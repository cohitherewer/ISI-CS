The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A hattrick by Tevez
                                                                                                                       7                                      A hattrick by Tevez
                      
	London: Carlos Tevez grabbed a quick-fire hattrick against 10-man Wigan Athletic to give Manchester City a 3-0 victory and boost their bid to finish fourth in the English Premier League on Monday.         
	City, five points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur before kickoff, struggled until Wigans Gary Caldwell was shown a red card for a foul on Tevez after 56 minutes but finally clicked into gear thanks to the Argentine striker.         
	Roberto Mancinis side moved to 56 points from 31 matches. Tottenham, who still have City to play at home, have 58 points from 31.         
	After spending vast sums of owner Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyans money on signing the likes of Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor and Roque Santa Cruz, fourth spot and a chance of Champions League football was the minimum requirement for City.         
	Tevez brought that possibility a step closer at Eastlands with an inspired second-half display which brought him three goals in 13 minutes.         
	Wigan still looked dangerous after Caldwells slightly harsh sending-off but Tevez put City ahead on minutes when he tapped in. (Reuters)

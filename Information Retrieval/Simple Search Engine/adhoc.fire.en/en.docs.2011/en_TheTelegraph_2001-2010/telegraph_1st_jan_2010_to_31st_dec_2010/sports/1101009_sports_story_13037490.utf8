The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Feet on the ground, Dhoni is wary of the Australians
                                                                                                                       7                                        Feet on the ground, Dhoni is wary of the Australians
  - Well be looking to close the series without incidents, says Team India captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni, in Bangalore, on Friday                                 
	Bangalore: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, appeared more relaxed than usual, on the eve of a big Test, on Friday. He spoke to the media in general at the Chinnaswamy and, then, briefly to The Telegraph at the luxury-oozing The Royal Gardenia.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Recovery after such an intense first Test         
	One has made the most of the three-day break before the next one... We had a fairly long practice session yesterday (Thursday), but it was lighter today for the bowlers... The body needs rest.         
	Lessons to learn even from the win         
	Usually, the negatives arent talked about after winning, but there are lots of areas to improve upon... I know we dropped catches... Whats important is how weve practised... While practising, one tries to get as close as possible to match conditions... Where improving is concerned, one must look at not giving away many with the new ball... Weve got to stop conceding too many singles, not allow the Australians to rotate strike... Also, when were batting and somebody is set, he should make a really big one.         
	The response he expects from Australia         
	They will come out strong... Thats their culture... Theyll be giving it their best shot...         
	Whether hes concerned that quite a few batsmen fell to short-pitched deliveries (in Mohali)         
	No... The dual bounce, in my opinion, created problems.         
	Mohali having given Test cricket a huge boost         
	Test cricket is there to stay... We, captains, have been trying to make it more interesting... Nowadays, most of the matches end in a (decisive) result, with the Tests getting over in four-and-a-half days. The more exciting it becomes, the better.         
	Update on V.V.S. Laxmans fitness         
	Laxmans feeling much better, but Test cricket involves five days of hard work and, so, the call will be made this evening or even tomorrow (Saturday) morning... Wed like him to play, most definitely.         
	[Barring the unforeseen, Laxman is going to be in the XI.]         
	Sreesanth, who is expected to take the injured Ishant Sharmas place in the XI, not having been impressive for the Board Presidents XI, in Chandigarh         
	But hes been bowling well in nets and seems to be free of injuries.         
	[Late in the evening, it got confirmed that Sreesanth would indeed be making a comeback.]         
	Comments on the Chinnaswamy wicket         
	Right now, its damp (because of the watering)... It remains to be seen just how dry it will be... Theres no grass, though.         
	The first Test having been incident-free, except for the Ricky Ponting-Zaheer Khan exchange...         
	We try and play in the best spirit... At times, players do respond, but it shouldnt get personal. A bit of chit-chat is fine... Well be looking to close the (Test) series without incidents.         
	Retaining the captaincy of the ICC World Test Team of the Year         
	Its thanks to my (India) team... Its because weve done well, collectively, that Ive once again got this recognition.         
	Having lost the ODI captaincy to Ponting         
	Theek hai... Im not seeing it as a contest with him.         
	Finally, whether wife Sakshi was in Mohali         
	(Grins) She wasnt... In fact, she was in Ranchi... But shes joined me here.

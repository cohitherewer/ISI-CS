The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India start favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                      India start favourites
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India start as overwhelming favourites in their title defence in the third Asian Volleyball Championship (Central Zone) that gets underway at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Friday.         
	Iran take on Pakistan in the opener while India open versus Kazakhstan in a later match Friday. The Indians, buoyed by their bronze finish in the Asian Cup last month, will be looking to maintain their momentum.         
	To make things easier for the hosts, Iran have sent their second-best side in the competition. Their first string side is preparing for the World Championships to be held in Italy later this month.         
	This is a great opportunity to beat them (Iran). We definitely have a bright chance of defending the title we won in Islamabad. We won a bronze in the Asian Cup after 24 years and had a successful Europe tour (Poland and Slovania) for over a fortnight, captain Sanjay Kumar said.         
	India lost to Iran 2-3 in the semi-final of the Asian Cup. They, however, thrashed Chinese Taipei 3-0 in the third place play-off. The meet will be played in a round-robin format with the top two meeting in the final on Monday.         
	Pakistan arrived in the city Thursday morning. They have a young side with an average age of around 20. In the words of their foreign coach Augusto Sabbatini the team is looking to gain experience here.         
	For the four teams in the competition, this is an opportunity to fine tune themselves before the Asian Games in Guangzhou in China in November. Our blocking and centre attacking are the strong points, we hope to attack and take the edge, Sanjay said.         
	The Indian camp is also aware that complacency might lead to disaster and that they have to be cautious in their approach. India have two changes to the successful bronze-medal winning squad in the Asian Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pettigrew no more
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pettigrew no more
                      
	North Carolina: The University of North Carolina said former Olympic sprinter Antonio Pettigrew was found dead in Chatham County, Tuesday.         
	Pettigrew worked as an assistant coach at the university, and school spokesman Matt Bowers says Pettigrews body was discovered in his car.         
	Pettigrew was part of the 1,600-meter U.S. relay team that won the gold medal in the Sydney Olympics in 2000, but the IOC stripped the team of the medals two years ago, after he admitted to doping during a trial against former coach Trevor Graham.         
	Pettigrew had spent four seasons at North Carolina and focused on sprints, hurdle and relays. He graduated from St. Augustines in Raleigh in 1992.           (AGENCIES)

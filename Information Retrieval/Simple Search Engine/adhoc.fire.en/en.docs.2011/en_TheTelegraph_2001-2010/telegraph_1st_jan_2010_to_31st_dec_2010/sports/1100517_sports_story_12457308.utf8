	Madrid: Venus Williams was beaten 6-2, 7-5 by unseeded Aravane Rezai of France in the Madrid Masters final on Sunday.         
	Rezai rallied from two breaks down in the second set to win her third career title in her sixth final.         
	The Frenchwoman was making her second appearance at the Madrid Masters and came in having lost in the first round in Barcelona and the second in Rome. She ended up dropping only one set throughout the tournament.         
	Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy were ousted from after suffering a straight set defeat at the hands of top seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic. The third seed Indo-Czech pair lost the semi-final clash of the clay court event 3-6, 4-6 to the Canadian-Serbian pair.         
	Paes and Dlouhy had won the Miami Masters event in March and semis appearance in this tournament is their best performance since then.         
	The fourth-seeded Williams was seeking to win a 10th clay-court title and improve on her 12-1 record on the surface this year. It was the 70th final of her career, and she will rise to No. 2 in the rankings on Monday for the first time since May 2003.

            OUR BUREAU            Australia under-19 players celebrate with the World Cup, in Christchurch, on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	After their senior team were thrashed in the first four one-day Internationals of the five match series against Australia, the Pakistan under-19 side couldnt fare better either as they lost to the same opponents in the final of the ICC under-19 World Cup on Saturday.         
	The Australian bowlers clinically shut down Pakistans batting threat to help their side win their third under-19 World Cup title with a hard-fought 25-run victory at Bert Sutcliffe Oval, Christchurch on Saturday.         
	Defending a modest total of 207 runs, Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood (4/30) and left-arm spinner Luke Doran (3/32) ripped through the Pakistan line-up as Azeem Guummans side was bowled out for 182 runs in 46.4 overs.         
	Hazlewoods final wicket to finish the match set off scenes of celebration in the Australia camp as they hoisted the trophy for the first time since 2002 when it had defeated South Africa on the same ground. Australia had also beaten Pakistan in the inaugural World Cup final in 1988 in Adelaide where it had won by five wickets.         
	The final was a tense, fluctuating affair played in perfect cricketing conditions, in front of a colourful crowd.         
	Chasing 208 runs to lift the title for the third time this decade, Pakistan, which had come into match with an unbeaten record, lost an early wicket in opener Ahsan Ali (2) in the fifth over. Babar Azam (28) and Ahmad Shazhad (36) accumulated 54 runs for the second wicket to steady the ship somewhat. However, it began to lose ground after Doran dismissed Shahzad and Babar in a space to five balls to reduce Pakistan to 74 for three.         
	Hazlewood, after picking up the wicket of Ahsan Ali, returned for his second spell and broke the back of Pakistan middle and lower-order by claiming the wickets of Hammad Azam (0), Sarmad Bhatti (10) and Raza Hasan (10).         
	None of Pakistans high-scoring line-up fired Saturday and the side were unable to put together any significant partnerships, as the Australia bowlers kept a tight line and astute field placings.         
	Pakistan wicketkeeeper Mohammed Waqas fell to a bizarre dismissal when he edged a ball which clipped the wicketkeepers pad and ballooned to deep gully where it was caught by Hazlewood off Alex Keath. Pakistan captain Azeem Ghumman (41 off 90 balls) followed soon after when he was bowled by a Jason Floros off-break.         
	The departure of Azeem shifted the momentum in Australias favour as Pakistan slipped from 156 for six to be bowled out for 182. Hazlewood deservedly claimed the Man of the Match award.         
	Dominic Hendricks of South Africa was named the Player of the Tournament after finishing as the tournaments highest run-scorer, amassing 391 runs in six innings at an outstanding average of 97.75.

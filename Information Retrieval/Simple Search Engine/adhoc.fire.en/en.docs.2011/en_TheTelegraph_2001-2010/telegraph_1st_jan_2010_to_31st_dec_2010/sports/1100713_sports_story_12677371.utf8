The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flops, shocks and sizzlers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Flops, shocks and sizzlers
            OUR BUREAU THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	There was much that amazed, and shocked the world over the month-long festival of football in South Africa. Heres a look at the highs and lows:         
	Team of the Tournament (4-2-3-1)         
	Casillas (Spain); Maxi Pereira (Uruguay), Friedrich (Germany), Lugano (Uruguay), Lahm (Germany); Schweinsteiger (Germany), Xavi (Spain); Robben (Holland), Sneijder (Holland), Forlan (Uruguay); Villa (Spain)         
	Player of the Tournament         
	Diego Forlan (Uruguay)         
	Wesley Sneijder, David Villa and Xavi may have inspired their teams to the final, but Forlans four goals took Uruguay  population 3.5 million  to the semi-finals, allowing one of the worlds most traditional football nations a long-overdue moment in the spotlight.         
	Biggest disappointment         
	Argentina         
	Diego Maradonas team may not have been as dreadful as France, Italy or England, but they disappointed more than all of them, by looking like the team of the tournament and then stalling when it mattered.         
	Best goal         
	Carlos Tevez (Argentina Vs Mexico)         
	Though Giovanni van Bronckhorsts heat-seeker in the semi-final was better, Tevezs spin and shot was certainly the best goal in the flesh.         
	Worst game         
	Paraguay Vs Japan         
	The two words, which could be best used to describe these teams, are evenly-matched. Cue 120 minutes of relatively excitement-free stalemate, rescued only by the thoroughly enjoyable drama of penalties.         
	Unforgettable moment         
	Landon Donovans last-minute winner against Algeria, the goal that effectively knocked England out of the tournament, was the first really emotive moment of the World Cup. The tears that followed were mildly uncomfortable.         
	Rising star         
	Uruguays Diego Godin and his defensive partner Diego Lugano struggled with injury throughout, but whenever he played, the Villarreal centreback looked composed on the ball and fearsome in the tackle.         
	Worst teamwork         
	While Henry single handedly helped France into the World Cup finals, it was teamwork that got them out of it. What started with an altercation between Nicolas Anelka and coach Raymond Domenech finally led to a boycott of practice session by the team.         
	Best save         
	Move over Maradona. Luis Suarez is here with the New Hand of God. The striker kept out a near goal in Uruguays quarter final clash against Ghana and, while the move took his team to the semis, it made him the pet hate of Africa.         
	Worst strike         
	Dutch Nigel de Jong exhibited his martial arts skills when he hit Spains Xabi Alonso with a well-placed kick on the chest.         
	Best men         
	The nasty followed the nice for the Dutch, as the World Cup runners-up made up for their ugly on-field tactics by giving the victorious Spaniards a Guard of Honour.         
	Conflict of interest         
	For the past masters of football, this one was a different ball game altogether. The verbal serves and volleys between Pele and Diego Maradona made for one of the most heated and mouth-watering duels .         
	Most awaited move         
	Diego Maradonas plan to celebrate an Argentinian triumph with a streak through the streets found a follower in Paraguayan model Larissa Riquelmes promise to shed all if her team won the World Cup. Larissa reportedly did keep her word despite her team bowing out prematurely.         
	Biggest managerial cock-up         
	Marcello Lippi forgetting to tell his players to attack before Slovakia went two ahead. Fabio Capello abandoning two years of planning in the two weeks before the start of the tournament. Raymond Domenech. Take your pick.

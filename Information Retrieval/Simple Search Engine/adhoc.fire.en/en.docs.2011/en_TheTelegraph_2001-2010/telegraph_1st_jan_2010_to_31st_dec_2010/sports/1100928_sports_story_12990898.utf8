The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | How IPL got a ticket to trouble
                                                                                                                       7                                      How IPL got a ticket to trouble
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: There is simply no end to scandals in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Just when it seemed that things were going quiet, the IPL on Monday dug out more dirt against suspended chairman Lalit Modi as it found out that funds had been siphoned off through a ticketing scam in the third edition of the meet.         
	The IPL Governing Council, which met here on Monday, discovered that Rs. 76.22 crore that was supposed to have been earned through sale of corporate box tickets for the knockout matches was not registered in the accounts, while the sale of more than 20,000 tickets for the final, on April 25, was not accounted for.         
	Ticketgenie, which was announced by Modi as the ticketing rights holder, had accounted for only 30,000 tickets for the final whereas the IPL believed that the attendance that night was more.         
	The stadium was packed and the capacity of the stadium is 52,000. So where did those 20,000 tickets go, is the question, the source said.         
	[The Telegraph had reported on July 4 that no contract was awarded to Ticketgenie for printing the tickets for the knockout matches.]         
	This is a new scandal that has been unearthed. The fundamental issue is that there was no written agreement or contract for the ticketing rights, a BCCI source said after the meeting.         
	According to the source, the corporate box or hospitality tickets for the final was priced at Rs. One lakh, for the semi-finals at Rs. 80,000 and for the third-place play-off at Rs. 50,000.         
	The interesting part is that no figure was printed on the tickets, the source said.         
	All knockout matches were played at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. The semi-finals were supposed to be played in Bangalore but were moved following a bomb scare.         
	Besides, another sum of Rs 5.5 crore, debited against the hiring of X-ray scanning machines, did not tally with the invoices.         
	The invoice says its Rs. 1.5 crore. Also, the companys address (in the IPL accounts) is shown as a guest house in Delhi while the invoice is from a company in Bangalore. According to the company, Rs. 70 lakh has been paid to them so far, the source said.         
	The timing of the revelations could not have been more significant as it comes two days before the Boards Annual General Meeting here on Wednesday and with the BCCI Disciplinary Committees hearing of other allegations against Modi nearing an end.         
	Mondays findings would be placed before the AGM, the source added.

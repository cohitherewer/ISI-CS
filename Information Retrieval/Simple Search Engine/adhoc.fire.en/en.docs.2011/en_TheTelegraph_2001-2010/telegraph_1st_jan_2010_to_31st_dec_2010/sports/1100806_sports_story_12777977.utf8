The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cesc joins Arsenal training
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cesc joins Arsenal training
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Barcelona target Cesc Fabregas returned to training with Arsenal on Thursday morning.         
	The Arsenal captain has been at the centre of speculation linking him with a return to the Catalan giants .         
	Barca, the club with whom Fabregas began his career, made a 30 million bid for the midfielder earlier this summer, only to be told by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger that the player was not for sale at any price.         
	A series of public statements by Barcas most prominent players advocating a move for the World Cup winner has only served to increase speculation that Fabregas will leave the club.         
	Nevertheless, the Spain star looked at ease as he lined up alongside Wenger and the rest of the Arsenal squad for the team photo Thursday, perhaps an indication that he will remain at the club he joined as a 15 year-old for at least another season.         
	Meanwhile, fellow clubmate Theo Walcott has added his voice to those that believe the deal will not materialise and that Fabregas will stay with Arsenal.         
	 Cesc is a big player for Arsenal. Im looking forward to seeing him back, hes a fantastic player for us and our captain, the winger said. Walcotts comments follow teammate Thomas Vermaelen who has stressed how crucial Fabregas is to the Arsenal set-up.         
	Hes really important and we hope he stays.

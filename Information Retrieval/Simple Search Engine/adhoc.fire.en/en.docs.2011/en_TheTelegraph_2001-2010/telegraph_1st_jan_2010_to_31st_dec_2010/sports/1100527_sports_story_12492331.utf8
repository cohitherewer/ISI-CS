            OUR CORRESPONDENT amp; AGENCIES                      
	Mumbai/ Margao: The title might have been decided long ago, and with the team all set to be wound up at the end of the season, the players might have found little purpose in their final practice session.         
	But David Booth, the Mahindra United coach, as always, egged them on, and gave a mouthful if necessary, to show discipline and strive for perfection in whatever they did.The Englishman wanted his players to give their best when they take on JCT in what would be the teams final round clash in the I-League and their last competitive game forever.         
	Steven Dias and Co. had one hand on the trophy a few rounds ago when they were top of the table before they slipped and Dempo clinched the title with two rounds to spare.         
	The hosts, now fourth in standings with 38 points, have a theoretical chance of finishing second if they won at the Cooperage while simultaneously Pune FC (41) went down to Dempo and Churchill Brothers were held by Air India.         
	This is our last chance to regain a little credibility and respect before we all move on. During the last several weeks, ninety five percent of the players have received contracts elsewhere, so there is no excuse for the lack of performance in recent games, the ever uncompromising Booth said referring to the teams winless performance in the last five games.         
	Mahindra would be missing Senagal defender Lamine Tamba due to suspension and probably skipper KN Ajayan as well because of an ankle injury.         
	In Margao, Pune FC will look to ensure the runners-up place in their debut I-League season. Pune FC have a good chance of fulfulling their aim, which would be a credible achievement for a team in its debut season, as they come into the match with impressive wins over Sporting Club de Goa and Churchill in their two previous clashes.         
	Pune coach Derick Pereira expressed happiness with the way his boys have played in this tournament.         
	It will be a great achievement if we win and finish as runners-up on debut. The credit will go to the boys who played as a unit and remained consistent throughout the tournament, he said.         
	There is nothing much left for us except to complete the formalities. But we want to end the league on a winning note, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said. Dempo will be resting Ranty Martins and Beto for the Thursday clash.         
	Pune FC will be playing the same side that played last against Churchill, except for defender Selwyn Fernandes who will sit out for a double yellow.

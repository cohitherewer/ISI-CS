            A STAFF REPORTER              Branco in the city, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                      
	Calcutta: World Cup-winner Branco said on Friday that the Brazilians missed Ronaldinho during their campaign in South Africa.         
	I would have favoured Ronaldinhos inclusion in the squad. The side missed him Three other players should also have been selected  Adriano, Ganchu and Hernanes, Branco, who is in the city in connection with a reality show for a private television channel, said.         
	A member of the 1994 World Cup winning team, Branco didnt wish to comment on Dungas performance. Dunga is a close friend. We won the World Cup under his captaincy. I was on the federations panel when he was named coach and I had preferred him I cant comment on his performance.         
	Branco, whose real name is Claudio Ibrahim Vaz Leal, felt whoever takes over the reins would face a tough task.         
	Its difficult to answer who will be the next coach. Most of the players in the current side are old and wont be around for long. Just two players are young They need to work much harder.         
	The Brazilian federation has a few names in mind ... At this point it is very difficult to tell who will be the next coach. Whoever takes charge has a big responsibility, Dunga explained.         
	The 46-year-old has been impressed with the Salt Lake Stadium. Ive been impressed with the Salt Lake Stadium. There are few places with such facilities. The athletes need to be given proper training. A total of 24 players have been selected for the TV programme and are capable of improving.         
	Ive been associated with the Brazilian federation at the junior level for long. The side has won six titles under my coaching. The biggest problem here is government support and the need for physical education. If these can be imparted things will improve, he said.         
	Dunga also stressed on the mental aspect. I come from a poor background in south of Brazil. As a youngster I dreamt of playing football for my country. I realised my dream and proudly became a part of a World Cup winning side. Its a question of getting the chance at the right time and using it.         
	Has he noticed any limitation in coaching pattern of the Indians? Cant say much Ive been here for only a few days. With training everything can be improved, tactics, technique

                                                                                                                       7                                      For a professional, theres never a challenge: Shah Rukh Khan
    - The No. 1 superstar on life away from cricket             A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khans tweets have been giving an insight into what he feels, emotionally and otherwise, about the Kolkata Knight Riders performance in IPL III.         
	Moving away from cricket, the numero uno superstar spoke to The Telegraph. The one-on-one covered films, challenges and whether hes the sort to envy.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Critically, where would you rate your performance in your last release, My Name Is Khan?         
	A I never see my films... I mean, you just do what you think is good at that point in time... You dont assess your state of mind and say that this is nice... I dont even know how to rate the film... What I do look at is just the technical things. I dont see films in the hall with people... I see it, technically, five-seven days before we take the final call... See how its going to look. The process of making art is enjoyable to you, the process of enjoying art is for the others. Its a very strange dichotomy in art, that it is not yours. You can ask any artist, whether it be a singer, a painter or a designer... It is very strange that your work is only yours till you are making it. Post that, it is everybody elses to enjoy. So, I feel the same sense of detachment. I do feel very happy when people say it (a film) has turned out well, I cant deny that I love that... On a Monday (after the opening weekend), though, the film is not mine. Its like a daughter you marry off and hope shes happy with her husband and that her husbands happy with her. And that she spreads love like she did in your life... So, in any work of art, the artist will have a different connotation... I want people to enjoy my films and its not only about the number of people who come to the halls. Of course, if a lot of people come, then a lot of money also comes, but I cant sit and talk critically... I dont even remember what Ive done in the film, to be honest with you...         
	Whats your reaction when fans praise a particular scene or scenes?         
	See, when you are doing it, you dont even know which one is going to be liked by the people. You may like a particular shot, but others could find some other shot nice and 20 more may just hate it all. To me, the process of creating each film is as important as my life itself. And, then, you just leave it and get on to the next one.         
	Talking of challenges, how challenging was your role in My Name is Khan?         
	(Passionately) For a professional, theres never a challenge... It would be a challenge for someone who is not a professional actor. This is what I deliver... This is what I do... This is what I live by... When my director tells me to do something, I dont take it as a challenge at all. I work very hard on it... Ive worked for 20 years and, if after 20 years, I take it as a challenge, then you know (something is wrong)... Id be disappointed if one of my KKR players says he finds the role assigned to him challenging.         
	As an actor, what for you is the next level?         
	I dont think like that. I just do the films my friends like, or, I feel like doing... It becomes more important when people like it. The appreciation belongs to the viewers, I have no ownership over it. I dont know how it will pan out... I just do my job and have a great time doing it. Like Im doing Ra.One now... Im really thrilled.         
	Is there an actor or a person you envy?         
	I dont have any reason to envy anyone.         
	Or, appreciate highly...         
	I appreciate everyone. I enjoy everybodys work... I dont belittle anyone, Im humble. Indeed, I accept everybodys excellence with a lot of humility, graciousness and appreciation. However, I dont want to be like anyone else. I want to be me. I like (best buddy) Vivek (Khushalani) for what he is... But, theres no point in my becoming him... Vivek is good individually for what he does and I have to appreciate it. However, I want to be who I am and I hope people appreciate that... There has never been any envy in my life, never. I have no negative or dark shades and am always transparent.         
	Do you have long-term plans? Do you actually plan ahead or do you plan for the moment?         
	(Laughs) I do what I like doing at the moment in question... Like giving you this interview.         
	But you dont really come across as being disorganised, so to say?         
	Im very disorganised.         
	The final one... Disorganised at home?         
	Everywhere.

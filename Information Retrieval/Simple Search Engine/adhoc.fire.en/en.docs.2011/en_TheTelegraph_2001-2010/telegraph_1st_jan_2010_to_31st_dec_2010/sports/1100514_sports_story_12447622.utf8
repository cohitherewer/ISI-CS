The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods has inflamed neck joint
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods has inflamed neck joint
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Tiger Woods has an inflamed joint in his neck and is still unable to say when he will be able to return to competitive golf.         
	Woods pulled out of the Players Championship on Sunday with a neck injury and underwent a scan to determine the cause of the problem.         
	An article on the world No 1s official website reported that Woods has an inflamed facet joint in his neck.         
	The story continued: When the facet joints are inflamed, it causes pain in the affected area as well as headaches and difficulty rotating the head.         
	Physical therapy, including soft-tissue massage, rest and anti-inflammatory medicine will be used to treat the injury.         
	The prognosis for Woods is a full recovery, although a return date to competitive golf is contingent on how quickly the condition heals. The lay-off is not expected to be extensive, but can vary.         
	Woods himself said: I want to thank everyone for their caring and concern.         
	I now need to take care of this condition and will return to playing golf when Im physically able.         
	Woods has played in three events this season after five months out following the sex scandal which broke at the end of last year.         
	Speaking on Monday about his potential schedule, the American said: Ill want to come back and obviously defend at Memorial and play the US Open (they are in the first and third weeks of next month), but Ill have a lot more answers after I get the picture.         
	Woods tied fourth on his return from a five-month absence at the Masters but has struggled since, missing the cut at the Quail Hollow Championship in North Carolina before pulling out at Sawgrass on Sunday.

                    Shoya Tomizawa                        
	Misano: Japanese teenager Shoya Tomizawa died after crashing and being hit by two other riders during Sundays Moto2 race at the San Marino Grand Prix, the second fatality to rock the sport in eight days.         
	The 19-year-old Tomizawa lost control of his bike and hit his head on the track as his bike flipped over. While on the track, he was then hit at full speed by riders Alex de Angelis and Scott Redding.         
	A statement on the MotoGP web site said Tomizawa died of cranial, thoracic and abdominal trauma.         
	Tomizawa was initially put on an artificial respirator at the Misano World Circuit medical centre before he was taken to a hospital in Riccione, where he died.         
	Im truly devastated about what happened to Shoya, De Angelis said. Im close to his family and all of them loved him a lot. In moments like this nothing seems to matter.         
	I saw Shoya fall in front of me. It is the worst ever incident in my career. I tried everything I could to avoid him and hit his motorbike instead.         
	De Angelis was treated at the track and allowed to leave. Redding was taken to a hospital to check on his condition.         
	The races continued and the riders were only informed of Tomizawas death at the end of their event.           (AGENCIES)

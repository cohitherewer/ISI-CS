            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England football legend Sir Bobby Charlton, a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy, said that Fabio Capello is a first class choice as England manager. You have to have someone that can bring all these different people from different clubs playing different systems together. And thats what Sir Alf Ramsey did, he said.         
	The member of Englands 1966 World Cup winning team also said Cristiano Ronaldo will be a big hit in South Africa. I think he will be one of the big players, he told the Laureus TV. Charlton also praised Wayne Rooneys mentality. He is a winner. He loves the game as much as anyone I have ever met, he said.

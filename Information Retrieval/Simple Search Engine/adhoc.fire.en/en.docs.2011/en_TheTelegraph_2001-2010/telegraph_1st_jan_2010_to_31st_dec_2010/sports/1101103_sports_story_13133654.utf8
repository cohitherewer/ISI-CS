  - Tamil Nadu in driving seat vs Assam; Agarkar scores a patient 80       OUR CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES            Iqbal Abdulla                                 
	Mumbai: Twenty-year-old Iqbal Abdulla hit his maiden first-class hundred and put Mumbai in command on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Super League tie, against Saurashtra, on Tuesday.         
	Abdulla, a left-arm orthodox spinner and a useful lower order batsman, struck an unbeaten 150, which was studded with 14 fours and three sixes, as Mumbai declared their first innings at 580 for nine at the stroke of tea.         
	Saurashtra began their reply strongly with openers Chirag Pathak (37) and Bhushan Chauhan (29 batting) putting up a half-century stand. However, seasoned Mumbai offie Ramesh Powar removed Pathak and Sitanshu Kotak (0) in successive overs to dent their hopes.         
	At stumps, Saurashtra were 94 for two, trailing by 486 runs and needing another 287 to avoid follow-on.         
	Resuming at 340 for seven, Mumbai depended on veteran Ajit Agarkar, who had scored a match-winning 102 not out at the same venue against Himachal Pradesh last season, to perform an encore.         
	Agarakar responded with a measured 80 (175 balls, 11x4) which was key to the teams prospect.         
	But Abdulla eclipsed his senior partner with some stupendous batting filled with a wide range of strokes.         
	The left-hander was severe on debutant Jaydev Unadkat, Jayesh Odedra and Ravindra Jadeja whenever they erred in length.         
	His aggressive innings helped Mumbai scored 138 runs without any loss in the morning session, and the dismissal of Agarkar in the fourth over after lunch hardly affected the run rate as the second session produced another 102 runs.         
	The eighth wicket association between Abdulla and Agarkar was worth 165 runs.         
	Wicketkeeper Sagar Jogiyani dropped Abdulla on 72, Jadeja being the unlucky bowler, and Saurashtra were made to rue the miss.         
	However, Saurashtra benefited from wayward bowling by Mumbai when they began their reply.         
	Powar and Avishkar Salvi hardly struck the right line and length.         
	The match between Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, in Meerut, was interestingly poised. After dismissing Punjab for 288, Uttar Pradesh were 221 for five at the close of the second days play. Mohammed Kaif was the top scorer for Uttar Pradesh with 58 runs.         
	In Chennai, Srikkanth Anirudha, S. Badrinath and R. Satish cracked half-centuries to propel Tamil Nadu to a commanding 300 for four in their first innings at the end of second days play.         
	At draw of stumps, Tamil Nadu had taken a crucial first innings lead of 116 runs in reply to Assams 184 all out.

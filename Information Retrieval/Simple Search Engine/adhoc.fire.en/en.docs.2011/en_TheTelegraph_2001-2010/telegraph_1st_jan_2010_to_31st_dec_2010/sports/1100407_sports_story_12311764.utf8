The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: Good to beat top team
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni: Good to beat top team
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Chennai Super Kings captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, at the post-match presentation ceremony, gave credit to his bowlers for keeping the Mumbai Indians batsmen under check.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Dhoni: We couldnt cash in on a good start. After the 13th over or so, we couldnt cash in But it was a very slow wicket. The only fear was (Sachin) Tendulkar because he loves this wicket. Good that the heat got him! We also did a good job with the ball. Both (Doug) Bollinger and (Thilan) Thushara bowled well in the final overs. It was above par score. Two points are important. Its good to get points against the top-ranked team. From here, we will take one game at a time. Hopefully, Albie (Morkel) gets fit for the next game. It upsets the team composition. (Muttiah) Muralidharan would have been terrific on this wicket but, at the end of the day, I am happy with the way (Ravichandran) Ashwin and (Shadab) Jakati bowled.         
	Tendulkar: I was feeling slightly drained out while batting. There was a lot of weakness and I was struggling. So, I thought that rather than throwing away my wicket away, I will preserve it. I didnt have the strength to hit the ball. So I left. I thought the Super Kings played better cricket and deserved to win. The loss has come at the right time for us. Its a wake-up call for us. Our fielding wasnt up to the mark Our catching can be better. But there is no need to panic. We just need to stay calm. Hopefully, I will be ready for the next game.         
	Suresh Raina: Dhoni handled the bowlers well. Ashwin, Jakati, Thushara, Bollinger  all did a good job. We have seen during international matches as well that he (Dhoni) can keep his cool in pressure situations.

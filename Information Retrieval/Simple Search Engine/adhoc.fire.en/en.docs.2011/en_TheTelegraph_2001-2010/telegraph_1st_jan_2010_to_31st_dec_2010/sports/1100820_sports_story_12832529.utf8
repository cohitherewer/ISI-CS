The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharapovas journey back to her roots
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sharapovas journey back to her roots
            OLIVER BROWN            Maria Sharapova                           
	Gomel: You would think that Maria Sharapovas trek through the irradiated wilderness of eastern Belarus should end, definitively, her portrayal as the selfish little rich girl.         
	But for the young woman who has established herself as the highest-paid female athlete on the planet, some trappings of extravagance must endure even in the most blasted landscapes.         
	The scene is a remote regional airfield outside Gomel. Its terminal building is a stark Soviet monolith and it is scattered with rusting Tupolevs you would only dare to board after several vodkas. But this is far from an average day, as a vision in the flawless midday sky soon shows.         
	For coming in to land is one gleaming and highly incongruous private jet, bearing the self-styled princess that is Miss Sharapova.         
	The 23 year-old, wearing a simple grey dress, emerges from the aircraft, then is garlanded with bouquets by fawning local dignitaries.         
	Sharapova came home. Well, not home exactly, but to the Chernobyl fall-out zone; to the place whose grotesque fate she escaped only fractionally. It was during the early hours of April 26, 1986, when newsreels began running with the words: There has been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union. There is speculation that people have been injured, and may have died. Almost a year later, once parents Yuri and Yelena had fled the poisoned streets of Gomel for western Siberia, Maria Yuryevna Sharapova was born.         
	Yuri, who had to take a job on the Siberian oilfields, is accompanying her on this trip, her first to the region for 11 years.         
	Its very emotional, Yuri admits. Theres a big sense of her reconnecting with her roots, even though she wasnt born here. Back in86, it was just crazy. People panicked, packed up their bags and if they had chance, tried to escape.         
	He was one of them, terrified by the radiation cloud gathering over Gomel and the growing incidence of neighbours falling sick. Yelena, too, who became pregnant with Maria four months after the catastrophe, has talked of the birth defects she feared would arise.         
	At several points during this visit Yuri, who having transplanted Sharapova to Florida aged six, spends private time with his daughter, whether walking through sun-dappled forests to share his memories or taking her to the municipal hospital to see her grandmother, Galina.         
	Sharapova grasps the pain of her family history and has read, voraciously, about the impact of Chernobyl catastrophe.         
	She is keenly aware that 9,000 people around Gomel will die prematurely because of their exposure to radioactive dust and has not hesitated in her work as an ambassador to the region, on behalf of the United Nations Development Project.         
	My dads family still live here, so there are a lot of people Im coming back to, she says. I was too young to appreciate all the details, apart from the fact that there had been a big disaster, but as I grew older I became more interested, wanting to help people who had been affected or been born here.         
	Too many people have forgotten about Chernobyl, but Im determined to remember. Im trying to help the kids who have been born since, to find a way of their own, to give them perspective.         
	Assuredly, the children of the Gomel Oblast, as this area is known, need her care and the money the attention can bring  as she discovers in Chechersk District Hospital, there has been a 1,400 per cent increase since the disaster of those being born with thyroid cancer.         
	 Sharapova has pledged more than 250,000 for their rehabilitation, and the UN have sought to channel this into reviving the rich musical culture that existed here before the safety test at Chernobyls nuclear reactor No. 4 went so hideously wrong.         
	Belarus has a tragic history, a lot of things have gone wrong for it. My connection here is very real. Its probably one of the closest places I can call home. Even though I didnt actually live here steadily, all my family are from here. So this is where it all started. My parents took a lot of chances in their life and, growing up, I was always surrounded by those decisions  I think, in a way, I subconsciously learned from that. It really meant that they wanted me to do something that I loved in my life. I loved playing tennis, and I couldnt wait to go out on the court and pla, she said.         
	If Chernobyl had never happened, my life would have been very different, Sharapova acknowledges. I probably wouldnt even be playing tennis.       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

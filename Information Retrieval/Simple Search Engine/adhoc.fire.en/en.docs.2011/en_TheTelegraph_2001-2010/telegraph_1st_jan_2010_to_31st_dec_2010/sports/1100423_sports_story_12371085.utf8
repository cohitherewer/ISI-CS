The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tsonga, Ferrer move into quarter finals
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tsonga, Ferrer move into quarter finals
                      
	Barcelona: Third-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga came from behind to beat Nicolas Almagro of Spain 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 for the third time this year at the Barcelona Open on Thursday.         
	Tsonga, making his debut in Barcelona, also beat 15th-seeded Almagro at the Australian Open and last week in Monte Carlo.         
	Joining Tsonga in the quarter finals was eighth-seeded David Ferrer, the runner-up to Rafael Nadal for the last two years. Ferrer won all nine games when qualifier Simone Bolelli of Italy retired with a right wrist injury.         
	Former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero, the 2001 Barcelona winner, lost his first meeting with Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (4). The other winners were Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil and qualifier Eduardo Schwank of Argentina.         
	Late on Wednesday, Fernando Gonzalezs hopes for a successful claycourt season were dented when he suffered a shock 4-6, 7-6, 3-6 second round loss to Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos-Vinolas.         
	After falling a set behind, fourth seed Gonzalez, ranked almost 150 places higher than the 22-year-old left-hander, looked to have clawed his way back into the match by winning the second-set tie-break 10-8.         
	But Ramos-Vinolas responded to the roars of support from the local fans to grab one crucial break of serve in the decider and set up a last-16 clash with Lativas Ernests Gulbis.         
	Nadal, who has triumphed in Barcelona for the past five years, opted to skip the event to give his body a rest.         
	Lleyton Hewitt, however, will not be around to take advantage of Nadals absence as his comeback from hip surgery stalled when he lost 6-7, 4-6 to Eduardo Schwank.         
	The 29-year-old Australian, who has played only one tournament since the operation at the end of January, was twice broken by the 59th-ranked Argentine and misses out on a possible last-eight clash with French Open runner-up Robin Soderling.

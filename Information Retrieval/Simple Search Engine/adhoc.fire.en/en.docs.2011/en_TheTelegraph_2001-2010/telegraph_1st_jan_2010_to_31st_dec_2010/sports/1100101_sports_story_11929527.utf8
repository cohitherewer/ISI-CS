The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar: Track wasnt normal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar: Track wasnt normal
                      
	Colombo: Breaking his silence on the Ferozeshah Kotla pitch fiasco, Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said the track did not look normal soon after the first five overs and was too dangerous to continue playing.         
	Even after 6-10 overs, we could feel that the pitch was not normal. But the Match Referee (Alan Hurst) said: I cannot do anything. It was a call for the on-field umpires to take.         
	Sangakkara defended the decision to call his batsmen back in the 24th over when the ball was doing all sorts of things on a treacherous pitch.         
	We spoke to the fourth umpire as well. We cannot, from outside, make a request to the umpire. The two on-field batsmen had to make a request, Sangakkara said after his team returned from India losing both the Test and ODI series.         
	The umpires were also waiting to see whether the pitch would improve. By the 23rd over, they knew that it did not even out. Then (Muthumudalige) Pushpakumara got hit and (Thilina) Kandamby nearly got hit, he told reporters here. Kandamby spoke to the umpire who said they were also waiting for the pitch to improve but that it had not. So, it was a dangerous batting pitch to play on.         
	Looking back at the disappointing tour, Sangakkara said among the few positives was the way some youngsters performed.         
	We saw how the young players Suranga Lakmal, Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera and Suraj Randiv performed. Young players are starting to realise its anybodys game now and we are going to see them pushing everyone for places, not just for the World Cup but for other tours as well. Its a great step forward in Sri Lanka cricket, he said on Wednesday.(pti)

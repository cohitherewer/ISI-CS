The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods is proud of friend Atwal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods is proud of friend Atwal
            A STAFF REPORTER                          Tiger Woods in Cardiff, on Monday      
	Calcutta: The US Ryder Cup team arrived at the Cardiff airport on Monday morning, ready to defend the trophy at nearby Celtic Manor, with the meet starting on Friday.         
	World No. 1, but Ryder Cup wildcard, Tiger Woods sported sunglasses, despite the sky being cloudy, while Jim Furyk probably slept the most soundly of the 12-man team having pocketed an astonishing $11.35 million on Sunday for winning the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup.         
	I want to congratulate my friend Arjun Atwal for winning the Wyndham Championship.         
	Hes worked awfully hard to get his game back and battled through shoulder and knee problems. Im proud of him, Woods wrote on his blog, shortly before leaving for the Ryder Cup.         
	Atwal himself had told The Telegraph that Woods had called to congratulate him after he won the Wyndham Championship.         
	Woods further added: Contrary to what some people might think, I dont feel extra pressure or incentive as a captains pick to perform (at the Ryder Cup).         
	The goal is to win every match youre put out there so you can help the team retain the Cup.         
	Woods also wrote that he was excited about the future going forward.         
	He said he was excited about the prospects of the tournaments coming up in China, Australia and the Chevron World Challenge in Southern California and that he can put himself in contention to win.         
	Ive gotten some grief for wearing white belts on the golf course, he wrote.         
	Its just a sign of the times. The first time I wore one was on Saturday at the US Open, and I played pretty well.         
	People keep asking me how Im doing, and I have to say its night and day from how I started the season at the Masters.         
	Theres no comparison. Ive said it many times, but I really mean it: The fans have been great, he concluded.

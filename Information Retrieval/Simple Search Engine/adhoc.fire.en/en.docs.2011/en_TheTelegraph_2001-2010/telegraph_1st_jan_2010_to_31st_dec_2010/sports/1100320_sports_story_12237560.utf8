	Berne: Unfashionable Premier League side Fulham knocked favourites Juventus out of the Europa League after an astonishing 4-1 win over the Italians who finished the last 16 second leg game with nine men on Thursday.         
	Fabio Cannavaro was sent off after less than half an hour for the twice European champions and three-times UEFA Cup winners, who went out despite a 3-1 first-leg lead and second minute goal at Craven Cottage.         
	In another drama-filled match, prolific World Cup-bound Spain striker David Villa scored a hattrick for Valencia as they drew 4-4 at Werder Bremen to go through on away goals.         
	Benfica scored twice in the last 15 minutes to win 2-1 at Olympique Marseille and also qualify for the quarter finals.         
	It was the second time this season Juve have gone out of European competition with a 4-1 defeat after they lost at home to Bayern Munich in their final Champions League group match by the same score.         
	They got the perfect start at Craven Cottage thanks to David Trezeguets early opener but Bobby Zamora equalised seven minutes later and then Cannavaro was harshly dismissed in the 27th minute for bringing down Zoltan Gera.         
	Gera finished off a flowing move in the 39th minute and then converted a penalty four minutes into the second half after Diego handled to level the aggregate score.         
	A brilliant chip by Fulhams United States midfielder Clint Dempsey seven minutes from time sent the west London side into their first European quarter final with a 5-4 aggregate win.         
	It was a fantastic team performance. Their goalkeeper made four outstanding saves, Fulham manager Roy Hodgson said.         
	Valencia, held 1-1 at home by Bremen, were ahead on aggregate from the moment Villa gave them a second minute lead in a pulsating game.         
	Juan Mata extended Valencias advantage in the 15th minute but Hugo Almeida pulled one back for the Germans who looked capable of forcing an equaliser only for Villa to score again on the stroke of halftime.

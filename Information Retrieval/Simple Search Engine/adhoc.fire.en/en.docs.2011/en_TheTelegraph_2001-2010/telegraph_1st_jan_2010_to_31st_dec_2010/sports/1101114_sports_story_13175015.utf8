The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wicket faces flak

  - Ranji trophy Gurav, Jaffer hit centuries on final day at the Eden         A STAFF REPORTER            Omkar Gurav and Wasim Jaffer at the Eden, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal and Mumbai played out an inconsequential final day of their Ranji Trophy match at the Eden Gardens on Saturday. Though the match ended in a draw, the debate veered more on the unresponsive Eden wicket that received sharp criticism from both sides.         
	It was surprising to see Mumbai skipper Wasim Jaffer decide to bat again after they wrapped up Bengal for 296 Friday evening. A first innings lead of 325 runs was enough to enforce the follow-on and push for an outright victory. But the defending champions decision to go for a draw instead, seemed baffling, if not entirely shocking.         
	Mumbai have done it in the past (not enforcing the follow-on), but always in the knock-out stages when the fitness of the team is a primary concern. But a decision like this at the start of the league was bound to raise questions. But Jaffer, who slammed his 42nd first-class hundred in the second innings, said: I asked all the players and discussed with the coach that the wicket was too slow. And all the bowlers had bowled about 20 to 25 overs. Weve seen what kind of wicket it is. Even if we had tried, it would have been a tricky decision.         
	We had put in a lot of effort and getting them out would have been difficult. I wont say it was never going to happen, but we all thought that we gave our best in the first innings. There was hardly any help for bowlers in the wicket. We were lucky we won the toss.         
	Jaffer urged the BCCI to ensure that domestic cricket is played on competitive wickets. Its something for the BCCI to look into. If there is some life or help in the pitches then its going to produce good cricket. There are lots of games when teams have taken first innings lead, but dont go for outright win. Thats, because, theres hardly any gap between the games and they want to keep their bowlers fresh. They dont want an injury, which might hamper the important games, he said.         
	Realistically, even if Jaffer sent Bengal in once again, he didnt have the resources to take 10 wickets.         
	Abhishek Nayar suffered a niggle in his ankle, and, though he bowled 13 overs on the third day, it was later learnt that he had pulled his hamstring. Matters got worse when Aavishkar Salvi also complained of a shoulder sprain that left only Dhawal Kulkarni and Ajit Agarkar to form the pace battery on an unresponsive Eden wicket. Ajinkya Rahane, who scored a magnificient 110 on the first day, was substituted by Praful Waghela due to an ankle injury.         
	I think Abhishek Nayar will miss the next game. But Ajinkya Rahane and Salvi would be available against Railways, Jaffer said.         
	And the Mumbai skipper was not the only one who blasted the Eden wicket. Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman, too, flayed the strip in no uncertain terms. It was a bloody tough job for the bowlers on this wicket, Raman said. But that doesnt absolve his side from the mistakes they made.         
	Both Jaffer (104 not out) and opener Omkar Gurav (127 not out) slammed their respective hundreds, the latter being assisted by Bengals butterfingers on the way. Mumbai were 286 for 1 in their second innings on the fourth day when the two skippers decided to shake hands.

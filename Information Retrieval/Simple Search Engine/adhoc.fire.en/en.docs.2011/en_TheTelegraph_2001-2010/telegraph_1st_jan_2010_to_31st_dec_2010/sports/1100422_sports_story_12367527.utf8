The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi votes for Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi votes for Modi
                      
	Karachi: Under-fire IPL commissioner Lalit Modi has found support from an unlikely quarter in Pakistans Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi, who feels the cash-awash event would be at loss if the man who launched it goes.         
	I dont know what will happen tomorrow but I feel that if Modi goes, then the IPL will feel his loss because he played a big part in conceiving it and launching it, Afridi said.         
	Meanwhile, on his own chances of competing in the IPL in future, Afridi, who had felt insulted at being ignored by the franchisees this year, did not rule out the possibility in case of being approached.         
	I have not entirely ruled out the IPL, but my foremost criteria is that if we (Pakistani players) are shown the same respect as players from other countries then I can play in the IPL, he told a Pakistani television channel.         
	Afridi was among the dozen Pakistani cricketers who were not bid for at the IPL players auction in February which led to strong protest from the Pakistan cricket community, Board and government.         
	Afridi said what happened in the players auction was avoidable and unpleasant.         
	But one has to move on and the situation can change quickly and I have always believed that sports can play a big role in bridging gaps between Pakistan and India, he added.         
	Afridi also spoke on the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies where Pakistan will defend its title.         
	I think we have a team that is capable of doing well even without key players.

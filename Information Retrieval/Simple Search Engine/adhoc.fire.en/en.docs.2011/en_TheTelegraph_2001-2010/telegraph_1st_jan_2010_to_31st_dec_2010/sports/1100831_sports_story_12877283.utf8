	New York: Defending champion Kim Clijsters started to drift on a windy day but found her footing in time to win her 15th straight match at the US Open.         
	The second-seeded Belgian beat Hungarys Greta Arn 6-0, 7-5 in the first round Monday. She fell behind 4-0 in the second set, and the 104th-ranked Arn had a chance to serve out the set at 5-4. But Clijsters got the break, then did it again to clinch the straight-set victory.         
	Im just glad to finish that second set off and not let it go three sets, she said. Clijsters said she had some trouble adjusting her strokes when she was playing with or against the wind. What wasnt troubling her much was the left hip that bothered her at a tune-up tournament earlier this month.         
	A year ago, Clijsters was a wild card entry in only her third tournament back after two and a half years away from the sport. Now shes one of the favourites to win the Open. Melanie Oudin and Francesca Schiavone also know how quickly perceptions can change. Oudin struggled with higher expectations since her crowd-pleasing run to the US Open quarter finals last year. So did Francesca Schiavone after her breakthrough French Open title in June.         
	But neither showed any signs of the pressure in cruising to dominant first-round wins. Oudin, the 18-year-old from Marietta, Georgia, needed just 56 minutes to beat Olga Savchuk of Ukraine 6-3, 6-0. Schiavone, the Italian who won her first Grand Slam weeks before her 30th birthday, dispatched Ayumi Morita of Japan 6-1, 6-0 in 58 minutes.         
	If anything, Schiavone seems to be having fun in the spotlight. Asked why shes a fan favourite, she playfully replied, I attract them because Im beautiful.         
	Schiavone acknowledged that maybe shes a bit more motivated at a Grand Slam than at other tournaments. She was pleased that her first-round match was in the grandstand  a year ago, she was relegated to an outer court.         
	Oudin snapped a four-match losing streak and won for only the fifth time in her past 18 matches. A year ago, she became the darling of the tournament, upsetting Maria Sharapova and Elena Dementieva en route to becoming the youngest US Open quarter finalist since Serena Williams in 1999.         
	Schiavone, seeded No. 6 had no difficulty against the 83rd-ranked Morita, facing just one break point and hitting 28 winners. Russias Dementieva, the No. 12 seed, also advanced easily, beating Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-1, 6-2.         
	Fellow Russian Nikolay Davydenko, the No. 6 seed on the mens side, beat American Michael Russell 6-4, 6-1, 6-3. No. 11 Marin Cilic and No. 22 Juan Carlos Ferrero also advanced.

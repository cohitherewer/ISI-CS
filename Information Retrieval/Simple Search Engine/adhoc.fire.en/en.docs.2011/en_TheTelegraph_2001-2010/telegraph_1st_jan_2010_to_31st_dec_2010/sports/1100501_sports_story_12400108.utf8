The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bob wants a hike or   will leave
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bob wants a hike or   will leave
            JAYDEEP BASU                                            
	New Delhi: In what could be a major setback for the national team before the Asian Cup, chief coach Bob Houghton has threatened to submit his resignation in the next couple of days, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources.         
	Houghton, who is currently in Cape Town, is believed to have asked the AIFF to either extend his contract with immediate effect with an additional remuneration of $10,000 per month or he would resign from his current position.         
	The British coachs current contract runs up to the Asian Cup final rounds in January 2011. He receives an annual salary of $240,000 apart from other perks that include round the year five-star accommodation wherever he is stationed in India.         
	Houghton is considered one of Indias most successful national coaches ever. Under him, India won three back-to-back titles in the last three years including the AFC Challenge Cup, the qualifying tournament for the prestigious Asian Cup.         
	The senior officials of the AIFF are aware of the situation and have asked the coach to hold on till the executive committee meets in the capital in May 7, sources told The Telegraph. But apparently Houghton is not ready to wait till that time, he added.         
	Sources also claimed that Houghton has a few offers from other nations and foreign clubs including one from the Australian federation, which wants him to take over their national team after the World Cup.         
	The sudden development has left the opinion totally divided within the federation.         
	While a section in the federation felt that Houghton was only looking for an excuse to desert the Indian national team on the eve of a tough assignment like the Asian Cup, others said the national coach was frustrated by the way all his proposals were being ignored by a section of the officials.         
	Houghtons bitter relation with a principal office bearer of the AIFF is a well known fact by now, said an official. This office bearer was trying his best to scuttle all of Houghtons plans before the Asian Cup. He did not even bother to arrange the friendly matches against superior Asian teams that Houghton has been requesting for a long time, said the official.         
	The federation is yet to finalise the exclusive contract papers with the national team players for the next eight months. The coach was very frustrated, he added.         
	Houghtons detractors, however, are of the view the coach was looking for an escape route after he found India were pitted against mighty Australia and South Korea in the Group C of the Asian Cup.         
	All his success came while playing within India, said an official. Bob knows that India will cut a sorry figure in Doha. So he wants to quit on some pretext or the other to avoid the humiliation, he said.         
	Houghton employed similar tactics after the AFC Challenge Cup victory when he arm twisted the AIFF to increase his salary by nearly $100,000 at least six months before the renewal of his original contract. He wants to do it again since he wont be in a position to do that after the Asian Cup, the official alleged.

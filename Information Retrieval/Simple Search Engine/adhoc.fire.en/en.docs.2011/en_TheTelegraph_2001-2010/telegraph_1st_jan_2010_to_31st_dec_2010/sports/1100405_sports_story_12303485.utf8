                                                                                                                       7                                        Making me look bad wont help others look good, says Yuvraj 
    - Senior pro says his integrity should not be questioned             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Yuvraj Singh                                 
	Calcutta: Team India and Kings XI Punjabs Yuvraj Singh, who is never far away from the headlines, spoke to The Telegraph at the ITC Sonar on Saturday night.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youve been getting some stick, with somebody even suggesting that you may have intentionally under-performed for your franchise...         
	 A People need to understand that Im coming off a major (wrist) injury. So, to come and take the opposition apart is tough... One needs to get into the groove and, in T20, theres no time to settle down... Its very different in Tests and in the 50-over game... People who havent played the sport wont understand... About under-performing, its a very strong allegation that questions my integrity... On what basis has that allegation been made? Dont question my integrity... I take a lot of pride in playing for India and playing in the IPL. People should think three times before writing and talking that way.         
	For some, youre a ready target. Why?         
	Perhaps, people dont like my lifestyle... I have a very carefree attitude and Im entitled to that. When Im performing well, they will say Im working hard, but the moment I have a few bad games, they will link me to women or partying... If you open the papers the next day, it would seem I was the only one at the party the previous night, even though loads of cricketers wouldve attended.         
	Were you out to prove a point, against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, on Friday?         
	I dont have to prove a point to anyone... You know, people are talking rubbish... I was just focusing on my game... I played well that day and need to build on that. I have to perform... Indeed, I want to perform... When my body is 100 per cent fit  Im almost there  Ill have a good knock.         
	Are you happy with the image of a playboy?         
	(Laughs) Its a tag given by the media...I dont see myself as one... Let the media call me whatever, its fine as long as my family and friends know what Im doing. They know who I am.         
	The scrutiny, you feel, is too much...         
	Yeah, my personal life gets targeted, when everybody is entitled to his/her lifestyle...Some people like staying at home, some like going out. When I go for the after-match IPL parties, I see 20-30 players from both teams... I dont know why Im the only one who gets targeted. Maybe, targeting me increases the sales of some publications and improves the TRPs of certain channels.         
	You wont be changing yourself, is it?         
	Why should I? I get targeted because Im well-known... Look, I dont have a problem with criticism, but the criticism should be fair and must be constructive. Say that Im not in form, but you cant say thats because of the women in my life. Those making such damaging allegations will themselves feel the pain if, at some point in life, the same things are levelled against their children.         
	Are you amused, too, that the lifestyle bit doesnt come up when you hit six sixes in an over (as in the inaugural World T20, in 2007)?         
	Yeah, the ones who applauded then are now finding faults... Well, let me assure you, making me look bad wont help others look good.         
	Youre on Twitter. How have fans been responding?         
	Ive got a lot of support... But, yes, I realise that Ive disappointed fans by not being among the runs in this edition of the IPL.         
	[Yuvraj, as it turned out, played an excellent hand in the Kings XI victory over the Kolkata Knight Riders, on Sunday.]         
	Some questions on cricket... How would you describe your relationship with your successor as the Kings XI captain, Kumar Sangakkara?         
	I have a very good relationship with him... The other day, in fact, we were having a laugh at the stories doing the rounds... Ive been playing with Sanga for the past three years and have played against him even longer... I also have a very good relationship with Mahela (Jayawardene)... We try and do the best we can.         
	But you must have been disappointed at losing the Kings XI captaincy?         
	Ive had disappointments in the past, too... Its the franchises call and the franchise is God... Today, Im happy just being a player.         
	The World T20 is coming up. What are your memories of the first edition?         
	Oh, great memories... Unforgettable memories... Winning the World T20, coming back, seeing lakhs on the streets of Mumbai. Of course, we got the stick last year, when we didnt do well in the second edition... This year, weve got a good bowling line-up and, if we click, we should go all the way.         
	Would you have liked Sachin Tendulkar to make himself available for T20 Internationals?         
	(Laughs) I would love him to be with me all the time... The icons a great friend, always willing to help youngsters... Always humble... You dont get people like him very often... Sachin has chosen not to play T20 Internationals, he has made a choice and we should respect his decision... Im sure, if he was closer to 27 than 37, hed be playing T10 as well!         
	Just how differently do you treat T20?         
	I love T20... Its great entertainment... Its a power-packed game and, so, your approach has to be in tune with its demands... Assessing form in T20, though, is a bit hard. Batters, after all, have to go out there and just hit.         
	How should T20 be approached?         
	You need all kinds of players in this format... You need hard-hitters, you need someone who can hit the ball in the gaps, spinners, particularly in the subcontinent, quicks... You need to be smart with your game and smart in the composition of the XI.         
	What are the T20-specific dos and donts?         
	Field well, bowl well and bat according to the situation... As for the donts... Dont listen to what people say... (Laughs) Dont look at the cheerleaders and dont listen to your owner too much!         
	Why have you been so injury-prone?         
	I dont know... Injuries happen and they are a part of any sportsmans career... Its unfortunate that Ive had a lot of injuries this season.         
	Not too long ago, you recommended Sania Mirza to one of your doctors...         
	Yes, to Dr Jatin Chaudhary... Sanias been a friend.         
	The final one... Whats your take on Sania deciding to marry Shoaib Malik?         
	Has come as a surprise... I had no idea at all... Its her life and shes entitled to do whatever she wants... Shoaibs a nice guy, very humble... Im sure they will make a sweet couple.

            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Charl Langeveldt attributes the change in the Kolkata Knight Riders fortunes to Sourav Gangulys leadership skills and the new coaching staff in place.         
	Langeveldt was picked for just the last match against the Rajasthan Royals in South Africa, but had made a point with a super three for 15. Things have been different for the South African quick this time. Having successfully opened the attack for both their matches, he has played a key role in their success thus far.         
	Sourav back as captain has made a big difference. He knows the conditions, knows the players More importantly, hes a thinking guy, keeps changing the field, rotating the bowlers, Langeveldt told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	If you win, its a lot more calm. Last year we were struggling This year things are a lot different. Sourav knows each player and his potential. With the new coaching staff, things have been a lot different, he explained.         
	Langeveldt also praised the set of new Indian players that have joined the side. A lot of new Indian players Lot of talented youngsters coming through has been good.         
	The appointment of Dav Whatmore has proved to be a big boost after the harrowing experience with John Buchanan. Dav is cool and relaxed. He has a good idea of international cricket, having worked with the Sri Lankan and Bangladesh national sides. He communicates well with the players and his man management is very good.         
	How helpful has Wasim Akram been as a bowling consultant? Akram is unbelievable Speaking to him about swing bowling  conventional and reverse  is an education. He is an asset to the team.         
	For someone who has over 900 wickets in international cricket, theres very little you can say. But picking his brain and learning from what he says is a great experience for the youngsters Im still learning too. No one is a master of the game.         
	One of the best during the death overs with his variation, Langeveldt said there was no secret behind his success.         
	Weve been bowling well as a unit. Theres been good back up at the other end too. Im used to playing in these conditions Bowling in flat wickets. Theres no secret of bowling well in Twenty20 cricket If you bowl well on your day, you bowl well.         
	He is looking forward to the contest with the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday. Chennai Super Kings is going to come hard Now that we have won two games, theres going to be lot more pressure and expectation. Youre a professional cricketer and youve got to face it. Its a matter of how we handle the pressure now. Weve got to just keep improving         
	Chennai a good, balanced side. One might say their bowling is their weak point but they have Murali in their ranks the 35-year-old said.         
	The experience of touring India on a few occasions, most recently with the national one-day side before the IPL, has come in handy. Id been here two weeks before the start Toured with the South Africa one-day side. Ive toured India four times and so adjustment wasnt a big problem         
	It needed just a small adjustment, bringing your delivery length a bit shorter. In Twenty20 cricket, you just need to stay cool under pressure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I dont let the expectations of others run my life: Atwal
                                                                                                                       7                                        I dont let the expectations of others run my life: Atwal
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjun Atwal                           
	Calcutta: Arjun Atwal, the only Indian to win a US PGA Tour event, in August, spoke to The Telegraph on Tuesday morning, hours after touching down in the city.         
	Atwal is Asansol-born, but regards Calcutta as home. For professional reasons, however, hes now based in Florida.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youre back home after quite some time...         
	A (Laughs) Feels good, yes, but Im on the way to the airport for a flight to Jamshedpur (to inaugurate a golf course), so it doesnt feel that good as were talking.         
	Having missed the cut in the last tournament (Singapore Open), this isnt the perfect homecoming, is it?         
	Making the cut and missing it is part of life, its something Ive accepted... Doesnt affect my coming home. Ive played well this year, though I felt mentally fatigued by the end of the Shanghai event (which ended November 7).         
	Is this a complete break from golf or do you intend working on aspects of your game?         
	Look, Ill be taking it easy only for three-four days before beginning to practise for the Indian Open, which begins December 2. My wife and children join me here on Saturday.         
	While in Calcutta, are you looking forward to anything in particular?         
	Tucking into sea food, something I avoid when Im not at home... My mother (Rupi) ensures that bekti and prawns are always available, so I can have them at short notice... Theres nothing like home-cooked food... Ill be at the clubs (Royal, Tolly), for they allow me the private space I like... In fact, going back to sea food, this city offers the best.         
	You seem happy with the way 2010 has gone...         
	Yes... Ive been doing most of the things right... Winning the Wyndham Championship has given me confidence... I hope to end the year on a high (at the Indian Open, in Delhi), give it one final push, and take the confidence forward, into 2011. I know I can win again.         
	But hasnt that Tour win increased pressure and raised expectations?         
	No... No... I dont let the expectations of others run my life... Golf is such an individual sport... Good or bad, its all about me.         
	Your best in the five tournaments after that has been a tied third (McGladrey Classic)...         
	I agree, but I feel Ive been playing well.         
	Youve mentioned mental fatigue... How do you overcome it?         
	Look, if youre committed to playing tournaments, then you meet those obligations... Cant get away... One shouldnt, of course, allow fatigue to weigh one down. I stay positive.         
	Three months on, how do you look back on that first for Indian golf?         
	Frankly, I dont think about it... It was a great moment in Greensboro, my confidence took wings there, but Ive moved on. The Wyndham Championship is now part of history.         
	What has that win taught you the most?         
	All I know is that the next time Im in a similar situation, Ill have the confidence to beat the odds. Im aware accolades came my way and its nice to be recognised, but I dont bother about accolades.         
	Your thoughts on the new world No.1, Lee Westwood?         
	Westwoods a great player, but there are three-four in that category... Martin Kaymer, for example... I dont know how the rankings work, though... For, in the past week, Ive climbed from 138 to 135... (After a pause) I expect Tiger (Woods) to regain the top position.         
	When did you last communicate with Tiger, with whom you share a special relationship?         
	I stayed with Tiger in the house hed rented during the Shanghai event...         
	After what hes gone through, has Tiger changed?         
	Well, theres a softer side to him, which is more visible now... You find him smiling a lot more on the golf course. I think Tigers more at peace with himself... Hes working hard to get back to where he was.         
	Tiger hasnt won a tournament for a year...         
	Hell be just fine... Tigers changed his swing and that, as you know, will take time to perfect... Being his practice partner, I can say he has a lot of good stuff in him.         
	Finally, what would you tell the young golfers of the city?         
	Theres no substitute for hard work... Id say practice till you cant anymore... Put in those hours and hours... Its like any other job, the more you put in, the better the rewards.

            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs ward Crystal Dance, the 1-3 piping hot-favourite, won the 1,200m Birthday Girl Cup on Friday. However, the horse was made to sweat for the victory, thanks to jockey C. Alford who rode the public-choice well off the pace and also took the home turn six-wide. Crystal Dance yet managed to score by a shade under a length. The stables rank-outsider, Arizzano, however, scored easily in the hands of apprentice Ajoy Roy.          
	The day was otherwise dominated by jockey A. Imran Khan who scored a treble through Burst Of Speed, Fly For Sure and Island Warrior. D. David trained the first two named.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Razzaq blast in Pak win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Razzaq blast in Pak win
                      
	Dubai: Abdul Razzaq smashed 46 off 18 deliveries to lead Pakistan past England by four wickets and split the two-match Twenty20 series on Saturday. Razzaq finished the match with his fifth six, a blast over long on off Ajmal Shahzad. England scored 148 for six while Pakistan reached the target with an over to spare at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.         
	England won the first match by seven wickets on Friday. Razzaq, who went in with his team tottering at 78 for five after 13 overs, got able support from Umar Akmal (36) and Fawad Alam (28).         
	Razzaq also bowled a tight spell of four overs, conceding only 17 runs even as Kevin Pietersen continued his good form.         
	Pietersen, who hit an unbeaten 43 on Friday, made another aggressive 62 of only 40 deliveries and with Jonathan Trott (39) put up a healthy partnership of 98 from only 12.2 overs for the second wicket. But a late flurry of wickets allowed Pakistan to stem the run tide.         
	Trott was run out going for a needless run just when both batsmen were set to cash in on the platform they built. Once he left in the 17th over, Pietersen followed him in the next as he was trapped leg before to Saeed Ajmal.         
	Umar Gul went for 17 runs in the penultimate over. Yasir Arafat was the most successful bowler with figures of three for 32.           (AGENCIES)

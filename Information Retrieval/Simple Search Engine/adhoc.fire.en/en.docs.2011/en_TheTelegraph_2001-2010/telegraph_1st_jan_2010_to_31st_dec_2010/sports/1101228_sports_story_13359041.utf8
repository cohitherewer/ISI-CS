            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: South Africa captain Graeme Smiths Test cap has been returned to him.         
	Somebody handed it over to the manager (Dr Mohammed Moosajee) on Sunday evening and, obviously, Graeme is delighted, a Cricket South Africa official told The Telegraph.         
	The cap went missing at some point during the team luggage vans journey from Centurion to here.

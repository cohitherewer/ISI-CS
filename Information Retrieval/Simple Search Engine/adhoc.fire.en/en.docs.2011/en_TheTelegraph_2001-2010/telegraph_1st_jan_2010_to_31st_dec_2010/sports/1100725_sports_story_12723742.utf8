The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Deputy Mahela taken aback
                                                                                                                       7                                      Deputy Mahela taken aback
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara during a practice session, in Colombo, on Saturday. The second Test begins Monday      
	Colombo: Sri Lankas senior-most pro Mahela Jayawardene has been taken aback by the selectors decision to name him vice-captain for the second Test against India, which begins here on Monday.         
	I knew they were talking about it, but Id said there were younger candidates around... Its only this (Saturday) morning, then, that I got to know Id been appointed vice-captain, Mahela, 33, told The Telegraph.         
	Mahela, it may be recalled, stepped down as Sri Lankas captain early last year. Hed been succeeded by Kumar Sangakkara, who remains at the helm.         
	Perhaps, Kumar asked the selectors that I be named his deputy. Ill have to speak to Aravinda (de Silva, the chief selector) and find out, Mahela added, as he prepared to leave for a training session.         
	The selectors move could upset Tillekaratne Dilshan, whod captained Sri Lanka in the recent tri-series in Zimbabwe, when most of the seniors were rested.         
	Clearly, its a show of no-confidence.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan had been the vice-captain in the first Test, his last, in Galle.

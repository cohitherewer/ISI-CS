The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav to play vs Tamil Nadu
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav to play vs Tamil Nadu
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has decided to come out of retirement from first-class cricket to play Bengals Ranji Trophy match against Tamil Nadu, in Chennai, which begins from Wednesday.         
	The left-handed batsman himself expressed his desire to play and informed the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) about his decision on Monday evening. The move comes at a crucial time, when there is a huge question mark over whether he will be retained by the Kolkata Knight Riders. While Bengal are placed fifth in Group A of the Ranji Super League table, Tamil Nadu are perched on the second spot.         
	Souravs last first-class outing was against Delhi, last season, where he scored a sparkling 152 to help Bengals cause who were in the relegation zone.         
	The Bengal squad are currently not in good health with a number of first team players suffering from bouts of viral fever. Souravs availability will thus bolster the side against Tamil Nadu, who have garnered 10 points from four matches so far. Sourav, in all probability, will be replacing Dibyendu Chakraborty in the playing XI. He informed us about his availability today It is good news for the team, said CAB joint secretary Sujan Mukherjee.         
	But Bengals casualty list kept growing as, on Monday, wicket-keeper Sreevats Goswami came back with high fever. In fact, Sreevats defied a running temperature during Bengals last match against Gujarat, to turn out for his side. Bengal under-22 keeper Gitimoy Basu has joined the squad as Sreevats replacement. Sourav will be leaving for Chennai on Tuesday morning.         
	However, the Bengal selectors didnt have a clue about Souravs decision. They were informed about the development after everything was finalised.

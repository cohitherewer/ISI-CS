	Calcutta/Wellington: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Saturday received another setback in its search of a new vice president as Sir John Anderson, a former chairman of New Zealand Cricket, has refused to take up the job.         
	[That Sir John wouldnt be keen on taking up the job was reported by The Telegraph on May 26.]         
	After rejection of former Australian Prime Minister John Howards candidature last month, the ICC had asked the cricket Boards of Australia and New Zealand to re-nominate a person.

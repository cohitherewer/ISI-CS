	Centurion: With the shadow of spot-fixing scandal looming large over Champions League Twenty20, beginning in Johannesburg, on Friday, former India captain Anil Kumble said ICC and CLT20 organisers should ensure strict anti-corruption measures during the 12-day event.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore captain termed the recent spot-fixing scandal as a major issue, but said the game has the power and ability to withstand such crisis.         
	Yes, this is a major issue that has happened but cricket is larger than any individual... But having said that you need to be vigilant as any game is susceptible.         
	I am sure the International Cricket Council and the (CLT20) organisers will be very cautious on this matter and cricket will be played here in a highly competitive atmosphere, he added.           (PTI)

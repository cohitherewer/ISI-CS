            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Abel Hammond vies for the ball with Air Indias Peter Odafe at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: It seems East Bengals woeful run in the I-League will not end in the near future. On Sunday, it was Air India, who turned the heat on the red-and-gold brigade beating them 2-0 in a 17th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The loss stretched East Bengals winless streak to 10 matches and they remain at the eighth position with 21 points. Kailash Patil and ND Busi Opara scored on either side of the break.         
	Air India, who also have 21 points now climbed up to ninth spot in the 14-team table. It was one of the worst match that East Bengal played this season. The Mumbai outfit didnt do anything special. Twice they had a clear look at goal and they were bang on target.         
	On both occasions, the East Bengal defenders, especially right back Nirmal Chetri, were horribly out of position and both strikes were of identical fashion.         
	In the 32nd minute, Kailash got a loose ball at the half line and sprinted down the left wing. Nirmal who failed to fall back on time was beaten by sheer speed and before Mehrajuddin Wadoo could close down, his angular left-footer beat Abhra Mondal entering through the far post.         
	The home teams defence has suddenly started looking very fragile with absolutely no-cordination amongst the defenders.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder introduced veteran Rennedy Singh at the wide right and he was a total flop. Ditto with Alvito DCunha and Sanju Pradhan. There was not a single chance that was created. That left the two strikers Abel Hammond and Yusif Yakubu frustrated. Although Hammond tried a few things, Yakubu was well marked by Mohun Bagan-reject Peter Odafe, who justifiably won the Man of the-Match award.         
	The second goal came in the 78th minute when Opara got a ball and unleashed a left-footer which kissed the wide post before nestling into the net.         
	In Margao, Chirag United defeated a fighting Salgaocar 2-1 here Sunday. Joshimar and Ashim Biswas scored for Chirag while Beevan DMello scored for the hosts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Has John run into trouble?
                                                                                                                       7                                        Has John run into trouble?
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Howard                           
	Calcutta: Has former Australia Prime Minister John Howards nomination as the next vice-president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) run into trouble?         
	That, indeed, was the question being asked after the ICCs Executive Board, which met in Dubai, didnt rubber-stamp the joint nomination by Australia and New Zealand.         
	While its true that flight disruptions kept the president, David Morgan, away from the meeting, he did have a tele-conference on other issues... Why wasnt the Howard business settled in the same manner? Its rather intriguing, a top source told The Telegraph.         
	For the record, the ICCs media release, on Tuesday evening, merely said: ...The issue of the nomination of the next vice-president will now be taken forward by the ICC president, vice-president (Sharad Pawar) and the chief executive (Haroon Lorgat)...         
	Howard, it may be recalled, got the nomination narrowly getting past New Zealands Sir John Anderson.         
	Nobody in an official position was available for a comment, but its being assumed that either Sri Lanka or Zimbabwe, or even both, could have raised an objection.         
	Had the nomination been approved, Howard would have taken over from Pawar in June and also succeeded him as the ICC president, in the summer of 2012.         
	All that is, for now, on hold.

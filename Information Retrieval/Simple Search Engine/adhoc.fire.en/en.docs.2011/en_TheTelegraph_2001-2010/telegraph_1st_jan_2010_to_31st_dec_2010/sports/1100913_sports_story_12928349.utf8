            A STAFF REPORTER              Usman Afzaal                      
	Calcutta: England Test cricketer Usman Afzaal is hiding in a safe house after a betting gang posing as cops ransacked his family house, The News of the World reported on Sunday.         
	The 33-year-old Afzaal is under police protection after being targeted by a shady betting syndicate.         
	Usman Afzaal, 33, is being guarded at a safe house after a gang posing as cops ransacked his family home with a fake warrant, the report said.         
	Afzaals family reported the unusual incident to a Nottingham police station next morning but they were informed that no such record of investigation existed.         
	Afzaals brother Kamran had also received an anonymous blackmail call, asking for a sum of 100,000 within 24 hours, failing which his family would be reported to the International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), the report said.         
	The family had to leave their three-storey townhouse on the outskirts of Nottingham after the bizarre episode.         
	They have gone. They have been under police protective custody for a couple of months and have moved out, a neighbour at the family home, was quoted as saying by the paper.         
	Scotland Yards Serious and Organised Crime Command were tipped off by Customs officers who had learned of the menacing demand.         
	It is believed the gang involved may have links to an illegal gambling ring run by an Indian fixer based in the Middle East, the report said.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Surrey CCC confirmed there was no suggestion Afzaal had ever been involved in any form of match fixing.         
	The Pakistan-born cricketer Afzaal featured in three Ashes Tests against Australia in 2001.         
	Afzaal dated Bollywood actress Amrita Arora some years back.         
	Meanwhile, a senior betting industry expert has asked the ACSU to add the first ball wide that cost five runs from Pakistan pacer Mohammed Aamer to the no-balls, under investigation from the tainted Lords Test.         
	Mark Davies, who is also an adviser to the ACSU, said: The knowledge that five runs will be scored from the first ball could be used in several spot-betting and spread betting markets, the kind of books that the ICC ACSU know are made in the illegal betting markets in India and other parts of Asia.         
	I dont buy the explanation (for the wide ball) given by the commentators that it is hard to adjust to the conditions at Lords, said Davies, who runs betting analysts Camberton UK.

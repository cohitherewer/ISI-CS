The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look to go atop

	London: The Premier League lead could change yet again this week when Manchester United and Arsenal seek to take advantage of Chelseas continuing participation in the FA Cup.         
	Top spot has changed hands four times in the past six weeks and both defending champions United and Arsenal have the chance to make it five on Saturday.         
	United could take first place for the first time in a month with a draw or win at Wolverhampton Wanderers, with any slip up giving Arsenal the chance to leap two places  if they beat visiting Burnley by four goals or more. But both clubs have selection problems to contend with.         
	Arsenal now have Aaron Ramsey on the sidelines along with the injured William Gallas and suspended Alex Song, while United may have to persist with their reliance upon Wayne Rooney after Michael Owen was ruled out for the season. We have to assess Wayne because he played almost 90 minutes for England the other night at Wembley, which I was disappointed in, United manager Alex Ferguson said. When you are playing on that pitch for almost an hour on Sunday and then nearly a full game on Wednesday its far too much. Now he is a doubt for Wolves.         
	Rooney was set to rest last weekend but was forced into action when Owen limped off with the hamstring injury that has ended his season.         
	Ferguson must now decide whether to further risk fatigue or field Dimitar Berbatov alone up front.         
	United got some good news with defender Rio Ferdinand set to return from a back injury that kept him out of the past two games and Englands midweek win over Egypt.         
	And England midfielder Owen Hargreaves is finally close to returning after 16 months out, with a reserve appearance scheduled for Thursday.         
	Arsenal are expected to recall Andrei Arshavin and Denilson from injury absences, while Abou Diaby may return from a knee problem. Arshavin could be available and there is a little, little chance that Diaby could be available again too, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. I am convinced that Denilson and Arshavin will be OK but for Diaby it is 50:50.         
	If we have good news from the other players coming back, we should still have a strong squad out.         
	Chelsea host Stoke on Sunday as the only one of the Premier Leagues so-called big four left in the FA Cup. Tottenham and Aston Villa play their FA Cup quarter finals this weekend knowing that theyre unlikely to get a better chance of winning the famous trophy.         
	Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal have won 13 of the past 14 FA Cup finals between them but Tottenham are at Fulham on Saturday having won the last of their once-record eight FA Cup finals in 1991, while seven-time champions Aston Villa, without a title since 1957, are at Reading on Sunday.         
	Also this weekend, West Ham host Bolton in the Premier League on Saturday, while Hull are at Everton a day later. Liverpool are at Wigan in Mondays match.           (AGENCIES)

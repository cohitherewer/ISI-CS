The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A case of mistaken identity! 
                                                                                                                       7                                      A case of mistaken identity! 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	A junior football coach landed a job as the manager of Seychelles national team after the countrys football association mistook him for former Manchester City defender Andy Morrison.         
	Andrew Amers-Morrison got the job while he was on holiday in the tropical island.         
	The local federation confused Amers-Morrison, 40, with the former City player who turned out for Kevin Keegans side, handing the holidaymaker a two-year contract.         
	Chairman Suketu Patel said: We thought we were getting the real Andy Morrison, but instead we have an impostor.         
	After realising that a mistake had been made, Amers-Morrisons new bosses called him in for a meeting where they incredibly gave him six months grace to prove he was up to the task. Amers-Morrison did attempt to become a professional player in his youth, but saw his progress hampered by a series of injuries.

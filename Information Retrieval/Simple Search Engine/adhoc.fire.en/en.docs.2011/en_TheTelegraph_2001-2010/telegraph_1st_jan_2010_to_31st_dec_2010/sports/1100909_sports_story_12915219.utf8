                                                                                                                       7                                        Focus will be on the process: Raman
  - Coach leaves it to Sourav to decide on his availability       A STAFF REPORTER            W.V. Raman, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Its early days for Woorkeri Raman. He still hasnt got the probables shortlisted for the Ranji Trophy. The first couple of days have been spent working with players who have been selected in the three teams for the S. K. Acharya Challenger Trophy.         
	Its too early to chalk out a plan now It is a matter of adjustment and the mental and physical aspect would be most important Too early to talk on the composition of the side I havent seen most of the guys in match situations. Only after having a proper look, can their roles be defined. May be after four weeks, Ill be better placed to comment, the newly appointed Bengal coach said on Wednesday.         
	That, however, hasnt prevented him from identifying the key areas. Enhancing the mental and technical skills of the players will be most important. Well have to reach the optimum level before the first Ranji game. But cricket is all about how you play on that particular day.         
	Itll be all about motivating... Alleviating the anxiety that creeps in Success will come but a process needs to be followed in the nets day in and out. It is about discipline that will have to be nurtured and focused upon, he explained.         
	The availability of the boys will be a key issue in the long season ahead Injuries, national call ups Well be playing seven/eight games back to back. So the intensity has to be maintained and that will be important.         
	The mental freshness bit will be important. Its more or less a new side. Thats not a disadvantage and will always be interesting to work with them. Even the last time when I worked with Bengal team, quite a few players made their debut, he said.         
	The former India opener is focused on the team game. Its a team game. Nobody is greater than the side. Each individual has to succeed and weve got to focus equally on everybody.         
	After the Challenger Trophy, Raman plans to bring down the probables list to somewhere in the 20s. First and foremost will be the work ethics everyone working towards a common objective.         
	Bengal havent done well in the past few seasons but he is optimistic. When I was the Tamil Nadu coach, I saw them from a different angle. Now Ill look at them from another angle. Lot of things can change. The boys have had a clean break of six months and will be starting afresh. Ill have to see how their rhythm is building up and then take it from there.         
	Raman is open to the idea of captaincy. Its a matter of necessity and there are no compulsions. Theres no harm if one person leads in all three formats. Its a need-based game.         
	The selectors might discuss the captaincy issue with me. Its a situation where Ill hear more about what has happened Ill give my inputs as and when required.         
	On Sourav Gangulys availability, the Bengal coach said: Its up to him. He has to judge if he has the drive to play in the four-day format. If hes willing then it will be great for the boys, considering the amount of experience he will bring into the side Ill have a chat with him once he decides... Will have to see his inclination. Well think of crossing the bridge when we come to it.

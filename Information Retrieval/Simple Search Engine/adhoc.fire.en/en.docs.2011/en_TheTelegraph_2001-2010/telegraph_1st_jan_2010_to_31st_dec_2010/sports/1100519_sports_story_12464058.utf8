The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England use their brains, at last
                                                                                                                       7                                        England use their brains, at last
                  Guest Column    Geoffrey Boycott          
	Im sure English fans are delighted to see their team break the major-tournament duck, but even more important was the manner in which they got there. This was a team in which everybody carried off their role to perfection. A Twenty20 match is so short that the momentum can switch in an instant, if you allow it to.         
	England never did.         
	So often in England, we like to reduce everything to one person  an Alex Ferguson, say, or a Jonny Wilkinson. This time the credit has to be shared around. It wasnt just the players who got it right, but the coaches and the selection panel, who managed to fit round pegs into round holes for once.         
	Up until this tournament, I had lost track of the number of opening combinations who had been sent out with instructions to bat like Adam Gilchrist. The trouble is that it has to come naturally, or it wont come at all. If you look at Gilchrist, he batted the same way in Test cricket as in Twenty20. So it was a relief to see England settle on Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter, two players who looked comfortable waltzing down the pitch against the new ball.         
	The top three should do most of the work in 20-over cricket, and England were fortunate that Kevin Pietersen was back to his swaggering best. It is a known fact he is the most talented batsman, with the widest range of shots, but he hasnt been doing himself justice for a while. Here he looked more like his old self, cocky and aggressive. The sight of him taking on the best strike bowlers from around the world  people as quick as Dale Steyn or Shaun Tait  gave everybody a lift.         
	In the field, England had a well-balanced bowling attack, with three seamers who didnt send down many drive balls. Graeme Swann was the best spinner in the competition: nobody collared him at any stage, or even looked like doing so. And then there was the catching and athleticism on show. In previous meetings, Australia had tended to make England look ponderous around the outfield, but the balance swung the other way this time.         
	As captain, Paul Collingwood did an excellent job, and the fact that he had a quiet time with the bat didnt matter because everyone else was firing around him. Here is a guy who resigned the ODI captaincy in 2008 because he found it was affecting his form and leaving him mentally tired.         
	On his second try, he has come back more experienced and better able to preserve his own psychological space from the pressures of the job. The catch he took to dismiss Michael Clarke in the final was inspirational.         
	Englands was a real horses-for-courses selection: only four players could consider themselves automatic choices for the Test side. But the way they performed will make the next 50-over squad very interesting. What will happen to the likes of Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Matt Prior? They all featured in the one-day series against South Africa last November, but now they might not be feeling too sure of their ground.         
	Whatever England do with that team, they will want to carry over some of the confident mindset that they showed in the West Indies. There has always been a flakiness to English limited-overs teams, a tendency to turn every little trip into a major stumble.         
	Because all the players would be half-expecting someone to buckle under pressure, a sense of panic would all too easily creep in. The difference now is that they have started to trust each other, and with good reason, because this result was no fluke.         
	Some people still tend to take Twenty20 lightly, but in the last few weeks we have seen how skilful the game has become. Its basically crickets answer to baseball. If you count up the average number of pitches thrown in a baseball match, it comes to around 100 per innings  which isnt far short of the 120 balls we use in this format.         
	There are plenty of batsmen who will whack you out of the park if you bowl in the area where they like it. So a lot of thought has to go into the field placements and individual strategies for each opponent.         
	Just like a baseball pitcher, you are trying to stop them hit a home run, and you often need a Plan B and C as well as a Plan A.         
	In this tournament England showed more brainpower than any of their opponents - no mean feat from a team who have often been accused of playing thoughtless cricket. On this evidence, there is no reason why they shouldnt go on and become a force in the world of Twenty20.         
	And a few more trophies would be nice.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

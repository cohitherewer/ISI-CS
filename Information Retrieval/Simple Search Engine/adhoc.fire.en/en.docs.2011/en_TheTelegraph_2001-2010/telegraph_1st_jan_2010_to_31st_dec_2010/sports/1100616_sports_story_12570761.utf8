The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winston nods in a point

	Rustenburg: With one fair flick of his head, Winston Reid made himself a New Zealand sporting icon. Not bad for a man who was borderline Danish three months ago.         
	The centre-back came from nowhere in the third minute of injury time to score the goal that brought New Zealand their first-ever point at the World Cup finals.         
	Born in New Zealand, Reid moved to Denmark aged 10 and represented his adopted home at under-21 level. He plays for Midtjylland in the Danish league.         
	In March, he took a decision that Tuesday became the best of his life. I was torn between the countries for a long time, he said. I was asking myself, am I a Kiwi or a Dane? Now my hope is to play in a higher league. And I hope this will launch football in New Zealand.         
	Reids goal sent both nations into shock. Slovakia, technically superior but tepid and conservative, especially once Robert Vittek had scored early in the second half with a possibly offside header, had not looked like conceding to tidy but benign opponents.         
	Vladimir Weiss, the Slovakia coach, was rendered oxymoronic by the result. This is a small tragedy for us, he said. With Italy and Paraguay to come in group F, Slovakia must privately feel that they are fatally wounded.         
	At this tournament there are outsiders, long shots and New Zealand. They are a motley crew captained by Ryan Nelsen, of Blackburn Rovers, but mainly comprising lower-leaguers and even no-leaguers: two players are unattached and three are amateurs. Shane Smeltz, who set up Reid, is a former Mansfield Town and AFC Wimbledon striker who was released by Halifax Town in 2007.         
	So they arrived in South Africa with nothing to lose  except, potentially, three matches, pride, credibility and self-respect. Now they have more points than Australia.         
	Can it get any better? This teams created history, said Ricki Herbert, the coach, who was a member of the squad that lost all three of their fixtures in 1982, New Zealands only previous appearance at the World Cup finals. It would have to be our greatest-ever result.         
	Next up are Italy. Who knows what the Italians might do to us  or not, Herbert said. We have no fear. Strangely enough, a fixture between two of the least populous countries in the tournament on a Tuesday lunchtime was not a smash with the public.         
	Until Reids exhilarating intervention, this was one of those contests that makes hypocrites of us all. Before a World Cup, who doesnt want underdogs and new nations to qualify and breathe fresh air into the competition?         
	Then, once they are here, who doesnt turn up their nose when an entirely forgivable lack of talent and nous produces matches such as these. The result, though, made small beautiful.         
	Teams         
	New Zealand: Mark Paston, Tony Lochhead, Winston Reid, Ivan Vicelich (Jeremy Christie, 78), Ryan Nelsen, Simon Elliott, Shane Smeltz, Chris Killen (Chris Wood, 72), Leo Bertos, Rory Fallon, Tommy Smith.

	Referee: Jerome Damon (South Africa)           THE TIMES, LONDON

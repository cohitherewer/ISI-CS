	Leeds: Pakistan turned the form book on its head with an inspired bowling performance to skittle Australia for just 88 on the first day of the second test on Wednesday.         
	The Australians, seeking their eighth Test win a row, folded meekly after winning the toss and Pakistan reached 148 or three at the close to set up the prospect of a first victory over their opponents for 15 years.         
	Australia, who won the first test by 150 runs, crashed to their lowest total since 1984 when they made 76 against West Indies.         
	Pakistan pace bowlers Mohammed Aamer (three for 20), Mohammad Asif (three for 30) and Umar Gul (two for 16) exploited the favourable conditions with clever swing and seam bowling. Tim Paine top-scored for Australia with 17.         
	The Pakistanis lost new captain Salman Butt (45), Imran Farhat (43) and Azhar Ali (30) but Umar Amin and Umar Akmal extended their lead to 60 runs, Akmal slogging leg-spinner Steven Smith for the days first six as the light dimmed.         
	Pakistan passed the Australia total with one wicket down when Ali edged Mitchell Johnson to the third man boundary.         
	Australia were annoyed by another Ali edge for four through gully, this time off Ben Hilfenhaus, who appeared to give a verbal volley to the young batsman with captain Ricky Ponting adding a few words of his own.         
	By then the dark clouds had been replaced by blue sky as fans bared their chests and used T-shirts as makeshift sunhats. For most of the day, there was only a smattering of fans in the Headingley stadium despite enthusiastic marketing to a strong local Pakistani community.         
	But the ball swung even in the sunshine as left-hander Butt was undone by a full-length Hilfenhaus delivery that uprooted his leg stump.         
	Farhat also succumbed to the wobbling ball when Shane Watson shaped one into him for a simple lbw decision and Ali was caught one-handed by wicket keeper Paine after batting for 79 minutes.         
	Earlier, left-armer Aamer claimed wickets with the first two balls after lunch to help finish off Australias innings.         
	Aamer, aged 18, bowled Smith with a ball that swung into him sharply and left-hander Johnson was bowled by a ball swinging prodigiously away.         
	Before lunch, Australia regularly lost wickets as Asif swung the ball both ways and moved it off the seam, with Watson and Ponting undone by his in-swing.         
	Gul dismissed Michael Clarke with a ball that swung in and cut back off the seam.         
	Although the series is being played at neutral venues in England, it is a home one for Pakistan who cannot play in their homeland because of the precarious security situation.         
	Conditions remained favourable for bowling throughout, but Australia looked shell-shocked when they took the ball barely halfway through the second session and Pakistans openers virtually wiped off the measly total with a stand of 80.         
	I think it was a good day for us, speedster Gul said at the end of days play. I think, we will be happy if we can score 200 to 250.         
	Gul was also surprised by Australias decision to bat first. There was moisture on the wicket, so I think it was a surprising decision, especially from the Australians, he said.         
	When the sun came out it was good for batting, so it all depends when the conditions are overcast.         
	Pakistan bowled beautifully, Australia coach Tim Nielsen said. They bowled a good length and line, hit the wicket hard and didnt expect the conditions to do it for them. We never got the smell of getting a partnership going.         
	Nielsen defended Pontings decision. We felt once we got through the new ball that it would flatten out and be quite a nice batting wicket, he said. The conditions were beyond our control, but we felt the batting would deteriorate towards the end of the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan hope for a change in form
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bagan hope for a change in form
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans newly-appointed technical director Subhas Bhowmick and his players during a training session, at the club ground, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: With the winter wind stamping its presence in this part of the country, Mohun Bagan will dearly hope their change of coach is as soothing as the change in the season. The spotlight is on Subhas Bhowmick, the man entrusted with the job to bring a change in Bagans fortunes.         
	Though the technical term that defines Bhowmicks role is a technical director, its no secret that he has the job of being the coach, philosopher and guide of a dwindling Bagan boat. On the eve of Bagans crucial I-League encounter against defending champions Dempo SC, few would argue that Bhowmick is in the hot seat, literally.         
	Under the guidance of former coach Stanley Rozario, the green and maroon brigade have managed a solitary point from three outings in the I-League so far. Facing the might of Dempo, arguably the best side in the country, with the expectations of millions to stage a turnaround is like fighting a gun with a stick.         
	But Bhowmick, a veteran of many tests and battles, begs to differ. Life in itself is a war and soccer is just an extension of it Its all about fighting a mental battle. This is certainly not the toughest test that I have faced in my career, the former I-League winning coach said.         
	No matter how brave a face Bhowmick puts up, fact is that Bagan are not in the best of shapes  mentally and physically.         
	Two key players who would have been very much in Bhowmicks plans, have been ruled out with injuries. Striker Edeh Chidi and defender Kinshuk Debnath both have muscle tears and will not be available to help their team in the daunting task. Moreover, another defender, Harpreet Singh, too, is uncertain for Thursdays match.         
	Speaking after the teams practice on Wednesday, Bhowmick said that he was no miracle man and a good show depended entirely on how the players perform. Nothing depends on me, its the players who will help the team perform better.                     
	True, but the Bagan players so far in the season have either lacked the zeal of putting their best foot forward or had to bear the burden of being played in unfamiliar position by the former coach. This is where the experience of Bhowmick will be expected to add the necessary Midas touch.         
	As of Wednesday, Bagans midfield managers for Thursday appeared to be the quartet of Snehasish Chakraborty, Jayanta Sen, Souvik Chakraborty and Gouranga Dutta. A lot will depend on their efficiency to curb a potentially stronger opposition midfield which has the dangerous duo of Beto and Ogba Kalou. Foiling rival plans, the Bagan four will also have to ensure that they keep the supply line for Jose Ramirez Barreto and Subair Murithala Ali live.         
	Queried on Barreto, who has often been used in the midfield in the earlier matches, Bhowmick made it clear that the Brazilian will not be restricted to any zone and will rather be allowed to execute freely. Players like Barreto should not be limited a particular zone. One can make the optimum use of him if he is allowed to play freely, he said.         
	Asked if he would be gunning for three points, a cautious Bhowmick replied: I will be taking every match by 15-minute sessions Look the I-League is such that every single point you earn can make a difference in the long run. So obviously my first priority will be not to lose the match.         
	Dempo, on the other hand, are a calmer lot. Coming off a 2-0 victory over JCT in their last match, Armando Coalcos boys will certainly look to clinch some vital points from an away match. But thanks to coach Coalco, tension is an unknown word for them.         
	I still believe that the AFC Champions League is most important for us, not the I-League. We want to venture into unconquered territories. We will try to give our best against Mohun Bagan but we are not worried about the result, Coalco explained.

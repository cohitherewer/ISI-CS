The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Next goal is Olympic gold, says Vijender 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Next goal is Olympic gold, says Vijender 
          
	Guangzhou: Indian boxings poster boy Vijender Singh pummelled two-time world champion Abbos Atoev into submission with a commanding 7-0 triumph in 75kg to give the countrys campaign in the Asian Games a golden finish here Friday.         
	The Beijing Olympic Games bronze-medal winner Vijender destroyed the Ubzek boxer and later said his next aim is to win gold in the 2012 Olympic Games in London.         
	But two other Indian boxers  Santosh Kumar in the 64 kg category and Manpreet Singh in the 91 kg category  lost in the finals and settled for silver medals.         
	India finished their boxing campaign with their best-ever haul of nine medals (two gold, four silver and four bronze), including two in the womens competition that made its debut here.         
	The other gold medal came from Vikas Krishan in the 60kg class.         
	After his comprehensive victory over his Uzbek opponent, 25-year-old Bhiwani boxer, Vijender said he thoroughly enjoyed the thrashing one of the top fighters in amateur boxing and that his next goal was the Olympic gold.         
	My next goal is to win the Olympic gold in 2012. I felt hungry for the title and enjoyed beating the world champion, said Vijender who had ended up with a disappointing bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi.         
	He also avenged his defeat to the same Uzbek rival at last years World Championship in Italy in which he won a bronze.         
	The loss against Atoev in Italy still rankles him but Friday he carried too much weight in his punches and the Uzbek found the Indian too hot to handle.         
	He was cheered all the way during his bout at the Foshan Stadium by a small bunch of Indian supporters that included Indias ambassador to China S. Jaishankar.         
	After his triumph, Vijender kneeled down in the middle of the ring with his arms raised in victory.         
	The Indian, who normally adopts an open stance, kept his guard and scored whenever he got a chance to break his rivals defence.           (PTI)

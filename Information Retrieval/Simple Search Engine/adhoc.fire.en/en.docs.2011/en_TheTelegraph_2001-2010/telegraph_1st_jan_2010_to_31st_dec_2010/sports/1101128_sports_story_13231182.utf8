The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poulter in the lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Poulter in the lead

	Dubai: Britains Ian Poulter kept up his bid for back-to-back victories by taking a two-stroke lead after the Dubai World Championship third round on Saturday.         
	Last weeks Hong Kong Open winner carded a three-under 69 for a 12-under total of 204, two ahead of fellow countryman and playing partner Ross Fisher (71), Italian Francesco Molinari (68) and Thailands Thongchai Jaidee (69).         
	One stroke further adrift were world No. 1 Lee Westwood (71) and Swede Robert Karlsson (67).         
	Martin Kaymer found the water with his approach shot and double-bogeyed the par-five 18th but was still poised to finish the year as Europes No. 1.         
	The German, who has a lead of 290,000 euros over second-placed Graeme McDowell in the money-list, finished with a 73 for 210.         
	Briton McDowell, who will probably need to win this weeks tournament to overhaul Kaymer in the Race to Dubai, was four strokes adrift of the German after shooting a 69 in the season finale.         
	Up for grabs for Kaymer and McDowell, the only two players who can top the money-list, is a $1.26 million cheque for winning the tournament plus a $1.5 million bonus for finishing the season as Europes No. 1.         
	Barring the impossible I think Europes No. 1 is probably not a reality for me any more, said McDowell.         
	I can certainly draw a line under it tomorrow in the last round and just put a nice end to whats been a fantastic year, added the U.S. Open, Wales Open and Andalucia Masters winner.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Surprise at ceremony
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: For the first time in many years, an official of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) was seen at the prize distribution ceremony of an event which is the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s property.         
	Biswarup Dey, joint secretary of the CAB, was one of those invited to give away the prizes after the final of the Champions League Twenty20 in Johannesburg, on Sunday night.         
	It was learnt that the BCCI affiliates had received invitations from the Super Kings and the Royal Challengers Bangalore, two of the Indian teams that made the semi-finals of the tournament. Dey had gone there on behalf of the CAB.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya didnt wish to read much into it.         
	However, the surprise element couldnt be overlooked, considering that someone from the CAB, which is not in the best of relations with the BCCI, is being called on stage.         
	Murali Vijay and Mike Hussey cracked a sparkling half century each as Chennai Super Kings were crowned the champions with their eight-wicket victory over Warriors in the grand finale. Murali Vijay was the Man of the Final while Ravichandran Ashwin was the Man of the Tournament.

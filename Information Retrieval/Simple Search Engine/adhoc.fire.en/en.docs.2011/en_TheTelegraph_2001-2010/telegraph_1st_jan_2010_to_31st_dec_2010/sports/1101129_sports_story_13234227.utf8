  - European money title for Germanys Martin Kaymer             Martin Kaymer, after winning the 2010 money-list crown, on the final day of Dubai World Championship, on Sunday. (Reuters)                                 
	Dubai: Swedens Robert Karlsson won the Dubai World Championship Sunday, beating third-round leader Ian Poulter in a two-way playoff after a bizarre blunder by the Englishman on the final hole.         
	Karlsson calmly rolled in a birdie putt on the second playoff hole after Poulter had been given a one-stroke penalty for dropping his ball on his marker on the green, causing it to flip over and move from its original position.         
	The coin was one way and the next minute facing the other way, Poulter said. Its pitched right on the front and flipped over. If it pitches in the middle, the coin doesnt move and its fine. But its pitched on the front and its flipped over.         
	Poulter spotted his error and reported it to the match referee, whose ruling left him with a long putt for par instead of a birdie. The putt came up a foot short, taking all the pressure off the Swede as he then had two shots to clinch the victory in the season-ending $7.5 million tournament.         
	The 41-year-old Karlsson needed just one shot to secure his second European Tour victory this year and the 11th tour victory of his career. The former top-ranked European said this was one of the biggest victories of his long career and one of the most lucrative.         
	He earned $1.25 million with the win.         
	This must be the highest one I would think if you just look on the quality of the field thats been here, world No. 1, world No. 3 or 4 or whatever it is, he said. Its a fantastic field, and obviously when we have all of the best players in Europe together, the way it looks now, its going to be a great field so to win here is fantastic.         
	Germanys Martin Kaymer finished in disappointing tie for 13th but still beat out Northern Irelands Graeme McDowell for the European money title after tying him at 6 under for the tournament.         
	Kaymer follows in the footsteps of Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo, Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie and compatriot Bernhard Langer by ending the season as the European Tours No. 1.         
	Its been a fantastic year, Kaymer said. All of the goals that I set for myself, for my career, everything happened this year. To win the Race to Dubai, No. 1, and to play the Ryder Cup, and to win a major.         
	Poulter came into the final round seemingly in control, with a two-shot lead over Thailands Thongchai Jaidee and fellow Englishman Ross Fisher. He also had momentum on his side after winning last weeks Hong Kong Open.         
	He struggled on the first nine with a bogey and only one birdie but settled down on the back nine as the 34-year-old has done all week with consecutive birdies and two pressure par putts on the 16th and 17th holes. But with the title on the line, he couldnt sink a birdie putt on the 18th and then fell apart in the playoff.         
	Despite his disappointing finish, Poulter said the tournament provided a fitting end to the season. It was good. Looking at the board all the way around, Robert got off to an incredible start, birdie, birdie, eagle. Westy made a late charge. It was good fun the whole way around, Poulter said.         
	I felt good, hit lots of good golf shots. I made a couple of key up and downs at the right time. But, you know what, youre left walking away disappointed. (agencies)

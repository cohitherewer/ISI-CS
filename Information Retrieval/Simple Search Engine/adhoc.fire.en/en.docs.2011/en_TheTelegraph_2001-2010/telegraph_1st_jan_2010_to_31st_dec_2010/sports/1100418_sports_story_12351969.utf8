	Calcutta: Timing, they say, is of utmost importance in cricket. Two great catches, excellent bowling and a match-winning knock from the captain  the Kolkata Knight Riders win on Saturday had it all. But will it be enough to squeeze a miracle out of nowhere and earn a last-four berth? Time will tell if the Knights have got their timing right or if everything came too late.         
	But the eight-wicket victory for Sourav Ganguly and his men will certainly bring smiles back on the fans faces. They outplayed and outthought the Rajasthan Royals at the floodlit Eden to knock them out of the semis race of IPL III.         
	The victory took the Knights up to the sixth spot in the points table. They have now 12 points from 13 matches and are still alive in the race for the semis race.         
	The accolades for the victory would certainly be shared by the team for their collective excellence, but if one person deserves a special mention, it has to be Sourav. After leading his troops to stifle the Royals during their innings, the never-say-die man of Indian cricket returned to smash a 50-ball 75 to help his team overhaul the 133-run target and give principal owner Shah Rukh Khan a reason to cheer.         
	Sourav hit 11 boundaries and two huge sixes to give the capacity crowd reasons to celebrate. He was well supported by Cheteshwar Pujara, who scored a restrained 38-ball 45. The duo shared an unbroken 111-run partnership for the third wicket to ensure full points and an improvement in the net run-rate. They negated the early hiccups in the form of Brendon McCullum and Chris Gayles wickets.         
	That catches win you matches was once again proved. The Knights shrugged off their consistent inconsistency so far in the tournament as discipline seemed to be their oath on the day.         
	Strict line and length from the bowlers, sparkling fielding and shrewd captaincy made them look like deserving winners all through the evening.         
	That Sourav and his boys were up for something special was evident from the first four overs of the day. Shane Bond was firing on all cylinders and Ashok Dinda was doing the basics right. The result  the Royals opening duo of Shane Watson and Naman Ojha could manage only 24 in first four.         
	But Watson responded well to the challenge and started whacking any loose delivery in the offing. Just when it seemed that the Australian was set to spoil the Knights day, a Laxmi Ratan Shukla slower rattled his woodwork. His 26-ball 44 was studded with seven boundaries and a huge hit over the fence off the medium pace of Jaydev Unadkat.         
	That brought the ever-dangerous Yusuf Pathan to the crease. When Murali Kartik spilled a difficult chance off the very second ball he faced, many thought he had dropped the match.         
	Shukla, who was pushed into oblivion for the better part of this IPL (and strangely so), then pulled off a stunner to send Ojha back to the hut. Ojhas well-timed cut off Unadkat was plucked out off thin air by a diving Shukla, who was stationed at point.         
	If that was brilliance, Sourav chose to redefine it. The 37-year-old, whose fielding in IPL III has matched the best in the business, ran about 25 yards backwards to deep mid-wicket and dived full length to grab the ball, which was always moving away from him. And the fact that it was Yusufs catch which he lapped, made it all the more special. The Baroda bomber scored just eight.         
	With two of their best back to the pavilion, the Royals never really managed to recover and kept losing wickets which, in turn, put their run rate at a disadvantage.         
	Young Unadkat returned the best figures for the Knights, claiming three for 26. But equally good were Bond (1/20), Dinda (2/24), Kartik (1/31) and Shukla (1/30). Bond was undoubtedly the best of the lot, with his brilliant blend of pace and accuracy.         
	The New Zealander, who was thought to be not good enough for a place in the XI in the last two matches, even managed a wicket-maiden (in the 15th over)  a rare distinction in this lethal format of the game.         
	With the semi-final hopes still lingering for KKR, let us just say  picture abhi baki hai mere dost!

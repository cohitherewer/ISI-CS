The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Ridder used resources well

     P.K. BANERJEE      -             
	When the Federation Cup final went to penalties, I thought it was Lajong FCs best chance to pip their fancied rivals. After all, Lajong coach Stanley Rozario has a history of winning through tiebreakers.         
	A few years ago, I can distinctly remember, Rozario led the Army XI to a historic triumph in Durand Cup by winning both the semis and the final on penalties against top teams like JCT and Sporting Clube de Goa.        
	Stanley wasnt third time lucky because of two reasons. First, East Bengal goalkeeper Abhra Mondal was in scintillating form throughout the tournament.         
	For a goalkeeper, who suffered the ignominy of standing under the bar in a 3-5 defeat against Mohun Bagan only a couple of months back, it isnt easy to make a comeback and finish a top-tier tournament without conceding a goal. Personally, I was overwhelmed to see the youngster saving three spot kicks in the final.        
	Another reason for Lajongs defeat was the absence of their two foreigners in the final. Over the past few years, clubs in India have become over dependent on foreigners and Lajong are no exceptions. With a capacity crowd cheering them on vociferously, it was Lajongs best chance to win the Federation Cup. But they failed to cash in.        
	All said and done, my heart goes out to Lajong. Their success in the Federation Cup once again proved the ability of footballers from the northeast to match the best in the country. All they need is the right platform to showcase their skills.         
	I must also congratulate the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for allowing the northeast teams to come up at the national level.        
	Credit should also go to East Bengal as they defied all odds to win the countrys premier knockout tournament. Not many were hopeful about their chances in Assam, especially after their pathetic performance in the IFA Shield and the Durand Cup.         
	While the addition of quality foreigners in the team has played a big part in their revival, Phillippe de Ridder also used his limited resources well to get the best out of them.         
	But then, the standard of football in the Federation Cup wasnt all that impressive. I watched most of the matches but there were not many enjoyable moments and the second semi-final between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan was no different.         
	East Bengal were definitely the grittier of the two sides in that match and that made a lot of difference.         
	Here, I would like to say a few things. A section of the people in Bagan said that had Jose Ramirez Barreto scored from the spot in the first half, it would have been a different story altogether. All I want to point out to them is that the match wasnt over after Barreto missed the penalty.        
	In the second half, East Bengal were the better team and the deserving winners at the end of 90 minutes.        
	I have a feeling that the results of the Federation Cup will have little impact on the I-League, resuming shortly.         
	With the addition of one more foreign player in each team, the strength of teams like Churchill Brothers and Bagan will go up. And I am also quite sure that Lajong would not be able continue their spectacular run once they are forced to play in away matches in places like Goa, Calcutta and Ludhiana.         
	In the end, I must congratulate one of my favourite coaches on the circuit, Sukhwinder Singh, for winning the SAFF Cup in Dhaka last month, that too with a bunch of inexperienced players.         
	I was particularly happy because only three years ago, he was booted out by the AIFF after levelling some wild charges against him.        
	In February, Sukhwinder will be taking the team to Colombo for the AFC Challenge Cup. It will be a task much tougher than the one he accomplished at the Dhaka meet.

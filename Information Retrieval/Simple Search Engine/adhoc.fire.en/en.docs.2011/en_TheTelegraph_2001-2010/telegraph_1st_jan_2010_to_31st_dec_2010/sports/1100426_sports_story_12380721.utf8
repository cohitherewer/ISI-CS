                                                                                                                       7                                      Italy storm into final
                      
	Rome: Fed Cup holders Italy easily dismissed the Czech Republic and stormed into another final on Sunday.         
	World No. 15 Flavia Pennetta, who has never threatened in the individual Grand Slams, displayed her special attachment to the team competition by defeating Petra Kvitova 7-6(3), 6-2 to give Italy an unassailable 3-0 lead in the World Group semi-final.         
	Sara Errani then beat Lucie Hradecka 6-4, 6-2 in a dead singles rubber before teaming up with Francesca Schiavone to hammer Hradecka and Kveta Peschke 6-2, 6-4 in the doubles to seal a 5-0 whitewash.         
	Italy, with no great tennis tradition, lifted the Fed Cup in 2006 and 2009 and have now reached four finals in five years.         
	Its an incredible emotion. We are again in the final and all the team are euphoric, Pennetta said courtside after her second singles win on Romes clay in two days.         
	Meanwhile, Russia draw level with the United States when Elena Dementieva won her match Saturday after Melanie Oudin won the opening singles.         
	Oudin gave the hosts a perfect start when she recorded a 6-3, 6-3 win over Alla Kudryavtseva before Dementieva levelled the tie, beating Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4 6-3, at the indoor hard court in Birmingham, which kept the players away from the storms battering Alabama.         
	In the playoffs, Yanina Wickmayer beat Maret Ani 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 Sunday to give injury-depleted Belgium an insurmountable 3-1 lead over Estonia and a place in next years World Group. Justine Henin came in as a replacement for the injured Kim Clijsters for Belgium but, playing with a broken finger, lost 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-3 to Kaia Kanepi.         
	In Belgrade, Bojana Jovanovski defeated Magdalena Rybarikova 6-1, 7-6 (4) Sunday for Serbia to level at 2-2 with Slovakia. Daniela Hantuchova had earlier defeated Jelena Jankovic 7-6 (2), 7-5 to give Slovakia a 2-1 lead.         
	France remained in the World Group by winning the last two matches for a 3-2 victory over Germany. Andrea Petkovic of Germany beat Aravane Rezai 6-1, 6-7 (2) before Pauline Parmentier leveled by defeating Julia Goerges 7-6 (2), 6-4, setting up a decisive doubles match on clay at Palmengarten.

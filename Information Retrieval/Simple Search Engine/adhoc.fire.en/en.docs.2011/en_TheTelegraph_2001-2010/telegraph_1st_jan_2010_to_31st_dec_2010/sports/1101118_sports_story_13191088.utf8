The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Power cut leaves stars stranded
                                                                                                                       7                                      Power cut leaves stars stranded
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Salt Lake Stadium once again left us in the dark. Literally. Minutes after Bayern Munich All Stars XI captain Paul Breitner completed his post-match news conference and was walking back to the dressing room, the aisle plunged into darkness.         
	He almost banged his head against the wall. And in the dressing room one of the camera bulbs was switched on so that we could change. And when we were discussing about the alternatives, luckily the power came back. But those 10 minutes were really horrifying, a Bayern source revealed on Wednesday.         
	An official of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, though, said that there was two-minute power failure due to a technical glitch. Normalcy was restored soon, the official added.         
	Power failure at the Salt Lake Stadium is nothing surprising. The most famous, of course, was the power failure during a World Cup qualifier between India and Japan in 2004.

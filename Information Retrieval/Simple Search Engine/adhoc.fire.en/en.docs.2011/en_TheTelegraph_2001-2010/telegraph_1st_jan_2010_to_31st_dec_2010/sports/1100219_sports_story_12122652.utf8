The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith out of ODI series
                                                                                                                       7                                      Smith out of ODI series
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith will be flying back home late on Thursday night.         
	Smith, who played the second Test at the Eden Gardens with a fracture in the little finger of his left hand, has been advised 10 days of rest. This automatically rules Smith out of the three-match ODI series against India starting from February 21 in Jaipur. He sustained the fracture during fielding practice a couple of days before the Test match.         
	Smith has been advised rest by the doctor. He will take 10 days time to recuperate which rules him out of the one-day series. Jacques Kallis will be leading the team in the ODI series in Smiths absence, South Africas media manager Michael Owen-Smith said on Thursday.         
	However, the team management has decided against flying in a replacement for Smith. Hashim Amla, who has been in stupendous form in the current Test series, will be staying back for the one-dayers.         
	Amla has played 22 ODIs, scoring 848 runs at an average of 47.11, with one century and six half centuries.

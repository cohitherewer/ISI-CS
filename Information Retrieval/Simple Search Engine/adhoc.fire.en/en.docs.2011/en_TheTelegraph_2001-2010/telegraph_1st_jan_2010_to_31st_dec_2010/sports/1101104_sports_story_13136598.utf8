	New Delhi: Midfielder Amandeep Singhs brilliant goal off a counter attack in the 100th minute took JCT to the final of the Durand Cup, at the Ambedkar Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	In a match that was extended to extra time after a goalless draw in the regulation time, the Phagwara side was lucky to scrape past the last three years finalists Churchill Brothers 1-0 as the Goan team missed several chances in the later part of the second half.         
	The good number of JCT fans, who were present in the stands, danced in joy as their favourite team made the final after four years. On Sunday, JCT will take on the winners of East Bengal and Chirag United in the first Bengal-Punjab final since 1993.         
	Amandeep, who had a good day in office, was quick enough to grab the ball off a long clearance and then covered a considerable distance before chipping the ball over an advancing goalkeeper Vinay Singh.         
	The hero of the day, however, was the Punjab team goalkeeper Pawan Kumar, who made some incredible saves to keep JCT in the match. He was under immense pressure in the second half but never lost his courage to foil the Churchill attackers.         
	Two of Pawans saves were exceptional. Once he dived on the left to block an Odafe free kick from just outside the box that was curling in with great speed.

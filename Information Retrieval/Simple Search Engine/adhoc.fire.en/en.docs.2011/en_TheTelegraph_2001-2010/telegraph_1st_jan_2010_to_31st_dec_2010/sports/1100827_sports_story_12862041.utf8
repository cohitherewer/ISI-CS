The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | OC bails out IWF
                                                                                                                       7                                      OC bails out IWF
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games released $375,000, on Thursday, for Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) to pay fine to the international body for doping offences. This gesture cleared the deck for the weightlifters to take part in the Games. Last year, the IWF was slapped with a fine of $500,000 after six weightlifters failed dope tests.         
	IWF managed to pay $125,000, but then appealed to the government and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to dole out the rest of the amount. After the IOA refused help, the ministry of sports directed the OC to bail out IWF.         
	IWF secretary-general Sahdev Yadav, who collected the cheque from the OC office, said I have collected a cheque worth Rs 1.75 crore from the OC. It is a good news for the lifters. We will try to pay the fine at the earliest, so that our weightlifters can participate in the Games, he said.

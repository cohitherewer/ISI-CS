The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger, Serena to start favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                        Roger, Serena to start favourites
                  Justine Henin on Sunday                     
	Melbourne: Roger Federer has done everything necessary to etch his name in the annals of tennis immortality and all that remains for the Swiss world No. 1 is to add more Grand Slams to his remarkable tally of 15.         
	His biggest challenge now is to maintain his motivation and while Federer insists he remains as keen as ever, the Australian Open could provide the first real glimpse into what lies ahead for his opponents. By his own lofty standards, his early season form has been patchy. He was beaten by Swede Robin Soderling, for the first time, in Abu Dhabi then lost to Russias Nikolay Davydenko in Qatar Open.         
	Despite his uncertain build-up, Federer remains the pre-tournament favourite. After all, he has made the final of 17 of the last 18 Grand Slams, dating back to Wimbledon in 2005.         
	However, he was beaten in last years Australian Open final by Rafael Nadal in a five-set classic and the Spaniard once again looms as his biggest obstacle.         
	Serbias Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open in 2008 to emerge as the most likely challenger to the Federer-Nadal duopoly but has failed to reach any Slam final since. A new challenger emerged last year in the shape of Juan Martin del Potro, the giant Argentine who won the US Open, beating Federer in the final.         
	Others in the fray are Andy Roddick and Andy Murray.         
	The return of Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin to the Australian Open has added even more spice to a womens tournament already overflowing with talent.         
	There is always an element of mystery attached to the first Slam of the year but the reappearance of the three former world No. 1s has ensured this years tournament will be one of the most open in years.         
	Serena Williams is the favourite and understandably so. She is the current world No.1, the defending champion and one of the few players who thrive in the scorching Australian summer heat.         
	Serena has won at Melbourne Park four times but if she is to make it five she will have to interrupt a winning sequence that has seen her take the title in alternate years since 2003.         
	It is no surprise that she has flagged her older sister Venus as her biggest threat but the Russians and Belgians present a more formidable challenge.         
	Three of the worlds top five are Russian and there are five in the top 15 including Sharapova, who has dropped back to 14 after a shoulder injury that prevented her from defending the Australian Open title she won in 2008.         
	However, the most intriguing twist is the return of the Belgian pair, Clijsters and Henin, who played each other in the 2004 Australian Open final.         
	Among the Indians, Sania Mirza would look to improve on her third round appearance while Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi would target the only title missing from their Slam kitty when they compete.         
	Sania will yet again hold the Indian interest in the singles at the first Grand Slam of the season. The Hyderabadi will open her campaign against world No. 27 and 26th seed Aravane Rezai of France in the first round Monday.(Agencies)

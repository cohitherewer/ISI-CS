The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Enjoyed every session: Mithun
                                                                                                                       7                                      Enjoyed every session: Mithun
            A CORRESPONDENT                            Abhimanyu Mithun      
	For the 20-year-old Abhimanyu Mithun, it is, so far, a debut which he wont forget in a hurry. Grabbing four wickets in his first Test is by no means an easy feat and the Karnataka speedster did just that with figures of four for 145, in the first Test, against Sri Lanka, in Galle.         
	Speaking to the mediapersons after the match, Mithun said that he wasnt under any pressure and was busy enjoying the experience. He also said that starting early in his career will help him gain ground.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his debut         
	It was a great feeling playing with great players. Before the start of the match, the senior players spoke to me and said everyone has some sort of pressure To not think of it as pressure and to just enjoy the moment. So I was enjoying every session.         
	His preparations         
	When I was with the team during the home Test series against South Africa, it was a good experience to see the bowlers in action I understood the difference between international and domestic cricket. I have kept working on that in the interim. My state coach Sanath Kumar helped me a lot during my initial days.         
	Gary Kirstens tips         
	Gary and Eric Simons told us to keep bowling in good areas, to back yourself and today (Tuesday), the wicket had some help for the faster bowlers It (the ball) was moving till lunch, so it was good for us. We tried to make the batsmen play by bowling up to them. It was a good challenge. On the first day, the pitch was not doing much.         
	His journey so far         
	Its not like a fairytale. I never had any ambition to play for India. Since I started playing cricket, I used to just tell myself that I have to play my best and try to make a name for myself and I ended up playing for India. In the junior level, I used to play with tennis ball. Later when I turned 17, I started bowling with leather ball. Its good for me to start early as a fast bowler. Usually when a fast bowler starts his career, he bowls a lot in the junior level and, by the time they break through, they are a little different. It was good for me to start playing for India so early in the career.         
	The wicket he cherished         
	The first wicket was the most enjoyable. I was feeling very happy. I wanted to give my best.         
	On what he will do to keep up the good work         
	I will think of myself, what I should do and how I should work. I have the confidence to be myself I will work on my strengths and not think about anything else. I wont be satisfied. If we can bat out the match, it will be good for the team. Its about the team and not individuals.         
	On the teams plans         
	We have good batting depth and so we will play as much as we can and try and win the sessions.

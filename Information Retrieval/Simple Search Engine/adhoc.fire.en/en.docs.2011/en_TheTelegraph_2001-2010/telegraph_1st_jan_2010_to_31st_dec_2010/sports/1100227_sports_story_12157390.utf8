            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In Indian cricket, two former India captains locking horns in the domestic circuit is as rare as a hens teeth.         
	But Vadodara, on Sunday, will be witness to such a welcome change when Sourav Ganguly in Bengal colours face the Rahul Dravid-led Karnataka in the Vijay Hazare Trophy semi-final at the Motibagh Palace Ground.         
	Bengal did register a resounding nine-wicket victory over Saurashtra in the quarters, but against Karnataka it would be a different story altogether.         
	Karnataka, Ranji Trophy finalists this season, are loaded with a number of former, current and prospective India players. Besides Dravid, Robin Uthappa, Manish Pandey and R Vinay Kumar are the ones who hand Karnataka the definite edge.         
	But Shukla chose to approach the challenge with the composure expected of a captain. They are a very good side But then you cant expect a weak side in the semi-finals of a national tournament. We have some plans and lets see how it goes, he said. However, with his batsmen enjoying a decent form with the willow, Shukla shouldnt worry much.         
	With Manoj Tiwary, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and the captain himself to follow, the scoreboard shouldnt be in tatters. We are playing good cricket. We will, in all probability, go with the same XI But I would like to take a final call tomorrow, Shukla said.         
	If the captain opts for the same team, then pacers Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda, and off-spinner Saurasish Lahiri would be the specialist bowlers with Shukla, Sourav and Arnab Nandi being the part-time options.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Kumar Sangakkara feels it is possible for the team bowling second to win, if you can put up a good total and bowl a disciplined line. Nothing is impossible, the Sri Lankan captain told a press conference Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	His thoughts on the final         
	Were thinking of doing the best we can do. We are preparing ourselves for the challenge.         
	If another run feast is on the cards         
	Weve got to play and see Im not in favour of making any predictions. Were going in with a fresh mindset.         
	On the chances of the side bowling second winning         
	Im sure it can be done Nothing is impossible. If you get a good total and bowl a disciplined line in the evening, you can win.         
	What should be a good total?         
	Anything over 270/280 should be good.         
	The dew         
	Yes, dew is a problem and we know that. Once you know its a problem, youve got to try and overcome it.         
	The importance of Virender Sehwag         
	It all depends on how he performs on the day. If he doesnt do well, it will be good for us.         
	Virat Kohlis batting and the Lankan strategy for him         
	Yeah, hes batting well and we should try not to bowl to his strengths... Bowl more to the field that we set.         
	Performance in the last match against India         
	It was a bad performance A game weve got to try and forget, but also learn from... Well start afresh tomorrow (Wednesday).         
	On the youngsters         
	Its been a nice opportunity to give the young guys some games. They deserved it. Nice to see them perform and prove that they are hungry We hope these guys will push everyone in the side and give all a run for their money.         
	If Suraj Randiv is challenging Muralidharan for a place in the ODI team         
	Hes pushing for a permanent place in the one-day side beyond doubt. But Murali is Murali, you cant compare him with anyone. Once Murali is back, it would be exciting to see these guys playing together if we can manage that.         
	Shakib-al Hasans comment that India win more because of individual brilliance         
	It depends. If you talk about individual brilliance in the teams winning context, I always believe its better to score 10 runs and win rather than score a 100 and lose. Its always about supporting each other and making sure everyone is ready to perform. We have fifteen guys on the tour. We win and lose together.

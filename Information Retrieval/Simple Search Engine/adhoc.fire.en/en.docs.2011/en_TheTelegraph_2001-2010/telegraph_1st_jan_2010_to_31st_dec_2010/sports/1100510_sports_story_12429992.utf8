                                                                                                                       7                                        Aviks triumph of life
            A STAFF REPORTER            Avik Chowdhury at the city airport, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The wide grin said it all. It was one of the most wonderful feelings to watch Avik Chowdhury come out of the domestic terminal of the Netaji Subhas International Airport on Sunday morning.         
	Yes he was on a wheelchair, which bore testimony to the life-threatening car accident last October, but the fresh look on his face suggested he was much better.         
	For those who saw the talented Bengal all-rounder on a ventilator in the days immediately following the accident, it was witnessing a triumph of a different kind. Someone tried to help him into the car, but Avik declined. Leave me, I can get in on my own, he said.         
	Perhaps there couldnt have been a more endearing sight than this. A defining moment that showed the 25-year-olds will power. During his short career for Bengal, it was his sincerity that always came to the fore, even more than his talent.         
	It is the same courage that saw him go through an intense rehabilitation program at the Indian Institute of Spinal Injuries (IISI) in New Delhi over the last six months. Such has been the improvement that Avik is now able to walk a little, with the help of a walker.         
	I have been through an intense rehab programme, which will continue. I will be joining office after sometime, he told The Telegraph, at his residence in Subhas Nagar.         
	So impressed were the doctors by his improvement that he was considered a role model for paralytic patients at the IISI. I was told to deliver lectures at various seminars on paralysis but I declined. Yes, I did appear in a promotional on the importance of using airbags in cars, he smiled.         
	Ask him about his current plans and his reply will come as a pleasant surprise. I dont know when I will make a comeback on the field. As of now, I will be concentrating on taking the Civil Services exams. It is very tough but I am ready to study hard. You get four attempts and my aim would be to at least make the Indian Revenue Services (IRS), said Avik, who currently works as a tax assistant in the Income Tax department.         
	His parents, Basu and Sushmita Chowdhury, feel it was their sons mental strength that made all the difference.         
	During our stay in Delhi, he would speak about nothing else but his rehabilitation programme. Even his doctor, H.S. Chhabra, praised his mental toughness which has helped him recover faster than one could ever imagine, his father said.         
	The Chowdhurys thanked the Cricket Association of Bengal, the state government and the I-T department for financial help.         
	Which was the toughest period for the mother in the last six months? Today, pat came the reply. During security checks at the New Delhi airport, officials asked him why he needed to use a wheelchair? I was about to answer but Avik stopped me and said, because, I am a paralytic patient She broke down. But those were tears of joy.         
	The story is not about cricket. Its about someones journey back to life.

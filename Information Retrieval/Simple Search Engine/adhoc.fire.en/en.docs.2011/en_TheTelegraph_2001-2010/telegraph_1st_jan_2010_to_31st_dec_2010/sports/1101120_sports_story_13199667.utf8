The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India set to lose rating points
                                                                                                                       7                                      India set to lose rating points
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias lacklustre show against New Zealand, in the first two Tests of the three match series, will cost them a drop in the ratings points in the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings for Test teams, irrespective of how the third Test in Nagpur pans out.         
	India, ranked No. 1, had entered the series leading No. 8 New Zealand by 52 ratings points. This gap meant that Mahendra Singh Dhonis side were expected to win the series convincingly. As such, because the rankings are weighed to reflect this difference, Indias failure to win the opening two Tests means they will now drop points.         
	If India win the Test, they will concede one rating point and will slip to 129 ratings points while New Zealand will rise to 80 ratings points after gaining two ratings points. However, if New Zealand win the third Test and the series 1-0, they will earn nine ratings points which will take them to 87 ratings points while India will drop to 124 ratings points after losing six ratings points.         
	In case of a drawn series, India will drop four ratings points while New Zealand will pocket five ratings points.         
	Meanwhile, Chris Gayle, after his triple century in the first Test against Sri Lanka, rocketed into the top-10 for the first time in his career. His 333 lifted the Jamaican from 21st to the No. 10 position in the latest rankings for Test batsmen.

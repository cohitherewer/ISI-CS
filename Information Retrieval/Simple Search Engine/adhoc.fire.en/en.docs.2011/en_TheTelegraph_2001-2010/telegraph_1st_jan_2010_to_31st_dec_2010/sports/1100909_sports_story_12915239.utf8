  - Italy, England keep slate clean; Portugal stumble             Action during the France-Bosnia match, in Sarajevo, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	London: Two late goals from Karim Benzema and Florent Malouda gave France their first win in six competitive matches and kick-started their Euro 2012 qualifying campaign when they beat Bosnia 2-0 on Tuesday.         
	Traditional powerhouses Italy, Germany, England and World Cup runners-up Netherlands all maintained their perfect starts with the goals flowing as they seek to seal their places in the finals in Poland and Ukraine in 2012.         
	Italy crushed Faroe Islands 5-0, Germany blasted Azerbaijan, managed by former West Germanys World Cup winner Berti Vogts, 6-1, England won 3-1 in Switzerland and the Dutch saw off Finland 2-1 with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring both their goals.         
	Sweden also hit the goal trail with a 6-0 win over San Marino but Portugal, struggling without suspended coach Carlos Queiroz and the injured Cristiano Ronaldo, continued to stumble.         
	After drawing 4-4 with Cyprus in their opening qualifier on Friday, Portugal crashed to a 0-1 defeat against Norway in Oslo and they are now second-bottom of Group H ahead of traditional no-hopers Iceland who were beaten 1-0 by Denmark.         
	There was a thriller in Istanbul where Turkey and Belgium traded the lead before the Turks won 3-2 to maintain their perfect start in Group A.         
	Russia were stunned in Moscow where Slovakia secured a 1-0 victory thanks to a first-half goal from Miroslav Stoch.         
	Scotland, facing one of the worst results in their long international history, salvaged their respect and all three points with a 97th minute winner from Stephen McManus who headed home a corner in the last few seconds of stoppage time.         
	Former World champions Italy, whose World Cup also ended in a group stage exit like France, struggled to win their opening qualifier in Estonia on Friday but had no problems on Tuesday.         
	Five players got on the scoresheet against the Faroe Islands in Florence -- Alberto Gilardino (11th minute), Daniele De Rossi (22), Antonio Cassano (27), Fabio Quagliarella (80) and Andrea Pirlo (89).         
	Germany were also in no mood to show mercy to outclassed opponents and one of their great soccer heroes Vogts, who is now in charge of Azerbaijan.         
	Miroslav Klose scored twice to take his tally to 55 goals for Germany in his 103rd international, while Lukas Podolski showed a welcome return to form as Germany went top of Group A on goal difference ahead of Turkey.         
	England, also seeking redemption after a poor World Cup, followed up last weeks 4-0 win over Bulgaria in London with an excellent 3-1 victory over Switzerland in Basle.         
	Wayne Rooney, who has had stoires about his private life splashed all over the tabloids in Britain, scored Englands opener and his first goal for his country for a year.         
	Adam Johnson and Darren Bent, with his first England goal, adding the others against the Swiss who finished with 10 men following the second half dismissal of Stephan Lichsteiner.         
	Bulgaria, who lost to England on Friday, were defeated again, going down 1-0 at home to Montenegro with coach Stanimir Stoilov becoming the first coaching casualty of the campaign by resigning immediately after the game.

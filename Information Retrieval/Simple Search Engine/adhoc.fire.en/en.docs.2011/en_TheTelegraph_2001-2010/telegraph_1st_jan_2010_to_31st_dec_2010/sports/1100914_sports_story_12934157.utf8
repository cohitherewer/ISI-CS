The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi lashes out at Irfan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi lashes out at Irfan
                                  Mohammed Irfan		    
	Leeds: Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi called for the Decision Review System (DRS) to be introduced in ODIs as well but saved his strongest criticism for lanky pacer Mohammed Irfan after another loss to England.         
	In what turned out to be a tense finish, England won the second ODI, on Sunday, by four wickets with three balls to spare as they went 2-0 up in their five-match series against Pakistan.         
	But the result might have been different had not 7ft seamer Irfan, positioned at short fine leg, dropped a glance from Andrew Strauss when the England captain had made just 23.         
	It was a costly error with Strauss went on to make 126 as England, replying to Pakistans 294 for eight, finished on 295 for six.         
	Strauss also appeared to be given another reprieve on 38 when wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, changing direction and diving full length to his right, held what he thought was a one-handed catch off fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. But the DRS, increasingly common in Test cricket, is yet to be introduced into the ODI format and Pakistan were unable to challenge West Indian umpire Billy Doctroves not out verdict.         
	Afridi, asked if DRS should feature in ODIs, replied: It will be good in matches like this and big series like this. Its important in cricket now. I know in Twenty20 you dont have much time but in one-day cricket you would.         
	But Strauss said: I wasnt sure it hit my glove. The umpires are there to make a decision. Any thoughts about DRS in one-day cricket would have been stilled if Irfan had caught Strauss.         
	Poor fielding has plagued Pakistan for several years and Afridis patience is clearly at an end.         
	Im really disappointed with this guy (Irfan), he said. Cricket is not all about just batting and bowling, nowadays fielding is very important. Maybe if he is good in the field, I will give him a chance, otherwise I am not happy with his performance.         
	But Pakistan, with Kamran Akmal making 74 and Asad Shafiq a maiden fifty, at least ran England close.         
	Im quite happy, the boys put in some effort. We have three more games and definitely we will get a result (win), Afridi added.         
	Pakistans tour of Britain has been overshadowed by newspaper allegations of a spot-fixing scandal that saw no-balls deliberately bowled in the fourth Test against England at Lords last month.         
	The claims, published in the News of the World, led to the suspension of Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif by the ICC.         
	But the Pakistan supporters in a capacity 18,500 crowd got behind their side and there was no jeering by England fans.         
	Afridi said he hoped the support would be maintained during the remaining three matches of this series, which continues at The Oval, on Friday, before moving across London to Lords, a week on Sunday, before finishing at Hampshires Rose Bowl, on September 22.         
	Its a very great sign and we are expecting more fans in London and Hampshire as well. If we play cricket at this level, definitely the crowd will come and they will enjoy the game, he said.         
	Man-of-the-match Strauss has opted out of Twenty20 internationals and his worth as a one-day batsman has been questioned by several pundits. But the left-handed opener, after scoring his second one-day century in three matches, said: Ive worked very hard on trying to expand my game a little bit. Im very happy with my game at the moment, and even happier that were continuing to win. All I can do is do my talking with the bat and help England win cricket matches.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Pretoria: The big crowd gathered outside the High Performance Centre (HPC) on Wednesday evening was waited more than half-an-hour for the gates to open. Inside, the Argentina team were practising and coach Diego Maradona had left strict instructions that people were to be ushered in only 15 minutes before the end of the training session.         
	Waiting in the mass of mediapersons and curious onlookers was Henk Ten Cate, one of the coaches who played a crucial role in shaping Lionel Messis career at Barcelona.         
	I have come to meet Messi, Ten Cate said. He was a little kid when I was coaching in Barcelona. I have seen him grow. He had the game in him from the very beginning. I am not surprised that he has reached this level.         
	Neither was he too worried that Messi has failed to score so far in South Africa.         
	I am not too bothered that Messi hasnt scored so far in this World Cup, Ten Cate said. What bothers me is the supervision. The refereeing has been lacklustre so far. Players like Messi should be protected from being fouled again and again. People come to watch players like Messi, not others.

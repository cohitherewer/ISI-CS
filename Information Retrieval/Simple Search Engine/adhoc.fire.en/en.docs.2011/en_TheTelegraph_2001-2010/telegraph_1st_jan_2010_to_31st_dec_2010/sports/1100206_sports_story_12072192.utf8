	Melbourne: Australia pipped Pakistan by two runs in a T20 International at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to complete a clean sweep.         
	Shaun Tait was the star for Australia as he bowled the fastest ball ever recorded in Australia and grabbed three for 13 including the key wicket of Kamran Akmal, who had threatened to end Australias streak with his highest T20 score.         
	According to cricinfo, Australia opting to bat first could manage only 127 but then restricted Pakistan to 125 for nine 20 overs to win the match.

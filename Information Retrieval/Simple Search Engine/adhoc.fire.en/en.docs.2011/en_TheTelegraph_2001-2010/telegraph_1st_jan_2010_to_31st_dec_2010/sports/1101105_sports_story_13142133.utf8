            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Wasim Jaffer after his century, on Thursday                           
	Mumbai: Wasim Jaffer collected his second century of the match and Mumbai pocketed three vital points in the drawn Ranji Trophy Super League tie, against Saurashtra, on Thursday.         
	Jaffer, who made 138 in the first innings, remained unbeaten on 103 as Mumbai reached 207 for two in their second essay after scuttling out the visitors for 374, on the fourth and final day.         
	Rohit Sharma was the other not out batsman on 74.         
	However, Jaffer was not too happy about the nature of the wicket. The team management has conveyed to the (Mumbai Cricket) Association about the nature of the wicket. If there is no pace in the wicket, there would be no result in four days, said Jaffer, less enthused despite his 41st first-class hundred.         
	We needed more than 120 overs to bowl them out in the first innings Chances of getting them out in 75 overs were not much on this track. And the scheduling is such that teams need to preserve their fast bowers, he explained on not enforcing the follow-on.         
	Saurashtra, overnight 364 for seven, folded up in less than an hour on the final morning. Avishkar Salvi (3/57) and Iqbal Abdulla removed the last three batsmen for the addition of 10 runs, leaving centurion Pratik Mehta stranded on 107.         
	With the dusty BKC-MCA ground track anything but an inspiration for taking 10 wickets, the hosts chose for some batting practice. From there on, things became a formality.         
	In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh earned three points by virtue of a 74-run first innings lead against Punjab in their Group B match that ended in a draw.

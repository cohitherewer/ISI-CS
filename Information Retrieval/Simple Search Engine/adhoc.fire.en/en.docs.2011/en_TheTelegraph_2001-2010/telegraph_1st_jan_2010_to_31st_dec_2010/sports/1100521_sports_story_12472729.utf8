The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pragyan keen to make a mark
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pragyan keen to make a mark
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Pragyan Ojha is keen to do well when he visits Zimbabwe later this month.         
	The 23-year-old left-arm spinner tied the knot with Karabee Kailash, a Ph.D student in bio-chemistry, in his hometown Bhubaneswar last week. But instead of getting away to an exotic locale with his beloved, Ojha was back in the nets, honing his skills in the heat and dust of the maidan.         
	And rightly so. The upcoming tour in Zimbabwe, where the Indian team is scheduled to play a tri-series and two T20 Internationals, presents an opportunity for the youngster to establish himself as the second specialist spinner after Harbhajan Singh.         
	I have been practising for the last two days with the Hyderabad Ranji Trophy team that is having a summer camp. This tour is very important for me. I did well in the IPL and if I do well on this tour, it will be a big positive for me, Ojha told The Telegraph.         
	Not even the politico-economic crisis that Zimbabwe has plunged into in recent years perturbs him. I have been to Zimbabwe before (with the India A team in 2007). So I know what to expect. The situation there doesnt matter to me. When you are playing for the country, you have to be focused on the game and filter out other things, he said.         
	To cement his place in the Indian team, Ojha has to contend with leg-spinner Amit Mishra, who would also be in the touring party. As a professional one has to fight for the place. But off the field, we have been very friendly. We discuss a lot about the game, he said of his friend and rival.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sandeep: Goals vs Pak worth more
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sandeep: Goals vs Pak worth more
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Sandeep Singh after one of his goals, on Sunday        
	New Delhi: Anuj Srivastava, 49, and a father of two, had his voice trembling with emotion. Twenty-eight years ago, he had travelled in a rickety bus from Meerut to watch India play Pakistan in the Asian Games final at the National Stadium only to return home deeply humiliated after a 1-7 drubbing of the hosts.         
	I have rarely watched a hockey match after that, said Srivastava, after India outclassed Pakistan 4-1 in their World Cup opener on Sunday. I came because my eldest son wanted to. Now I really feel lucky to be present here tonight.         
	Srivastava was not the only one feeling overwhelmed; for the majority of the 15,000-strong crowd, it was a night of redemption as they savoured one of Indias most memorable wins in recent times. The choc-a-block Dhyan Chand Stadium witnessed a premature Holi as a wave of colourful patriotism swept through the stands.         
	Memories of Indian hockey in its pristine glory were rekindled and aficionados were relieved to see that an Indo-Pak hockey encounter had lost none of its charm.         
	This was surely a great win, one of the finest I have seen, said Zafar Iqbal, the captain in the 1982 Asian Games final.         
	Our team played like a well-oiled machine. They never allowed the Pakistanis to get a grip in the match, said Zafar. If they can continue in the same vein, this is surely going to be a great World Cup for India.         
	Pakistan had beaten India 6-3 recently, in the Champions Challenge in Argentina, and the spectators initially were not too sure about Indias chances on Sunday. As the hundred odd Pakistan fans cheered their team from the stands at the High Court end, the home supporters appeared a bit subdued.         
	But all hell broke lose once Shivendra Singh put India ahead in the 27th minute with a delicate flick after Sandeep Singhs penalty corner had ricocheted off Pakistan goalkeeper Salman Akars pads. The celebrations that followed reached a crescendo when Sandeep increased the lead a few seconds before the break.         
	India did get caught on the wrong foot on a few occasions in the second session but not before they had pumped in two more goals through Prabhjot Singh and the indomitable Sandeep. Pakistan earned a series of penalty corners during this period but the battle, as the rivals from across the border became painfully aware of, was already over.         
	I am happy to have scored twice and helped the team win, An elated Sandeep said. Scoring against Pakistan always gives you extra pleasure. It is a great feeling but we have a tough match against Australia on Tuesday. Australia are a very strong side though they lost to England. We have a job at hand.         
	Sohail Abbas did pull one back through a penalty corner but even the Pakistan fans were not too impressed.         
	Balbir Singh (Senior), the manager of the Indian team that won the World Cup in 1975, was at a loss for words to describe his utter delight. The Indian team played like a single unit. They looked capable of beating any team in the world, leave alone Pakistan, he said.         
	In the end, hockey was the biggest winner. Despite the traditional rivals fighting it out in a high-octane match, there was no sign of any acrimony. If the players from either side displayed admirable sportsman spirit, the partisan crowd, too, refrained from barracking the visitors, which they often have in the past.         
	Pressure was definitely there, but it was a good match, said Pakistan coach Shahid Ali Khan. The Indian team need to be congratulated. They played tremendous hockey and definitely deserved this victory, he added.         
	Surprisingly, Spanish coach Jose Brasa, the man credited with Indias turnaround, remained least impressed. It was a fine win, but thats all. This is a kind of tournament where you have to play well for at least a fortnight to achieve the target. The victory against Pakistan was definitely a morale booster but nothing more than that.         
	We played a match today and won 4-1. I am happy. Thats all, said the national coach.         
	Meanwhile, in Sundays other matches, European champions England defeated Australia 3-1 and Spain outclassed South Africa 4-2.

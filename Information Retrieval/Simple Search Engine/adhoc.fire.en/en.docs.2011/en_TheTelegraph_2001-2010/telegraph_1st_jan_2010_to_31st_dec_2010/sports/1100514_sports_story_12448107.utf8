The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumi not sorry for   Monaco misdeed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Schumi not sorry for   Monaco misdeed
            Kevin Eason                            
	Monaco: Fernando Alonso, the Ferrari driver, may have forgiven and almost forgotten but Michael Schumacher is unrepentant about the last of his notorious acts in Formula One.         
	It was here in the Germans final qualifying session before his retirement in 2006 that Schumacher deliberately parked his Ferrari at the tight Rascasse hairpin in an effort to stop Alonso, who was following close behind, claiming pole position.         
	The howls of derision were deafening at such a clumsy act of cheating and Schumacher was sent by race stewards to the back of the grid in shame, while Alonso, then at Renault, recorded his first Monaco victory.         
	Schumacher was yards from the scene of the crime on Wednesday as preparations got under way for his first Monaco Grand Prix since coming back from three years of retirement and the events of that day burnt bright in the memories of those who were witnesses.         
	Yet, at 41 and as the most senior driver in Formula One, Schumacher refused to acknowledge his role in what amounted to a desperate embarrassment for the sport.         
	He could not be drawn to say the one word that Formula One would have been delighted to hear: Sorry.         
	Instead, he batted away questions and labelled one of his inquisitors boring for wanting to know whether the seven-time world champion regretted yet another incident that tarnished a great career. Ask as much as you want, but I am moving on, he said.         
	Alonso, who won the World Championship that year, had to think about which incident was being referred to, but as his memory was refreshed he decided he had forgiven his old foe, although possibly because he was used to Schumachers tendency to bend the rules.         
	There is nothing to think about, he said. It was something that happened in other races. There were other incidents. This was another one and the stewards studied the situation and on Sunday they changed the grid order and thats all.         
	This happened every year and in 2006 it happened here but it happened in other places.         
	Keke Rosberg, the 1982 world champion, said at the time of the incident: For me, he [Schumacher] is a scumbag. He should stop in Formula One because it hurts our sport.         
	Schumacher did stop at the end of the season but four years after retiring, he is back and, by one of those great ironies, is teammate at Mercedes to Nico Rosberg, Kekes son. Rosberg Jr is not keen to stoke the fires again.         
	I have talked with Michael, he said. It is water under the bridge now.         
	But the incident remains one of the more notorious of Schumachers long career and more than one fan will be reminded of his parking episode at one of Monacos most famous corners when qualifying for this years race starts on Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | MISSION CHINA
                                                                                                                       7                                        MISSION CHINA
            As the clock ticks before the start of the 16th Asian Games, today, The Telegraph takes a look at the shoulders that carry the onus to win big, the faces expected to preserve our national pride and those who may create history              Saina Gagan                       
	India will have a strong presence at the Guangzhou Asian Games that start on Friday.         
	At the last count, Indias strength was 843, yet someone seemed missing. That missing link is Jaspal Rana whose worth, at least at the Asian Games, should be measured in gold.         
	At the last Asian Games in Doha, the ace pistol shooter came up with an amazing performance as he singularly accounted for three of Indias 10 gold medals .         
	With Rana virtually into retirement mode, no one is quite sure who would lead Indias medal charge at Guangzhou, though the shooters, as evident in the Commonwealth Games, are expected to bag the largest chunk. Overall, India won 53 medals in Doha and the tally is expected to be marginally better, with the gold count standing between 12 and 15 in 35 disciplines.                   Abhinav Bindra            Suranjoy Singh            Dola Banerjee            Pankaj Advani            Sania Mirza      
	The Sports Authority of India (SAI), however, has carried out their own analysis and projected a total tally of 74 to 108 medals, something that appears to be an impractical proposition. In fact, if India manage to get the higher tally that is being expected, it would exceed the number of medals won by India at the last two Games put together.         
	Shooters would once again be Indias chief medal earners with the fans eagerly waiting for Gagan Narang to do a Rana act in rifle events despite the presence of the Chinese. The battle for supremacy in the 10-metre air rifle should remain confined to Narang and Indias only Olympic gold medallist, Abhinav Bindra.         
	Narang, however, is also a gold medal prospect in 50-metre prone and 3-position events. And if the Hyderabad boy fails in his endeavour, Sanjeev Rajput can be trusted to do the needful. In Rajput and pistol shooter Vijay Kumar, India have two prospective champions at Guangzhou.         
	National coach Sunny Thomas is also confident of Indias good showings in the trap events. quot;Watch out for Ronjan (Sodhi) and Manavjit (Singh). They are capable of delivering the goods. quot;         
	True, no other sport in India has abundance of talent like shooting, but athletics, too, can fetch India a rich haul of medals. If the women quartet are the brightest hopes of retaining the gold in the 4x400 metres relay, Mandeep and Manjit should also be able to showcase their individual brilliance in 400m.         
	In triple jump, Renjith Maheshwari (17.07) is a big hope for podium finish though Kazakhstans Roman Valiyev and Li Yanxi of China have the ability to topple the entire field.         
	The hard work that was put in by the athletes before the Commonwealth Games should be showing at the Asian Games, said a SAI coach. At the same time, it could also go against the Indians as they had already picked for the CWG. It is not always easy to get the best out of you twice in a short span, that, too, at the end of the season, he said.         
	The focus will also be on Tintu Luka in 800 metres and shot putter Om Prakash Singh despite their disappointing shows in the CWG. Since Luka has broken the two-minute barrier, she should win a medal unless she commits a huge mistake. But then, if Bahrains Maryam Yusuf Jamal once again decides to take part in 800 metres, all other competitors would be forced to take a backseat.         
	Medals should also trickle in for India in kabaddi, chess, tennis, boxing, wrestling, cue sport, rowing, 6-red snooker and even in gymnastics where Ashish Kumar came up with a stunning performance in the CWG. In cue sport, however, the new frame format could prove to be a handicap for legendary players like Geet Sethi and Pankaj Advani.         
	The talent pool in Indian chess runs so deep that they should manage without Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy, the girl who bagged gold in Doha. With K. Sasikiran, P. Hari Krishna and Surya Sekhar Ganguly, India would still be a formidable force in Guangzhou.         
	Stars like Sania Mirza, Sethi and Advani, who brought India a handful of gold medals in Doha, are likely to do an encore. But there are several first timers in boxing and wrestling, who could also hit the headlines in the next 15 days.         
	Dont forget about Suranjoy Singh, he is going to create history, said an upbeat chief boxing coach G.S.Sandhu before leaving for Guangzhou. If the Manipur boy can clinch the 51kg gold medal, as he did in the Asian championships and the CWG, Manoj Kumar (64kg) is also in line to create history. Then there is Mary Kom, the five-time world champion, who has finally got a chance to prove her mettle in the Asian Games.         
	Like Suranjoy in boxing, two Indian wrestlers Narsing Yadav (74kg) and Yogeshwar Dutt (60kg) - are reigning Asian champions and can repeat their performance in China, though Dutt, according to team sources, is not yet fully fit to take on the best in the continent.         
	The nation though would eagerly await a gold medal winning performance from the hockey team. After the debacle in Doha, it is time to make amends. India will hope Rajpal Singh and his boys live up to the billing.         
	The Indian team did a commendable job in the Commonwealth Games winning a silver medal.         
	With no Australia in the Asian Games, the Rajpal Singhs have a very good chance to bring home a gold. A gold will give Indians a direct entry to the 2012 London Olympics.  
	OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  
	Some of our best moments...  Football gold in 1962, Jakarta: Booed by 60,000 jeering fans, Indian football team, led by Chuni Goswami, made history when they defeated mighty South Korea 2-1 in the final. With goals from PK Banerjee and Jarnail Singh, India won the gold, their last major title at the international level.  Khazan Singh rsquo;s silver in 1986, Seoul: One of the most versatile swimmers produced by India, Khazan Singh gave the nation its first Asian Games swimming medal in 35 years when he won the silver in 200m butterfly. In a sport completely dominated by the Chinese and Japanese in Asia, no other Indian could ever match this feat.
    P.T. Usha winning four gold medals in 1986, Seoul: The undisputed queen of Indian track and field came up with one of the greatest individual shows in the history of Asian Games, when she won four gold and one silver medal. She also created Games record in all the four events in which she bagged the gold medals.  Hockey gold in 1998, Bangkok: Coached by Maharaj Krishan Kaushik, 
  India won their first major international title after 1980 Moscow Olympics, when they beat South Korea in the final. It was also India's first Asian Games title since 1966. The Indian Hockey Federation, however, sacked six players and the coach   after the team returned to India.  Dingko Singh rsquo;s triumph in 1998, Bangkok: Initially dropped from the squad, the bantamweight  boxer stunned the world when he won the gold by   beating famed Uzbek opponent Timur Tulyakov in   the final. The achievement was even more impressive   as Dingko had moved to 54kg from 51kg only a few   months before the Games.  
	...and, some of our worst  India losing the hockey gold in 1958, Tokyo: It was the beginning of India's downfall as the world's greatest hockey power as they surrendered the gold medal to Pakistan. For the next four years, India lost two more finals against their neighbours - one in the 1960 Rome Olympic final and then in the 1962 Jakarta Asian Games.  Shiny Abraham Wilson losing the gold in 1986, Seoul: The ace 800m athlete lost the gold on technical ground even after winning the race convincingly. She changed the lane unknowingly during the race and was disqualified. 
    Football team losing to 1-7 to China in 1974, Teheran: Two-time   champions India suffered one of their biggest defeats in international football when they lost to debutant China. India could never make a comeback in Asian Games football thereafter and were slowly reduced to minnows.   Four athletes failed dope tests in 1986, Seoul: Four Indians, three lifters and a boxer returned positive in dope tests. The weightlifters mdash; N.G. Naidu, Tara Singh and Balwinder Singh mdash; were banned for two years. Boxer Daljit Singh, who won a silver medal, also had traces of drugs in his urine samples and was stripped of his title.
    Rajyavardhan Rathore losing in 2006, Doha: Hot favourite and Athens Olympics silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore's defeat in double trap came as a shock for the Indian fans. Reduced to the third place, Rathore later made some unkind remarks about the organisation and it landed him in trouble with the authorities.

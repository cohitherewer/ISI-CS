            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai FC will look to improve their tally when they take on Viva Kerala at the Cooperage on Wednesday.         
	The hosts would be without midfielder Dane Pereira and the visitors, too, would be hampered by the loss of foreign striker Reuben Senyo. Both players miss out with suspensions.         
	We have two drawbacks to overcome. We will be missing our star striker and they are playing at home, Viva coach Sreedharan said on the eve of the match.         
	Meanwhile, Mahindra United will look to land another positive blow in their title assault when they visit Pune FC Wednesday, the same day as East Bengals encounter against Sporting Clube de Goa.

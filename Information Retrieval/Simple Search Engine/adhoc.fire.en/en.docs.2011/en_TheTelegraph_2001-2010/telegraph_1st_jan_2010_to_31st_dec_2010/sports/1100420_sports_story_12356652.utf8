The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real get past Valencia
                                                                                                                       7                                        Real get past Valencia
                  Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain celebrate their win over Valencia, on Sunday                     
	Madrid: Real Madrid made the most of Barcelonas slip-up to close to within one point of the La Liga leaders on Sunday with a 2-0 win over third-placed Valencia at the Bernabeu.         
	Reals title challenge appeared to be disappearing when they lost 2-0 to Barca last weekend but the champions 0-0 draw at Espanyol on Saturday left the door ajar and Real grabbed the opportunity.         
	Gonzalo Higuain opened the scoring in the first half but it needed a second from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 77th minute to make sure of the win, as Valencia belatedly threatened to get back into the game.         
	Real have 83 points with five left to play, one behind Barca, and proved that the 24-point gulf in class with third-placed Valencia was, perhaps, justified.         
	Valencias timid start played into Reals hands and it came as no surprise when Argentinas Higuain spun past his marker to net his 25th of the campaign after 25 minutes.         
	The hosts should have made more of their dominance, but a flying save from Iker Casillas and Juan Matas follow up against the post reminded Real of the slenderness of their lead.         
	Valencias David Silva had been anonymous until he crashed a 25-metre drive against the crossbar midway through the second half and Portugals Ronaldo settled the match firing in after good work down the left from Marcelo.         
	Valencia have 59 points, five ahead of Sevilla who occupy the last Champions League qualification slot following their 3-0 win over Sporting Gijon on Saturday.

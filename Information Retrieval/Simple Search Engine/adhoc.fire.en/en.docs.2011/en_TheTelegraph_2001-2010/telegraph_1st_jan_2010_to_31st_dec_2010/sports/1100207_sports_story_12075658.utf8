The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stroke of luck for Saha
                                                                                                                       7                                        Stroke of luck for Saha
    - Instead of Rohit Sharma, Bengal keeper makes debut             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Wriddhiman Saha                                 
	Calcutta: Where ironies go, it cant get bigger than this: Set for his Test debut, Rohit Sharma collided with Wriddhiman Saha and its the 25-year-old from Bengal who got his maiden cap!         
	One cant recall a cover, too, being rendered hors de combat in the hour before a Test, but Saha surely isnt complaining.         
	Not that you can hold it against him.         
	Clearly, a most bizarre situation confronted Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Jamtha, on Saturday morning, when both V.V.S. Laxman and his cover, Rohit, became unavailable for Test No.1 against South Africa.         
	With no specialist batsman in the reserves, Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten had no choice but to include Saha, the second wicket-keeper, in the XI.         
	Sahas debut, incidentally, came at the same venue where Sourav Ganguly had played his final Test, 15 months ago.         
	Its Kirsten who gave Saha the greatest news of his life, around five minutes before the toss.         
	Rohit collided with me, during the warm-up session, and hed looked bad... I was throwing some balls to (Amit) Mishra when Gary came up to me and said that I would be playing... Dhoni spoke to me after the toss... Everything happened so fast, Saha told The Telegraph, when contacted on returning to the Pride Hotel in Nagpur.         
	Who presented him the India cap?         
	Sachin Tendulkar... At that moment, it definitely felt great... Till then, Id been quite normal... Sachin also gave the cap to the other debutant, (Subramaniam) Badrinath... Having got this chance, Im looking to contribute to the teams effort... Team jate bhalo korte pare...         
	Today, Im thankful to so many for their encouragement over the years... My parents (Prasanta, Maitrayee) and dada (Anirban)... My coach for long, Jayanta Bhowmick... Its a long list, Saha responded.         
	Actually, not that Dhoni has anything against Saha, but his worst fears came true at much the wrong time.         
	For, it was on the eve of the Test, that hed told a well-wisher: Please talk of anything, but injuries ki baat nahin karen...         
	The Krishnamachari Srikkanth-headed selection committee needs to hold a review. Most important, it shouldnt pick anybody who hasnt proved that hes match-fit.         
	Laxman wasnt anywhere close to that when the selectors chose the XV, on January 2-8. Well, it wasnt very many years ago that even somebody of Souravs standing had to prove his fitness.         
	He did so with a hundred in the Duleep Trophy.         
	Speaking exclusively from Nagpur, Srikkanth said: We were faced with such a strange situation... What happened was very unfortunate and Rohits injury has only confirmed that anything may occur... Well now have to look at a logical way of avoiding a repeat...         
	Srikkanth didnt commit himself on whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India would be requested by his committee to sanction the selection of XVI players for a home series as well.         
	Thats a possibility, though.

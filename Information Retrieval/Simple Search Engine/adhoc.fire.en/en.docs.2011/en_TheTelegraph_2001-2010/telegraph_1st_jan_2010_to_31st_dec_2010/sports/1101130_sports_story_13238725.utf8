The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha is advised rest, to miss Indian Open
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev Milkha is advised rest, to miss Indian Open
                      
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh was Monday advised three weeks of complete rest to recover from his back injury. This decision will force him to miss this weeks Hero Honda Indian Open here.         
	This advice was given to him following a series of tests and MRI scans on his problematic lower back. The Chandigarh golfer, who had to withdraw halfway through the Casio World Open on the Japan Golf Tour last week, said he felt lucky that the injury did not turn out to be as serious as he had initially thought it to be.         
	I was actually fearing the worst. There is a muscle tear around the L4 and L5, and there is a slight bulge in one of the discs which was pinching against a nerve and causing an intense amount of pain, said Jeev.         
	Doctors have asked me to take complete rest for three weeks with intensive physiotherapy sessions. Hopefully, the disc will move back in place soon and there should not be any long-term damages. If all goes well over the next few days, I will be able to resume practice soon, he said.         
	Jeev said he was disappointed at missing the Indian Open as he was looking forward to playing in India after a long time.         
	Unfortunately, the injury means I will have to pull out of the Hero Honda Indian Open. Its a huge disappointment for me because I was looking forward to play in India after a long gap. I greatly admire what Hero Honda has done for Indian golf, and personally for me too, said Jeev who is ranked No. 157 in the world due to an injury-plagued season.         
	I wish the tournament all the best, and hope that the best man will win on Sunday.         
	In another development, friend Jyoti Randhawa feels that the leading Indian pro is playing way too many tournaments. Jeev should reduce his workload to avoid injuries and maintain top form.         
	We are going to miss him in the Indian Open. He had a great chance of winning the meet. However, I think Jeev is playing too many tournaments at the moment. He should reduce the number to avoid injuries, Randhawa said.         
	We are now 38-40 years of age. We have to reduce the number of tournaments in a year. I believe at this age playing less will keep us in top form, he added.         
	Randhawa said he was looking to regain form at his happy hunting ground  the Delhi Golf Course, after a lean patch but said he was not making any changes in his game.         
	I am looking to come back to form at my happy hunting ground. I am going to give my best and hoping that the atmosphere here gets me back to my old form. In golf, getting back to form is just a matter of a break with some good performances, he said.         
	I know I am not in the best of form but I am going to stick to my game and make some adjustments. In the past, under pressure I had to change my way of playing but that did not work at all. So, what I have learnt is play to your own game and not make changes when things were not working your way, said the former Asian Order of Merit No. 1.         
	Asked to pick a favourite to win the Indian Open, Randhawa said, It would be Arjun Atwal.(PTI)

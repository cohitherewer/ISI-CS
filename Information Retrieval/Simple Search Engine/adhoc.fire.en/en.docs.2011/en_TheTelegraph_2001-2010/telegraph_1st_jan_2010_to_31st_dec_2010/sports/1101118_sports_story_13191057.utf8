	Mumbai: Rohan Raje made a stunning debut as he grabbed three top order wickets in an incisive new ball spell as Mumbai skittled out Railways for 201 on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Super League Group A tie here on Wednesday.         
	The 24-year-old right-arm bowler returned with figures of three for 41 on a juicy track at the BKC-MCA ground. Left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla (4/42) then weaved his magic to demolish rest of the Railways batting.         
	In Vadodara, Yusuf Pathan and Munaf Patel shared nine wickets between them as Baroda bundled out Uttar Pradesh for 190 and then reached 59 for one. At the Kotla, Delhi produced a sensational seam bowling display, dismissing Gujarat for a paltry 71 on the rain-affected first day.

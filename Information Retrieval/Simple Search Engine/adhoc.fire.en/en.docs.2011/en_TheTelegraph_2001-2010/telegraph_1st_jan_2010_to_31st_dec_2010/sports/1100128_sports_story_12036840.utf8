	Melbourne: Roger Federer and Serena Williams needed all their fighting qualities to stay in the Australian Open on Wednesday after Li Na stunned Venus Williams to become the second Chinese to reach a Grand Slam semi-final.         
	Federer reeled off 13 games in a row to dig himself out of trouble and beat Russias Nikolay Davydenko 2-6, 6-3, 6-0, 7-5 in a wildly fluctuating match.         
	Serena was also staring down the barrel in her quarter final against Victoria Azarenka of Belarus before she recovered to win 4-6, 7-6, 6-2.         
	Her elder sibling might have joined her but threw away a comfortable lead in her 2-6, 7-6, 7-5 loss to Li, one of two Chinese women through to the last four at Melbourne Park.         
	Federer made it through to his 23rd consecutive Grand Slam semi but only after a titanic struggle with Davydenko, who won the opening set then got an early service break in the second.         
	Federers next opponent will be Jo-Wilfried Tsonga after the Frenchman beat Novak Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 to avenge his loss to the Serb in the 2008 Australian final.         
	Djokovic was heavily criticised after he retired with heat exhaustion while trying to defend his title last year and the world number three said he was sick again against Tsonga.         
	It was unfortunate that I couldnt perform on the level that I wanted to in the fourth and fifth set, Djokovic said.         
	Djokovic dashed from the court as soon as the match was over as Tsonga leapt into the air and starting blowing kisses to the Centre Court crowd.         
	Serena showed why she remains the toughest woman in the world to beat, battling back from the brink of defeat to remain on course to defend the title she won for a fourth time last year.         
	The once unimaginable prospect of an all-Chinese final is suddenly looming as a real possibility after Li followed Zheng Jie into the semis.         
	Zheng, the first Chinese to reach a Grand Slam singles semi when she made the last four at Wimbledon in 2008, beat Maria Kirilenko 24 hours earlier and plays Justine Henin in Thursdays semis while Li faces the daunting prospect of playing Serena.

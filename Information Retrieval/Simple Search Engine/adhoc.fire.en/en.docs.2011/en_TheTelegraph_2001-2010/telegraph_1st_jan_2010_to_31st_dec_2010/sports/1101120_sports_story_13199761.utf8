	Guangzhou: Bajrang Lal Takhar stole the limelight with a historic gold in mens singles scull, as Indian rowers notched up three more medals and the shooters chipped in with a bronze, on the seventh day of competition in the 16th Asian Games, on Friday.         
	Apart from Bajrang Lals gold, which is first for an Indian rower at the Games, the Indian mens eight team grabbed silver and the women claimed the pair bronze to make it a very fruitful day at the International Rowing Centre.         
	The shooters, who have been a pale shadow of themselves at the Aoti shooting range, accounted for a bronze with Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Mansher Singh and Zoravar Singh Sandhu finishing third in the mens team trap event.         
	With the addition of four medals in the morning session, Indias medal tally climbed to two gold, eight silver and 10 bronze. India had finished 10th on the medals table in the last Asian Games in Doha with a tally of 10-17-26.         
	The 29-year-old Bajrang Lal gave India the second gold in the ongoing Games after Pankaj Advani had clinched the yellow metal in billiards on the second day of competitions.                     
	Takhar led the 2000m race from start to finish and rowed his way to the gold with a few lengths of boats to spare in seven minutes and 4.78 seconds.         
	The gold, that followed the two silver medals won in the mens lightweight 4s and 4s event on Thursday, took the medal haul from rowing to five.         
	Rajasthan-born Bajrang Lal, who won Asian championship gold last year in Korea and was the pre-event favourite, was followed across the finish line by Chinese Taipeis Wang Ming Hui (7:07.33), who took the silver, and Iraqs Haeider Hamarasheid (7:10.10), who won the bronze.         
	I won silver in the 2006 Asian Games. I had prepared for four years to fight for the gold medal today (Friday). I knew I would make it, Takhar said.         
	Later the womens duo of Pratima Puhana and Pramila Minz, both in their teens, grabbed the pairs bronze in seven minutes and 47.50 seconds, well behind gold medal winners China, who crossed the finish line far ahead in 7:22.06.         
	The rowing event came to an end with the Indian mens eight team clinching the silver, by clocking 5:49.50, way behind hosts China who timed 5:37.44, but well ahead of bronze medal winners Uzbekistan (5:55.96).         
	The Indians  Lokesh Kumar, Satish Joshi, Saji Thomas, Jenil Krishnan, Anil Kumar, Rajesh Kumar Yadav, Manjeet Singh and Girraj Singh  finished more than a boat and half length ahead of the third-placed team.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian trap members logged 341 points, with Asian record holder Manavjit leading the way, which enabled them to finish one point ahead of China (340). The gold medal went to Kuwait (352) who edged out Lebanon (351).         
	But none of them won an individual medal, including Asian record holder Manavjit, who stormed his way back from eighth to third position and qualified for the final only to finish fifth with an aggregate of 136, including 119 in the qualifying round.

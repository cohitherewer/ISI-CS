                    Muricy Ramalho                
	Rio de Janeiro: Fluminense manager Muricy Ramalho has been asked to take over as Brazil coach but has not yet accepted the job, the countrys football confederation said on Friday.         
	The gruff 54-year-old, who won three consecutive Brazilian championships with Sao Paulo between 2006 and 2008, said after a meeting with Brazilian Football Confederation president Ricardo Teixeira that he needed to speak with Fluminense officials before making a decision.         
	Nothing is decided because I still have a contract with Fluminense, Ramalho said in a statement.         
	Ramalho would replace Brazils 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga, who left as coach following the countrys quarter final defeat to the Netherlands in South Africa this month.         
	Dunga, in charge for less than four years, was criticised for producing a Brazil team which lacked style but Ramalho is not expected to be much different.         
	Ramalhos Sao Paulo team were renowned for being physically robust and strong in defence but were criticised for being unattractive to watch.         
	Fluminense side are currently at the top of the Brazilian championship.         
	Apart from brief stints in Mexico and China, Ramalho has spent his entire coaching career in Brazil since starting in 1993 and Fluminense is his 13th club in the country.

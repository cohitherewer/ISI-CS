	Shanghai: Sebastian Vettel gave Red Bull their fourth pole position in four races with a searing late lap in qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday.         
	The German clocked one minute 34.558 seconds to pip teammate Mark Webber with his final lap and claim his third pole position of the year.         
	Force India driver Adrian Sutil will start the race from 10th while teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi from 18th after not going beyond Q1.         
	Indias Karun Chandhok of Hispania will begin from the back of the grid. His starting from the back of the grid was more or less a certainty after Chandhok was handed a five-place grid penalty by the Shanghai race stewards.

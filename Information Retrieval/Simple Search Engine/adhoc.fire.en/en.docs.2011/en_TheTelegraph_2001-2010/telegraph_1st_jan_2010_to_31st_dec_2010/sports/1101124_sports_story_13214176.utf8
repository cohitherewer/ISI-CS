The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A perfect birthday gift, says Kirsten
                                                                                                                       7                                      A perfect birthday gift, says Kirsten
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nagpur: Gary Kirsten, who turned 43 on Tuesday, described the series-clinching innings win over New Zealand as a perfect birthday gift from his wards.         
	Its great to be successful... A win on my birthday, yeah, its a perfect gift, Kirsten told The Telegraph, smiling a lot more than he normally does.         
	There were traces of chocolate cake on Kirstens T-shirt, suggesting that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. had taken good care of him in the Jamtha dressing room.         
	Kirstens contract is till the end of the 2011 World Cup, by when he wouldve completed three years. It wont be a surprise if hes requested to extend his India stay, though.

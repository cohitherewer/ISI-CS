The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gritty win for Inter 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gritty win for Inter 
                      
	Milan: Serie A leaders Inter Milan shrugged off the suspensions of four players and came back from a goal down to win 3-2 at lowly Udinese on Sunday.         
	Three straight draws had slashed their advantage at the top but Inters famed resilience coupled with some fantastic play kept the champions four points above second-placed AC Milan, who beat Atalanta 3-1.         
	Inter were without the suspended Walter Samuel, Ivan Cordoba, Esteban Cambiasso and Sulley Muntari following last weekends fiery 0-0 draw with Sampdoria and had coach Jose Mourinho banned from the bench.         
	Midfielder Thiago Motta was forced to play in central defence and Kenya winger McDonald Mariga was handed a first start while struggling Samuel Eto was still only a substitute.         
	Udinese, four points above the drop zone, had a great start when Simone Pepe rifled in after Antonio Di Natales pass but Inter were soon level thanks to Mario Balotellis angled shot from the edge of the area on six minutes.         
	Right back Maicon then put the visitors 2-1 up after a fine move midway through the first half and Diego Milito, who grabbed the opener in the midweek Champions League win over Chelsea, headed the third just before the break.         
	Serie A topscorer Di Natale scored a penalty early in the second period after a handball to set up a nervous finale.         
	In La Liga action on Sunday, Diego Forlan scored twice as Atletico Madrid won 4-1 against Valencia, who ended the game with nine men. The result means Valencia stay third on 46 points and Atletico move up to 11th on 30.         
	On Saturday, Barcelona beat Malaga 2-1 to stay top of the league. Real Madrid had led the standings temporarily by winning 5-1 at Tenerife earlier. Barcelona are on 61 points and Real second on 59 points.         
	Also on Sunday, Joseba Llorente scored the winner as Villarreal beat Deportivo La Coruna 1-0 and moved closer to the European places.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A challenging task: Kumble
                                                                                                                       7                                        A challenging task: Kumble
                  Srinath                     
	Bangalore: Promising to make a difference, former India captain Anil Kumble and Jawagal Srinath Wednesday jumped into fray in the Karnataka State Cricket Association elections to contest for the president and secretarys posts, respectively.         
	In what would be a historic change of guard if it happens, Kumble and Srinath would be among the candidates contesting in the elections slated for November 21 here.         
	Brijesh Patel, who was secretary of the association for 12 years, has decided not to contest the elections.         
	Rahul Dravid, who is expected to be a part of the management committee, along with Venkatesh Prasad, will be part of Kumbles managing committee.         
	I think it is important for cricketers to be part of the association. When I retired two years ago, I was keen to involve myself in cricket administration. I thought this was the best time for me, Srinath, Dravid, Venkatesh Prasad and all the other cricketers of our generation to get involved.         
	We will be able to bear the responsibility and deliver. I can confidently say that we will give our 100 per cent and our commitment will be there, he added.         
	Whatever vision we have will ensure that Karnataka cricket grows. Not just the association becoming the No.1, the cricket team should also go on to be No.1 and many more cricketers represent India, Kumble said.         
	Asked if he would have the time for cricket administration as he is also the chairman of the National Cricket Academy, Kumble said: If I didnt have the time I would not have been addressing the media here. The priorities are important and that is cricket.         
	It will be a challenging task but I know with the support and commitment from everyone in the team we will be able to make a difference. It might take some time but we are wholeheartedly committed.         
	Srinath, on the other hand, stressed on the need to bring in more professionalism in KSCA. (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Wednesdays loss may have been New Zealands eighth defeat in past nine one-day matches, but Black Caps skipper Daniel Vettori is not giving up. We cant get caught up in history, Vettori said after the match.         
	The wily left-arm spinner failed to impress with the ball coming from an injury, but hoped to arrest their losing streak soon. We have three more matches to go and I am sure the team would make a comeback, he said.         
	Vettori heaped praise on Indian stand-in skipper Gautam Gambhir and said the southpaws stellar show took the game away from them. It was an outstanding knock. He (Gambhir) was in fabulous form, the New Zealand skipper said.         
	Vettori was unhappy with his sides performance and conceded they couldnt bat or bowl well. We should have put on some more runs on the board. We also bowled badly and gave away too many boundaries. That was the reason why we suffered a huge loss, he said.         
	Admitting that the dew played a crucial role in deciding the fate of the match, Vettori said: The weather is somewhat different at different venues. Still, we will give it a try in the next three matches.

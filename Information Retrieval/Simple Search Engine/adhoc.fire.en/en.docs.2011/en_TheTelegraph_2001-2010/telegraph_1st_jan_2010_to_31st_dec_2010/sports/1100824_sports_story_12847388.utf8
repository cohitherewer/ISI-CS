The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A victory for Indian sports: Kapil Dev
                                                                                                                       7                                      A victory for Indian sports: Kapil Dev
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/ New Delhi: Indias World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, on Monday, led the chorus of appreciation for Arjun Atwal, who scripted golfing history by becoming the first Indian to clinch a US PGA Tour title.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar (golfer): All of us are very proud of him. The US PGA Tour was the only Tour where an Indian hadnt won before. He has broken that barrier and raised the bar for all of us. Its a great achievement considering that he had lost his card last year.         
	Kapil Dev (iconic former cricketer): This is a big victory for Indian sports. Atwal has been fighting for consistency. One big win at this level will boost his confidence and I hope the rest will come on a platter. He required such a win and this will make him much better.         
	Rahil Gangjee (golfer): I knew hes going to win in the US sooner or later. This year has been quite good for him as he has played well and posted some good finishes on the PGA Tour. I have known him for many years and the best thing about him is that he is very relaxed while on the course. And, at the same time, he is always extremely positive.         
	Anirban Lahiri (golfer): Arjuns feat has made us all very proud. It is an inspiration for us. The victory would be very special for him as it has helped him make his way back to the top rung after injuries and personal problems.         
	Ashit Luthra (IGU president): I think this is the biggest achievement since Prakash Padukones All-England triumph in 1980. Atwals triumph will open the floodgates just like the 1983 World Cup triumph did to cricket. Amazing performance. Simply superb. We, at the RCGC, are proud of him.         
	Lakshman Singh (1982 Asian Games gold medallist): I think it was long overdue. But better late than never. Atwal has done us proud. He had won every where except the US PGA Tour. I think his shoulder injury hampered his chances in previous years. He has been in brilliant form in this tournament. I saw the second and third rounds, but could not see the Sunday action since I had an early morning flight to catch. I wish him all the best for the future.

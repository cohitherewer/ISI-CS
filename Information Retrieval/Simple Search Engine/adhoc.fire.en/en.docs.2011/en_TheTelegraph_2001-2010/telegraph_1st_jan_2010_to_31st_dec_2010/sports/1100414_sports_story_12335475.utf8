The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Force India hoping   for more

	New Delhi: Force India have not returned empty-handed from any of the first three races this season and drivers Adrian Sutil and Vitantonio Liuzzi expect the trend to continue when they hit the state-of-the-art Shanghai International Circuit for Sundays Chinese Grand Prix.         
	Sutil, who picked up his first points-finish of the year in Malaysia with a fighting fifth place, is particularly optimistic because he feels the Shanghai layout suits the VJM03 to a tee.         
	The race in China will be a bit different but there will be some similarities to the Malaysia race. The circuit layout is different but you need a good top speed, which we have, and you need a little bit of down-force for the mid sector, for the slow corners so I think it should suit our car really well, Sutil said.         
	After the sweltering heat in Malaysia, Sutil is looking forward to a relatively cooler climate in Shanghai and the German expects both the Force India cars to do well.         
	Liuzzi, who won points both in Bahrain and Australia before an engine failure marred his outing in Malaysia, said there was no reason why the team could not stretch their point-scoring streak.         
	I have been in the simulator and we are pushing to bring updates to China as we want to be ready to score points again and not let our momentum slip, said the Italian. (PTI)

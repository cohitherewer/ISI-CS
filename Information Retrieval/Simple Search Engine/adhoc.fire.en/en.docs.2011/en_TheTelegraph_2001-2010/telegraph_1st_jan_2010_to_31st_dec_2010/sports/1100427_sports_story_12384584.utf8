            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Ferraris Fernando Alonso during a news conference in Boadilla del Monte, near Madrid, on Monday                           
	Fernando Alonso has had his thumbs insured to the tune of almost 9 million as part of a life and accident package arranged by one of Ferraris primary sponsors in banking giant Santander. Alonso has signed a new one-year deal with Santander that now sees the Spaniard sponsored by the insurance arm of the company, as well as the banking division.         
	Ferrari at the back of the grid for speed of payment. With less than a fortnight to go ahead of Alonsos home Grand Prix in Barcelona on May 9, it is a race the 28-year-old feels will separate the men from the boys in the world title fight.         
	After the first four races of the season, the Ferrari driver currently finds himself in joint-third place in the drivers standings alongside McLarens Lewis Hamilton.         
	The former teammates are 11 points adrift of championship leader Jenson Button and a point down on Mercedes Nico Rosberg.         
	After three Grand Prix in Australia, Malaysia and China dominated by inclement weather, Alonso feels Spains sunnier climes will offer a more defined picture on the title race.         
	The championship always starts with the first race, but its just a race to confirm the good sensations you had during testing, said Alonso.         
	The first races can be atypical, with changing weather all the time, but in Europe it is the moment of truth to show who is going to fight for the title and who isnt. It is also time for the teams to prove they can develop faster than their rivals. Its the start of a nice fight.

	London: Edwin van der Sar could make his Manchester United comeback against Burnley on Saturday.         
	The veteran Dutchman has not played for United since mid-November when he injured a knee against Everton. Since then, his wife Annemarie suffered a stroke just before Christmas.         
	However, she has now recovered and, after spending this week in Qatar with his teammates during a warm weather training camp, the 39-year-old is in contention to face Burnley at Old Trafford.         
	Edwin has come back to training and has done very well, said manager Alex Ferguson. He has been out for a few weeks and it is great to see him back. He will give us so much experience when he eventually does come back, which is important to us.         
	Ferguson will have a chat with Van der Sar before deciding on his line-up for Saturdays game.         
	Ferguson also confirmed long-term absentees Rio Ferdinand and Owen Hargreaves continued to make progress in Qatar last week.         
	Record signing Dimitar Berbatov is resisting having an exploratory operation on a lingering knee problem, with Ferguson hoping surgery can be delayed until the end of the season.         
	Roberto Mancinis new-found popularity with Manchester City fans gets its toughest test yet Saturday when the coach takes his team to Everton in the Premier League.         
	Citys fans are renowned for their loyalty but their perception of Mancinis abilities may be readjusted should the team he inherited when Mark Hughes was fired stumble at Goodison Park.         
	Also Saturday, leader Chelsea host Sunderland. Blackburn hosts Fulham, Portsmouth hosts Birmingham, Stoke hosts Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers hosts Wigan in Saturdays other matches. Arsenal is at Bolton on Sunday, when Aston Villa hosts West Ham.

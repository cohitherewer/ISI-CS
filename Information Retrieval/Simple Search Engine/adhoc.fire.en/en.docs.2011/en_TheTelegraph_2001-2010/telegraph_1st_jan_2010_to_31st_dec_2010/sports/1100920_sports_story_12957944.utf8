The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA players reluctant to play vs Pak
                                                                                                                       7                                      SA players reluctant to play vs Pak
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	South Africas cricketers have such deep reservations about playing against Pakistan in their scheduled series in Abu Dhabi and Dubai next month that several senior players are considering whether to make themselves unavailable for selection.         
	The team are due to play five ODIs and three Test matches as well as a brace of T20s, the second of which was agreed to by Cricket South Africa to help with flood relief in the stricken nation.         
	To say we are reluctant is an understatement, one senior player said. Nobody knows what the hell is going on in Pakistan cricket and we feel that playing such a high profile series right now, especially in the Middle East, is asking for trouble.         
	Maybe its time for the ICC to step in, or for Pakistan to withdraw from the international game for a year until the mess can be cleaned up and people can start to believe in the game and develop a bit of trust, the player said.         
	The SA Cricketers Association chief executive, Tony Irish, admitted that many players had expressed their concerns to him about the tour but that he was, for the moment, stoically maintaining a diplomatic stance.         
	The fact that there are now further incidents under investigation is not good news. This all needs to be dealt with urgently in order to ensure that a heavy cloud of suspicion and doubt doesnt hang over our series against Pakistan, Irish said.         
	Asked whether he was aware that some senior players were extremely reluctant to participate in the tour, Irish said: Lets hope it doesnt come to that.         
	Pakistans withdrawal from international cricket may, of course, happen involuntarily anyway. With the ECB having ruled itself out of acting as a home venue in the immediate future and the UAE financially unsustainable, the PCB is rapidly running out of options, not to mention willing opponents.         
	Last week Zimbabwe were even considering offering Harare and Bulawayo as venues for Pakistan to stage home games with ZC cricket committee chairman and former national captain Alistair Campbell suggesting that staging international cricket in the country before the countrys scheduled return to Test cricket in May next year was a good idea.         
	Zimbabwe are still scheduled to tour Pakistan for a five-match series of one-dayers to raise money for flood relief in January.         
	However, Cricket South Africa Sunday denied reports that its players were reluctant to play against Pakistan in the wake of the match-fixing scandal, saying that the series between the two sides in the UAE next month would go ahead as scheduled. CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said no player has expressed any such reservation so far and there was no plan to scrap the series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Molinari holds on to lead
                                                                                                                       7                                        Molinari holds on to lead
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Francesco Molinari tees off on the first hole, during the second round of the HSBC Champions, in Shanghai, on Friday. (Reuters)                                 
	Italian Francesco Molinari continued to hold the lead with a two-under 70 at nine-under 135, at the end of the second round of the HSBC Champions event, in Shanghai.         
	Lee Westwood remains one shot off the lead, despite missing out on the birdie-fest raging elsewhere. Westwood carded a 70 to go eight under par and will partner Francesco Molinari, whom he trails by one shot, in the final pairing on Sunday.         
	I didnt know what to expect having not played for three weeks coming into this event. Tee to green has been pretty good. My short game and pitching is a bit rusty, so eight under is great as far as Im concerned, Westwood said.         
	It was a good day for Arjun Atwal, as he rode on his front nine to bring home an improved card of one-under 71 and surge 12 places up the leaderboard at tied 40th.         
	An erratic Atwal traded four birdies against three bogeys to take his two-day total to 144.         
	A 10th tee starter, Atwal stumbled on a bogey at the second hole but he made amends by picking up a birdie at the 16th. However, back-to-back bogeys at the 17th and 18th holes meant he made the turn at two-over.         
	However, the Orlando-based Indian shrugged off the back nine blues and fired a couple of birdies in the first two holes to draw level-par, and then picked up a stroke on the eighth hole, to finish even par for the day.         
	Ernie Els remained among the days biggest movers with a 65 to sit one behind Westwood. Els, playing alongside Tiger Woods, lit the afterburners with a chipped birdie at the fifth and never looked back.         
	You never expect a chip to go in. That was a big turning point. It kind of freed me up a little bit. I definitely enjoyed my round after that, Els said.         
	Woods, who led Els by five following a birdie at the first, trailed by three at the close after a disastrous stretch around the turn. A string of errant tee shots led to the loss of three shots in four holes, starting at the ninth, where his drive flew into the trees and hit a spectator.         
	Woods shook his victims hand and gave him a ball to keep. His drive landed safely on grass trodden flat by the gallery.         
	He even had a shot out of the arbour, but could not get close enough with his recovery to prevent the bogey.         
	He was fortunate not to lose ground at the previous hole, where a poor approach landed a metre clear of greenside topiary from which there would have been no escape.         
	There were no such problems for Jaco Van Zyl, a little known South African, who plays his golf on the Sunshine Tour. Van Zyl, who started at the tenth hole, turned for home on level par. Eight holes later he was seven under and lying third.         
	I birdied one and two and it just carried on from there, he said. Not many people know me here. Im in awe of the guys next to me on the range. My wife wants to go up to them and ask for their autographs.

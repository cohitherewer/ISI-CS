The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another high for Lochte
                                                                                                                       7                                      Another high for Lochte
                      
	Dubai: Ryan Lochte has set two world records on consecutive nights and the Americans just warming up.         
	There were a lot of mistakes I made and I can go a lot faster, I know that, Lochte said, on Friday, after adding the 200-metre individual medley mark to his 400-metre record a day earlier at the short-course world championships. Its just a matter of time where I finally have a perfect race.         
	While he may have not been completely satisfied with it, Lochtes latest victory was a dominant display. He touched in one minute, 50.08 seconds to improve on the previous mark set by South Africas Darian Townsend by an astounding 1.5 seconds.         
	Lochte finished more than two bodylengths ahead of his closest competitor, Markus Rogan of Austria, who was 2.82 seconds behind.         
	Another American, Tyler Clary, was third, 3.48 back.         
	When I was doing backstroke I looked up on the screen and I saw how I was right in front of the world record line and that kind of motivated me, Lochte said. It pushed me in breaststroke and freestyle and I just came off that last wall, took a deep breath and just went in.         
	Rogan finished only 0.34 behind Lochte at a short-course yards meet in Ohio a couple of weeks ago. This time, the Austrian was so far behind he could only admire his rival.         
	I watched him the whole race, Rogan said in his usual light-hearted manner. I had the best seat in the house  nobody saw his feet like I did, nobody saw his turns. Ive got to get that ticket again.         
	Lochtes two marks represent the only individual world records set in 2010  either in short or long-course  after high-tech bodysuits were banned at the beginning of the year. By contrast, nearly every record in swimming was broken multiple times the previous two years.         
	Two other world records in relays were set the past two days.         
	Lochte is not from this planet  hes a little freak, said sprinting standout Cesar Cielo. Im just glad Im not an IMer. If he wants to swim the (sprints), Im ready for him, but lets just let him take those world records for now.         
	Lochte has won all three of his individual events so far and he has two more remaining, plus possibly a relay.         
	 I never go in the race expecting world records, he said. Im just going out there having fun, and if me having fun puts me first with a world record, more power to me I guess.         
	Lochte took bronze medals in the 200 and 400 IMs at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which were both won by Michael Phelps, who is skipping this meet.         
	Also Friday, Cielo showed a return to form with a dominant display in the 50 freestyle.         
	Cielo clocked 20.51 seconds in the two-lap race, 0.30 ahead of French rival Frederick Bousquet, with Josh Schneider of the US third, 0.37 behind. (Agencies)

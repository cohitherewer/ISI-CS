The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akrams help for an erring Ishant
                                                                                                                       7                                        Akrams help for an erring Ishant
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ishant Sharma                           
	Calcutta: Ishant Sharmas rise to stardom is a fascinating story of how he made Australia captain Ricky Ponting his bunny during Indias tour Down Under in 2007-08. However, after a fabulous first few months, the lanky Delhi speedster lost out on pace, which was his USP. From mid-140s (kmph), his pace dropped to early 130s. The nip off the pitch seems to have vanished.         
	Once considered the next best thing for Indian cricket, Ishant is now struggling with inconsistent form. The situation certainly called for some corrective measures from someone who knows the art of fast bowling like the back of his hand. Enter Wasim Akram. It is the Pakistan great who seems to be the answer to Ishants queries.         
	When it comes to lending a helping hand to the youngsters, Akram is always available. From Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra to Irfan Pathan, all of them have sometime or the other benefited from Akrams advice. Now its Ishants turn to look up to the Kolkata Knight Riders bowling consultant as he tries to redeem his career.         
	The last time Akram was in town, Ishant couldnt attend the camp as he was all set to tour Bangladesh with the Indian team. On Saturday, the 21-year-old was seen quietly stepping into Eden Gardens for an afternoon training session with the guru of all modern day speedsters.         
	For the next hour, it was Akram who was seen closely monitoring Ishants bowling as the India pacer bowled his heart out at the nets. The former Pakistan captain minutely assessed everything from Ishants run-up to his delivery stride. He was seen talking to the youngster and pointing out the corrective measures.         
	The Knight Riders will have all the 23 registered players for the first match in Mumbai. However, the team management wont travel with more than 15 players when they hit the road next time. The final XV will be decided on Wednesday, two days before KKRs first match against the Deccan Chargers.         
	The five foreigners available for the first match are Owais Shah, Brad Hodge, Ajantha Mendis, Angelo Mathews and Charl Langeveldt.         
	Likely squad for 1st match: Sourav Ganguly, Manoj Tiwary, Cheteshwar Pujara, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Ashok Dinda, Ajit Agarkar, Murali Karthik, Ganapathy Vignesh, Ishant Sharma, Angelo Mathews, Brad Hodge, Ajantha Mendis, Charl Langeveldt, Owais Shah

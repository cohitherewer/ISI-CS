The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Semenya finds support from fans on Facebook 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Semenya finds support from fans on Facebook 
  - Negative publicity around the Golden Girl has left her fretting over finances             Caster Semenya                           
	Johannesburg: While her rivals battled for Commonwealth Games gold, and soaked up the acclaim in New Delhi, Caster Semenya was left fretting over her finances and wondering if she can afford to keep running.         
	A gender test controversy and the ensuing 11-month layoff from competition has robbed the 800-meter world champion of more than just time on the track. Despite being cleared to run by the IAAF, Semenyas manager, Tshepo Seema, says she cant find a sponsor because of the negative publicity.         
	Semenya is struggling to pay for her running and has even met with and accepted an offer of help from two young South Africans, who say they rallied a few friends on Facebook to raise money for the athlete.         
	Semenya, now 19, was the first black South African woman to win gold at a world championships when she triumphed in Berlin last August. Despite then undergoing infamous gender tests, she was welcomed as a national hero on her return to South Africa and dubbed the countrys Golden Girl.         
	But, the world champion still cannot find anyone to endorse her.         
	Caster has been cleared to compete as a female athlete, she should get the opportunity for sponsorship. Companies have said there is a lot of uncertainty around Caster. They have said, We cant touch her.         
	I would ... like to make a request to South Africans to support me on various platforms that my team has put together, the normally media-shy Semenya said. And my promise to the nation is that through excellence and resilience I will strive to live up to the reputation of being known as the Golden Girl.         
	Earlier, Semenya even met with the Facebook group, which intends to sell T-shirts and hold mobile car washes for cash  an unthinkable situation for a world champion athlete to resort to.         
	We saw an interview (with Semenya) on TV, said Thobeka Macgai, a 27-year-old media professional who started the campaign with her brother Clement. It was clear she was broke, she had no sponsors and she was on her own. We thought, why not try and assist her? She is South African and she represents us.         
	Macgai said she met with Semenya and the athlete gave them her approval. However, the group of seven volunteers is yet to raise the money required to print the T-shirts. For Semenya, its far from the professional sponsorship deals that normally accompany a world title.         
	Michael Seme, Semenyas coach, said she receives a salary from the South African government, is provided with running clothes by a sportswear company, and receives help with tuition fees and the use of training facilities from the University of Pretoria. But theres no endorsements.           (AGENCIES)

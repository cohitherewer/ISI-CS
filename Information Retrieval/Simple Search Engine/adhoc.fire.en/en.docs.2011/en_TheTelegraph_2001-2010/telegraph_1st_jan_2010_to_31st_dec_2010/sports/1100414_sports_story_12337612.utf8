The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A night to forget for the Knights
                                                                                                                       7                                      A night to forget for the Knights
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Chennai: This was a demolition that Sourav Gangulys men would like to forget in a hurry; an embarrassment that would force them to scurry for cover.         
	Shah Rukh Khans hopes of a revival in the teams fortunes were sent crashing into the Chepauk dust when the Knights top-order committed hara-kiri.         
	What had started off with a bang in Mumbai, has been reduced to a whimper.         
	While the Chennai Super Kings kept their fortunes alive with a clinical all-round performance on Tuesday, it was all but over the Kolkata Knight Riders, their dismal net run rate adding to their woes.         
	The writing was on the wall as early as the fourth over of the match. Twenty20 contests are generally decided in the first six overs and, while the Knights limped to 22 for four, the Super Kings had it well in their grasp with 67 for one.         
	Optimists had taken some hope from the fact that this very pitch had thrown up the only Super Over in this edition after the Kings XI Punjab had made 136. But the Knights failed to show the zeal and determination needed to contain the opposition in a low scoring affair.         
	The match was over in a flash once Suresh Raina (78 not out off 39 balls) launched into an offensive after Matthew Haydens departure in the first over. The lefthander was supported well by Murali Vijay, who hit an unbeaten half-century. The 140-run target proved to be too little as the Super Kings won by nine wickets with 39 balls to spare. Another embarrassment the team management would struggle to explain.         
	For the third year running, the Knight Riders lived up to their reputation of being a much-hyped outfit with little to show. The inadequacies of the domestic players, the wrong choice of foreigners, the failure to gel as a unit, the immense pressure built on the players by external factors  the list seems endless.         
	The Knights looked tensed from the outset, a team that seemed worried about losing. The expectations were belied. They deflated like a pricked balloon even before most had settled into their seats at the full house.         
	The home celebrations had begun long before the match got underway with singer Chinmoyyi Sripadaa sending the crowd into ruptures with a live performance. It only gathered further momentum as the match progressed with Shivamani charting out popular Tamil chartbusters.         
	Momentum, though, was missing from the Knights innings.         
	There was a brief resistance during Angelo Mathewss run-a-ball 48 and his 73-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Manoj Tiwary. But once they separated, it was curtains for the Knights.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni had read the wicket well and loaded his side with three specialist spinners. Ravichandran Ashwin turned out to be their trump card removing the three foreigners in the top-order, signalling an inexplicable collapse.         
	Coming into this match, Ashwin (3/16), who was among the India T20 probables, had only seven wickets in as many games.         
	Ashwin was denied a hattrick on the day after umpire Simon Taufel overlooked a bat-pad catch of Mathews. However, Taufel later apologised for the mistake, Ashwin revealed.         
	A mere ten balls destroyed the backbone of the batting. Except for Sourav, the rest fell to poor shot selection. Chris Gayle got carried away after hitting the first ball of the third over for a six. In trying for an encore, the West Indian failed to connect the next one that turned away.         
	Brendon McCullum tried to break free by sweeping, the top-edge travelling to short fine-leg where Muttiah Muralidharan held on to an acrobatic effort.         
	Souravs promise-filled innings was cut short by a horrible decision from umpire Sanjay Hazare. Doug Bollingers delivery was missing the leg stump by a distance but the umpire thought otherwise.         
	There was more to follow as David Hussey failed to justify his recall to the side. Drawn out by a wide delivery down the leg side, he failed to connect as it further drifted down. Dhoni didnt waste the opportunity. It was 18 for four at the end of the fourth over and the visitors were already looking down the barrel.         
	Thereafter, there was very little apart from Mathewss innings. Tiwary provided brief support with 27 from 31 balls. Laxmi Ratan Shukla made a quickfire 17 off 10 balls with two sixes.         
	But that proved too little. The backbone of the innings had already been broken and no further medication was enough to revive the patient from the ventilator.

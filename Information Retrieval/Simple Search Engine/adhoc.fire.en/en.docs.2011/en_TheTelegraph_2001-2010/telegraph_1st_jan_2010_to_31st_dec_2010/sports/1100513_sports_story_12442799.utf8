	Gros Islet: India skipper Jhulan Goswami is confident of stopping the Australian juggernaut when they clash in the first semi-finals of the Women World Twenty20 at the Beausejour Cricket Ground here on Thursday.         
	Indian women are quite confident of derailing Australia and making it to the summit clash, slated for May 16 in Barbados. The Australian women have had an unbeaten run in the World Cup but skipper Jhulan Goswami is hardly worried.         
	We have beaten Australia in the 50 overs World Cup Down Under. So we are pretty much confident that we can beat them in this format as well, said Jhulan.         
	Sulakshana Naik (59 vs Sri Lanka, 28 vs New Zealand and 11 vs Pakistan), Mithali Raj (52, 44, 33) and Poonam Raut (54 against Pakistan) have been the hub around which India have made match-winning scores.

	Margao: Defending champions Churchill Brothers thrashed Mohun Bagan 4-0 in a an I-League encounter at the Nehru Stadium, here on Friday. The win helped Churchill to delay Dempo Sports Clubs championship celebrations. Armando Colacos boys now need to get a point against Lajong FC on Sunday in order to win their fourth national league title in the last five years.         
	Churchill skipper Okolie Odafe scored a brace, while Felix Chimaokwu and Ogba Kalu also netted a goal each. This was incidentally Mohun Bagans third loss by four goal margin  having lost 1-4 to Lajong and 0-4 to Dempo in their previous encounter.         
	The home team started aggressively. After missing a close chance, the defending champions went ahead in the 20th minute. Kalu relayed the ball to Odafe who weaved past a couple of defenders and unleashed a shot that deflected off stopper N.S. Manju to catch goalkeeper Shilton Paul on the wrong foot while going in.         
	Odafe and Felix then combined nicely upfront and found an able ally in Kalu in the central midfield. Bagan defence was caught napping on number of occasions and Churchill increased the lead in the 26th minute. Kalu slipped in a through for Felix who took a defender in his stride and took a powerful grounder that deflected off Shiltons feet before going in.         
	In the 31st minute, Churchill made it 3-0 when Kalu nodded home off a flag kick taken by Lalindrika from the right.         
	Mohun Bagan gave a better account of themselves in the second half and created lot of scoring chances but poor finishing by their forwards led them down especially Barreto who missed four scoring chances.         
	Twice his try was saved on the goalline by defender Rowilson Rodrigues and substitute B.A. Raju.         
	Churchill made it 4-0 when Felix trying to dribble past Deepak failed in his bid. The ball fell on the path of Odafe who shot in on the run to complete the rout to remain the leading scorer with 19 goals. Bagan remained fifth on the table with 32 points while Churchill are placed third with 38 points.

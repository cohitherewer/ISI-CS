The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | TFA seals deal with Sheffield
                                                                                                                       7                                      TFA seals deal with Sheffield
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Tata Football Academy (TFA), on Tuesday in Jamshedpur, announced a tie-up with the worlds oldest club Sheffield United, of England.         
	As part of this tie-up, the Championship side will formulate a 12-month programme on coaching, fitness and professional development of coaches.         
	During this time, Sheffield United will depute one coach and a fitness advisor. While the coach in charge will be entrusted to impart lessons on technical aspects of the game, the fitness coach will advise the team on sports science, strength and conditioning work and dietary requirements.         
	Dave McCarthy, former Sheffield United manager and now the operations director will pay a visit in the first week of September.         
	There will be an exchange visit too, where the TFA coaches will travel to South Yorkshire to study the coaching pattern, strength and condition methods.         
	This apart, a few outstanding cadets of the TFA will also have an opportunity to train at the Sheffield academy periodically.         
	It is for the first time in its 24-year history that the TFA has signed a deal with a European club.         
	In earlier days, they used to travel to Germany or Brazil on exposure trips and on one such trip the TFA Blue Shylo Malsawmtluanga had the chance to play against German star Lucas Podolski.         
	We are really looking forward to a fruitful one-year association with the Sheffield United, Satish Pillai, head of Corporate Social Sustainabilty, Tata Steel, said from Jamshedpur.         
	When asked why the TFA went for an English side when they could have easily inked a deal with some Spanish or Dutch side, Pillai said, even Sheffield is a big English club with a rich history and fantastic training facilities.         
	The total cost of the project is  20,000 even though Pillai said he would not be able to disclose the exact figure.         
	The English clubs vice-president, Ian Cameron said that they had lot of things in common with the Tatas.         
	Sheffield is known for its steel and Tata being one of the leading steel companies of the world there will be an instant connect.         
	India is a vast market and so we are hopeful of tapping that, he said.         
	Cameron, however, ruled out any acquisition of football clubs in this part of the world.         
	Yeah we have acquired clubs in China and Hungary but right now we have no plans to acquire a club in India, he said.

	Melbourne: Roger Federer and Serena Williams were given the royal seal of approval after dazzling performances at the Australian Open on Thursday.         
	Britains Prince William was in the stands at the Rod Laver Arena admiring the Swiss masters win over Romanias Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 in the second round. Federer later thanked the Prince for attending and shared a private moment with him before Serena Williams and her mother Oracene posed for a photograph with the second in line to the British throne.         
	Federers polished display dispelled any doubts about his prospects of winning the first Grand Slam of the year after he survived a scare in his opening match with Igor Andreev. Its still early on in the tournament, he said.         
	Serena had earlier joined older sister Venus in the third round as the main contenders continued to move safely through the draw.         
	Serena had no problems defeating Czech Petra Kvitova 6-2, 6-1 and is steadily improving as she tries to defend the title she won last year while Venus cruised to a 6-2, 7-5 victory over Austrias Sybille Bammer.         
	The former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic bowed out after a 6-7, 7-5, 6-4 loss to unseeded Argentine Gisela Dulko while Marcos Baghdatis defeated Spains David Ferrer, the 17th seed.         
	Nikolay Davydenko steam-rollered Ukraines Illya Marchenko 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 to maintain his unbeaten start while Hewitt survived a dogged challenge from American Donald Young to win 7-6, 6-4, 6-1.         
	Meanwhile among the Indians, Mahesh Bhupathis reunion with Max Mirnyi began on a disappointing note as the fourth-seeded duo made a stunning first round exit from the Open even as Leander Paes and Sania Mirza notched up wins with their respective partners.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy were the first to take the court and the third seeds didnt have much trouble in sailing past Czech duo Leos Friedl and David Skoch 6-3, 6-1 in the first round of the mens doubles. But the new combination of Bhupathi and Belarusian Mirnyi disappointed with a 4-6, 4-6 loss to the unseeded German-Finnish pair of Michael Kohlmann and Jarkko Nieminen.         
	Tenth seeds Sania and her Spanish partner Virginia Ruano Pascual ended the day with a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 triumph over the unseeded Indonesian-Japanese duo of Yayuk Basuki and Kimiko Date Krumm. (Agencies)

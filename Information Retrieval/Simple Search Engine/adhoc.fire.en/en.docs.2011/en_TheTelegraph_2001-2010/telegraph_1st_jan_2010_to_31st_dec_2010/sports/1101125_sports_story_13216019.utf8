	Guangzhou: Uzbek wrestler Jakhongir Muminov became the second doping case of the Asian Games, on Wednesday, when he failed a drugs test and was disqualified. The 23-year-old student competed in the Greco-Roman 84kg division and lost on Monday in the quarter finals.         
	The athlete has been disqualified from these Games and his performance has been nullified, said Dr. Mani Jegathesan, chairman of the Olympic Council of Asias medical committee.         
	The Games has seen one previous drugs scandal, also involving an athlete from Uzbekistan who was also named Muminov, although they are not believed to be related.         
	Judoka Shokir Muminov won a silver medal but had it taken away and was thrown out of the multi-sport extravaganza after testing positive for methylhexaneamine, a stimulant used widely as a nasal decongestant. It was the same drug involved in Wednesdays case.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger thrills fans with Open surge 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger thrills fans with Open surge 
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	For Tiger Woods it was his moment of redemption: the point in time he knew that, whatever the outcome in the final round of the US Open at Pebble Beach Sunday night, he had won back many of the hearts and minds of the huge crowds that follow him.         
	Woods, the tarnished man, they still question. But Woods, the genius golfer, they obviously want more than ever.         
	And it was the final approach shot in his third round that sealed it  a faded three-wood around a tree to within 20 feet of the flag 280 yards away, on one of the most famous finishing holes in golf. The shot, stunning in the extreme, set up an eagle chance, but more than anything it threw down a marker to all those who had doubted him. His speciality is to make fools of us all and to feed off the adulation of the watching public.         
	You could not say that Woods had merely been making up the numbers in the first two rounds, but he certainly did not look like the player who won his first US Open here ten years ago, when he cruised to victory by 15 strokes. Much of the talk before the week was whether he was about to be usurped as world No.1 by Phil Mickelson, and all the signs pointed in that direction.         
	At the start of the third round, Woods trailed Graeme McDowell, the leader from Northern Ireland, by seven strokes. Going into the final round, he found himself five shots behind Dustin Johnson, two behind McDowell and two strokes ahead of Mickelson, who lost his grip in a third round of 73. Nobody dared rule him out now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar: Wont have a second Murali
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar: Wont have a second Murali
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, at the post match press conference, said that after scoring over 500 runs, the thought of losing the Test match didnt cross his mind.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Thoughts on comprehensive victory         
	We couldnt have scripted it better. When we came here on the first day, we got off to a good start. Second day was washed out and there were some doubts in my mind whether we could get a result. Once we got that 500-run platform and the way Lasith (Malinga) bowled, there was no way we were going to lose .         
	If the team was tense that Muralidharan may not get his 800th victim         
	There was a chance of that happening. In the dressing room, we all agreed that we have to go out there and enjoy and back Murali. There was no one other than Murali who could have done it. He has done so much for us over the years... He never spoke about 800 wickets, the media did...         
	On Muralis replacement         
	You are not going to find another Murali. Therell be just one so theres no point in looking for another Murali. He played for 18 magnificent years and hes been the best bowler ever to play the game. For me, leading a side without Murali is a huge loss. It gives us an opportunity to see how really the other bowlers will be able to give us Test wins. I dont think anyone from now on will regularly take eight or nine wickets in an innings for us. They might to do it once in a while.         
	Special plans for Murali         
	I dont think we gave Murali a gift, he gave us one. At the start the game I said that if Murali picks up eight wickets, we will win the match. People like Arjuna Ranatunga were able to get us to this state. If we can get Muralis service in some way or the other, be as a consultant or any other way or even just to come and sit and have a chat in the dressing room is a great thing. We are sad, but happy that Murali has presented us with a win.         
	On Indias performance         
	The Indians were constantly under pressure. When Viru (Sehwag) got away, we tried a couple of things to get him out. It was important that we used Lasith and Murali in spells that counted and got us wickets. I think in every spell, they manged to do that.

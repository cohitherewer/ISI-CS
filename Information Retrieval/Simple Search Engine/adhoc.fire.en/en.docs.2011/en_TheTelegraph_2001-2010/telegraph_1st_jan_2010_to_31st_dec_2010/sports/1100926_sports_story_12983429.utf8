The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kalmadi takes responsibility
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kalmadi takes responsibility
    - Fennell gets into the preaching act           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Suresh Kalmadi, the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (OC) chairman, on Saturday finally admitted to being morally responsible for the mess surrounding the multi-sport event, but also blamed the government for delaying the completion of the infrastructure.         
	While Kalmadi said the scenario would have been better had the government agencies handed over the Games venues in time, Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Mike Fennell felt the Games had dented Indias image.         
	Addressing a news conference jointly with Fennell at the swanky Media Press Centre (MPC), Kalmadi said: I am the chairman of Organising Committee and I will take all the responsibility. There is no issue. But I wish the venues were handed to us a little earlier.         
	However, when asked whether he would quit from his post, Kalmadi, who at times was fumbling with his answers under the continuous grilling of mediapersons, refused to resign.         
	The role of the Organising Committee is the conduct of the Games. I am not involved in construction. It is not my responsibility.         
	Yes, monitoring is my responsibility. I am not going to quit, said Kalmadi, adding he would talk to all doubting Thomases after the Games was over.         
	He also refused to admit that Fennell and other the CGF officials are putting the blame solely on the OC.         
	I dont think he (Fennell) has blamed the OC. The developer has to hand the venues over to OC and our responsibility comes after that.         
	As far as the Games Village is concerned, 18 towers were handed to us and we completed the work on time. The rest 18 were handed over late and that what the problem is, he said.         
	Contrary to popular belief that OC had the right to spend Rs 30-40,000 crores on the organisation, we only had Rs 1,600 crore allotted. The rest was taken care by the government and Indian Olympic Association.         
	Kalmadi sought to blame various agencies who were handed the rights for construction and renovation of the stadiums and Games Village.         
	Everyone had fixed responsibilities. Our job was to ensure that the athletes of all countries would reach safely, ensure that there stay is comfortable, Kalmadi said.         
	Kalmadi also said that he was confident that everything will be completed before the opening ceremony on October 3.         
	According to Kalmadi, the Games Village is fine. We have some issues in the Games Village but I think it is a fine Village, he said.         
	Only that some blocks have to be cleaned up. But the entire infrastructure is good... I can assure you that our aim is to host a good Games. Our aim is to do as good as Melbourne did in 2006.         
	Fennell also agreed to share the blame for the mess. We all have to share the blame and take responsibility. In any Games, there are a number of stakeholders. Overall, we have to ensure that we do everything to conduct the Games.         
	Other Games have had problems and I believe that here too the problems would be sorted.         
	A number of issues should have been and could have been avoided. Necessary corrective steps should be taken in good time, Fennell said.         
	I hope India would learn a lesson. We,too, have learnt a lesson he said.         
	[PTI adds: Fennell has rubbished Organising Committee secretary general Lalit Bhanots view that the other nations standard of hygiene is different from that of India, saying his opinion was unacceptable.         
	That was unacceptable. Hygiene has no nationality. Its same all over the world, Fennell said.         
	Reacting on the issue, Kalmadi said that the controversy could have been avoided.]         
	The CGF boss did not criticise the Games Village and said that calling off the Games was never on the agenda of the CGF.         
	There are difficulties in areas like wi-fi service, medical services and generally speaking, all the matters that relate to living in the Village. They are being worked out, he said.         
	Following the action that has been taken by the government to ensure that the remedial work is done, I am very pleased to receive the news that the countries who were not convinced, have instructed their teams to travel to Delhi, Fennell added.

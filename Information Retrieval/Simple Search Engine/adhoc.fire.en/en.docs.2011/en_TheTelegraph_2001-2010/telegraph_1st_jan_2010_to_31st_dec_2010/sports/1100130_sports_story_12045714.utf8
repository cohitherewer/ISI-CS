The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jyoti, Shiv hang on 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jyoti, Shiv hang on 
                      
	Doha: Jyoti Randhawa returned a sub-par card, while Shiv Kapur also made the cut but it was end of all roads for compatriot SSP Chowrasia in the Qatar Masters, here on Friday.         
	After a poor opening round of 77, Randhawa produced a vastly improved three-under 69 on Friday to join Shiv, who carded 72 on the day, at the 56th place and barely squeezed themselves inside the cut line set at two-over 146.         
	After his opening round of 75, Chowrasia also needed a better show but the Kolkata pro stuttered to six-over 78 to crash out.         
	Australian Brett Rumford (135) fired six-under 66 to grab the lead with overnight leader Bradley Dredge (69) following from just one shot behind.         
	The 32-year-old, who returned to Europe in 2009 after a year on the PGA Tour where he failed to retain his playing card, reached 9 under. His back again wall, Randhawa stared at an early exit after a poor front nine which left him two-over at the turn.         
	The lanky Indian pro redeemed himself with five birdies in his flawless back nine to sneak inside the cut line. Shiv, a 10th tee starter, also looked in trouble and was one-over after 15 holes before the seventh hole birdie saved his bacon.

	New Delhi: The doping tests conducted by National Anti Doping Agency (Nada) and the subsequent positive results of 12 sports persons in the last 10 days could only be the tip of the iceberg.         
	On Friday night, two officials from World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) descended at the National Institute of Sports in Patiala and took random samples of athletes selected for Commonwealth Games.         
	There are growing fears that India could face further embarrassment on the eve of the Commonwealth Games if more sports persons are found guilty.         
	According to SAI sources, the two Wada officials, both Australians, went to the players hostel on Friday night and took samples of eight weightlifters. In the morning, they asked the boxers to produce their samples.         
	The WADA officials are still in Patiala and are expected to collect samples of sports persons of all other disciplines, said a source in the Sports Authority of India (SAI).

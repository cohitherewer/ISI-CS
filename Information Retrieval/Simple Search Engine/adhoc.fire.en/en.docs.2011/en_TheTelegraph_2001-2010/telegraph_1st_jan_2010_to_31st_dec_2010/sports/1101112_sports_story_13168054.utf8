The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohit doubles Bengal agony
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rohit doubles Bengal agony
  - Tiwary amp; Co. floor chances galore as the visitors make merry       A STAFF REPORTER            Rohit Sharma on way to his unbeaten 200, at the Eden, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: As far as persistent lunacy goes, Bengal are peerless. The hosts paid the price of dropping Ajinkya Rahane, who eventually scored a century Wednesday. On Thursday, they made the same mistake of grassing Rohit Sharma (200 not out) thrice to compound their own misery.         
	Rohit made his chagrin public after missing a hundred against Saurashtra. But against Bengal, on Thursday, he took full toll on a listless attack to register a fantastic double century. The Mumbai batsman had scored 205 against Gujarat in 2006-07 and had marched to his maiden triple hundred against the same team in Ranji Trophy last year.         
	Resuming from their overnight score of 287 for 4, Mumbai declared at 621 for 8. Like a bully, the visitors cornered Bengal by removing star batsman Arindam Das (8). The day ended with Bengal resting at 28 for 1 in 15 overs.         
	On evidence of the first days play, Bengal had to make the most of the first hour. Ranadeb Boses third ball could have ended Rohits monarchical status had Wriddhiman Saha showed some more alacrity behind stumps.         
	The ball was pitched up and Rohit fished outside off sending a nick to the keeper. But Wriddhiman made heavy weather of what looked a simple regulation catch.         
	Bengal fielders seemed to take turns to chalk out Rohits escape route when Sreevats Goswami failed to pounce on another opportunity off Bose. Rohit, who often inspires awe with his lazy elegance, flapped loosely but the ball fell just short of the fielder at first slip.         
	But lady luck hadnt deserted Manoj Tiwarys men completely. Boses efforts were rewarded when Abhishek Nayar (19) sent a nick to Arindam Das at slip. Little later, Ajit Agarkar (4) obliged Dinda by offering an edge to Goswami. Bengals quota of luck seemed to end with it, as from here on Mumbai dominated the proceedings entirely.         
	After his good show against Saurashtra, Iqbal Abdulla (81) rooted in for another courageous knock. The Mumbai spinner showed the tenacity for an innings revival. Mumbai scored 73 runs in the first hour despite losing two wickets and added 100 more to reach 450 by lunch on the second day.         
	Rohit gave both Sourasish Lahiri and Manoj Tiwary a hostile welcome. He cracked Sourasishs first ball for four and then planted him into the rubble for a six.         
	The Bengal skipper was plundered for 14 runs in his first over.         
	Tiwary took the ball hoping to break the Rohit-Abdulla partnership. But his dream soon vanished when Rohits six off his first ball disappeared into the construction site. The game was held up forcing the umpires to change the ball. Rohit had sailed to 99 with that shot. A double off the next completed his seventh Ranji hundred.         
	It was surprising to see Tiwary not employ Ranadeb Bose, who was the teams best bowler in the morning. Bose, who had bowled 20 overs Wednesday, got only six in his first spell, which was also his last of the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Elephants pray for a miracle

	Johannesburg: Ivory Coast need one of the unlikeliest results in World Cup history if they are to prolong their stay at the 2010 tournament. The Ivorians retain just the slimmest of mathematical chance of qualifying for the last 16 stage.         
	Sven-Goran Erikssons team have to beat an already-eliminated North Korea in Nelspruit in the last Group G match on Friday  but thats an easy part.         
	At the same time Portugal have to lose to Brazil in Durban  not impossible. And there also have to be a nine-goal swing in Ivory Coasts favour  almost inconceivable. Theres one match to go and we owe it to ourselves to win it and hope events go in our favour, said defender Guy Demel, insisting The Elephants still retained hope of an incredible outcome. Nothings over yet.         
	World Cup history is not in Ivory Coasts favour. A one-goal loss by Portugal to five-time champion Brazil would require the Ivorians to win by at least eight and in the 80-year history of the World Cup there have been just six matches with an 8-0 scoreline or greater.         
	North Korea has been stung by their 0-7 defeat by Portugal, and is eager to make amends against the Ivory Coast on Friday.         
	Tactically speaking we fell apart, said North Korea coach Kim Jung Hun, who took responsibility for the change in his teams formation at halftime that led to six second-half goals from the Portuguese.         
	Back home I believe that they will look at the next game, Kim said. We have one left. We will reinforce our mental abilities and really work well.         
	Midfielder An Yong Hak said the mood in the locker room wasnt good following the Portugal match, which was the first North Korea game abroad to be aired live prime-time on state TV in the isolated country.         
	An said the Ivory Coast game is a chance to regain lost pride in their first World Cup appearance in 44 years.

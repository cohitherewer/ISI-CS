	Johannesburg: Diego Maradona has apologised to Uefa president Michel Platini over comments he made about the Frenchman.         
	After his Argentina side effectively booked themselves a place in the knockout phase, Maradona produced a letter, which he claimed had been written by the Uefa chief.         
	He says he has never said what you (reporters) told me, so through you I would like to aplogise to Mr Platini.         
	Platini allegedly derided Maradonas ability as coach.(AFP)

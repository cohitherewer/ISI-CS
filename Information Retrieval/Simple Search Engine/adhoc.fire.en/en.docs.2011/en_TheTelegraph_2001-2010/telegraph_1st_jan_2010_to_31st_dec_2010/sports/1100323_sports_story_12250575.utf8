The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We need punch in batting: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      We need punch in batting: Sourav
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly admitted that his team were around 10 runs short after they succumbed to their third defeat on the trot in the Indian Premier League.         
	The Knights were humbled by the Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians by seven wickets in Mumbai on Monday.         
	Speaking at the media conference, the former India captain said that his team needed to pack more punch in their batting to finish on the right side of the score line. However, he also observed that the bowling at the beginning was not up to the mark as well.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If they were a few runs short         
	I wont say it was competitive. Probably we were 10 runs short 160-170 would have been a good target. But we didnt bowl well upfront. Spinners were difficult to get away with on this wicket.         
	Not being able to score enough runs despite having wickets in hand         
	In the last match we were on the wrong side of a pretty ordinary wicket. We need to bat better. We are batting well but not well enough. We have gone off the accelerator. We need to get those extra 10-15 runs Need to get that punch in our batting.         
	Sachins hammering of Ishant Sharma         
	He (Sachin) is a great player. He has done that to a few bowlers. Hope Ishant will learn from this.         
	On his two brilliant catches         
	All of us can get better  We need to pull off a few of those things.         
	Whether retaining Owais Shah instead of Brad Hodge was right         
	I knew my four best foreign players. Unfortunately, Charl Langeveldt was injured. Dont know if he will be fit for the next match         
	If he should have opened the bowling with slow bowlers         
	We bowled only two overs with fast bowlers. With a frontline India pacer and Shane Bond in the team, you have to use them. And (Chris) Gayle did come on in the third over. You need at least that much breathing space.         
	On Gayles good form         
	He played well, kept the innings together till the end. We needed one big over, it didnt happen. (Lasith) Malinga and Harbhajan (Singh) bowled really well at the death.         
	His decision to open the innings         
	Myself and Gayle will open from now on. As far as the middle-order is concerned, will see how it goes.

	Pennsylvania: After 12 years of working, sweating and wondering when he would finally win in the United States, Justin Rose has begun to make it look easy. Rose won his second tournament on the PGA Tour in a month on Sunday, taking the AT amp;T National on a day nearly as hot as he was.         
	Following up his June victory at the Memorial Tournament by shooting a round of par 70 on the difficult Aronimink Golf Club layout, Rose edged the charging Ryan Moore, who shot 65, by one stroke, and Jeff Overton (67) by two.         
	Rose, a 29-year-old Briton, eagled the ninth hole for a front-nine 33, then faltered slightly at the turn with three-putt bogeys at the 10th and 11th holes. Those three-putts broke a streak of 274 consecutive holes without a three-putt, turned a five-stroke lead into a two-stroke margin over Overton and Charlie Wi (69) and refocused Rose on the business at hand.         
	He reeled off seven straight pars, the last with a two-putt from 25 feet at the 18th, to post a 10-under-par total of 270. With that two-putt, he erased any doubt about whether his blown three-stroke lead last week at the Travelers Championship had any lingering effect and reinforced the belief that his win at the Memorial probably should have given him entre to the United States Open field.         
	Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal was done in by a poor front nine as he turned in his worst card of the week -- a four-over 74 -- to sign off tied 41st.         
	Atwal, who got to play in the tournament courtesy a Sponsors Exemption handed out by his friend and practice partner Tiger Woods, ended his campaign with a total of three-over 283.         
	The Orlando-based golfer, in joint lead after the opening round, was off to an ominous start as he stumbled to a bogey on the first hole.         
	His poor form continued when he dropped two more strokes on the third and sixth holes to make the turn three-over.         
	It was a similar story on the back nine as he dropped shots on the 12th and 14th. His only birdie came on the 16th but that was just not enough to change his fortunes.         
	Atwal, however, did manage to finish ahead of Woods (71), who ended tied 46th at four-over 284. I was obviously a little worried about today based upon last Sunday, theres no doubt about it, Rose said. But I just had to try to stay within my rhythm. I was walking slow, trying to stay real calm  did a great job of that. Probably made it a little closer than it needed to be with a couple of shaky three-putts on 10 and 11.

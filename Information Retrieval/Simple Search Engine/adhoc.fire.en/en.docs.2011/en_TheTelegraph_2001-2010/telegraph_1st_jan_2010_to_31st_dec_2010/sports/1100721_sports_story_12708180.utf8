The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian hockey hits a new low
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian hockey hits a new low
                      
	New Delhi: Indian hockey was rocked by a fresh controversy on Tuesday with a member of the womens team sending a written complaint alleging sexual harassment against one of the coaching staff.         
	The member alleged that one of the coaching staff had asked for sexual favours and used vulgar language during a recent Canada and China tour.         
	Following the complaint, Hockey India (HI) has set up a four-member committee to probe the allegation, general secretary Narendra Batra said.         
	The committe comprises Rajiv Mehta, as its chairman, and former players Zaffer Iqbal and Ajit Pal Singh and Sudharsan Pathak, Batra said.         
	Today, a womens team member has mailed me a written complaint of sexual harassment, usage of vulgar language and asking for sexual favours against a coaching staff, Batra said.         
	Batra said he had also received an anonymous mail last Friday, where allegations had been levelled against the videographer of the team for having being involved in a sexual orgy with prostitutes during the foreign tour. He said five photographs of the videographer with the prostitutes had also been mailed to him.         
	Batra said the sport ministry had been apprised of the complaints. The government had suggested a lady representative be appointed in the committee, and so, Pathak was inducted.         
	The committee had its first meeting on Monday and decided that the videographer will not be accompanying the team on upcoming tours pending the inquiry.         
	Batra also said such complaints will be looked at seriously and assured that there will be no harassment or intimidation of those making the allegations.         
	I would also like to urge the player to file a formal police complaint. The other players should also come forward with their grievances. They dont have to worry about their future selection and safety. Hockey India will help them financially if they want to go to court, Batra said.         
	Batra said the disciplinary committe will meet again Wednesday to take stock of the situation.         
	The committee will have a meeting Wednesday and we are confident of completing the investigation within 4-5 days. Whoever is found guilty, Hockey India will impose life ban on him, Batra added.         
	It is a shameful chapter in Indian hockey. It is a very serious issue and we will deal within with a firm hand, he added.                 (AGENCIES)

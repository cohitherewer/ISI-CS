	 New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar has found a fan in South Africas triple Olympian swimmer Roland Schoeman, who says the champion cricketer inspires him to do the extraordinary in the pool. Im very fond of cricket and Sachin (Tendulkar) is my favourite. In fact I take a lot of inspiration from him. Sachin, Lara (Brian) and (Michael) Phelps are the kind of sportspersons who have the ability to inspire every athlete of any discipline. They can unite the nation as well, Schoeman, who holds the world record in short-course 50m freestyle, said.

We saw Prince Charles meeting the England weightlifting team at the training center. But to our surprise, he also came to the area where our lifters were training and shook hands with us. He asked Renubala what was the mantra of the Indian lifters success, Rao said.

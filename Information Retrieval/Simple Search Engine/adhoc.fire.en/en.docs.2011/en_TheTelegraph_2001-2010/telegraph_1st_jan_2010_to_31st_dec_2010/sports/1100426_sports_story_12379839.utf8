The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru fills Warner with Test dream
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru fills Warner with Test dream
                  David Warner                     
	Melbourne: Swashbuckling Indian opener Virender Sehwag has inspired Australian big-hitter David Warner, who is considered a Twenty20 specialist, to think of a Test future.         
	Both Warner and Sehwag play for the Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League and have struck up a friendship.         
	He said you have to play as much cricket for your country.         
	He said youll be playing Test cricket in the next two years and youll be taking over my record of most runs in a day.         
	He has scored something like 284 runs in a day and said he wanted me to get 300, Warner was quoted as saying by a daily.         
	It put a smile on my face and its a challenge for myself. I want to play Test cricket, he said.         
	Warner said Sehwag told him to target Test batting records.         
	Sehwag said in Tests you can play all your shots and if an opposition is 0-100 off 15 overs in a Test, youll have them run off their feet, Warner said.         
	 I said its a good philosophy to have and if I can open the batting in first-class cricket for NSW, Ill play my attacking role but also knuckle down when the time comes. If I can play a quarter of the Tests Punter (Ricky Ponting) has played Ill be happy, he added.         
	Warner studied the batting approach from some of the games biggest names in the IPL, including Sachin Tendulkar  he rarely tries to hit a six in the first 10 overs and respects his wicket.         
	But he was also impressed by the intensity of Englishman Paul Collingwood and New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori during net sessions.         
	Theyre just focused on hitting the next ball, its like a match for them, Warner noted.         
	With the IPL now over, Australians now head to the West Indies for the Twenty20 World Championship and Warner said the ODI world champions stand a good chance of grabbing the top honours in the Caribbean.         
	I reckon we have got the team to go through and win it.         
	Weve got four quicks who bowl over 150km/hour plus and well be playing on wickets that dont bounce during the day, he said.         
	Spin is also a key in Twenty20 cricket, and we have two of them (Nathan Hauritz and Steven Smith), (David) Hussey can bowl part-time, and obviously Pup (Michael Clarke) as well, he added.

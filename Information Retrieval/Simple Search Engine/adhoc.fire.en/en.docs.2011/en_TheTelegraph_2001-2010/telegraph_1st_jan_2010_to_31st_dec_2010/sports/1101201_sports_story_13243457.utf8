The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We must take our chances: Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      We must take our chances: Gambhir
  - I am enjoying the captaincy and trying to do my best... It is a challenging job       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Jaipur: Indian captain Gautam Gambhir is not disturbed by the fact that the second one-day International on Wednesday, at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, would be played on a wicket that saw Hyderabad getting skittled out for a mere 21 runs, in a Ranji Trophy Plate match against Rajasthan earlier this month.         
	Speaking to the media after a practice session, Gambhir said that he was aware of what had happened in the Ranji tie and India must take their chances on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The batting plan and team composition         
	Its always good to score as many runs as possible in the subcontinent. If we are batting first, 300 should be a good score but because of the dew factor, the more we score the better. It would be better for our bowlers. There is no point thinking about the team composition and wicket right now as we are going to talk to the coach. The wicket looks dry and it might spin a bit if we bowl first.         
	His batting         
	I am doing fine now. In Guwahati, we (Murali Vijay and I) gave a reasonably good start to the team. In ODIs, you have to play with a certain goal in mind. I think all of us did that in the first match. I am sure bigger scores will come from my bat very soon.         
	Ashish Nehra and Sreesanth not bowling at the nets         
	Nehra is a very experienced campaigner and is bowling in good rhythm at the moment. Sreesanth has also bowled a lot in the Test series and doesnt need to bowl that long. Moreover, on subcontinent wickets, batting is also very important. In the end, the team that will play good cricket for 100 overs, will be the eventual winners.         
	On his captaincy         
	As far as captaincy is concerned, you need to take care of the entire unit. As a player you have to take care of yourself only. For the moment, I am enjoying my captaincy and trying to do my best. It is a challenging job and a big honour. As I have always said a captain can be as good as his team and this has been a very good team effort. I am enjoying the stint.         
	Team fitness         
	All the players are absolutely fit and there is no injury worry at the moment.         
	Indias chances in the ODI series         
	We must take our chances. In Guwahati, we started well with a fine victory. All we want to do now, is to carry on from where we started in the first match. This is a young side and are shaping up very well.         
	On the wicket         
	We are aware of what happened in the Hyderabad-Rajasthan Ranji match here. But, at that time, there was a lot of grass on the wicket. Now, there is not much grass. The wicket is on the slower side at the moment. It, however, may take spin.

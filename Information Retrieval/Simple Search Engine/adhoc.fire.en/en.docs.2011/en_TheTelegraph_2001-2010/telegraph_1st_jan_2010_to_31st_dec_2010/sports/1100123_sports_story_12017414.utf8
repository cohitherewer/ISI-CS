	Calcutta: Come Saturday and the battle royale will get underway at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.         
	Almost all the participants of the Vodafone Royal Trophy from the various Royal golf clubs tested the greens on the eve of the mega event. Going by the intense practice session in the afternoon and the strategies being discussed at the welcome dinner, there were clear signs that the camaraderie was sure to end on the first tee!         
	Former England cricket captain Tony Lewis who is now on a mission to achieve success in his other loved sport, golf, and is representing his club, The Royal Porthcawl Golf Club. We will give our best shot although we are not sure of the other teams strengths, said Lewis after the practice round.         
	I am aware of the RCGCs heritage and I am proud to be a part of the first edition of this historic event, he added. Lewis is paired with Hugh Child.         
	The fortunes of hosts Royal Calcutta Golf Club are led by the Captain of the club, Aveek Sarkar, who will pair up with the president of the Indian Golf Union, Ashit Luthra to form the RCGC A team. Asian Games gold medallist Lakshman Singh and Aditya Khaitan will represent RCGC B while RCGC C team comprises Ranobir Sen and Partha Gupta.         
	In the current format, a team consists two golfers each. Taking the full advantage of the format, The Royal Melbourne Golf Club has fielded three teams who are actually paired as life partners too! The opening round will be played on an eclectic Stableford format while the final round will see the golfers playing in the Texas Scramble format.         
	The RCGC, which is one of the toughest courses in the country, is primed for the gala event. The strategically placed bunkers, large trees and water bodies demand accuracy. With the touch of Royalty around, its not going to be an easy task for the golfers, many of whom will be getting a first feel of the course.         
	It is on this count  familiarity to the course and the conditions  that the RCGC teams will enjoy a distinct advantage over the other teams.         
	The field is quite open and its going to be intensely competitive. Any of the famous clubs can win, said Luthra.         
	Over the years, by frequent visits to celebrate each others special occasions, the ties between the Royal Clubs has been maintained. In order to make the bond stronger, the RCGC mooted the Royal Trophy.         
	Weve already received expression of interest from other Royal Clubs enquiring if they could hold the next edition. The interest shown proves that the longevity of the tournament is assured, explained Luthra.         
	The excitement was on a high pitch with more than 90 players teeing up on Friday for the invitational golf tournament.         
	Anirban Nath played some superb golf to take the honours in the 0-16 handicap category aggregating 35 stableford points, while Angad Luthra, who finished with 32 points, ended up as the runner-up after pipping two other players on a count-back.         
	SS Das emerged victorious in the 17 amp; above handicap category with a total of 34 stableford points while Yashwant Goenka came second with 33 points.

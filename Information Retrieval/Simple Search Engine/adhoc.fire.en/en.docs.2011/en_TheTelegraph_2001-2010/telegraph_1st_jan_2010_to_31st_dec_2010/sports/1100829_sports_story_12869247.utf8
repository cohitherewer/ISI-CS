                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni rues poor batting
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            MoM Tillekaratne Dilshan after his century, on Saturday                           
	Dambulla: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni defended the youngsters despite their failure which lead to a crushing defeat in the final of the Micromax Cup. His counterpart, Kumar Sangakkara, at the press conference said that Tillekaratne Dilshans hundred and Virender Sehwags dismissal were the turning points in the final.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The turning point         
	Sangakkara: Dilshans hundred, Sehwags run out The way our bowlers bowled and kept Dhoni in check was also laudable. Solid bowling and fielding got us the victory.         
	The Indian batsmens failure to convert starts         
	Dhoni: It was the best wicket in the series. It played well. Unfortunately for us most batsmen got the starts but failed to convert them into good scores. We needed at least a couple to score big. Partnerships were needed but we didnt get going. It was disappointing. We looked like proceeding well at times, but lost wickets at crucial times.         
	If it was disappointing to see the way the youngsters batted         
	Dhoni: I would defend the players In Test matches, Suresh Raina batted well and it would be wrong to criticise him now. In Test matches, his batting was termed courageous I would say theres a thin line between being courageous and playing rash shots. If we could have delayed playing risky shots by say two or three overs, the story could have been different. Experience counts in such situations The youngsters have learnt a lot from this series.         
	His assessment of youngsters performance         
	Dhoni: As we come closer to the World Cup, we will shorten the list of these playersThey have got international experience behind them More than talent, it will be a test of character for them before and during the World Cup.         
	Rohit Sharmas dismal form         
	Dhoni: We want him to perform well considering the amount of talent he possesses. Unfortunately he has found some unlucky ways to get out.         
	The absence of Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir         
	Dhoni: Of course, their presence would have made a difference.         
	Not playing Saurabh Tiwary         
	Dhoni: I know its tough to motivate oneself if you dont get a game in a long tournament like this. But sitting in the dressing room atmosphere, you get to learn a lot about international cricket by interacting and observing The experience helps. You cant give chance to all players at all times. You judge the conditions and demands of the side while selecting the XI. You have to fight your way through.

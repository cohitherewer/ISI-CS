                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag hold Viva 2-2
                      
	Vasco: A late goal by Joshimar helped Chirag United hold Viva Kerala to a 2-2 draw in their Group B quarter finals league match of the 32nd Federation Cup, at Tilak Maidan, here on Thursday.         
	In the first half, Joshimar in the 45th minute, cancelled out Viva striker C. Sabeths 35th-minute goal. However, playing his first match, Sabeth again scored to put Viva ahead in the 53rd minute.         
	Viva Kerala looked destined to win till a moment of indiscretion on the part of their defenders allowed Joshimar to head in the match-saving goal, on the 89th minute.         
	The draw take Chirags tally to four points from two matches while Viva Kerala, who lost to Churchill Brothers in their opening fixture, have one point from as many matches. After a sluggish start against Churchill, Viva Kerala looked sharp with their attack looking dangerous at times. They had the first chance to take the lead but Sabeths header off Karmas cross from the left went over the bar.         
	Sabeth kept the rival defence under pressure throughout the match.         
	Chirag, who took time to settle down, restored parity in the stoppage time of the first half through Josimar, who converted from the spot, after he was brought down by Vascos Sharath.         
	18 minutes lat er, Sabeeth connected a well-directed low cross from the left by Vineeth, which caught the Chirag defenders napping. Going all out to avoid defeat, Chirag finally found the equaliser when Joshimar headed in a Denson Devadas through.

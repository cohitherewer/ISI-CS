The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clean sweep by Black Caps
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clean sweep by Black Caps
                      
	Christchurch: Bangladesh Thursday came closest to what can be described as taking the challenge to the hosts in the third and final ODI against New Zealand.         
	But despite an impressive maiden 100 from opener Imrul Kayes and a four-wicket haul by captain Shakib-al Hasan the visitors could not stave off a whitewash as the Black Caps replied to the visitors 241 for nine with 244 for the loss of seven wickets.         
	Not only that, riding a run-a-ball 91 from Man of the Match Martin Guptill, New Zealand raced to the target in 44.5 overs.         
	According to Cricinfo, Tim Southee picked up three for 37 for New Zealand and was able support to his captain, Daniel Vettori.

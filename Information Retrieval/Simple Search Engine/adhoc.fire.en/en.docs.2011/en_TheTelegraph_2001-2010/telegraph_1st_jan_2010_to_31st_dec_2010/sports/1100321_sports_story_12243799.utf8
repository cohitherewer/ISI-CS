The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lady with baby stumps Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                        Lady with baby stumps Sourav
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Ahmedabad: Its not often that Sourav Ganguly has been stumped. On the field, that is. Off it, he certainly was, on Friday night.         
	It was around 10clock that Sourav was in The Courtyard Marriott lobby, on the way to his room, when a couple with a baby boy, caught his attention.         
	Given the commotion, it was quite a feat.         
	Please, Sourav, I want you to just hold my baby, the lady pleaded, in The Telegraphs presence.         
	Taken aback, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain replied: Ill stand next to you... Im not good at holding babies... My days have gone...         
	Daughter Sana, by the way, is now eight.         
	The lady, in particular, was even more pleased. Ive been a huge fan of yours... Youve made my day, she said wide-eyed, as her husband recorded the moment for all time to come.         
	Security personnel asked them to move away, before the thank yous could be completed, but Sourav was glad hed been able to make somebody happy.         
	Indias most successful Test captain retired from international cricket in November 2008, but clearly continues to make a difference in the lives of many.         
	A pity Souravs team didnt do well on Saturday and he himself couldnt make much of a difference. On the field, that is.

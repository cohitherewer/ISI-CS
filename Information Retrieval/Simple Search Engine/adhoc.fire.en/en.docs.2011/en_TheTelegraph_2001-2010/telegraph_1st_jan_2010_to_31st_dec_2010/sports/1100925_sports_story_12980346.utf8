The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Most difficult tour of my career: Afridi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Most difficult tour of my career: Afridi
    - Pakistans one-day and T20 captain hints at return to Test cricket           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Shahid Afridi in Karachi, on Friday                                 
	Lahore: An exhausted-looking Shahid Afridi flew in to Karachi with three team-mates while the rest of the squad arrived in Lahore in the early hours, with a phalanx of policemen escorting the players out of both airports on Friday.         
	One-day captain Afridi has called Pakistans scandal-marred tour of England the most difficult of his career as the team staged a low-key return home after four gruelling months away.         
	Coach Waqar Younis also conceded that it had been a punishing tour on and off the field after corruption investigations engulfed the side, triggering a barrage of condemnation from the press and public.         
	It was tough because of the controversies and became very difficult to cope with, because every time we went out of the hotel people passed remarks against us, Afridi said.         
	Because of the controversies on the tour, it was the most difficult tour of my 14-year career, the explosive all-rounder added.         
	Afridi hinted at a return to Test cricket I will think about it and if the team needs it, I may consider playing the Test series against South Africa, said the explosive all-rounder.         
	The tour ended on Wednesday with Pakistan losing the one-day series 3-2. England also took the Test and Twenty20 series.         
	The tour will be remembered less for the on-field play and more for the off-field revelations by British tabloids that sparked investigations by Scotland Yard and the ICC.         
	Allegations of spot-fixing in the Lords Test against England engulfed Test captain Salman Butt along with bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif. All three were questioned by British police and returned home early to Pakistan.         
	The ICC launched another probe into a suspicious scoring pattern by Pakistan in the third one-day International at The Oval on September 17, prompting Pakistans cricket chief to hurl corruption allegations in turn against England.                   Waqar Younis      
	The PCB on Thursday hired lawyers to reply to a legal notice filed by English officials demanding an unreserved apology over the allegations by PCB chairman Ijaz Butt.         
	Pakistans problems didnt end there. In the fifth and final ODI of the series, Akhtar was caught on camera allegedly tampering with the ball, apparently running his left thumb along the balls seam before dropping the ball on the ground and standing on it with his spiked right boot. Pakistan lost the match by 121 runs.         
	Waqar said the tours length had taken its toll.         
	If you take into account the tour to Sri Lanka before we went to England, it was four months on the trot and the tour of England was difficult both on and off the field, the coach said.         
	Such a long tour is always a demanding one for the players but the scandals and controversies both on and off the field added to the pressure on us. It was not an easy tour at all in cricketing terms and also because of all the controversies surrounding it. But we have learnt a lot from it, Waqar said. We had successes against Australia which were pleasing.         
	But because of the controversies it was tough against England, because you need to go to extra effort to gee up the players when you see a report in the newspaper every other day.         
	There is a need to educate the younger players so that the future generation should not be embroiled in match-fixing controversies and I would request the PCB to enhance that education. This education needs to start from the grassroots level from boys in the age groups of 17 and 19         
	But he admitted that there was a need for the board, selectors and coaches to sit down and reassess the entire performance and discuss future planning.         
	Personally I would like to see more young blood in the team for the future, Waqar said adding he would be meeting the chairman of the board Ijaz Butt soon to chalk out the future strategy.

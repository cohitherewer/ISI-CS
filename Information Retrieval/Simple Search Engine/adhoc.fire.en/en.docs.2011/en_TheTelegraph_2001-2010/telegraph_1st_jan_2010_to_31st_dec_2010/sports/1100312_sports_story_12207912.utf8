The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We expect   KKR to be aggressive: Gilchrist
                                                                                                                       7                                      We expect   KKR to be aggressive: Gilchrist
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist is wary of Kolkata Knight Riders because his team have been there and done that. The former Australia wicket-keeper said it at a news conference on Thursday, the eve of the inaugural match of the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The Chargers started IPL 2009 after finishing at the bottom of the table in the first season of the IPL. The Knight Riders are starting this years IPL from the same position. Gilchrist spoke on the two teams chances.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether the Chargers vs the Knight Riders is a mismatch         
	We have started like that before (as the lowest-placed team). So we know we cannot take teams for granted. I dont think its a mismatch, given the nature of the game and the format. Its a new tournament, thats how I see it.         
	On KKRs chances         
	They took a controversial approach last year, but I think they have settled down this time. I would expect them to focus on the game and play an aggressive brand of cricket.         
	The Chargers missing the home advantage         
	Its a disappointment for the fans in Hyderabad, but its not in our control. And after what happened last year, were used to playing all matches away from home.         
	Foreign players being absent due to national duty         
	Every team has been affected by it, it hasnt surprised me. Thats where the management has a role to play. As the first two IPLs showed, this tournament is not about the foreigners but the Indian players.         
	The first season and this one         
	Then it was an unknown concept to everyone. There was excitement and nervousness all around. But when Brendon McCullum walked out and played that knock (a scintillating century for KKR against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the first match of the tournament), and Ganguly and Ponting celebrated a wicket together, those became enduring moments. The reality is that its a big business, serious business.         
	If IPL has helped Indian cricket         
	I am impressed with the kind of Indian talent that is seen across the board. The kids are gaining confidence. In the zonal matches (Deodhar Trophy), there have been some fantastic skills on display. But there is a lot more to cricket than T20. It is just one component. Test is the ultimate and thats got to be maintained.         
	Window for the tournament         
	The ICC and the IPL need to sit down and have a close look at it. I believe the players would like to have a window. This is the premier club tournament in the world, and it (window) only help the brand grow.         
	World T20 immediately after the IPL         
	This is going to be a great preparation for the World T20. Sure its a big workload and IPL needs to be aware that it shouldnt get too big. Modi has commented that it would not take too much time. But in terms of skills and match fitness, this helps in getting into the World Cup.         
	The Pak players absence         
	It did surprise me a bit since they are the current world champions. But there were limited positions and the teams had specific desires. Probably, they would come in next year.         
	Sachins 200 in ODIs         
	Only one man could have done it and that was him. Its a tribute to his longevity.

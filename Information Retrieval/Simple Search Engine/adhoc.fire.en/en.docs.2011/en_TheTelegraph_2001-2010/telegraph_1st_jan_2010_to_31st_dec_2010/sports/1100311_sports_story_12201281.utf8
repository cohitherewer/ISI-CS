The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods at work with swing coach
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods at work with swing coach
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Tiger Woods                           
	Tiger Woodss return to competitive golf has moved a step closer after it emerged that he has resumed work with his swing coach, Hank Haney.         
	According to reports in the US, Haney travelled to Orlando last Sunday to recommence practice sessions with Woods near his Isleworth home.         
	Haney is one of Woodss most trusted allies, having helped him win his last six Major championships, and the news that the pair have started working together again will intensify speculation that the world No. 1s return to the game could be imminent.         
	Woods has not played a tournament since crashing his car outside his home on November 27, an incident which sparked a lurid series of revelations about his extra-marital affairs.         
	The American, who has been undergoing therapy, made a televised statement apologising for his behaviour last month, but refused to set a date for his return.         
	That prompted suggestions that Woods might not play again this year, but it now likely that his return could come much sooner.         
	He resumed practising last week and, while he will not take part in this weeks event at Doral, he could return at the Tavistock Cup, a two-day exhibition event at Isleworth which begins on March 22. Failing that, the Arnold Palmer Invitational begins at Bay Hill later that week.         
	The next Major, the Masters, starts on April 8 at Augusta, one of Woodss favourite venues. It has also been suggested that Woods is considering whether to sack his caddie, Steve Williams, for speaking about his behaviour on television in his native New Zealand. Williams claimed he was angry at Woods and would have spoken up had he known about his affairs.         
	Meanwhile, media reports that Woods is working with Haney have leading golfers talking of a possible return to action for the world number one.         
	Its certainly going to be interesting to see not just how he plays but just how he handles the whole situation, Britains Rory McIlroy said on Tuesday. I think everyone is excited to see him just get back out on to the golf course and play golf and from the reports Ive heard, he seems to be swinging it well and as good as he ever was.         
	It will be exciting the next few weeks, whenever he comes back, I know a lot of people are saying Tavistock or Bay Hill, McIlroy said.It would be nice to see him back.         
	I dont know whats going to happen, how the reaction will be, said Britains Paul Casey. You know, golf is here. Golf will always be here, waiting. So we will see what happens when he does return.

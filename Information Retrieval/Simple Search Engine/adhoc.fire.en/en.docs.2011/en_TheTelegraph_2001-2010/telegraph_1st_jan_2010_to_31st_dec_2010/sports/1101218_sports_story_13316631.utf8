	Centurion: Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis scored unbeaten centuries as South Africa took complete control of the first Test against a listless India by taking a substantial 230-run lead on Friday.         
	After bundling out India for a paltry 136 in just three deliveries in the morning session, South Africa tightened the noose around the visitors by reaching a commanding 366 for two in 87 overs at stumps on the second day.         
	Amla (116 not out) and Kallis (102 not out) showed that there was no demon in the pitch. The two negotiated Indian bowlers with consummate ease with an unbeaten 200-run third-wicket stand, that came off just 282 balls, to give the upper hand to the Proteas in the series opener.         
	While Kallis brought up his 38th Test hundred with a double off S Sreesanth, Amla reached the milestone -- his 12th century -- in style with a smashing pull off Ishant Sharma. Alviro Petersen (77) and Greame Smith (62), were the other notable contributors for the Proteas who relied on Morne Morkels career-best figures of five for 20 and Dale Steyn (3/34) to demolish Indias famed batting line-up.         
	Resuming at their precarious overnight score of 136 for nine, the visitors failed to add any run to their total as Morkel got rid of Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (33) in the third ball of the day.         
	Dhoni was hit on the pad to a delivery that appeared to be going down the leg side, but the Indian captain walked even before the umpire had raised his finger.         
	With three full days left in the match, the hosts will now seek to bury the Indians under a mountain of runs and then go for the kill.         
	The South Africans got a solid start through captain Graeme Smith and Alviro Petersen while the other batsmen also stuck to their tasks admirably to put the home team in a commanding position. Smith and Petersen seemed to be in no discomfort against the Indian seamers who failed to extract any movement from the SuperSport Park wicket.         
	The pair put on 111 runs for the first wicket before off-spinner Harbhajan Singh provided the breakthrough by evicting Smith in the last over before lunch. The South African captain attempted to cut a ball that drifted onto the left-hander but only succeeded in edging it to Dhoni behind the stumps. His knock of 62 came off 87 balls and had 11 fours.         
	With the sun shining brightly, the Indian bowlers hardly looked penetrative, unlike their South African counterparts who exploited the seaming conditions with devastating effect on Thursday.         
	Smith and Petersen started cautiously but gradually opened up to unleash some fluent strokes on both sides of the wicket. Sreesanth and Ishant bowled a tidy opening spell, but hardly looked menacing as they did not have the pace to torment the batsmen.         
	Jaidev Unandkat was introduced into the attack in the seventh over of the innings and the experienced Smith welcomed him by spanking his third ball to the fence.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar, Mithun cripple Mumbai
                                                                                                                       7                                        Kumar, Mithun cripple Mumbai
                  Vinayak Samant after his half-century, in Mysore, on Monday                     
	Mysore: Pace spearheads R. Vinay Kumar and Abhimanyu Mithun took seven wickets between them as Karnataka went full throttle at Mumbai on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy final Monday.         
	Mumbai captain Wasim Jaffer was left to rue his decision to bat first as Kumar (4/61) and Mithun (3/56) led the rout and the 38-time champions folded for 233 in their first innings.         
	In reply, Karnataka were 15 for one at stumps, having lost skipper Robin Uthappa (9) to Dhawal Kulkarni in the fourth over of their innings.         
	K.B. Pawan (2) and nightwatchman Kumar (2) were at the crease at stumps.         
	Mumbai would have folded for a thinner total but for a gutsy 67 by Vinayak Sawant and useful contributions from Ramesh Powar (23), Iqbal Abdulla (30) and Dhawal Kulkarni (20).         
	Sawant batted with admirable gumption to reconstruct a shattered innings with Mumbai reeling at 106 for six at one stage.         
	Aggressive and yet cautious, Sawant raised 127 invaluable runs in the company of the lower-order batsmen and the opponent bowlers, for whom it had seemed so easy initially, were made to sweat and fret as long as he was at the wicket.         
	Earlier, Kumar, who took his seasons tally to 43, struck three quick blows to have Mumbai on the ropes.           (PTI)

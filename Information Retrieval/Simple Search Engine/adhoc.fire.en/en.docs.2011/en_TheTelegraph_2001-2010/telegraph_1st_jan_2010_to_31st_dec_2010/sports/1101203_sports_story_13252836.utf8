                                                                                                                       7                                      Pune FC test for Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan would look to put aside the disappointments they suffered in this season so far, when they begin their I-League campaign against Pune FC, in Pune, on Friday.         
	The green and maroon brigade, in comparison to their city neighbours and arch-rivals East Bengal, havent managed anything worthwhile in this season. While the red and gold brigade have already pocketed two trophies  Federation Cup and the Calcutta Football League  Bagan have only managed patchy displays.         
	Beginning the campaign with an away match is not an easy job and Pune FC will be a formidable opponent in their home ground. However, the good news for Bagan is that they will have their full squad at their disposal for the vital game.         
	With all the three foreigners  Jose Barreto, Edeh Chidi, Murithala Ali  available, coach Stanley Rozario will certainly go for maximum points. I-League is a new beginning for us Past is past and we will not waste our time thinking about it. We will give it our all, Rozario said.         
	Star striker Barreto too was confident of a good show. Our performances in the past tournaments wont affect our shosw tomorrow (Friday), he said.         
	In the other matches of the day, JCT face HAL, while Mumbai FC lock horns with Air India.         
	In Kannur, Viva Kerala will face the challenge of Salgaocar. Playing before the home crowd should boost the confidence of the Viva players, who have been undergoing strenuous training under the watchful eyes of coach P Kunhikrishnan. Viva would depend on their three foreign recruits to deliver the goods for them.         
	The team, captained by defender Nigerian Bello Rasaq, has two more foreign imports in striker Chimaokwu Felix from Nigeria and defender Charles Disah from Ghana.

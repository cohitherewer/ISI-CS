The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A lot of positives: Simmons
                                                                                                                       7                                        A lot of positives: Simmons
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Zaheer Khan, after dismissing one of his two victims, on Friday                           
	Hyderabad: It was a surprise to see Team Indias bowling coach Eric Simmons walk in for the media conference at the end of the days play, in the second India-New Zealand Test, in Hyderabad, on Friday.         
	While its debatable that what led the team management do away with the usual practice of sending a player for the media interaction, the move certainly made sense. With the lesser known New Zealand batsmen ruling the supposedly superior Indian bowlers, who better than the bowling coach can throw some light on the issue.         
	Simmons played down the fact that the Indians managed just four wickets on the day and asserted that as a coach, he is more interested getting the process right rather than concentrating on just the result.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Team Indias bowling on the day         
	I think that there are a lot of positives for us as far as our bowling is concerned. Its true that the way we bowled, we could have got a few more wickets in the first session. But having said that, we will also have to remember that though we didnt pick too many wickets, we were successful in keeping a check on their run rate.         
	On the Indians no ball problem         
	It is a strange problem However, we will have to remember that bowling a no ball not only affects a bowlers rhythm but also hampers his confidence. Ishant (Sharma) had a definite problem with no balls. He did have few problems at the nets, but we had no idea that it would snowball into such a major problem as was the case in Mohali (against Australia). But we are working on it and are confident about solving it.         
	Sreesanth missing out on a wicket because of no ball         
	It was very frustrating for Sreesanth to see that his wicket being cancelled because of the no ball. It affects the mental state of a player.         
	On Harbhajans yet another off day         
	Thats nothing major. Today he was unlucky on a couple of occasions These are phases which every player passes through.         
	His views on the wicket         
	It is difficult to comment on the nature of a wicket after the first days play An actual analysis of the track can only be done on the third or the fourth day. What is more important for us at this juncture is the fact that there is a bit more bounce and pace in the wicket for our seamers We will look to exploit that.         
	Indias plan for Saturday         
	Of course seizing the momentum in the first session  A couple of wickets would help our case But thats obvious. We recovered somewhat on Friday with the two late scalps.

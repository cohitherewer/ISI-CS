AFTER A TUMULTUOUS RUN UP TO THE XIX EDITION, WHICH GETS UNDERWAY TODAY, MILLIONS OF COUNTRYMEN WILL BE WATCHING WITH BATED BREATH AS OUR ATHLETES RUB SHOULDERS WITH SOME OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE. FROM VIJENDER SINGHS FISTS OF FURY TO ABHINAV BINDRAS UNFLINCHING ACCURACY, SAINA NEHWALS LIGHTNING SMASHES TO SUSHIL KUMARS GRAPPLING SKILLS, THE CROWD WILL BACK OUR STARS TO THE HILT. THE TELEGRAPH GIVES YOU A LOW-DOWN ON THE DISCIPLINES INDIA HAVE THE BEST CHANCE TO WIN MEDALS IN. READ ON                                            
	Athletics         
	 The absence of Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell might have taken some sheen off it but the athletics event of the Delhi Commonwealth Games promises to be enthralling nonetheless with homegrown talents such as PT Usha protege Tintu Luka gearing up to make a mark.         
	India have just nine athletics medals, including a gold, in the Commonwealth Games history but the country can look forward to a haul of at least six this time.         
	In four events  mens shot put, mens discus throw, womens discus throw and womens 4x400 relay  Indians are among the seasons top five performers.         
	India are expecting two medals from womens discus throw out of the three in the team  Krishna Poonia, Harwant Kaur and national record holder and Melbourne Games silver medallist Seema Antil.         
	In womens 800m race, Luka has improved by leaps and bounds and she broke Shiny Wilsons 15-year-old national record recently in the VTB Bank Continental Cup by running 1:59.17 to finish a creditable fifth.         
	Luka is now sixth among Commonwealth top performers this season, but the pullouts of Kenyan duo of Nancy Jebet Lagat and Janeth Jepkosgei and Britons Jemma Simpson (1:58.74) and Jennifer Meadows (1:58.88) have surely brightened Lukas chances.                         
	Badminton         
	 All eyes will be on Saina Nehwal when the badminton event kicks off on October 4. It was during the Melbourne Games when a 16-year-old Saina came into limelight. Four years on, the Hyderabadi has risen in stature.         
	Given her international standing, anything less than a gold on home turf will be a disappointment for the 20-year-old, who has only Mew Choo Wong of Malaysia to deal with as a possible threat to her title hopes.         
	On current form, world rankings and the size of the field at the Commonwealth Games, Indian shuttlers can hope to at least clinch five medals out of the 18 at stake.         
	Competition for India will come mainly from England and Malaysia.         
	In mens singles, Chetan Anand, who won the bronze in 2006 Melbourne Games, and youngster P Kashyap will spearhead the challenge.         
	Indias medal hopes will also rest on world number 13 mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V. Diju, who recently reached the quarterfinals of the World Championship last month.         
	For the mixed doubles pair of Gutta and Diju, England will be the biggest threat.                         
	Boxing         
	 If there is one sport that has made steady progress in India in the past one decade, it is boxing. Backed by professional management and right technical approach, the Indian pugilists have grown in status in the last few years, and are expected to come up with a big haul of medals in the Commonwealth Games.         
	In Melbourne, India won five boxing medals, with Akhil Kumar winning the only gold in the 56 kg category. While Vijender and Harpreet bagged silvers, Jitender and Verghese Johnson contributed a bronze medal each to boost the tally.         
	Though Akhil is expected to repeat his Melbourne showings, the focus will naturally be on Vijender Singh, the bronze medal winner in the Beijing Olympics. The middleweight boxer is currently ranked No.1 in the world, and should be able to live up to his reputation.         
	The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) has done a good job in preparing the team, thanks to a long and strenuous camp in Patiala.         
	Apart from Vijender, two other boxers  Amandeep Singh (49 kg) and Dinesh Kumar (81 kg)  are the best bets for gold medals, though some feel Suranjoy Singh (52 kg) should also make the final.                         
	Shooting         
	 In the last Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, in 2006, the Indian shooters were hailed the real heroes as they hit the bulls-eye winning 16 of Indias 27 gold medals in the Games.         
	The competition was dominated by pistol shooter Samaresh Jung, whose five golds, one silver and a bronze earned him the nickname of Goldfinger and won him the David Dixon award as the best athlete of the Games. Jung, now 40, has qualified for only the standard pistol event at his home ranges.         
	In Delhi, Indian shooters are likely to continue their domination, though the challenge this time will be spearheaded by Abhinav Bindra, the man who took Indian shooting to an unprecedented high with a gold at the Beijing Olympics.         
	His golden run, however, goes back a long way. In CWG, the crackshooter from Chandigarh is looking for a hattrick of gold medals. In Manchester 2002, Bindra won the gold in the pairs event and went on to defend it four years later in Melbourne.         
	While rifle shooter Gagan Narang, trap star Manavjit Singh Sandhu and double trap world championships gold medallist Ronjan Sodhi are all big names in their own rights, the latest addition is the womens world champion Tejaswani Sawant in the 50 metres rifle prone event.                         
	Tennis         
	 Fresh from their success in the Davis Cup World Group playoff against Brazil, India are expecting a medal rush when tennis makes its debut at the Commonwealth Games stage.         
	Out of the five events in the competition, India will be outright favourites in the mens doubles and mixed doubles events with multiple Grand Slam winner Leander Paes featuring in both.         
	Somdev Dev Varman and Sania Mirza have a lot at stake at the Games. For Sania, it will be an opportunity to revive her career.         
	She has put India on the WTA landscape but has hardly had anything to boast about in the last two years. A medal at the Games would give a huge fillip to her struggling career.         
	Rohan Bopanna, who was brilliant against Brazil will be raring to go. One of the biggest moments of his career came when he, along with Pakistans AisamulHaq Qureshi reached the mens doubles final of the US Open. Bopanna will be second entry in the mens singles and is capable of producing an upset or two. But his pairing with Somdev is also to watch out for.         
	Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, who have 23 Grand Slam titles between them, are a strong contender for gold in mens doubles. Paes and Sania will team up in mixed doubles and they will be the pair to beat in the event.                         
	Weightlifting         
	 Weightlifting has been Indias pride as well as shame in the Commonwealth Games for many years now. From 1990, weightlifting contributed to nearly half of Indias medals tally, but also brought shame when a series of lifters failed dope tests.         
	In 1990, weightlifting bagged 24 medals for India, while in 1994 and 1998 Games, it gave the country 11 and 13 medals, respectively. Indias biggest haul in weightlifting came in 2002, when they won 27 medals, including 11 gold, nine silver and seven bronze.         
	On the darker side, in 2002, Satheesha Rai and Krishnan Madaswamy were stripped of their medals in Manchester, for flunking dope tests. Four years later, Shailaja Pujari and Prameelavalli Bodari failed Wada tests, while Tejinder Singh and Edwin Raju were caught for doping during the Games. That led to Indian lifters being banned for a year and missing the 2006 Doha Asian Games.         
	Though India did not perform too well in Melbourne, winning only nine medals, the lifters are expected to do better this time. Favourites to win gold are defending champion in womens 58kg category, Renubala Chanu, K.Ravi Kumar (mens 69 kg) and Soniya Chanu (womens 48kg). Melbourne silver-medallist L.Monika Devi also will be making a comeback, after her two-year ban for doping.                         
	Wrestling         
	 In 2006, when the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) decided to remove wrestling from the Melbourne edition of the multi-sport extravaganza, it came as a rude shock for the Indians. Over the years, wrestling had remained Indias chief medal earning sport, with a tally of 23 gold medals till the 2002 Manchester Games.                   
	With the sport back in favour, thanks to Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) persuasive skills in convincing the CGF, wrestling is surely going to give a tough competition to shooting in winning highest number of medals for the hosts. This is despite the fact that four of Indias best wrestlers, including one woman, will have to watch the Commonwealth Games from outside the arena after testing positive in dope tests.         
	Yet it would be no exaggeration to say there are at least eight more wrestlers in the mens team who are good enough for podium finish. Leading the pack is World champion Sushil Kumar in the 66 kg, who is determined not to lose the gold medal in Delhi.         
	Apart from Sushil, other Indians who are strong contenders in the freestyle category are Yogeshwar Dutt (60 kg), Anil Kumar (55 kg) and Anuj Kumar (84 kg). Among the Greco-Roman grapplers, Rajinder Kumar (55 kg), Ravinder Singh (60 kg), Sunil Kumar (66 kg) and Dharmender Dalal (120 kg) have their chances.

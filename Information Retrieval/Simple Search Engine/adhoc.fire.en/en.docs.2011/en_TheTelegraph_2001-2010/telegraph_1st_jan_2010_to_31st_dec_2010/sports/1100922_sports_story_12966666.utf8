The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lalit shames the country
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lalit shames the country
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Lalit Bhanot      
	New Delhi: If the visiting Commonwealth Games delegates from abroad are horrified by the excreta and paan stains inside the Games Village, it is merely because they perceive hygiene in a markedly different way. At least, the Games Organising Committee (OC) secretary general Lalit Bhanot thinks so.         
	The controversy surrounding the Games preparations may have tarnished the countrys image, but Bhanot wonders what the fuss is all about and why he or his colleagues should feel ashamed.         
	But what shocked the media persons most, at Tuesdays hurriedly called press conference, at the OC headquarters, was his observation about how hygiene is perceived differently in India and abroad.         
	Asked why the rooms of the Village were not cleaned for the visiting athletes, the high profile OC official came up with an outlandish statement.         
	These rooms are clean to both you and us. However, it may not appear so to some others. They want certain standards in hygiene and cleanliness which may differ from our perception, commented the high profile sports administrator, who is also the secretary of the Athletics Association of India (AAI).         
	However, we have now upgraded the level of cleanliness which should be according to their standards, said Bhanot in a dismissive manner. So, we are looking into everything and we will deliver the required facilities perfectly. No country has said they are not coming, he added.         
	Bhanots attitude towards the entire issue was appalling. Throughout the press conference, the OC boss chose to downplay the matter saying it was a minor problem.         
	Why should it be considered a shame for the country? It is nothing but a small issue blown out of proportion. All I can tell you is that the issue would be resolved before the athletes arrive, said Bhanot.

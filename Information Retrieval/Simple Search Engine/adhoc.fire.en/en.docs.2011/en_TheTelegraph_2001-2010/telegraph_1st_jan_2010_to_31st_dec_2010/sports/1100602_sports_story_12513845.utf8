            CHEER LEADERS                        
	Bebetos Rocking Baby         
	Bebetos celebration after scoring against the Netherlands is one of the most memorable moments of the 94 finals. As it turned out, he and his mates did deliver the baby as Brazil lifted their fourth Cup.               
	Crouchs Robot         
	How does an abnormally tall man celebrate scoring? By doing the robot dance. The 6ft 7in tall England striker delighted one and all with his trademark moves at 06 World Cup in Germany.         
	The Roger Milla twist             
	You are never too old to come to the party. The 38-year-old Milla sure wasnt when he landed in Italy for the 1990 finals. Following a goal, he would run to the nearest corner flag and perform a twist with teammates. Normally it takes two to tango; Milla scored four goals in that Cup and celebrated each with a dance.         
	Marco Tardellis scream         
	In the arena of the Santiago Bernabeu, the Italian was the raging bull after scoring the teams second in their 3-1 win over West Germany in the 1982 final. Tardelli sprinted into his own half, shaking his fists and screaming as he shook his head wildly. He smote his         
	chest as the tears poured down his face. The moment has entered the photobook as Tardellis scream or urlo di Tardelli.         
	Ivan Kaviedess Spiderman                 
	This was Peter Parker in a footballers guise as the Ecuadorean produced a Spiderman mask from nowhere and pulled it on after his strike against Costa Rica at the 06 World Cup. It sure was funny but had a sombre message as Kaviedes wanted to pay tribute to former teammate Otilino Tenorio who had been tragically killed in a car crash a year earlier         
	Finidi Georges dog walk         
	In the group stage match against Greece, Nigerias Finidi George completed a wonderful counter-attack by hitting home and then sank to the ground to imitate a dog. George crawled for a few yards and then lifted his leg, where, with perfect timing, Daniel Amokachi gave him a friendly pat on the backside as the player pretended to take a leak.

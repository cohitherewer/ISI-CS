The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Donovan does it 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Donovan does it 
            JEFFREY MARCUS            Bill Clinton in Pretoria                           
	Pretoria: The United States advanced to the second round of the World Cup with a thrilling goal by Landon Donovan in added time. It was the second of numerous American attempts on goal that went in, but the only one that counted.         
	In the waning minutes of a 0-0 game, the United States pushed frantically, and fell victim to a counterattack. But United States goalkeeper Tim Howard saved Rafik Saifis drilled shot on goal and quickly sprung Donovan down the right sideline. Donovans speedy run advanced the ball, and his pass to Jozy Altidore used open space on the line. Altidore crossed the ball to a charging Clint Dempsey, whose shot was blocked. But Donovan, smartly trailing the play, side-footed home the winning goal.         
	The Americans won Group C after England defeated Slovenia, 1-0. The English also advanced.         
	This is the third time in six consecutive World Cup appearances that the United States have advanced to the second round. The last time was in 2002, when Donovan, then 20, led the team to the quarter finals.         
	This is only the fourth win in the past 20 World Cup games for the United States since 1990, and it was far from certain. For 90 minutes, the teams attacked each others goal, with the Americans demonstrating a distinct advantage. They had 22 shots, 10 on target, to Algerias 19, four on goal.         
	The US did see an earlier opportunity on goal go in, but the score was disallowed on an erroneous offside call. It was the second time in this World Cup that the Americans had an apparent goal negated by a dubious decision by the referees.         
	Dempsey slotted Herculez Gomezs short cross from the right into the back of the net in the 21st minute after a furious and frantic push by the United States. But the assistant referee quickly raised his flag. While the American fans were celebrating, the referee called offside. It looked close, until the television replays showed Dempsey was even with Madjid Bougherra, the last Algerian defender.         
	At the beginning of the tournament, Dempsey succinctly characterised what was at stake for the United States. If we dont get out of the group, he said, thats a failure. The United States will face the second-place team from Group D  Germany, Serbia, Ghana or Australia  on Saturday in Rustenburg.         
	This dramatic victory helps the team move on from the disappointment four years ago when it crashed out of the World Cup in the first round. The Americans did it by going out to a fast start and playing attacking soccer.

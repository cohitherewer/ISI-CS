	Guangzhou: Mariana Mohammed crashed out of the Asian Games in a bloody accident that marred the womens time trial Saturday, while three Kazakhstan field hockey players were kicked out in a case of national identity fraud.         
	Mohammed, a 32-year-old Malaysian cyclist, had the leading intermediate time when she collided with a fence on the side of the course and cartwheeled her bike. Malaysian team officials said she had a broken collarbone and a deep cut on her chin, but was in a stable condition after treatment at the Guangdong Provincial Hospital.         
	Lee Min-hye went on to win the 35.6-kilometer race in 49 minutes, 38.35 seconds, giving South Korea victories in both the mens and womens time trials.         
	South Korea swept all four gold medals at golf, including both team events. Kim Hyun-soo won the womens total at 11-under 277, while Kim Meen-whe won the mens tournament with a four-round total 15-under-par 273, nine clear of Miguel Luis Tabuena of the Philippines.         
	Japan edged China 1-0 with a goal in extra time in the earlier semi-final. It was a rare setback for team China, which is dominating the standings with 138 gold and 270 medals overall.         
	Two of those came as expected, with Li Xiaoxia rallying from a 3-0 deficit to beat Chinese teammate Guo Yue in the womens table tennis final and Ma Long defeating Wang Hao in the mens decider.         
	Another bankable gold medal was delivered in the womens badminton final, with Wang Shixian beating Chinese teammate Wang Xin 21-18, 21-15.The womens field hockey continued after Kazakhstan was stripped of its competition points and dropped to last place ahead of its final preliminary match against India.         
	Technical delegate Mathavas Deavadas said Alessya Pyotukh, Yulliya Mikheichik and Anastassiya Chsherbakova admitted they represented Belarus at a World Cup qualifying tournament in April.         
	Organisers have awarded four of the matches here to Kazakhstans opponents with a score of 5-0 while retaining South Koreas 10-3 scoreline because of a bigger victory margin.         
	The only other athlete kicked out of the games so far was a Shokir Muminov, a judo silver medalist from Uzbekistan who had his results nullified and banned from competition after testing positive for a banned stimulant in a doping test.(Agencies)

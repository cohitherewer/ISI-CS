                                                                                                                       7                                      Chanderpaul and Katich join Lancs
                      
	London: Australia opener Simon Katich and former West Indies skipper Shivnarine Chanderpaul have signed for English County side Lancashire, the club said on Thursday.         
	Left-hander Katich will join Lancashire for June before joining the Australian squad, who will take on Pakistan in a two-Test series in England in July.         
	Chanderpaul, another left-handed batsman who has also played for Durham, will join in mid-July and will play for the remainder of the season.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara was due to be the Red Rose countys overseas player for the second part of the season, but international commitments meant the move was cancelled.         
	While it was disappointing to learn that Kumar wasnt coming, it is fantastic that we have been able to secure the services of two world-class left handed batsmen to keep the continuity within the side once Ashwell Prince departs, head coach Peter Moores told the clubs website.         
	Katich has earlier played County cricket for Derbyshire, Durham, Hampshire and Yorkshire.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its better to ignore the no ball incident: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Its better to ignore the no ball incident: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: India would look to clinch a berth in the final when they take on Sri Lanka, in a potentially high-voltage tri-series clash, in Dambulla, on Sunday.         
	A win will ensure a place in the final for India as, in that scenario, Sri Lanka will be left with six points with no more matches to play while India will have secured at least nine points with a game  against New Zealand  in hand. New Zealand are in a relatively comfortable position with seven points from three matches.         
	With the no ball incident still fresh on the players mind, sparks are expected to fly when Virender Sehwag and Suraj Randiv meet on the field. However, inclement weather may play spoilsport with the met office predicting heavy rains for the next four days.         
	For India, the only possible change might be Yuvraj Singh, declared fit for Sunday after being laid low by dengue for a few days, replacing Virat Kohli.         
	Meanwhile, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, at a media conference on Saturday, said that it was time to move on from the no-ball incident and focus on the remaining matches.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If the no ball incident will have an effect on Sundays match         
	I feel that in the best interest of the team, we should forget about the incident and move on. But at the same time, we must be aggressive on the field. That really helps. We will give our best and hope that we win the game.         
	Whether the incident may change the course of Indo-Lanka rivalry         
	It is better to just ignore the incident. We try to be as aggressively as possible on the field. And that no ball incident pushes us to be more aggressive. There is a point, till which we can be aggressive on field We dont really want to cross that boundary. Of course, whatever happened was bad.         
	Importance of bonus point         
	Of course At the end of the qualifying stage it may prove to be very crucial point. So, we have to see what really happens from now on. After Sundays match, there will still be one more (against New Zealand). So, that is also a plus point for us. However, at the end of the group stages, the extra point might really prove to be crucial.         
	Fitness issues in the team         
	As of now, there are no fitness issues. Everyone is available for selection.         
	If he is concerned with Virat (Kohli) and Rohit (Sharma)s form         
	They have done well for us. When you bat under lights in these conditions, it becomes difficult. It is difficult for the top-order batsmen to score consistently. I am not too worried about their form. I am happy that (Virender) Sehwag performed well in the last game.         
	Improvement in pacers performance         
	I think the seamer-friendly conditions have worked to their advantage. Even if you bowl first, there is a bit of swing. I think they have capitalised on that. In the last game, it was really good to see that we did not bowl short of length and it was more up to the batsmen Even the spinners really did not provide any room. Overall, quite happy in the manner they are bowling.         
	If there is any special strategy to win the toss         
	I will be practising with you (to India manager Ranjib Biswal)!         
	With Zaheer yet to make a comeback, if India are prepared for World Cup         
	If we dont have any injury worries, we will be all set for the World Cup. We are not playing too many ODIs So hoping that we wont have too many injuries and players like Zaheer will return, we will be set for the World Cup. The Tests and the ODIs will give him (Zaheer) an ideal platform to be back at his best for the big tourney.         
	The inclement weather         
	The weather obviously makes a difference. Dambulla is known to be among the dry zones in Sri Lanka. We have not really seen so much rain here before. If you dont have a game and you share points, then the equations change.         
	On how the weather affects the game         
	It does affect I have always preferred batting first in Dambulla rather than batting under the lights. I am not saying that the floodlights are poor but its not great either. The first 10 to 15 overs are very crucial when you are batting under lights. If you dont lose too many wickets, then you are really set for the game. But I always prefer batting first. If theres rain, well have to see how it goes.         
	The uncertainty factor         
	When you get up in the morning, you have to be prepared for the game, irrespective of the weather conditions. All of a sudden, you may find yourself in a position where you are not really prepared and the game happens. It may be a 20-over affair. So, it is important to be focussed.         
	Seven Indians nominated for ICC awards         
	It is a reflection of the team doing really well in the last calendar year. Our cricketers dont really play for awards. But its nice if their on-field performances get recognised. So we are just hoping that we will bag as many awards as possible.

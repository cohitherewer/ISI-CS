The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni wants strict action
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni   wants   strict   action
                                        
	New Delhi: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sunday said that cricket has been brought to disrepute by the spot-fixing scandal and the guilty should be handed harsh punishment as such incidents also tend to paint other players in bad light.         
	It does not just restrict to the people who are doing it or the side they belong to. I think people start associating it with the whole fraternity, which means all cricketers. It doesnt really matter which team you belong to, he said.         
	At times what happens is, if there is a game which is low scoring, then people think it may be a fixed game. When you work so hard on a field then thats one thing you dont really want. You dont want somebody to comment that the match was fixed or whatever, he said.         
	Asked whether harsh punishments should be handed to the three Pakistani players if they are found guilty, Dhoni said, I would definitely agree with that because as I said, it doesnt restrict the opinion to you. So definitely harsh decisions need to be taken.         
	Speaking in the same vein, Harbhajan Singh on Sunday said he has never been approached by a bookie in his career and would slap anybody who dares to approach him to fix games.         
	I will slap any bookie that will come near me, big time, said Harbhajan when asked what he will do in case a bookie approaches him to fix games.         
	I have never been approached by a bookie and also, I have not seen these things happen in my career. I never feel that anyone can do such things, he told a television channel.         
	He said it would be a shame if the spot-fixing allegations against Pakistani players turned out to be true after the investigations.         
	I dont know the details of what happened in England. I read it in the newspapers but I dont know how true these allegations are. Investigation is going on and let us see if these allegations are true or not, Harbhajan said.         
	When I play for my country I am very proud of representing it. I dont know how people can do something like this. It is a shame if these things are happening, he said.         
	Harbhajan said that if the allegations are true, harsh punishment should be handed to the players.         
	Well, as Imran Khan has said, if these allegations are true, there should be punishment to set an example so that it is not repeated. ICC and the (Pakistan) cricket board should take necessary steps, said the feisty Indian off-spinner.         
	Reminded that his first captain Mohammed Azharuddin was banned by the Indian cricket board on match-fixing charges, Harbhajan simply said, saja uske liye.         
	I dont know what happened then. I was young, in and out of the team. I dont know what they were doing at that time. If they were guilty saja uske liye, he said.           (PTI)

	I feel badly let down by the African countries. And, like me, millions of fans will be feeling the same. Before the tournament, I talked about my dream of seeing at least one African team making it to the last four. But barring Ghana none could even make the second round.         
	What a disgrace this is. In their own continent they just threw away the advantage of playing at home. The Didier Drogbas and Samuel Etoos must be feeling bad but, lets face it, they caused their own undoing.         
	I very strongly feel so. After Cameroon, South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria, Ivory Coast were the latest from the host continent to take the exit route. They defeated North Korea 3-0 but with Portugal and Brazil playing out a goalless draw, it was all over for the icon of African football. Drogba that is. Now 32, I doubt whether he will be there in Brazil four years down the line.                  Ivory Coast rsquo;s Ndri Romaric, on Friday. (Reuters)      
	So what went wrong with the African teams this time?         
	The Africans are generally big-bodied and extremely powerful. But I feel they are not tactically all that disciplined. They look not very keen to execute what they have been asked to and seem to drift away during a match.         
	A coach of an African side also has to deal with huge egos. Ego has no place in a team game like soccer but try selling that idea to an African team! I liked what Zinedine Zidane said the other day about his relationship with Raymond Domenech.         
	Zidane said he never liked Domenech but gave him the respect due to a coach. Thats how a professional should behave. If, in 2006, the Togolese had a bitter fight over bonuses with their football association which virtually sealed their fate, this time the Cameroonians questioned coach Paul le Guens tactical acumen and threatened to revolt.         
	Although the Ivorians did not bicker, in hindsight, I feel they could have continued with Vahid Halilhodzic instead of putting Sven-Goran Eriksson at the helm in as late as the last week of March.         
	Having said that, I must also add that the Drogbas got anything but an easy draw. Brazil and Portugal in the same group was the last thing an Ivorian would have wanted. It was like 2006 when Argentina and the Netherlands were clubbed with the Elephants. Had they got a bit of luck during the draw this team would have gone many miles at this World Cup.        
	They had hoped for a miracle on Friday. That Brazil will score a few against Portugal and they will have a romp against the minnows from Asia.         
	 So, they attacked in hordes, scored three  through Yaya Toure (14th minute), Ndri Romaric (20th minute) and Saloman Kalou (82nd)  missed chances galore and had two goals ruled for off-side. Alas, it was not enough and Drogba might have played his last World Cup. He and his teamamtes will leave the show with heads held high, though.

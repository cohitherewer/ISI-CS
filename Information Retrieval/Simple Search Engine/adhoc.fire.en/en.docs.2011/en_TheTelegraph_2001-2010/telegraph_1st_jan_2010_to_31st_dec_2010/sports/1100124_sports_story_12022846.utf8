	Calcutta: India international athlete Pinky Pramanik was injured in a road accident near Balarampur village in Purulia on Saturday.         
	Pinky was returning home to Bagmundi village after inaugurating the Purulia Athletic Championship at Manbhum Stadium when her car collided with an Ambassador. While Pinky sustained deep cuts on her forehead and knee, for which she underwent stitches, her father, Durgacharan Pramanik, was rushed to the Tata Hospital in Jamshedpur. Her fathers condition is learnt to be serious.         
	The incident happened in the evening when Pinkys Santro collided with the Ambassador near Patharbandh in Balarampur. The driver of the Ambassador, Sailen Hansda, died when he was being rushed to a nearby hospital.         
	Pinky is out of danger but the same cant be said about her father. Since, she is a railway employee, we will be shifting her to the B.R. Singh Hospital, Sealdah (Railway Hospital) on Sunday morning, Ashish Sengupta, coach of the West Bengal Athletic Association, who was present at the Balarampur Health Centre, informed         
	The doctors advised that as she had gone through a lot of mental stress, it will be better if she rests today (Saturday). Tomorrow (Sunday), we will shift her to Calcutta once Pinkys mother arrives from Baghmundi, Sengupta added.         
	Pinky was a member of the Indian quartet that won gold medal in the 4x400m relay in the Doha Asian Games in 2006.

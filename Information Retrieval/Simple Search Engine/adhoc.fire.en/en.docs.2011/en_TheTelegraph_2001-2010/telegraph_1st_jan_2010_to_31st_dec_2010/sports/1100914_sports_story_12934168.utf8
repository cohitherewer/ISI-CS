            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC)s plans to professionalise club football in India by next season could land Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in a spot of bother.         
	As per the AFC club licensing criteria, which has to be implemented before the end of the 2010-11 season, no individual or a company would be allowed to own 50 per cent or more stakes in more than one club at a time. Currently, the two Calcutta majors are owned by two companies, which are part of the same business group.         
	Rule 5(f) of the club licensing criteria says, cross-ownership of the clubs is now allowed in the professional league. In the meeting held between AFC chief Mohammed Bin Hamman and the AIFF pro league committee in the capital on Monday, East Bengal president Pranob Dasgupta asked for a clarification on this rule.         
	The AFC vice president Alex Soosay, who was present in the meeting, said that ownership of two clubs by an individual or a company would only be allowed if the person or the company has less than 50 per cent stake in at least one of the two clubs. The business group that owns Mohun Bagan and East Bengal has 50 per cent stakes each in both the clubs.         
	In present circumstances, though it seems that one of the two clubs will have to look for fresh sponsors once the licensing criteria is implemented, EB director Amit Sen said both the clubs would be able to continue with their present status.         
	While United Breweries are running East Bengal, Mohun Bagan are managed by United Spirits. Therefore, there shouldnt be any clash of interest. The only common thing is that the chairman of both the clubs is same, said the East Bengal official.         
	AIFF president Praful Patel later said the clubs that wont fulfil all the criteria by December 31 this year would not be allowed to play in the I-League.         
	Informing that Fifa has sanctioned money for laying eight artificial turfs in India, Patel said the AIFF has plans to host an eight-team international tournament involving top teams like Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United next July. The tournament could be played in Delhi and Calcutta, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the friendly match between India and Gambia on September 19 has been cancelled. On September 15, India will play Namibia.

	Barcelona: Australian Mark Webber seized pole position for Sundays Spanish Grand Prix ahead of German teammate Sebastian Vettel on an all Red Bull front row.         
	Lewis Hamilton was third fastest and shares the second row with Spaniard Fernando Alonso. Jenson Button, in a McLaren, and seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, for Mercedes, will line up together on the third row at the Circuit de Catalunya.         
	Schumachers sixth place marked the first time that the 41-year-old German, making a comeback after three years out, had qualified ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg and was also his highest grid position of the year.         
	Rosberg qualified eighth with Polands Robert Kubica seventh for Renault but the German was unhappy that Ferrari had released Alonso straight into his path in the pit lane at the start of the decisive final phase. Alonso should get a penalty for that, he told the team over the radio.         
	Webber, who was faster than Vettel in all three stages of qualifying, will be boosted by the knowledge that the driver on pole has won for the last nine years in Barcelona. Force Indias Adrian Sutil will start 11 th on the rid. (Reuters)

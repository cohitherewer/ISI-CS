The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Was a mistake dropping me
                                                                                                                       7                                        Was a mistake dropping me

	Wellington: New Zealand speedster Shane Bond feels that Kolkata Knight Riders team managements decision to drop him from the playing XI against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) was a mistake.         
	I missed out in Bangalore for whatever reason and that was the quickest wicket we played on, so that was probably a mistake, Bond was quoted as saying by a local newspaper.         
	The pacer took nine wickets in eight matches at an economy rate of 7.2. The paceman said his IPL team may not have done too well but he was happy with his own performance.         
	It wasnt too bad, I was pretty happy with the way I bowled. I missed a few games in the middle, which was disappointing, but I came back pretty strongly in the last few games, he said.         
	However he didnt mince words when he admitteed that the twin blasts in the Bangalore made him wary about the security situation.         
	In fact he was so rattled when he heard of the incident that he just wanted to get out of India.         
	He said that his last few days in India were uneasy after bomb explosions delayed the Royal Challengers Bangalore-Mumbai Indians IPL match.         
	I was nervous, he admitted. The pacer said he was in Calcutta when the incident happened and had just one game left to play as his team had failed to make the semi-final cut.         
	It (the Bangalore bombing) definitely made me more nervy. We went over there with the threat, I guess, but when that happened it became a reality, Bond.         
	We had one game left at that stage and knew we couldnt qualify for the semi-final, so we just wanted to get out of there, really, he said.         
	Bond and compatriot Brendon McCullum, who also competed for KKR packed their bags as soon as their matches got over even though participating players were expected to stay till the closing ceremony of the event on Sunday. Bond and McCullum will now join the national team for the Twenty20 World Cup.

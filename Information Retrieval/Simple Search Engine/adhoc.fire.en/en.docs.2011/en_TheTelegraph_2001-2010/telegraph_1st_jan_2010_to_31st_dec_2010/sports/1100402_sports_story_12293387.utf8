            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford guided trainer Arti Doctors piping hot-favourite Thundering Hooves to a start-to-finish victory in the 1,200m Brave Dancer Cup on Thursday. Mentally shattered after the failure of his two hot-favourites earlier in the day, Alford recollected himself for a new start and the victory followed easy on a afternoon which was otherwise dominated by less-fancied winners from leading trainers Vijay Singh and Daniel David yards. Vijays Romantic Concept and Daniels Must Be Magic won their respective events, causing the maximum damage to the cause of pool hunters.RESULTS

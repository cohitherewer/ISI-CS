	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals inducted Australian top-order batsman Aaron Finch to fill the void created by the absence of South African opener Graeme Smith, who is out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) with an injury.         
	A 23-year-old batsman from Victoria, Finch made his first class debut against a visiting Indian team in 2007.         
	Finch, who has been an Australia under-19 player, has the experience of playing in India, as a member of the Victoria Bushrangers in the inaugural Champions League T20.         
	Speaking on Finchs inclusion, Royals CEO Sean Morris said the youngster was a good addition to the team led by another Victorian, spin legend and team captain, Shane Warne.         
	Aaron is a sensational young player and he fits in with the Royals values of promoting and encouraging young talent.         
	He (Finch) brings with him power and promise and we envisage him learning a lot from his experience with us and from our senior players.         
	We are delighted to have him on board, he said.           (PTI)

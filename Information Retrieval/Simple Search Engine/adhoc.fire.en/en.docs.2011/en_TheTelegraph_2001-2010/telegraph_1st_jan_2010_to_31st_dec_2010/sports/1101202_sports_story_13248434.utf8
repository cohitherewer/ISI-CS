The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Farhat to take Mazhar to court
                                                                                                                       7                                      Farhat to take Mazhar to court
                      
	Islamabad: Pakistan opener Imran Farhat has decided to serve a legal notice on Mazhar Majeed, the London-based bookmaker, who has revealed his name, along with three other Pakistan cricketers, alleging that they, too, were involved in spot-fixing.         
	Farhat said he was appalled by the bookmakers claims. I just dont know what to say Neither is he my agent nor have I ever been involved in such things, Farhat said.         
	The left-handed opener was named along with Umar Akmal, Wahab Riaz and Kamran Akmal by Majeed as the players who work for him.         
	Three others  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer  has been already suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after Majeed, in an earlier video in August, claimed they had taken bribes to do spot-fixing in the fourth Test, against England, at Lords.         
	His claims have really upset me because I have always played clean cricket. I am suing him for an apology and damages and also to clear my reputation, Farhat said.         
	Farhat said he had a reputation in international cricket being a Pakistan player and Majeed, with his unsubstantiated claims, had basically indulged in character assassination.         
	I will not stand this I dont know about the others, but I have decided to sue him and I am consulting my lawyers, Farhat said. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Wednesday refused to comment on the new video footage of Majeed while legal advisor, Tafazzul Rizvi also declined to make any comment.         
	The national selectors Tuesday dropped Farhat for the tour to New Zealand and the opener said that he was disappointed but would continue to perform in domestic cricket and try to win back his place in the side.         
	Pakistan wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal also slammed Majeed for his claims.         
	He was just our agent and I dont know why he is making these claims. If he is involved in bookmaking, I dont know anything about that, Akmal said.         
	Meanwhile, ICC president Sharad Pawar, too, refused to react on the latest spot-fixing revelations. (Agencies)

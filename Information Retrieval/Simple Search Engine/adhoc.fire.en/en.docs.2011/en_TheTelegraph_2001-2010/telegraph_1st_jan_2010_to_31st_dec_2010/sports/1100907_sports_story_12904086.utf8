The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Defence is a concern for England
                                                                                                                       7                                      Defence is a concern for England
  - Tough test for Blanc                       
	London: After his campaign to restore pride in the French jersey suffered a first-day setback with a home defeat by Belarus, new France coach Laurent Blanc could have done with an easier task than a trip to Bosnia, on Tuesday.         
	Italy should have a more comfortable day, with a home tie against Faroe Islands, while Germany host Azerbaijan and England face what could be a tricky away match in Switzerland.         
	Blanc, who took over from Raymond Domenech after Frances World Cup fiasco, is a well-liked figure and is never likely to become as unpopular as his predecessor.         
	The French public and media, still fuming at their players strike in South Africa, recognise that the new man needs time to build a new team and a new attitude  even if the fans jeered after the opening 1-0 group D defeat. The only good news for Blanc is that Karim Benzema has recovered and will be fit to play.         
	Bosnia, who opened their campaign with a 3-0 win in Luxembourg, missed out on the 2010 World Cup in a playoff with Portugal and will provide a stiff challenge on home soil.         
	Belarus will look to build on their start with a home win against Romania, who beat them 3-1 home and away in the last European championship qualifying campaign.         
	Italy coach Cesare Prandelli briefly looked as if he would also get his tenure under way with a shock defeat until Antonio Cassano and Leonardo completed a 2-1 comeback win over Estonia.         
	England got off to a flier with a 4-0 home win over Bulgaria, where Jermain Defoe scored a hattrick and Wayne Rooney helped to set up all four goals, but it is at the other end, where they will field a patched-up, inexperienced defence, that they need to be on their mettle in what could be a testing encounter against Switzerland in Basel.         
	World and European champions Spain are not in action on Tuesday but Germany, runners up in Vienna four years ago, are at home to Azerbaijan having secured a good opening 1-0 win in Belgium.         
	Portugal, held 4-4 at home by Cyprus in their remarkable group H opener, have an awkward-looking trip to Norway, 2-1 winners in Iceland last week.         
	Portugal need to play more as a team when they face Norway, defender Ricardo Carvalho said after his team suddenly went soft at the back in last weeks shock home draw with Cyprus.

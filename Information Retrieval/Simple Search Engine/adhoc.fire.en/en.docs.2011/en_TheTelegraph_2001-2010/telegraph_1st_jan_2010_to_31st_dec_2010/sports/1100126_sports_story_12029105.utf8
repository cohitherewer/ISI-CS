The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB mulls naming deputy for Shukla
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB mulls naming deputy for Shukla
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is planning to have a vice-captain for the senior Bengal team that will take part in the Vijay Hazare Trophy (East Zone) in Cuttack, from February 10.         
	The CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra, who will be the convenor of the senior selection committee, is planning to moot the idea when it meets on Thursday.         
	Mitra cited skipper Laxmi Ratan Shuklas fitness status as being the prime reason behind the idea.         
	Laxmi has sustained a quadriceps injury. We are hopeful he will be fit in time but its better to have a deputy in case we dont get his services, the official said.         
	The CAB would ideally like to avoid any embarrassment, like what happened during the Ranji Trophy when there was confusion with Shukla pulling out during the match against Karnataka in Mysore.         
	The CAB later named Manoj Tiwary as Shuklas deputy when the skipper missed the following game against Saurashtra.         
	Shukla, who skipped the Duleep Trophy match against Central Zone in Amritsar, is recovering from the injury and is likely to play for his club, Kalighat, against Ballygunge United in a CAB two-day league match.

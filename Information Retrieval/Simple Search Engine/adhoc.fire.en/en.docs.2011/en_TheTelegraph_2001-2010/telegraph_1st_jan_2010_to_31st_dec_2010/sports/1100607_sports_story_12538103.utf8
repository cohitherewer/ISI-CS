            NET EFFECT              
	Heading up               
	At USA rsquo;94, the motley Bulgarian crew led by Hristo Stoichkov met Germany in the quarter finals at the end of a giant-killing spree. The Germans were thrice World Champions and an irresistible force. But the Bulgarians were undaunted. With scores tied 1-1, up steps Yordan Letchkov, to seize redemption (he had given away the penalty for the Germans rsquo; first goal) and glory with a stolen header. His hero-worshipping fellow countrymen put him on a pedestal and soon he found himself elevated to public office. He became mayor of his native city of Sliven and is reportedly a prominent voice in the assembly.            
	Deadly strike         
	Own goals are mostly tragicomic but Andres Escobar paid with his life for kicking the ball into the wrong end in rsquo;94. Colombia were ousted due to that defeat against US and Escobar was shot dead outside a bar in Medellin. Betting syndicates, drug cartels and public hatred have been variously blamed for the murder. The 12 bullets in Escobar rsquo;s body were not the first to be fired at a sportsman and haven rsquo;t been the last but there hardly has been another incident so savage and brutal. Escobar rsquo;s funeral was attended by 120,000 people and a statue built in his honour.             
	Renaissance man               
	In the rsquo;82 World Cup squad with no match practice and at the end of a two-year ban for match fixing, Paolo Rossi, the darling gone demon Italian, was all at sea in the group stages, looking out of sorts and desperately short of ideas. But then there is the tide in the affairs of men and, in a knockout stage match against the superstar Brazilian team, he scored not one but three goals when a single strike would have brought redemption. He got one in the final as well to complete a memorable Cup. The Italian even wrote a book about the experience, Ho fatto piangere il Brasile (I Made Brazil Cry).            
	Sent packing               
	Ahn Jung-Hwan, the South Korean poster boy plied his trade with Perugia in Italy. But he wasn rsquo;t much visible during his time there and, after he scored the Sudden Death goal that sent Italy out of the rsquo;02 World Cup, the club rsquo;s owner took a really dim view of his loyalties. Being the hero who took the co-hosts to the semi-finals for their best-ever Cup finish has its rewards, but also repercussions. Ahn was summarily dismissed from the Italian club and had to go back to being a local hero in the J-League. A case of being kicked out for heading home.

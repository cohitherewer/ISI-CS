The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bavarian Bastian comes of age 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bavarian Bastian comes of age 
            IAN CHADBAND            Bastian Schweinsteiger has been a revelation in this World Cup                           
	Bastian Schweinsteiger was being interrogated about life in the fast lane, his beautiful model girlfriend and the idea that, when he returns home to Munich after his triumphant World Cup, a Bavarian boy might be treated like an international pop megastar.         
	Well, thats up to you. Its certainly not my objective, shrugged Schweinsteiger, a faint smile flickering across his face. I certainly dont want to be a pop star; I just want to be a good footballer.         
	How Germany would have adored that response. How about that, eh? Their Schweini, once seen as young, gifted and peroxide, now all grown up and sensible. Only one thing, though. When he said good footballer, didnt he mean the best?         
	It is a while since Germany owned the most complete player in the game, one to follow a strutting Lothar Matthus or Franz Beckenbauer. But a nation is starting to believe that all the hopes they have long invested in a brilliant rebel are being gloriously fulfilled here.         
	They once thought of Schweinsteiger as a kind of latter day Guenter Netzer or Bernd Schuster, one of those rare, maverick alternatives to traditional muscular German efficiency and solidity.         
	But now they think of him as rather more than that. Their little Piggy has come of age at 25, ready to lead them past European champions Spain into the World Cup final.         
	If he started the tournament as a 30 million Chelsea target, he may just be ending it as a must-have 50 million Madrid galactico.         
	Remember all the fun Germany used to have with the Eminem of the Bundesliga? The teenager who broke the security code to sneak into Bayern Munichs training ground with his girlfriend, got caught by security guards as they skinny dipped at 2 am in the club whirlpool and then told them straight-faced that she was just his cousin?         
	Remember that lad who was done for speeding at 150mph? Who was partying at 4 am on the eve of a game? Who had his hair done up like a toilet brush during the last World Cup? And who, after getting sent off at Euro 2008, was rollocked by Angela Merkel, who told him it was time to stop doing all these foolish things.         
	Er, I think when the Chancellor tells you to do something you have to listen, sighed Schweinsteiger, who went on to enjoy a storming tournament. Merkels finest service to her country? The lady last seen jigging in the VIP box in Cape Town as the goals flooded in against Argentina is, like the rest of her country, stricken with Schweini fever.         
	Because Schweinsteigers performance against Argentina was the individual tour de force of the tournament. For if Lionel Messi is the best player on the planet, then how do you classify a performance in which one man can track and neutralise Messi in defence, while simultaneously setting the rhythm of Germanys counter-attack and creating game-winning chances?         
	Schweinsteiger dominated  on and off the field. Even his uncharacteristic pre-match outburst about Argentinas dirty tricks worked. He now has footage of Maradona doing an impression of him  Are you nervusssh, Schweinsteiger!  as a priceless memento.         
	On the pitch, there was simply a reminder that Schweinsteiger can do almost anything. Xavi will be, as ever, Spains metronomic pass master but Germans believe their man to be Xavi-plus, what with his greater ambition to maraud at defences, feint and shoot.         
	Watching him control the Argentina game was to be persuaded that it was his days as a champion junior skier, growing up close to the Austrian border, which helped furnish him with the strength, balance and agility that now see him dance past and bounce off opponents as if they were slalom poles.         
	It is not just talent which marks out Schweinsteiger, though. It is also, as coach Joachim Loew says, because his spirit acts as the teams heartbeat. The Daily Telegraph

	Leeds: Salman Butt will captain Pakistan for the first time Wednesday in the second Test against Australia at Headingley, marking a new era for Pakistani cricket  a mere eight days after the previous new era had apparently dawned.         
	A week is a long time in the highly politicised world of Pakistan cricket. On July 13, Shahid Afridi returned to the Test arena for the first time in four years to captain Pakistan in its nominal home Test with Australia, played at Lords due to the security situation in Pakistan. Yet, before the game had even finished, Afridi had resigned. After Pakistans 150-run defeat, he announced his retirement from Test cricket with immediate effect.         
	The problem lies with a batting line-up short on Test experience and patience  Butt was the only Pakistan batsman to score a 50 in either innings. Having banned former captains Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf for life after the 3-0 Test series defeat in Australia in the winter, the Pakistan Cricket Board subsequently left the door open for both men to return.         
	While Pakistans preparations for the second Test have demonstrated all the stability of a government in a banana republic, Australia by contrast demonstrated at Lords exactly what can be achieved with discipline and application.         
	Nobody would argue Marcus North is a better bowler than Shane Warne, but he managed to do something Warne never did by getting his name on the honours board at Lords with 6/55.         
	North, however, missed training on Monday through illness and could miss the Headingley Test, along with Ben Hilfenhaus, who injured a shoulder while fielding at Lords. Peter George is on standby to make his Test debut if Hilfenhaus fails to recover, although Clint McKay is also in contention. Usman Khawaja, an uncapped 23-year-old who was born in Pakistan, is in line to replace North.         
	Meanwhile, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat paid a glowing tribute to record-holding Emirates Elite Panel umpire Rudi Koertzen of South Africa who will umpire the final Test of his career, here, from Wednesday.

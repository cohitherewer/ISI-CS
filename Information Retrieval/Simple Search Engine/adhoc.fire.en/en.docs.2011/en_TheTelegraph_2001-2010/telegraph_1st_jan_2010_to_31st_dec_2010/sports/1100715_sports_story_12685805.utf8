The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malik axed because of form: Yawar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Malik axed because of form: Yawar
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan manager Yawar Saeed has dismissed reports that Shoaib Malik was not considered for the first Test against Australia on disciplinary grounds and said the former captain was dropped from the playing eleven because of his poor form.         
	There were reports in the media that Malik was dropped from the team for the first Test against Australia, which started Tuesday at Lords, after the experienced all-rounder skipped a few practice sessions to be with his wife Sania Mirza.         
	But Yawar rubbished the reports, saying they were untrue and baseless. The team was picked well in advance and the tour selection committee did not pick Malik because he is still trying to find his form, Yawar said from London.         
	The spirit of the team is high and all the players have gelled together. There have been no disciplinary issues as yet at all, he said.         
	Malik married Indian tennis ace Sania earlier this year in a much-hyped ceremony in Hyderabad. Soon after his publicised wedding, Malik, who was banned by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for one year over indiscipline, was recalled to the national team for last months Asia Cup after an appeals tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing.         
	Malik himself was surprised by the report since he had not missed a single practice session and said he was ignored only because of his form. Even when we go out of the hotel we do it with the knowledge and permission of the team management, he said. I have not been selected because the tour selection committee felt that it was better to give chance to youngsters for this Test Also I am trying to get back to my best form, Malik said.         
	Sanias father Imran Mirza has termed the reports as malicious and ridiculous rumours. I dont know who is spreading these malicious and ridiculous rumours about Shoaib missing a practice session due to spending time with his wife, Sania. These are baseless and childish allegations.         
	Shoaib and Sania are both seasoned professional sportsmen who will not allow their personal life to interfere with their professions, Imran said. (agencies)

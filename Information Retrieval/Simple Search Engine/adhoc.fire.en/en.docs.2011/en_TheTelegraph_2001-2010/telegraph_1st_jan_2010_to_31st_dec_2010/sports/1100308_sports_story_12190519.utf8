                                                                                                                       7                                      Germans fail   to cross the   Dutch hurdle
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: Connoisseurs in the capital had a delightful evening at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Sunday as defending champions Germany and the Netherlands played top quality hockey to share points with a 2-2 draw.         
	In what could easily be described the best match of the meet so far, the Netherlands held the upper hand in the first session and took the lead through a penalty corner conversion by Wouter Jolie in the 23rd minute.         
	Stung by the reverse, Germany, aiming to win their third title in a row, launched an all out attack in the second half and almost took the match away from the three-time champions with two consecutive strikes in the 43rd and 63rd minute. It was finally left to veteran Dutch skipper Teun de Nooijer to level the score in the 66th minute when he managed to push in from close ranges.         
	For Germany, the scorers were Oilver Korn, who darted in from the right to slam the equaliser and Joan Marco Montag, whose neat swing caught the Netherlands defence completely off-guard.         
	It was a great match, said Nooijer, the three-time FIH player of the Year, later. We are traditional rivals in Europe and know each others game well. Despite this draw, we shouldnt face any problem in reaching the semi-finals, he said.         
	The draw also left the race for the two semi-final spots from Pool A wide open as four teams have the chance to make the grade. While the Netherlands (10 points) and Germany (8) stand at the top of the pool at the end of the fourth round, South Korea, who routed Canada 9-2 in the days first match, are back in contention with seven points.         
	In another match, New Zealand went down to Argentina by a solitary goal but with six points so far, they have an outside chance to give it a final try on the concluding day of the group league matches, on Tuesday, when the Black Sticks play Germany and the Netherlands take on South Korea.         
	For Argentina, Facundo Callioni scored the all important goal in the second half. The Koreans were a revelation in the days first match. Beaten unexpectedly by New Zealand in the previous outing, the Asian champions were faced with the danger of elimination and needed a big win to stay in the race. The Koreans did it in style, especially in the second half, when they stepped up the pace to slam seven goals.         
	The true form of the Koreans, the only Asian team to reach the semi-finals in the last two editions of the World Cup, was evident between 35th an 51st minute. In 16 dazzling minutes, the Koreans tore open the Canada defence to score six goals. So aggressive were the Koreans that they did not mind conceding two goals from counter attacks during this period.         
	South Koreas main aim was to improve their goal difference at the expense of the hapless Canadians. They have now seven points and a good goal difference of plus seven. Jong Hyun Jang scored three goals followed by Hyo Sik You and Hyun Woo Nam with two each. Nam Yong Lee and Sung Hoon Yoon hit one apiece. Philip Wright got both the goals for Canada.

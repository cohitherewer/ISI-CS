	New Delhi: Churchill Brothers suffered a humiliating 1-7 thrashing at the hands of defending champions Kuwait SC in their last AFC Cup group match in Kuwait City on Wednesday.         
	However, Churchill have already made it to the next round.         
	With the defeat, Churchill finished as Group B runners-up with seven points from four matches, behind Kuwait SC (eight points), as both teams made it to the round of 16.         
	The result also meant that Churchill will not play their single-leg pre-quarterfinal match at home.         
	Khaled Ajab (9th, 35th, 50th, 57th minutes) scored four goals including a hat-trick, while Rogerinho Coutinho (76th, 90+1) struck twice and Rodrigo Vergilio (28th) once.         
	Nascimento Silveira scored the only goal for Churchill in the 48th minute.         
	The winners led 3-0 at the half-time. (PTI)

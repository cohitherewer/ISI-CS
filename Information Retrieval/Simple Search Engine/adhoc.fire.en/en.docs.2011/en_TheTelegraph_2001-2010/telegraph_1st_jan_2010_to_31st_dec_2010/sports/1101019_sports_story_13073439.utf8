	Dhaka: Rubel Hossains exploits with both the new ball and the old ball helped Bangladesh achieve a memorable ODI series whitewash against New Zealand. Defending a decidedly under-par 174, Bangladesh won the match by three runs in a thrilling finish to pocket the series 4-0.         
	I thought it was only a matter of one good delivery and it never really crossed my mind that we could lose, Rubel said. The captain also told me that they need four runs and we needed one wicket and that it was my day and he believed I could win the match.         
	Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasan was happy too for this was not the first time he was taking over the reins from an injured Mashrafe Mortaza to lead his side to a whitewash. Similar was the case when Bangladesh beat West Indies 3-0 last year.         
	Shakib said it was the winning habit, developed on the back of three authoritative performances, that stood his side in good stead.We didnt have a defendable total and yet the moment the first wicket fell there was a buzz in the field and we believed we could pull this game back our way, Shakib said.

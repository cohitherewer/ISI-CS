                                                                                                                       7                                      Sania out of doubles
                      
	Dubai: Sania Mirzas campaign at the Dubai Tennis Championships ended on a disappointing note as she crashed out of the doubles event as well on Tuesday.         
	The seventh seed pairing of Sania and partner, Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual, lost 3-6, 3-6 to the unseeded Chinese combination of Jie Zheng and Yung-Jan Chan in the first round.         
	Sania, who was apprehensive about the recurrence of an old wrist problem, exited from the singles Monday after suffering a 3-6, 4-6 first round defeat at the hands of another Spaniard, Anabel Medina Garrigues.         
	Sania has been in trouble off the field, too, for the last few days. Her engagement with Shorab Mirza was called off just a few days ago. (PTI)

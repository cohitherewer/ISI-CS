The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Of better games and goals
                                                                                                                       7                                        Of better games and goals
            ANSHUMAN ROY      Player of the week        Cristiano Ronaldo                             
	The smile is back and the wink will follow soon. The creases have vanished from the forehead, and Cristiano Ronaldo, seems to be getting back into the groove. Well, for the national team, of course.         
	He led Portugal to their biggest win in the World Cup. The 7-0 drubbing of North Korea also saw the Real Madrid star getting his first international goal in 16 months. If you are a Portugal fan, what else do you want?         
	By his own admission, he was not at all worried about the lack of goals. I never gave it a thought. Not much worried about the barbs they were hurling at me for my no-show in national jersey. I knew my time will come, he said the day after the seven-star performance.         
	Was he really not worried? As his booming shot on that rainy Cape Town afternoon hit the horizontal, Cristiano could not believe his luck. It was like: My god what else do I have to do?         
	As luck would have it, he got the goal three minutes from time, which by his own admission was funny. Cristiano capitalised on a defensive mistake, skipped past Ri Myong-Guk and, after bringing the ball down using his neck, turned it home.         
	My goal was funny but I am happy, he later said. Then, when his name was announced as the Man of the Match, he was magnanimous enough to give the award to teammate Tiago.         
	He deserves this more than anyone else. He was just brilliant on the day, he said.         
	This speaks of the camaraderie Cristiano shares with the teammates. There have been stories about Cristiano not being very popular among the Portuguese players. A rift with Simao Sabrosa was being discussed in hushed tones, but now everything seems to be on the right track. And thats good news for coach Carlos Quieroz, who is depending heavily on Cristiano in this World Cup.         
	So what was stopping Cristiano from delivering for the national team? Was it the burden of expectations? Or is he another case of good for the club, but not that good for the country? In Real Madrid, an array of stars like Kaka, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain give Cristiano the freedom to do things his own way. But when the country comes calling, its a different ball game altogether. The Tiagos and Hugo Almeidas can never be on a par with the Kakas and Higuains.         
	But all the talk that Cristiano plays well only in a club shirt will stop once and for all if he can inspire Portugal to win the title.         
	His form in this World Cup shows that the former Manchester United star wont give in to his rival Lionel Messi without a fight.         
	Agreed Messi is grabbing more headlines than him and is more skilful, Cristiano on his day can be deadly.         
	Those on-the-run step-overs and booming free-kicks can cause havoc in the rival camp. You cant doubt on that.         
	So, lets hope Cristiano continues to dazzle like the way he did against North Korea.         
	His supporters are saying it was a trailer and tell us to wait for bigger things to come. Lets see how things unfold in the next two weeks.

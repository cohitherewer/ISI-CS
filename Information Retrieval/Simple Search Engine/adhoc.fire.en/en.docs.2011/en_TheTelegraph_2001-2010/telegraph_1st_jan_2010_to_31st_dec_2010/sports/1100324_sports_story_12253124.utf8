The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | He is ready for return: Atwal

  - Timing of Woods interviews irks sponsor       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Tiger Woods                                 
	A leading golf sponsor has criticised the timing of Sunday nights TV interviews with Tiger Woods, both of which went on air just as Jim Furyk was close to clinching his first official victory on the PGA Tour for three years.         
	David Cole, the managing director of Transitions, said: We are a little bit disappointed that they chose to air that story at the conclusion of a very exciting tournament. We invest a lot of money in the Transitions Championship as a title sponsor.         
	Woods can plead that he is not responsible for when these two interviews were aired, but he has enough control over his image to have insisted they were put out on the day after the tournament. Woods has now disrupted three tournaments in five weeks with his news and has done nothing to get rid of the selfish tag attached to him by Ernie Els.         
	Furyk, who has replaced Ian Poulter as the world No. 6 following his victory, said: I can live with it and Im fine with it. Some day its all going to go away, and Ill be fine with that, as well.         
	Whether Furyks sponsors will be so happy is another matter.         
	Meanwhile, Woods is in vintage form, driving the ball further than ever and fully capable of winning next months US Masters, according to two practice partners.         
	The world No. 1 practised on Monday at Augusta National Golf Club, the site of next months Masters, according to two sports channels.         
	American John Cook, who has 11 PGA Tour wins, said he had played rounds with Woods on Thursday and Friday and hit balls with him on Sunday.         
	Asked, after play at the Tavistock Cup at Isleworth where he would place Woods in the Masters on the basis of his form, Cook told reporters: From what Ive seen of the last three days of ball striking, first. I dont see anyone that hits the ball like he does. We all know that thats not the whole battle, there are a lot of other issues there for him, but as far as ball-striking goes, if he takes that up there, its vintage, he added.         
	Arjun Atwal, who said he had played almost every day last week with Woods, said he was driving the ball even further than he had in his last competitive appearance in November.         
	He is hitting it just fine  he is hitting it longer than before, there is no doubt and he feels like he is not totally ready but I have seen him win with what he has right now, plenty of times, Atwal told reporters. I think he is ready but you know him, until he has every aspect right, he isnt going to go out there.         
	Both Cook and Atwal said that Woods was in a relaxed mood on the course, in contrast to the tense figure who appeared in television interviews on Sunday.

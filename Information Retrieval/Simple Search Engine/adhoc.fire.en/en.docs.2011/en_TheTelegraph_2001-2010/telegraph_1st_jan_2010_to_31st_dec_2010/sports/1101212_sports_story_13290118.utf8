The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan have a battle on hand
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan have a battle on hand
                      
	Margao: Churchill Brothers will be looking to capitalise on the home advantage to garner full points when they take on Mohun Bagan in a third round match of the I-League, here on Sunday.         
	Churchill Brothers were far from being impressive in their last two encounters as they drew their opening match against defending champions Dempo at home and later against JCT in their away match to fetch two points from two matches.         
	Churchill coach Vincent Subramanian knows that the Sunday clash match is an important one and they cannot drop points further as it will demoralise the team spirit.         
	On the other hand, Bagan too did not get the right start as they drew against Pune FC and lost to HAL.         
	Its just the beginning of the league and there is nothing to panic, Stanley Rozario, the Bagan coach stated.         
	In Kannur, Viva Kerala have an uphill task on hand as they prepare to lock horns with the formidable Pune FC.         
	Much was expected from the Kerala outfit, who were off to a disastrous start, going down 0-3 to Salgaocar in their opening match. However, they managed to hold Air India in their second match.         
	In terms of points, Pune FC are on even keel with Viva Kerala as they also have managed to log only point having drawn one and lost one.         
	Pune FC started off well managing to hold Mohun Bagan 1-1 but lost 0-2 to Mumbai FC in their second match.         
	Viva, cant afford to relax and should fully make use of the home advantage.         
	Viva disappointed local fans in their match against Salgaocar, missing innumerable scoring opportunities. The home teams fortune revolves around their three foreign recruits who need to deliver the goods.         
	The team led by Nigerian veteran Bello Rasaq have two more foreign imports in Nigerian striker Felix and Ghanaian defender Charles Disah.         
	Besides, Rasaq, Felix and Disah, Tamil Nadu winger Kalia Kulothungan and younsgters CS Sabeeth and Shahin Lal Meloli can trouble the opposition on their day.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Agarkar fined for dissent
                      
	Mysore: Mumbai pacer Ajit Agarkar has been fined 50 per cent of his match fees for showing dissent upon being given out on Day I of the Ranji Trophy final against Karnataka.         
	Match Referee Ramesh Subramonium reprimanded Agarkar for contesting his run out, which had been referred to third umpire S. Ravi, on Monday.         
	The out-of-favour India pacer had remonstrated at the square, arguing with on-field umpires Amiesh Saheba and Sanjay Hazare.         
	Agarkar has been charged with a BCCI Code of Conduct Level One offence.         
	When given run out, there was an obvious delay in leaving the wicket and he also entered into a prolonged discussion with the umpires.         
	This is an offence showing dissent at an umpires decision. As per BCCI guidelines, the penalty imposed for the offence is an official reprimand and a fine of 50 per cent of the match fee. Subramonium said in a statement.           (PTI)

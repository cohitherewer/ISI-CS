The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers need more rotation: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bowlers need more rotation: Dhoni
  - If someone falls and gets injured it doesnt mean he is overworked, says BCCI secretary       OUR BUREAU                            
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni has stressed on the need to rest and rotate his players, especially the bowlers, in order to keep them fresh.         
	I think what you see is that it is the bowling department that needs a bit more rotation compared to the batsmen, the Team India captain said in Dambulla.         
	You have to see what the impact will be if the bowler or the batsman is either made to play a few more games or given rest for the next few games. Accordingly, you decide if the rest is needed.         
	Depending on that, you give rest to the player so that he does not get injured... That, then, is the criteria when it comes to giving rest to someone, he explained.         
	The workload, for bowlers, can be too much... Especially for those playing in both Tests and ODIs because they are supposed to bowl close to 17 to 25 overs a day in Tests         
	That really challenges the limit. For batsmen, you dont have to put in the same amount of effort as a bowler, Dhoni said.         
	All this due to the flurry of injuries that have struck the Indians on their trip to Sri Lanka. Zaheer Khan pulled out before the start, Sreesanth went home during the practice game and Ishant Sharma is struggling with his ankle after bowling 99 overs in the three-Test series.         
	Would rotation have helped the bowlers who are now not on the radar, Dhoni was asked.         
	Very difficult to say... I think it is up to the individuals to do their best in the big domestic tournaments like the Duleep Trophy, the Challengers and the Deodhar Trophy. So, I think there are opportunities, he said.         
	It is better off, personally, if you can rest someone and prevent him from getting injured. You know that actually does not hamper his form and his momentum         
	He can just continue with that and he will always be in a positive frame of mind.         
	BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, when asked about the growing list of injured players and the workload, said: If someone falls and gets injured that doesnt mean he is overworked.         
	Vice-president Rajeev Shukla, too, clarified the Boards stand, in New Delhi.         
	If any player is feeling tired or fatigued or if he feels that he would not be able to perform due to some illness, then he must inform the selector, he said.         
	The BCCI policy is very clear. We will give the player rest. We are not forcing any player to participate in the series, Shukla asserted.The international calendar is like that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Five in the running for Brazil job
                                                                                                                       7                                      Five in the running for Brazil job
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	The Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) has drawn up a list of five candidates to replace the sacked Dunga as Brazil coach, with former coach Luis Felipe Scolari the favourite, Brazilian media reports.         
	Dunga, was sacked on Sunday night after the team returned home on Sunday, was reported in Mondays late city edition.         
	The other hopefuls are Mano Menezes of Corinthians, Fluminenses Muricy Ramalho, Ricardo Gomes of Sao Paulo and former star midfielder Leonardo, who has just completed a stint as AC Milan coach. Leonardo was a member of the World Cup winning Brazil squad of 1994.         
	Scolari remains the favourite to be installed for a second time because, according to sources within the CBF cited in the press, the federation president Ricardo Teixeira wants an experienced coach who can withstand the pressure that comes with a World Cup finals being hosted in Brazil.         
	However, there were reports that Scolari is apparently not keen on a second term. Dunga had been in charge of the national team since 2006.         
	Earlier on Sunday, the Brazilian squad were met with insults, pushing and shoving from angry fans in Rio amid a welter of recriminations for their poor showing.         
	Aside from Dunga, the target for much of their ire was Felipe Melo, who deflected in Wesley Sneijders opener for Holland in a 1-2 loss and then got himself sent off as the five-time champions made a miserable exit.         
	The Brazilians landed in Rio after a 10-hour flight from South Africa and fans immediately vented their anger, judging Melo one of the fathers of defeat.         
	Protected by bodyguards, the Juventus player had to run for cover towards a vehicle driven by his father after supporters left him in no doubt as to their displeasure  even though the players were taken through a side door to avoid potential angry hordes at the main exit.         
	Fans were more forgiving with goalkeeper Julio Cesar, some shouting out their gratitude for what they saw as a good showing overall by the Inter Milan shot-stopper who was tearful after the Dutch defeat.         
	He also stopped to speak. I am very emotional  I want to thank the Brazilian fans. This was the fruit of three-and-a-half years of work, he said before being driven off along with his mother.         
	Kleberson, Juan and Thiago Silva also had to run the gauntlet along with team doctor Jose Luiz Runco and technical assistant Jorginho.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tamim lords on Day IV 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tamim lords on Day IV 
                  Tamim Iqbal at Lords, on Sunday                     
	London: Tamim Iqbal launched an audacious assault on the England bowlers on Sunday during a glorious Bangladesh counter-attack on the fourth day of the first Test at Lords.         
	Tamim contributed 103 from 100 balls to a Bangladesh record first wicket partnership of 185 with Imrul Kayes (75) after his team had been asked to follow on.         
	Junaid Siddique and Jahurul Islam (46) consolidated with a composed third-wicket partnership of exactly 100 which enabled the visitors to reach 328 for five at the close, a lead of 105 with a days play remaining.         
	England should still wrap up the match comfortably on Monday but Bangladesh have proved thoroughly worthy opponents five years after losing their only other Test at Lords by an innings and 261 runs within three days.         
	Tamim reached his century from 94 balls, the fastest in Tests by any Bangladesh batsman and the quickest at Lords since Indian Mohammed Azharuddins 87-ball hundred in 1990.         
	He was particularly severe on off-spinner Graeme Swann, Englands best bowler over the past two years, slog-sweeping two sixes and cover-driving a four from one over.         
	Inevitably with such an attacking approach, Tamim rode his luck, missing completely with several full-blooded drives. But much of his shot-making was of the highest class, including a spectacular pull off one leg to record a third consecutive boundary off Steven Finn.         
	Kayes edged a James Anderson delivery between Swanns hands after scoring 30 and was stalled for 15 balls on 49 before sweeping a four to reach his first Test half-century. He continued to play with great determination, belying a Test average of 13.81, while Siddique, the top-scorer in the first innings with 58, batted with similar application.

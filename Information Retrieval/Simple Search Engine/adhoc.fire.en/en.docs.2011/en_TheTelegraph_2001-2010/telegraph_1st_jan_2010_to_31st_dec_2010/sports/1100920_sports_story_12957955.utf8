                                                                                                                       7                                        Talukdar clinches bronze
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Jayanta Talukdar won the bronze medal in the mens recurve section of Archery World Cup final at Edinburgh, on Sunday.         
	For the first time, three Indian archers, two women (Dola Banerjee and Deepika Kumari) and Taulkdar, had made it to the grand final.         
	The womens duo Saturday made a first round exit but the Guwahati archer, who represents Steel Plant Sports Board, ensured a medal for India, winning the bronze with a 6-2 win over Marco Galiazzo of Italy.         
	Taulkdar thus erased his bitter memories of the World Cup finals in 2006 and 2009, when he bowed in the semi-finals, finishing fourth.         
	On a rainy and windy morning with 11 degree celsius temperature, Jayanta braved the weather for a good start against the Italian, who was the 2004 Athens Olympic gold medallist.         
	The 24-year-old won the first two sets easily. The first being a perfect 10 (10-10-10), while in the second he shot 10-9-10 to take a 4-0 lead after two sets.         
	Galiazzo shot 9-9-9 against Talukdars 7-9-10 to take the third set.         
	But Talukdar again came up with a strong performance in the fourth set to settle the issue 6-2 for the bronze medal.         
	In the match of the day, Talukdar earlier lost out to eventual gold medallist Brady Ellison of USA in the semi-finals. Talukdar faltered from a 5-1 lead as the American edged past the Indian 6-5.         
	Ellison beat Korean Dong-Hyun Im of Korea 6-5 in the final en route to the gold medal.         
	In the first round, Talukdar beat Michele Frangilli of Italy 6-4 for a place in the last four.

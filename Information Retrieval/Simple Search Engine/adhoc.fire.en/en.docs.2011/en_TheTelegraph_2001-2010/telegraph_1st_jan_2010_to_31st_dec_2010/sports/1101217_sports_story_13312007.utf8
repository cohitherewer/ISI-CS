The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mancini: Tevez must stay
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mancini: Tevez must stay
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Turin: Roberto Mancini will lay the law down on Friday and tell Carlos Tevez that he must stay at Manchester City.         
	The City manager will meet with his captain at the training ground and urge him to stay and make history.         
	Mancini does not believe that Tevez is as unhappy as is being made out and intimated that responsibility for the furore that has followed the controversial transfer request lodged with City last week  and promptly rejected  lies with Kia Joorabchian, the players adviser.         
	Mancini was relaxed as, speaking about his star players transfer request for the first time, he stated that there is no chance of him allowing Tevez to leave, for this season at least.         
	I think we start every season  and this is an important season for us  and you have this group for this year, the manager said. Carlos is an important player for us. So I tell him he must stay here.

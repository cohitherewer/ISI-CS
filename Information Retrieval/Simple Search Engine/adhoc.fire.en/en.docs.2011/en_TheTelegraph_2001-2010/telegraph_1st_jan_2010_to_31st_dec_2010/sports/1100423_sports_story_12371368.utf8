                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin: Well get over crisis 
                      
	New Delhi: Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar feels that the hurdles confronting Indian cricket will be overcome and that the sport is strong enough to see through the rough patch.         
	Life is not a smooth journey always, there are sometimes rough patches in between and you overcome all those hurdles. Im sure cricket will help to overcome all those hurdles, he said.         
	Reacting to the controversy that so far has cost union minister Shashi Tharoor his job, invited Income Tax surveys and allegations of corruption, nepotism and rigged bidding against IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, Sachin said, I think when that competitiveness is witnessed by millions, you leave all those things behind.         
	According to Sachin, what matters to a common fan is a competitive match between two sides. People are waiting to see IPL matches. Every evening they are switching on their television to see a competitive match. Any form of competitive sport is fantastic to watch and its not only cricket. That is something which even I love.         
	I personally feel all these obstacles and hurdles will be overcome, Sachin said.         
	Sachin said such incidents do not distract the players, who forget everything else when they enter the ground.         
	Lot of things happening off-the-field, outside the boundary line but once you cross the line, you want to go out and execute your plans for the match. Switching on and off are important for a player, he explained.         
	Speaking on his injury, which he picked up during Wednesdays semi-final against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, he said that there were five stitches in one hand and swelling in the little finger of the other and that the stitches would not come off for the next eight days.         
	On new IPL rules coming into effect from next year when two more teams will join the fray, Sachin said four Indians and as many foreigners should be retained.         
	He said that it takes a lot of time to build a team and players are identified with a particular team and enjoy a huge fan following.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal ends tied 29th; Haas wins 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal ends tied 29th; Haas wins 
                      
	Madison: Indian golfer Arjun Atwal floundered in the final round to card a disastrous five-over 77 and sign off tied 29th in the Viking Classic here on Sunday.         
	The Orlando-based golfer, who was playing in his first tournament since winning the Wyndham Championships a month ago, was tied sixth ove-rnight but let it slip in the final round to total four-under 284.         
	Atwal stumbled to seven bogeys -- four in front-nine and three in the back-nine -- and found just two birdies in a disappointing final-round show at the Annandale Golf Club.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, too, faltered as he carded a two-over 74 after stumbling to four bogeys against a couple of birdies in the final round. His overall total stood at one-over 289 and he ended at tied 59th.         
	American Bill Haas (72) clinched the title by three strokes for his second career PGA Tour title.         
	Haas, who started the round with a four-shot lead, offset five bogeys with five birdies to finish with an even-par 72 and 15-under-par total 273, three clear of his playing partner and nearest rival Michael Allen.

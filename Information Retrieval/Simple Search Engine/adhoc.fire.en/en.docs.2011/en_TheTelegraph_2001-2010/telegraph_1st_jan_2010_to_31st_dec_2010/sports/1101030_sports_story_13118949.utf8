            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Fresh from their success in the Syed Mushtaq Ali (East Zone) Trophy, a confident Bengal leave for Delhi on Saturday. From November 1, they play Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match at the Kotla.         
	Without doubt, theres a big difference in winning all matches in a Twenty20 meet and remaining unbeaten in the longer format. New coach Woorkeri Ramanm too, is well aware of that.         
	The guys have done a very good job in Cuttack. But four-day matches are a different ball game altogether. So, adaptability will be the key. Nonetheless, Im hopeful of the players delivering when the situation demands, Raman told reporters here, at the JU ground, on Friday after a practice session.         
	Keeping the concentration aspect in mind, Raman has introduced yoga sessions. Yoga sessions is a new thing with the Bengal players as this wasnt there in the last few seasons. Whether these sessions will have a positive impact on the Manoj Tiwaris remains to be seen.

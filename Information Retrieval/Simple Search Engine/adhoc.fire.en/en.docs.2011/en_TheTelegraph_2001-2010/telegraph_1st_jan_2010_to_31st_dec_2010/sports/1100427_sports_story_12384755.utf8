The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gopal joint second
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gopal joint second
                      
	Subic Bay (Philippines): Grandmaster G. N. Gopal outclassed GM Darwin Laylo of Philippines to move into the joint second spot after the end of the fifth round of the Asian Continental Chess Championship here.         
	Playing black, Gopal showcased his top form in the event and cruised home without giving any chances to Laylo who lost a handful of pawns before reaching a lost rook and pawns endgame.         
	The victory took Gopal to four points out of a possible five and the Indian is just a half point adrift of tournament leader Wesley So of Philippines, who scored over Megaranto Susanto of Indonesia.         
	The highest-rated Indian in the fray, Grandmaster K. Sasikiran, came back into the reckoning for top honours with a thumping victory over Nguyen Anh Dung of Vietnam. (PTI)

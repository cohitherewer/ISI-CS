                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav presence bolsters team
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal will be bolstered by the presence of Sourav Ganguly in the team, when they take on Assam in their third Vijay Hazare Trophy (east zone leg) match on Sunday.         
	The match will be played at the Ravenshaw ground in Cuttack where Bengal lost their opening encounter against Tripura.         
	However, Bengal are now on top of the table with five points from two matches.         
	In their last encounter, Bengal easily beat Jharkhand by seven wickets, and in the process earned crucial bonus points.         
	With Manoj Tiwary being banned for one match, Sourav will straightaway replace Manoj in the playing XI.         
	However, it is not yet clear what exactly will be his batting position.         
	He may either open along with in-form Sreevats Goswami, who scored a century in the last match, or come in at No. 3.         
	Sourav will be aiming to bat within the Powerplays which will give him necessary practice keeping Indian Premier League in mind.         
	The Assam team consists the likes of Dhiraj Jadhav, Abu Nechim Ahmed, Parvez Aziz to name a few.

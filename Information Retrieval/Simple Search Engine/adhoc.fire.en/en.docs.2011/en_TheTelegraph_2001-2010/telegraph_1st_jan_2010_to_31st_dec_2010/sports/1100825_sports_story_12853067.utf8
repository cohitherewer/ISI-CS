The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB brings selectors on payroll
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB brings selectors on payroll
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: What the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) did yesterday, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will do it tomorrow.         
	Following the footsteps of the BCCI, the CAB has decided to take the state selectors on its payroll from the 2010-11 season.         
	The senior selection committee members, led by chairman Sambaran Banerjee, met CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, on Tuesday, to discuss on selection issues.         
	It has been learnt that Banerjee raised the issue of selectors being paid in order to bring in more accountability.         
	The CAB had never liked the idea of having paid selectors and this issue was lingering for a long time.         
	However, on Tuesday, Dalmiya relented, albeit, on certain terms and conditions.         
	The president has agreed but there will be some specific terms and conditions which the selectors will have to abide by. From now on, it will be mandatory for all the selectors to watch club matches and submit analytical reports on the performance of talented players, a senior official stated.         
	The junior selection committee members will also be on the pay roll from this season onwards.         
	The proposal will now have to be ratified by the working committee after which the finance committee will decide on the amount and mode of payment.         
	Since the 2010-11 will be the first season when selectors will be paid, there is a chance that it wont be a very big amount.         
	When Banerjee, a former national selector and Bengal captain was contacted, he appreciated the decision.         
	Its good that CAB has finally decided to pay the selectors. However, I hope that the amount will be a respectable one.         
	The BCCI gives Rs 40 lakh each per annum to the five national selectors.         
	It will be interesting to see how much we get. Having said that, I feel, more than us, the next batch of selectors will benefit from this move.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB has decided to do away with the probables as the Bengal squad will be selected from the three squads that will take part in the S.K. Acharya Challenger Trophy.         
	While Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Wriddhiman Saha will lead two squads, Saurashis Lahiri may be preferred to Manoj Tiwary for the third team.

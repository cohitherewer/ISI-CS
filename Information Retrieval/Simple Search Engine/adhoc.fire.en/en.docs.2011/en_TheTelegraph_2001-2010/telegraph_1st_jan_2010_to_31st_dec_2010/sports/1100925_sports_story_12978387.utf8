                                                                                                                       7                                      Trouble brews at archery venue
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: There seems to be no end to the problems at the Yamuna Sports Complex, the venue for archery and table tennis in the Commonwealth Games next month.         
	According to Organising Committee (OC) sources, the International Archery Federation (Fita), in a shocking move, has asked the OC to replace the entire lot of temporary spectators stands which was erected around the ground where the archery finals are to be held.         
	The Fita has found the stands below the specified standard and has asked the OC to change them with immediate effect. The last minute instruction has put the organisers in a spot of bother as erecting new stands should cost at least Rs 50 lakhs, sources said.         
	What has further complicated the OCs problem is the security concern. While the OC is now ready to replace the stands, the Delhi Police have put a spanner in their works by not allowing the labourers to move into the venue because of security reasons.         
	We have adequate number of people to work overtime and erect new stands, but the police have declined security passes and accreditation to the workers. We are now awaiting clearances from the security agencies, sources said.         
	Archery Association of India (AAI) secretary Paresh Mukherjee admitted that the stands would be changed but refused to comment any further.         
	I am still to reach Delhi, so I shouldnt say anything. However, I can assure you things at the venue should be fine very soon.         
	Zhang Ziuzhi, the venue manager for the archery event, said: The stands have to be changed as per Fitas instruction. The present ones are too low and not fit for an international event.

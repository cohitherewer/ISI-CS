            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal brass met city police officials on Wednesday in an effort to iron out the differences between the two parties ahead of the India-South Africa second Test at the Eden.         
	The police had shot off a letter to the CAB on Tuesday asking the state association to arrange for internal security of the Eden.         
	On Wednesday, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: I had a meeting with Jawed Shamim, joint commissioner of police, and requested him that the CAB and the Calcutta Police should work together to ensure a safe match.         
	It has been an almost three decade-old relation between us and I dont see any reason why that should end. We require their help for a staging a safe and secure match, he added.

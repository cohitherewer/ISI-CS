	Melbourne: The self-appointed sports capital of Australia got a feast of tennis on a lazy, sun-drenched Saturday afternoon.         
	While top seed and three-time champion Roger Federer played Albert Montanes in a Rod Laver Arena crammed with 15,000 fans, womens No.1 and Australian Open defending champion Serena Williams took on Carla Suarez Navarro at the neighbouring show arena.         
	By the end of it, Federer and Serena walked off their courts after booking fourth-round matches on Monday. Federer beat Montanes 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 and Serena defeated Suarez Navarro 6-0, 6-3.         
	I feel good, I feel confident, Federer said. Pretty straightforward match. Physically Im fine and mentally fresh and thats the way you want to go into the second week.         
	Leander Paes remained on course for successive Grand Slam titles after reaching the mens doubles pre-quarter final with partner Lukas Dlouhy.         
	The third seed Indo-Czech pair quelled the challenge of Lucas Arnold of Argentina and Romanian Horia Tecau 7-5 6-3 in the second round at Melbourne Park on Saturday.         
	They now meet Americans John Isner and Sam Querrey, who got the better of Frenchman Julien Benneteau and Steve Darcis of Belgium 6-4, 6-0 in their second round.         
	Serena, who beat Dinara Safina in last years final, needed a marathon final game of the opening set to clinch it, facing five break points and 13 deuces before winning it on her eighth set point. The final game lasted nearly 20 minutes  longer than the five previous games combined in the 37-minute set.         
	By that point, Federer and Montanes were in the fifth game of their second set.         
	I think it was definitely the toughest 6-love set, especially in the end because she was really fighting for it, Serena said. I thought, OK, Serena, dont put too much pressure on this. Worst-case scenario it will be 5-1.         
	Elder sister Venus too advanced, beating Australian wild card Casey Dellacqua 6-1, 7-6 (7-4). She won on her fourth match point with an ace. The Williams siblings could meet in the semi-finals but Venus must first overcome Francesca Schiavone of Italy, who beat Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-2, 6-2.         
	Venus said she was thinking more in terms of the final, which would mean beating Serena along the way.         
	Of course, I want to progress well to the final, that is my goal, Venus said. So far, Im getting closer. You know how it works. Just got to play well every match.         
	Melbourne sports fans regularly pack a 100,000-seat Australian Rules football and cricket stadium and turn the southern hemispheres biggest horse race  the Melbourne Cup  into a weeklong festival.         
	Australias top player, former No.1 Lleyton Hewitt, advanced after 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis was forced to retire with a right shoulder injury; Hewitt was leading 6-0, 4-2 at the time, in the night match at Rod Laver Arena.         
	The last time the pair met here, they started just before midnight and concluded the match  won by Hewitt  at 4:34 am. Hewitt plays Federer in the fourth round.         
	In completed mens matches, sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko beat Juan Monaco of Argentina 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 and will face Fernando Verdasco in the next round. Verdasco advanced when Stefan Koubek retired due to a virus, after losing the opening set 6-1.         
	No.3-ranked Novak Djokovic, who beat Federer in the semis en route to his 2008 title here, defeated Denis Istomin 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.           (AGENCIES)

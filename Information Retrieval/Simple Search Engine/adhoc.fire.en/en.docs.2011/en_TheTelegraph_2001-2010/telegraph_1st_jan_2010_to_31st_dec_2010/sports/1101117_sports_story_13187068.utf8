	Dubai: Younis Khan notched up his 17th Test hundred to guide Pakistan to a draw against South Africa on the final day of the first Test Tuesday.         
	Set 451 for victory after the visitors declared their second innings on 318 for two, Younis stroked an unbeaten 131 as Pakistan lost just one wicket on the fifth day to reach 343 for three.         
	Younis got solid support from skipper Misbah-ul-Haq (76) as the pair put on an unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 186. Their partnership was a record for any Pakistan wicket against South Africa, eclipsing the 161-run second-wicket stand between Kamran Akmal and Younis scored in Lahore during the 2007/8 season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak quartet to undergo dope tests
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak quartet to undergo dope tests
                      
	Karachi: Four Pakistan cricketers will undergo dope tests before the third one-day International against England, on Friday, a Pakistan team official said.         
	Team manager Yawar Saeed confirmed that a team of experts from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) had reached London and had notified the Pakistan team that random dope tests would be conducted before the match, to be played at The Oval.         
	Yawar said Wada had not conveyed which players would be picked for the tests on Wednesday but sources in the team said that four senior players had been shortlisted.         
	Captain Shahid Afridi, fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, and batsmen Mohammed Yousuf and Umar Akmal have been shortlisted for the tests, one source said.         
	Yawar said the dope tests were a routine matter as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was a signatory to the Wada anti-doping code which other boards had signed as well.         
	Under this agreement, Wada can conduct random dope tests during any competition or out of competition, at any time of the year, he said.         
	Pakistan cricket in the past has been tainted by positive dope tests of players such as Akhtar and Asif. Both the pacers had tested positive during out of competition tests by the PCB before the 2006 Champions Trophy and were banned. Later their bans were removed on appeal on technical grounds.         
	Asif, who has been released from the team and is serving a provisional suspension by the ICC for his alleged involvement in the spot-fixing and betting scandal, also served a 12-month suspension period in 2008-2009 for flunking a dope test during the Indian Premier League.         
	He was also detained for 19 days in 2008 at the Dubai airport for possession of hashish but later released without any criminal charges against him.         
	Meanwhile, Scotland Yard interviewed left-arm bowler Wahab Riaz on Tuesday at Kilburn Police Station before releasing him unconditionally. (PTI)

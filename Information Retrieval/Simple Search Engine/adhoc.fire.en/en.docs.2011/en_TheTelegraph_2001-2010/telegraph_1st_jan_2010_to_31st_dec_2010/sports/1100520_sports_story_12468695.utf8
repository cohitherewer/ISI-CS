The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods doctor charged 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods doctor charged 
  - Tigers former swing coach Haney has vouched for the world No. 1s innocence       Oliver Brown             Tiger Woods                                 
	Anthony Galea, the controversial Canadian doctor known to have treated Tiger Woods, was on Wednesday charged with administering unlawful drugs, including human growth hormone, to at least one National Football League (NFL) player.         
	No athletes were identified in the federal criminal complaint filed in Buffalo, New York, but while the charges related only to one of Galeas NFL clients, the doctor has worked with several other leading sports figures, including Woods.         
	Galea, based in Toronto, was charged with smuggling, conspiring to lie to federal officials, unlawful distribution of growth hormone, conspiracy to defraud, and introduction of the unapproved drug Actovegin into interstate commerce.         
	He became a key figure in a US-Canadian smuggling investigation soon after one of his assistants was caught at the Buffalo border crossing last September in possession of growth hormone.         
	Woods has claimed that the only treatments he received in five meetings with Galea were for blood spinning, where a persons own blood is placed in a centrifuge and reinserted into the body, purportedly with greater healing properties.         
	Hank Haney, Woodss former swing coach, said last weekend that he was at four of those five meetings with Galea and noted that nothing but what was taken from Woodss body went back into it.         
	I spent 110 days with Tiger a year for six years, Haney said. I spent probably 40 to 50 nights a year at his house. Ive never seen him do any [performance-enhancing drugs]. He has never talked about anything.         
	Woods has been repeatedly questioned about his links to Galea and has vehemently denied taking any illegal or banned drugs.         
	Prior to the Quail Hollow Championship, his second comeback event since his treatment for sex addiction, Woods disclosed that one of his physical therapists had recommended that he saw Galea.         
	A lot of athletes have worked with him, Woods said. Look at the list: its a whos who.         
	The world No 1 likened the approach to Galea to his relationship with Mark Whitten, the eye specialist who has twice carried out laser surgery on him.         
	One of the reasons why I went to see him is because he has worked with so many athletes and had a tremendous amount of success, and Dr Galea was the same.         
	The charges levelled against Galea came on a day when it was confirmed that Woods, as long expected, had sent in his entry papers for the Open Championship at St Andrews.

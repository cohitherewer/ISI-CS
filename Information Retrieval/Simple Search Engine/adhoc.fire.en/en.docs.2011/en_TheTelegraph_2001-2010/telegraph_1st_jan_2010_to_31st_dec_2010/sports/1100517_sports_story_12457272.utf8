The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Special time ahead: Paul
                                                                                                                       7                                      Special time ahead: Paul
            ACORRESPONDENT                      
	England captain Paul Collingwood feels their first ever world title triumph could be the beginning of something really special. The captain, at the post-match press conference, said confidence and self-belief were the key to his teams stupendous success in the tournament.               
	The Following are excerpts         
	PAUL COLLINGWOOD: Its a brilliant feeling. Its right up there with the Ashes triumph. It is our first ever world title, and Im obviously thrilled. We havent done anything differently. Just done what we were doing a bit better. The work ethic has improved. There is a lot of self-belief amongst the players. The confidence level, too, has increased. I wont say that I started believing we would win when we reduced them to 8/3. Especially, after their performance against Pakistan in the semi-final. But I guess to beat the best, you have got to play your best cricket. Once we restricted them under 150, we knew we had a chance. KP (Kevin Pietersen) and Kieswetter batted brilliantly But this is just the beginning. We need to kick on from here.         
	MICHAEL CLARKE: In the end, we must admit that we didnt get enough runs. Full credit to England for the manner in which they played. They had done well throughout the tournament and they deserved to win this one. However, because of the manner in which we fought, we will be going back with our heads held high. We didnt get a great start and I went out at No.3. As a leader, I had to promote myself and score runs. On another day, the move would have worked. Unfortunately, it didnt work out today. 170 would have been par for the course. England outplayed us on the day.         
	KEVIN PIETERSEN: Its been a pretty interesting week for me. A kid on Monday and World Cup today. Boys have enjoyed each others success and love each other. That has worked for us. The more you play, the more you win and thus winning becomes a habit. The bowlers did a great job and that made our job easier. Kieswetter looks a good prospect for the future.         
	CRAIG KIESWETTER: It was a great partnership with KP. Batting with him makes ones job easier as he takes a lot of pressure. I never dreamt of this a few weeks back. Now, I would like to become a regular in ODIs.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Just a bad race: Powell
                      
	Paris: Olympic and world champion Usain Bolt saw off compatriot Asafa Powell in the 100m at the Diamond League meeting, on Friday (as briefly reported in Saturdays CM edition). Bolt, the reigning world record holder in the 100m and 200m, clocked 9.84 seconds, with Powell at 0.07 second back.         
	Another Jamaican, Yohan Blake, finished third clocking 9.95 seconds. The 23-year-old who only made his comeback from an achilles tendon problem last week, was held by Powell until the closing 20 metres, but had enough in the tank to take it at the line.         
	It was just a bad race tonight. It will get better, said Powell. The standout performance of the evening, however, came from American David Oliver, who timed the third fastest time ever in the mens 110m hurdles at 12.89 seconds.         
	Only Cuban world record holder Dayron Robles (12.87) and Chinas Liu Xiang (12.88) have performed better than Oliver. Its excellent, I broke the US record and became the third athlete ever to run under 12.90sec, said Oliver, bronze medallist at the Beijing Olympics. Records will come when they should  Im not thinking about that too much.         
	It was a mixed night for the reigning world and Olympic champions on show. Australian Steven Hooker bombed in the pole vault, Kiwi Valerie Vili was second in the shot, South African Mbulaeni Mulaudzi second in the 800m, Kenyan Ezekiel Kemboi came third in the mens steeplechase, and Phillips Idowu of Britain was fourth in the triple jump.         
	But Allyson Felix (200m) and Brittney Reese of the United States (long jump), Croat Blanka Vlasic (high jump) and Kenyas Vivian Cheruiyot (5000m) all won their events.         
	Jeremy Wariner ran a world lead of 44.49 seconds in the 400m, turning on the gas around the final bend and managing to hold off Jamaican Jermaine Gonzales.         
	Australian Hooker was a surprise early casualty in the pole vault, the reigning world and Olympic champion bombing out at 5.40m. French vaulter Renaud Lavillenie, the world bronze medallist, won the event with an effort of 5.91m.         
	Kenya enjoyed a cleansweep of the mens 3000m steeplechase with Olympic champion Brimin Kipruto beating teammates Paul Koech and Kemboi to the line.         
	Sudans Abubaker Kaki powered to an impressive victory in the mens 800m, clocking 1: 43.50 seconds to see off Mulaudzi by 0.61 seonds.         
	Felix destroyed the field in the womens 200m, the reigning triple world champion winning in 22.14 sec after running a hard bend.         
	In arguably the most entertaining event of the night, Vlasic held off some stiff competition from American Chaunte Howard-Lowe to win the high jump.         
	After failing to cross 1.98m in couple of attempts, the Croat registered a best of 2.02m, with Howard-Lowe at 2mafter a duel that had engaged the crowd.           (AGENCIES)

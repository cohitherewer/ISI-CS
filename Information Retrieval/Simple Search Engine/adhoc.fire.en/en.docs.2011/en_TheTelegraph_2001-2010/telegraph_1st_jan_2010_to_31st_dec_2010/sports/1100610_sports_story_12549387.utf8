	Forward has back-up role         
	Johannesburg: Alexandre Pato is following Brazil around South Africa as a fan after failing to make the squad. Pato is following the example set by local fans and has already got his hands on a vuvuzela trumpet to blow at Group G games against Portugal, Ivory Coast and North Korea.         
	Noble gesture         
	Knysna: The French football federation will donate $120,100 for the renovation of a pitch when they visit a South African township in Knysna. France team director Jean-Louis Valentin says the donation is a strong show of solidarity toward the development of football in South Africa and that more money could be invested in the future.         
	Ref ruled out         
	Johannesburg: The World Cup injury curse that has struck down so many players in the build-up to the tournament has spread to the referees, with Chiles Pablo Pozo Quinteros the latest victim.         
	Scribes robbed         
	Magaliesburg: A Portuguese photographer was held up at gunpoint early Wednesday and two other journalists were also robbed at the same hotel.         
	Antonio Simoes said he woke around 4 a.m. and found two men entering his room at the Nutbush Boma Lodge outside of Magaliesburg, 120 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg. Spanish journalist Miguel Serrano and Rui Gustavo Morais were also robbed, but they slept through it.

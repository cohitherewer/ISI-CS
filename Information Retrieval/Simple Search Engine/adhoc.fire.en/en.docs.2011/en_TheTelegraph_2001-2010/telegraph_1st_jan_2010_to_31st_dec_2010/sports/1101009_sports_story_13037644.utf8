	Mumbai: World Cup winner and former Test batsman Mohinder Amarnath on Friday said that he would take on his new role as a member of the IPL Governing Council (GC), the same way he took on some of the fastest bowlers in the games history during his heydays.     
	Amarnaths appointment, for one year, came a day after former captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi refused to accept the BCCIs invitation to be on the Council in honorary capacity.     
	It is understood that BCCI president Shashank Manohar has called an emergency meeting of the governing council on Sunday to discuss the controversy surrounding three IPL franchises, Rajasthan Royals, Kings XI Punjab and Kochi.     
	Till late on Friday, no confirmation was available.         
	Hyderabad: India deserve to be the top Test side as they are way ahead of the other teams, believes former Australia wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist. The one team that is a long way ahead of any other team is India, and deservedly so, is the No.1 ranking Test side in the world, he said.

	Fife: Indian golfers were off to a poor start at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship with Shiv Kapurs two-over 74, which fetched him the tied 130th spot, being the best among the four in fray here.         
	Saitama: Japan upset a full-strength Argentina side 1-0 on Friday in a historic friendly win that crowned the coaching debut of former AC Milan boss Alberto Zaccheroni.

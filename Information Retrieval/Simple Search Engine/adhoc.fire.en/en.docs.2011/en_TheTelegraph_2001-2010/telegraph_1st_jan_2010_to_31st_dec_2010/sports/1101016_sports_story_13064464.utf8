The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanovic wins   despite penalty pinch
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ivanovic wins   despite penalty pinch
                            
	Linz: Former No. 1 Ana Ivanovic was docked a game for taking too long in the toilet, but the Serbian still eased past Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-2 to reach the Generali Ladies quarter finals on Friday.         
	Ivanovic asked for a toilet break after winning the opening game of the match, but the umpire gave her four penalty points  effectively a whole game  upon her return for taking too much time on Friday.         
	The chair umpire explained to the booing audience that she was docked one point for every 20 seconds she went over the time limit. Ivanovic blamed the incident on a miscommunication.(Agencies)

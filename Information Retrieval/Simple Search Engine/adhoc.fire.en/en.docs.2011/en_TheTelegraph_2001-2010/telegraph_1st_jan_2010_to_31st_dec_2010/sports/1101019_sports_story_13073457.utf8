The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA move up with a thin lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      SA move up with a thin lead
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa have displaced India from the second position in the ICC rankings for one-dayers.         
	The Proteas moved up in the championship table, for the time being though, after the India-Australia one-dayer in Kochi was washed out and South Africa beat Zimbabwe in the second match in Potchefstroom.         
	South Africa are now second with 116 rating points while India are third with 115. All this could change if India beat Australia in the second match in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday. Incidentally, India have to win the ODI series against Australia to retain their second spot.         
	Bangladesh have joined the West Indies on 67 ratings points after defeating New Zealand 4-0 in the five-match series in Dhaka on Sunday.         
	However, the Tigers are still placed behind the West Indian side when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point. To be precise, the West Indies has 67.06 ratings points while Bangladesh now has 66.68 ratings points.         
	Bangladesh had started the series on 53 ratings point and earned 13 ratings points after winning four of the five matches with one being washed out.         
	Bangladesh nex hosts Zimbabwe in a five-match ODI series from December 1-15 and can potentially have a taste of No. 8 position as the West Indies will play five ODIs against Sri Lanka from December 9. In sharp contrast, New Zealand has plummeted to 96 ratings points after starting the series on 112. As a result, they have now dropped behind Pakistan into seventh position.         
	In the rankings for batsmen, South African AB de Villiers and Dhoni resume their battle for the coveted No. 1 position. De Villiers, ODI Player of the Year, claimed the top spot from Dhoni in late August. Australias Mike Hussey is currently in third place.         
	THE RANKINGS         
	 1. Australia (132); 2. South Africa (116); 3. India (115); 4. Sri Lanka (115); 5. England (112); 6. Pakistan (99); 7. New Zealand (96); 8. West Indies (67); 9. Bangladesh (67); 10. Ireland (39); 11. Zimbabwe (38); 12. The Netherlands (17); 13. Kenya (0)

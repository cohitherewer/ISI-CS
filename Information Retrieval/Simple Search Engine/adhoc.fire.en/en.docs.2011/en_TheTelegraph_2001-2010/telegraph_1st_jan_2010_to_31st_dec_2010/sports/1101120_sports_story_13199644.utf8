The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India, Pak ready for big clash
                                                                                                                       7                                      India, Pak ready for big clash
                      
	Guangzhou: India are all set to cross swords with Pakistan in a high-octave mens group B clash in what is billed as the big moment of the Asian Games hockey competition at the Aoti field here, on Friday.         
	Pakistan will be looking to avenge their three previous defeats to their arch-rivals this year. Penalty corner experts  Sandeep Singh of India and the recalled Sohail Abbas of Pakistan  could make a difference between laurels and brickbats.         
	India go into the match against their South Asian rivals with their confidence high after a 9-0 thrashing of Bangladesh for their second victory in the league following a lung-opening 7-0 win over minnows Hong Kong in the first match.         
	More important is the fact that they had beaten Pakistan by a handsome 7-4 margin in the league stage of the Delhi Commonwealth Games only last month on the way to taking the silver medal behind champions Australia. That was the first time ever India attained medal standard in CWG history.         
	It is not just India but Pakistan also, who go into the needle clash with big wins to boost them up in the tournament.         
	Indian custodian Bharat Chetri needs to be at his best with his reflexes and agility to stop Abbas from gaining the upper hand.         
	The Indian forward line has functioned effectively in the tournament so far, especially in the second half against Bangladesh after a somewhat subdued effort in the match against Hong Kong.         
	Skipper Rajpal does not think the victory in their previous clash, and that too by a huge margin when they ran roughshod over their rivals in Commonwealth Games, would have any bearing on the crunch match.         
	Though we beat Pakistan in the World Cup and Commonwealth Games, tomorrow (Saturday)s match is a new game. Those wins are history and both teams start with a 0-0 score-line, Rajpal said.         
	Sandeep Singh, who was brilliant with his penalty corner essays and scored four goals to rout Bangladesh, indicated the presence of Abbas in the opposition ranks would make some difference.         
	However, manager Harendra Singh insisted that the three defeats against India would prey on Pakistans mind and put them under extra pressure.         
	The pressure is on Pakistan as we have defeated them three times this year.         
	We should not be too concerned about Pakistans challenge. Instead it is they who should be concerned about us, Harendra said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Admission by Royals
                                                                                                                       7                                      Admission by Royals
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Mumbai: The under-fire Rajasthan Royals have, in a communication to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), admitted that the bid submission for the Jaipur franchise was in one name and the agreement, with the Indian Premier League (IPL), actually signed by a totally different company.         
	That was in early 2008.         
	A copy of the communication, sent on May 12, is with The Telegraph and it includes the following: The name of the company appearing in the Bid Submission Document was Emerging Media (IPL) Ltd... Later, it reads: The name appearing on the Franchise Agreement was Jaipur IPL Cricket Pvt. Limited (JIPL)...         
	Enough, as a well-placed source put it, to land the Royals and Lalit Kumar Modi, the suspended chairman-commissioner of the IPL, in big trouble.         
	In fact, the very existence of the Royals, as a legal entity, is being questioned.         
	The Royals admission came while replying to the seven questions put to all the 10 IPL franchises by the BCCI, days after Modis suspension on April 26.         
	Modis relatives, significantly, have a major stake in the franchise and Central government agencies are interested in getting to the bottom of such a controversial agreement.         
	The Royals won the inaugural edition of the IPL, in 2008, but did badly in 2009 and poorly this year, finishing second from the bottom.

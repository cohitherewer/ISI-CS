The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni still the best bet, says Sunny
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni still the best bet, says Sunny
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN MUMBAI AMP; AGENCIES                Sunil Gavaskar and   Amitabh Bachchan                                   
	Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has backed the under-fire Mahendra Singh Dhoni, saying he remains the best man to lead the Indian team. The Team India captain also found support from Amitabh Bachchan.         
	I dont think anybody should be complacent enough to think his place in the team is secure as a player or as a skipper. But having said that, Dhoni has done the best he could. I still think he is the best bet as far as captaining the country is concerned. He has not quite had the luck he had when he started with Indias captaincy, Gavaskar told a news channel.         
	On coach Gary Kirstens reported criticism of some players fitness levels, Gavaskar said he would not react on what is essentially speculation at this stage.         
	I would rather wait to see if it is an official comment and not speculation. I would think that Gary Kirsten is intelligent enough not to make a public statement of it but he would probably send an e-mail to the BCCI giving his thoughts on this particular tournament, he said.         
	Gavaskar feels that Indian batsmen, who were all at sea against the short-pitched stuff on the hard and bouncy Caribbean tracks, need to go back to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) to sort out their problems.         
	He feels that blaming the Indian Premier League or its post-match parties for Indias humiliating exit from the World Twenty20 is a poor excuse to justify the dismal campaign.         
	I dont think that is an excuse at all. I think that is a very poor excuse used by people to say that IPL parties were the reason for the team not performing. Tell me one thing, there were no parties in the West Indies, were they? So how can you say that the team performed badly in the Caribbean because of parties in India, said Gavaskar.         
	Dhoni has found another prominent supporter in Bachchan, who expressed shock at the unjust and unfair criticism heaped on the India captain.         
	I am appalled at the way Dhoni has been targeted. A week ago he was the apple of your eye. And within seconds, in a show smacking of frivolity, you have through deliberate and unjustifiable cut-paste technology, made him into the creator of all that ails Indian cricket. This is most unjust and unfair, Bachchan wrote on his blog.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maradona: Will take Grondona to court 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Maradona: Will take Grondona to court 
                      
	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona says he is taking the president of the Argentine Football Association to court, accusing Julio Grondona of spreading false information about his problems with drugs and alcohol.         
	Maradona said he has not had drugs or alcohol for six years in Fridays edition of an Argentine newspaper. Grondona implied in a television interview this week that Maradona was using again.         
	There are reasons for what happens (with Maradona) and everybody knows them, Grondona said.         
	Maradona said he has contacted his lawyers about filing the case, though it was not clear when that might happen. I will take Grondona to court, he said.         
	He has been involved in a spat with the 79-year-old Grondona since July, when Maradonas contract as national coach was not renewed. Grondona offered to keep him on, but asked Maradona to fire some of his assistants. Maradona refused and was dismissed. Grondona, who was also a FIFA vice president, hired Maradona in 2008.         
	Maradona has repeatedly accused Grondona of betrayal and has been just as angry with Carlos Bilardo, the general manager of the Argentina team and Maradonas coach on the World Cup-winning team in 1986.         
	In an interview on Monday, Maradona accused Grondona of being senile  calling him gaga in Spanish  and suggested he was receiving treatments several times a year at an expensive Swiss clinic.         
	Maradona has been unable to find work since being released by Grondona. Months after being let go he suggested he might replace his assistants. By that time it was too late, with Sergio Batista taking over the national team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two-way race for captaincy 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Two-way race for captaincy 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jharkhand captain Saurabh Tiwary and premier Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary are in the running for East Zone captaincy for the upcoming Duleep Trophy.         
	The squad for the tournament will be announced in Guwahati on Wednesday. While Manoj has the experience of leading East Zone to the Deodhar Trophy final (last year), Saurabh has scored 593 runs (at an average of 98.83), including three centuries.         
	Last years captain Shiv Sunder Das has managed only 294 runs (at an average of 26.72) in the Ranji Trophy this season. The former India openers place in the side is in question as Bengal opener Arindam Das (519 runs) and Assams Dheeraj Jadhav (603 runs) have been in tremendous form this season.         
	With Bengal having two selectors in the zonal panel (Raja Venkat and Bengals chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee), Manoj, who led Bengal in two matches this season (had scores of 78, 65 .. and 107) is in a better position to bag the captaincy.         
	It will be interesting to see whether Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla is recalled to the side after he was dropped from the squad during the last edition, due to poor form. It will be a challenge for Sambaran to get the Bengal captain back in the squad. The lack of quality all-rounders stands Laxmi in good stead.         
	The ones from Bengal who are certain to be selected are Manoj, Wriddhiman Saha, Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda. Arindam Das and Rohan Banerjee also have a bright chance. Assam off-spinner Arlen Konwar is certain to pip Sourashis Lahiri. Jharkhands Ishank Jaggi is another batsman who is certain to be picked. East Zone will meet Central Zone in Mohali from January 19-22.

                                                                                                                       7                                        We deserved to win, says Anil Kumble
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Anil Kumble                           
	Calcutta: Shortly after Team Indias No.1 spinner Harbhajan Singh publicly thanked former captain Anil Kumble for his guidance, The Telegraph spoke to him in Bangalore.               
	The following are excerpts         
	To talk of Indias win first, its great... Great to stay No.1... We deserved to win (at the Eden) and it came about comprehensively... In a way, of course, it was too close for comfort, but the boys did it...         
	When our backs are to the wall, the senior players have to show the way... They did exactly that... Sachin (Tendulkar), (V.V.S.) Laxman, Viru (Virender Sehwag) and (captain Mahendra Singh) Dhoni in batting... Harbhajan and Zaheer Khan in bowling...         
	Even though we were a bowler short on the last day, Id been optimistic... After all, its never easy on Day V... I wasnt, however, sure about the light... As it turned out, one didnt have to worry...         
	Yes, I did speak to Harbhajan after the first Test (in Jamtha)... I think it was on the day the team was leaving for Calcutta... There were a few technical things, besides lifting his confidence...         
	I wouldnt like to list the specifics... Im sure youll understand... I agree that Harbhajan does get very emotional and takes things (criticism in the media) very seriously...         
	All of us have tried telling Harbhajan that he must calm down... Weve tried it for a number of years, but...

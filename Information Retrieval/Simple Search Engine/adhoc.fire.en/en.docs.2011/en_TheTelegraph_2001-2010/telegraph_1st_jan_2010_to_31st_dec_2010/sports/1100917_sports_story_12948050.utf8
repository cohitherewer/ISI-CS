	Calcutta: East Bengal are on a roll. There seems to be no stopping Trevor James Morgans boys. Team game has taken precedence over individual brilliance and that has bred life into the team.         
	On Thursday, the absence of Penn Orji and Uga Okpara made little difference to their rhythm as they walloped Peerless 3-0. Ekene Michael Ikenwa and Harmanjot Singh Khabra scored in the first session while Nirmal Chetri rounded it off five minutes before close at their home ground.         
	The conditions were hardly suitable for good soccer with the muck making it almost impossible for the players to maintain their balance. Such things mattered little, though, as East Bengal ran roughshod over their opponents after getting the lead as early as the eighth minute.         
	The presence of Ikenwa, Robin Singh and Tolgay Ozbey upfront meant it was almost impossible for the rival defenders to keep a tab on the crosses from the two flanks. The side showed superb opportunistic skills from dead ball situations with two of the three goals resulting from corner kicks by Mehtab Hossain.         
	The first goal was scored by Ekene as he headed in a Robin cross from the right. The Nigerian had to be taken off almost immediately after he suffered a cut on his eyelid that needed stitches.         
	Robin was the livewire in the forwardline with his forays down the middle. The Tata Football Academy graduate made good use of his height inside the rival penalty area with his dribbling and sense of positioning. He, though, had to be substituted because of a sore groin.         
	Theres nothing to worry They will be fit for the Federation Cup, coach Morgan said.         
	Im happy with the performance. The team has been playing good soccer, he said.         
	The second goal came in the 36th minute when Khabras header was bang on target following a Mehtab corner.         
	Reisangmi Vashum helped East Bengal gain a footing in the midfield. He, too, could have scored but failed to meet the target on at least a couple of occasions.         
	The final goal was courtesy another Mehtab corner, this time Chetris netting in with a header from the first post.         
	For Peerless, Samson Oyleke came close to scoring once but was off target.

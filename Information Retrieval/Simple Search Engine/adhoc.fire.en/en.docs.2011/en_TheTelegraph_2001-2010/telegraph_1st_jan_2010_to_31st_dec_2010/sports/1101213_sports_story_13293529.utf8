The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have plans for Viru, says Corrie
                                                                                                                       7                                        Have plans for Viru, says Corrie
                    Virender Sehwag                
	Johannesburg: South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl said that his team have worked out special strategies to counter the furious batting of swashbuckling India opener Virender Sehwag, during the three-match Test series.         
	We definitely have a few plans for Sehwag, Van Zyl said.         
	Sehwag would realise very quickly that he was now in South Africa and not on the tame pitches of his homeland.         
	I know he has been successful against us in the past, but that was mainly in India. Look at his record in South Africa. It is easier to bowl to him here (South Africa) than in India, where the bowlers are punished heavily for every small error, Van Zyl said.         
	Sehwag was recently described as the most destructive batsman in contemporary cricket by West Indian legend Vivian Richards and the Indian opener is currently toiling hard to get acclimatised with the South African conditions.         
	Team India coach Gary Kirsten said that Sehwag extremely important.         
	Even if he gets just 30 or 40, he does it so fast that he always places the opposition bowlers under pressure. He also makes it much easier for the other batsmen around him, by taking the pressure off them, Kirsten said.         
	Sehwag has hit five centuries against South Africa in 12 Tests, with his 319 off just 304 balls against the Proteas, in Chennai, in 2008, remaining his highest Test score.         
	South African bowling coach Vincent Barnes, on the other hand, believes that his side has enough ammunition in their arsenal to bowl out India in at least two Tests of the series.         
	I know that recently there has been a lot of talk about our inability to take 20 wickets, but I am fully confident that we will do it, especially in South Africa, Barnes said.         
	Barnes was reacting to criticism after his side could only take 13 wickets in the recent series against Pakistan, in Dubai.         
	The Proteas also failed to bowl out visitors England last year in two matches, despite having a full day at hand.         
	There was really very little help for the bowlers against Pakistan and to be honest, the batting conditions on the pitch in Abu Dhabi were just as good on the fifth day as it was on the first, Barnes said.         
	Conditions will be much more difficult for the batsmen in South Africa, he added.           (AGENCIES)

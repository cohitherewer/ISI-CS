The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB to take legal action
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB to take legal action
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Monday that the association has decided to take legal action against the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for going beyond their jurisdiction and sending a notice to the association. The CAB had called for an emergent working committee meeting on the day to discuss the issue.         
	The civic body, who were miffed with the CAB for not keeping them in the loop vis-a-vis the renovation work at Eden Gardens, had served a notice on Friday.         
	The notice stated that under section 401 of the CMC Act, the civic body can stop the renovation work, has the power to ask for police posting at the site and can arrest any CAB official.         
	This is ridiculous. I am very sorry to say that certain sections are trying to squeeze whatever they want from us. This cant go on. So, the working committee has decided to take legal action, Dalmiya said at a media conference. Controversies are not dying down at the Eden ever since the Indian Premier League (IPL) got under way.         
	Dalmiya said the CMC has gone beyond their jurisdictions to serve the notice. And he added that since the entire Maidan is under the Blue Zone, the civic body can never interfere with CAB affairs. At the best they can come forward if there is a leakage in water pipes. Not more than that, he said. The Blue Zone means the Maidan falls under the Cantonment Act and the CMC guidelines can never be implemented.         
	Dalmiya said that every time there was something happening at the Eden, different agencies try to scuttle things. If that is the case then let there be no matches at Eden Gardens, he said.

	London: Alex Ferguson became Manchester Uniteds longest-serving manager on Sunday with his team topping the Premier League but with heavy snow denying him the chance to mark the milestone with a win over title rivals Chelsea.         
	By extending his reign to 8,811 days, the 68-year-old Ferguson surpassed fellow Scotsman Matt Busbys record set during his two spells in the Old Trafford hot seat.         
	In the history of football, the best (manager) is Sir Alex, said England coach Fabio Capello, the 64-year-old Italian who has also taken charge of Real Madrid and AC Milan. For such a long time he managed the team and changed a lot. He changed the team, he changed the players, he has been really, really good for the club.         
	Ferguson has won 26 major trophies since replacing Ron Atkinson in November 1986, including the Premier League 11 times and the Champions League twice.         
	Ferguson, who has stopped discussing his future plans after previously changing his mind about retirement to remain in the job, was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 1999 after guiding United to a treble of Premier League, European Champions League and FA Cup titles that year.         
	While he has become British footballs most successful manager, Ferguson is quick to point out that Busby had the tougher time, having to rebuild United following the 1958 Munich air disaster that killed eight players.         
	Busby went on to deliver the clubs first European Cup in 1968 as well as winning five league titles during his first tenure between 1945 and 69. He took charge again between 1970 and 71 and remained involved with the club until his death in 1994, aged 84.         
	The strange thing for me was that I always thought Matt would be here forever, Ferguson said. (Agencies)

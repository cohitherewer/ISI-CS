	Auckland: Sania Mirza suffered her fourth successive defeat at the hands of Italian Francesca Schiavone in a straight sets mauling to crash out of the ASB Classic WTA tournament Wednesday.         
	The Indian lost 0-6, 3-6 to the fourth seed opponent in the second round of the $220,000 hard court event for a disappointing start to the season.         
	The world No.17 proved too tough for Sania as she struggled to get a foot hold in the match. Sania has never won against Schiavone.         
	Earlier, the Hyderabad girl also crashed out of the doubles after losing her first round along with Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual.         
	The second seeds suffered a shock 1-6, 6-7(6-8) defeat at the hands of wild card entrants Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium and Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia.         
	Israeli Shahar Peer had an eventful day as protestors demonstrating her countrys treatment of Palestinians interrupted her second round match against Slovakias Magdalena Rybarikova, which she won 6-1, 6-0 to advance to the quarter finals.         
	Peer was the subject of similar protests outside the Auckland Tennis Centre last year and on Tuesday. (Agencies)

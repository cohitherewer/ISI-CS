The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Plenty at stake for Manish 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Plenty at stake for Manish 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Manish Pandey                           
	Calcutta: The selection of some probables for the World T20, in the West Indies in April-May, defies logic, but its definitely pleasing that Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. finally looked at young Manish Pandey.         
	Manish remains the only Indian to score a hundred, an unbeaten 114, in the IPL  he did so for the Royal Challengers Bangalore against the eventual champions, Deccan Chargers, last year. Fine performances in the upcoming edition should see him head to the West Indies in the India colours.         
	In fact, the 20-year-old right-hander from Karnataka registered a fantastic 144 (second innings) in last months Ranji Trophy final versus Mumbai, but the selectors chose not to rush him into any form of international cricket.         
	Many had taken it for granted that, after the tri-series defeat in Bangladesh, Manish would get a look-in during the ODIs against South Africa.         
	By picking Manish as one of the 30 probables, the selectors have shown that hes on their minds and his first India cap may come in the T20 format.         
	That Manish is outstanding in the field is a huge plus.         
	India won the inaugural edition of the World T20, in September 2007, but fared poorly in the very next  in June 2009.         
	Its probably going to be in Manishs interest, too, if hes first selected for T20 Internationals... The selectors are looking to include him in the World T20 squad, but hell have to perform in the IPL, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	The stakes for Manish, clearly, will be that much higher when IPL III gets underway on March 12.

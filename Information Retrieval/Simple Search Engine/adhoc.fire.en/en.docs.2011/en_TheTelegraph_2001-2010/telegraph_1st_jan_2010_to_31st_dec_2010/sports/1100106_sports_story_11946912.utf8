	Bangalore: Karnataka have put one foot in the Ranji Trophy final after taking a massive 410-run overall lead against Uttar Pradesh at the end of Day III of their semi-final clash here on Tuesday.         
	Sustained fiery fast bowling spells by Abhimanyu Mithun (4/21) decimated Uttar Pradesh as they collapsed for 208 while pursuing Karnatakas imposing 575 for 7 declared and ended up conceding a whopping first innings lead of 367 runs.         
	The visitors could have been bundled out for a total below 200, but for Praveen Kumars breezy unbeaten 58, studded with four boundaries and five sixes.         
	In the second innings, Karnataka were 43 for three as Piyush Chawla (3 for 9) ripped through the top order, accounting for Robin Uthappa (18), KB Pawan (16) and Manish Pandey (4).         
	Karnataka are now ahead by 410 runs with seven wickets in hand.         
	Barring a miracle only two results are possible on Wednesday, the last day of the tie. Either a Karnataka win or a draw and both the cases the hosts would be through to the final.         
	Mithun was UPs tormentor-in-chief, scalping four wickets at the expense of 21 runs from 18 overs to take his seasons tally to 38.         
	Though the wicket continued to play low and slow with the ball often skidding through, the well-built youngster extracted disconcerting bounce to put fear into the UP batsmen.

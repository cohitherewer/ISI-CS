            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After conceding nine goals in the last two I-League matches, Chirag United are in for more trouble as their key striker, Brazilian Edmilson, could find himself suspended for four to six matches.         
	Edmilson, who has scored nine goals in the I-League so far, has been slapped with a show cause notice by the I-League committee, asking him to explain why he shouldnt be handed out a longer than one-match ban for spitting on a Churchill Brothers footballer last Sunday in Calcutta.         
	Although the I-League rules are not very explicit on what action should be taken against a player for spitting on a footballer, the act is considered an offence of extremely serious nature by Fifa, the governing body of world football.         
	As per the Fifa disciplinary code, even though an expulsion automatically incurs suspension from the subsequent match, the disciplinary committee may extend the duration of the suspension in terms of matches, days and months.         
	In the match in question, which Churchill won by a comfortable 4-2 margin, Edmilson was sent off by the referee in the 76th minute for spitting on Robert Lalthlamuana. Edmilson scored both the goals for Chirag United.         
	According to AIFF sources, it would not be out of place to hand strict punishment to Edmilson for bringing the game into disrepute. The referee for the match, P. Baskar, has also given a strong report against the Brazilian footballer.         
	Chirag United are currently placed sixth in the league table, with 23 points.

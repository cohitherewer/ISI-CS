The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beer gets a surprise call
                                                                                                                       7                                      Beer gets a surprise call
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Spin bowler Michael Beer was a surprise choice as Australian selectors cut Marcus North, Doug Bollinger and Xavier Doherty, for the third Ashes Test against England, according to a media release, Friday.         
	Beer, all-rounder Steve Smith and opener Phil Hughes were named in a 12-man squad for the Perth Test, starting December 16. England lead the five-Test series 1-0 after an innings win in Adelaide and a draw in Brisbane.         
	Pacemen Mitchell Johnson and Ben Hilfenhaus, who both missed selection in Australias XI for Adelaide, have also been included. Hughes was added in place of opening batsman Simon Katich, who will miss the rest of the Ashes series with a torn Achilles tendon.         
	Beer has taken 16 first-class wickets at an average of 39.93 since making his Western Australia state debut two months ago. This is obviously disappointing for Marcus, who has played some outstanding Test innings for Australia, National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. But it was felt to be the right time to bring the exciting prospect Steve Smith into the Test team.         
	Bollingers omission leaves Australia with a fast bowling quartet of Harris, Johnson, Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle to chose from.         
	The squad         
	Ricky Ponting (capt), Michael Clarke, Shane Watson, Phil Hughes, Mike Hussey, Steve Smith, Brad Haddin, Michael Beer, Ryan Harris, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus.

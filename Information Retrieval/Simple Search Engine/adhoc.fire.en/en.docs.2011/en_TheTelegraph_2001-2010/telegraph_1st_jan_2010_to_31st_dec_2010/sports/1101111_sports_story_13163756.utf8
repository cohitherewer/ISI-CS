                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal aims for seasons 2nd title
                      
	Singapore: Arjun Atwal wants to sort out some technical issues before chasing his second title of the season at the Barclays Singapore Open starting here Thursday.         
	A former Asian Tour No. 1, Atwal became the first Indian to win on the PGA Tour with his victory at the Wyndham Championship in August.         
	The Orlando-based Indian missed only two cuts on the US PGA Tour this season, one of which was the US Open but the last week saw him sign off tied 48th in the WGC-HSBC Champions. Im looking forward to it. I have always loved Singapore because it is a beautiful city. Ive played on this golf course once and it is a great challenge, Atwal said.         
	I was actually playing pretty well this year. I missed only two tournaments this year by one shot and one of it was the US Open. I was in contention a few times with two other top-10s. I havent played all that well the last two weeks and have a couple of technical issues which I have to sort out, he said.         
	Asked about what specific changes he intends to make, Atwal said there are some issues related to the alignment, which needs attention.         
	This is my fourth week in a row after Vegas and when youre playing that much, I dont really practise so theres a few issues like alignment that crept in but Ill probably get that sorted out by tomorrow (Thursday), he said.         
	Atwal, who topped the Asian Tour Order of Merit in 2003 before furthering his career in the United States, had lost his PGA card in July. However, the Indian regained the card after a dramatic win at the Wyndham Championship in August.         
	Ive been playing consistently in the United States for the whole year under a medical exemption and had limited starts to get the job done (secure his PGA Tour card) but as you guys know, I qualified on Monday and won. That was a little bit more special for me just to go through all the rigors of Monday qualifying and getting the job done, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Jeev Milkha Singh is happy to be back at the Sentosa Golf Club and is optimistic of winning his second title in Singapore.         
	I have a great feeling coming back, especially to a place where you won before. Obviously, you get the positive vibes again. I love the golf course, it is a fantastic set-up and Singapore is a great country and hopefully, Ill have a good tournament again, said Jeev.         
	Jeev had won the Singapore Open in 2008, beating Major winners Ernie Els of South Africa and Irelands Padraig Harrington but he could not participate in the event last year because of date problems.         
	It was a great win and I feel it was one of the biggest wins in my career. It was a strong field and the golf course was very challenging with the rough up and the greens were in excellent conditions, he said.         
	In 2008, my best memory was on the 18th hole when I got lucky when Ernie (Els) missed his putt and I made par on the last two holes to win by one shot. I think the golfing Gods were really looking after me.         
	It was tough a tough decision (to skip the tournament last year) because the World Match Play was on that week. I had to make the call whether to come here or go there. I decided to go there, reason being because it was the World Match Play, but it was a tough decision because when you win a tournament, you want to go back there and defend the title. But Im back here now, he added.           (AGENCIES)

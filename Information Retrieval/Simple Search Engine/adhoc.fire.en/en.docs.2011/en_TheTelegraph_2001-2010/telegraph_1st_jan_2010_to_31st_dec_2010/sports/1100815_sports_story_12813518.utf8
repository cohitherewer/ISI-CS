                  Rafael Nadal in Toronto, on Friday                     
	Toronto: World No. 1 Rafael Nadal survived a scare and Roger Federer ended a run of recent losses to Tomas Berdych to lead the worlds top four players into the semi-finals of the Rogers Cup, on Friday.         
	Defending champion Andy Murray and world No. 2 Novak Djokovic also posted quarter final wins to complete the all-star quartet but it was the possibility of a Nadal-Federer final that had tennis fans buzzing at the end of riveting day of action on the Canadian hardcourts.         
	Playing in his first event since winning Wimbledon last month, Nadal has at times appeared to still be in holiday mode, and the Spaniard was again slow out of the blocks against Philipp Kohlschreiber rallying for a nervy 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win.         
	Federer stepped onto centre court knowing the giant challenge that awaited him and responded with an inspired 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 victory over Berdych.           (REUTERS)

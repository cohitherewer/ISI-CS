The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil have the last laugh vs Ireland

            [+uc('Russell Kempson   THE TIMES, LONDON')+]            Brazils Robinho celebrates after scoring against Ireland, during their international friendly in London, on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Luck of the Irish? Do not believe it. Little more than three months after Irelands heartbreak in Paris, when the double handball of Thierry Henry helped to knock them out of the World Cup, they suffered another cruel blow on Tuesday night.         
	Ireland were holding Brazil in a highly competitive friendly in North London, indeed outplaying them for much of the first half, when Keith Andrews turned the ball into his own net.         
	That Robinho, the wantaway Manchester City striker now on loan with Santos, drove in a second goal near the end only added to Irelands frustration. Ireland lost 0-2.         
	Although the Emirates Stadium was filled to only two thirds of its 60,000 capacity, the drums and whistles of the Brazilian fans and the raucous chanting and cheering of their Irish counterparts created a passionate atmosphere. When the Latin ladies started screaming as their heroes swept forward, it was almost hysterical.         
	Not that they had much to shout about early on as it was Ireland who carried the greater threat through the miraculously fit Robbie Keane and Kevin Doyle. Keane had pulled out of the squad with a knee injury on Sunday only to recover swiftly and be reinstated by Giovanni Trapattoni, the Ireland manager, on Monday night.         
	Keane scurried to the byline but was blocked and Paul McShane twice went close to getting on the end of accurate corners by Damien Duff. Julio Cesar, the Brazil goalkeeper, also had to move smartly to keep out a firm header by Doyle from a cross by Duff. With the Irish tackles flying in, too, the South Americans were becoming rattled.         
	Mike Dean, the referee, just about kept a lid on things, although Brazil were clearly perturbed and failed to produce their best. Robinho just did what he usually did for Manchester City, drifting here, there and everywhere, but to little effect.         
	Still, he did have the desired effect approaching half-time. Maicon released Robinho, who looked offside, on the right and his low cross was turned into his own net by Andrews, the Ireland midfield player. It was a moment of good fortune that Brazil barely deserved. Shay Given, the Ireland goalkeeper, was not best pleased on the night that he and Kevin Kilbane, the left back, broke Steve Stauntons appearance record of 102 caps.         
	Irelands spirit remained undimmed but they were finding it difficult to make any headway. Daniel Alves, a substitute, drove wide after rounding Given and Robinho was twice denied, once by an offside flag and the other by a bad miss.

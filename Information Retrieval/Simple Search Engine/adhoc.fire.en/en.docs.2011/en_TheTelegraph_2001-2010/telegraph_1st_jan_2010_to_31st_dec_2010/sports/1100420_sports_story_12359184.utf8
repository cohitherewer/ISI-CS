The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | After attack by the MPs, Modis position is even more untenable
                                                                                                                       7                                        After attack by the MPs, Modis position is even more untenable
    - Autonomous BCCI is rattled by all-out assault
  -   IPL council to meet on april 26             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                    Shashank Manohar Lalit Modi                            
	Calcutta: For the Manmohan Singh government, Monday must have been like a return to the times when there were no restrictions on bouncers!         
	Indeed, the barrage from Parliamentarians  left, right and centre  was such that it now cannot but send a message to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that Lalit Modi has to go.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, the controversial Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioners position has become even more untenable.         
	The MPs, after all, reflected the outrage felt in many quarters over the alleged shady dealings in the body running crickets most successful T20 tournament.         
	Clearly, the last thing that the BCCI would like is nationalisation, as demanded by the mercurial Lalu Yadav. Mulayam Singh Yadav went a step further, calling for cricket to be banned.         
	In what came as somewhat of a surprise, Union minister Vyalar Ravi slammed the IPL as glorified gambling. He forgot that a senior colleague of his, Sharad Pawar, had encouraged its launch and, during his tenure as the BCCI president, had given Modi an absolutely free hand.         
	Quite a few believe that the problems actually began with that carte blanche.         
	The BCCI, which takes pride in being autonomous, doesnt mind politicians coming on board (and so many have), but wants to keep the government miles away.         
	We dont want the BCCI being torn apart in Parliament... We need to take a cue from the Prime Minister, who got a minister (Shashi Tharoor) to resign over the Kochi franchise fiasco, said a top official, upset at the income-tax raids and the attack in Parliament.         
	Strictly technically, the IPL is a sub-committee of the BCCI and the parent organisation has the right to recast it totally, if needed.         
	It was being assumed that a two-thirds majority, either at the AGM or a special emergent meeting of the BCCI, would be needed to remove Modi. However, it has since been clarified that a three-fourths majority has to be mustered.         
	The IPLs governing council will be meeting in Mumbai on April 26 and the buzz is that Modi would be advised to step down. If he obliges, a potentially messy removal wont be necessary.         
	May 2 is when the BCCIs all-powerful working committee will meet.         
	Incidentally, Modi and his two strongest backers  Pawar and another former BCCI president, Inderjit Singh Bindra  are currently together in Dubai, attending an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting.         
	Is a strategy being put in place to get out of a losing position?         
	Right now, all eyes are on Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president. Hes been very upset with the tamasha triggered by Modis tweeting on the shareholding pattern of Team Kochi, but wants the IPL chairman and commissioner to be given a fair hearing.         
	That, obviously, will be at the governing council.         
	Many, of course, are intrigued how Pawar and Manohar have grown apart (if not fallen apart). Apparently, differences cropped over the possible relocation of the world bodys HQ, from Dubai back to Lords.         
	Pawar, it seems, favoured status quo, while Manohar had no problems with Lords. The Union minister, according to well-placed sources, took exception to his line not being followed, more so as hes the next ICC president.         
	Close watchers of the BCCI feel that the next 48 hours are critical.

	New Delhi/ London: Embarrassed by construction delays and missed deadlines, the Commonwealth Games organisers came under more pressure Wednesday with England and Wales setting a 24-hour deadline to sort out the mess while Scotland delayed their arrival for the event.         
	A report from Melbourne, meanwhile, said that the Australian government is mulling sending federal police officers along with the countrys contingent to provide them a high-level security blanket.         
	An Australian paper reported about 15 Federal Police officers will provide a high-level security to the contingent  though unarmed  after Sundays shooting incident near Jama Masjid.         
	Sources said the Australian government was concerned about athletes families and fans, urging them to register with smartraveller.gov.au and take out travel insurance.         
	The government said it had reports of possible terrorist attacks in New Delhi, Mumbai and other Indian cities and its official advice was to exercise a high degree of caution.         
	The Malaysian government has also decided to send security officials with their contingent.         
	Youth and sports minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek said that contingent would be accompanied by security officials from the home ministry.         
	Earlier, England admitted their participation is on a knife-edge while Scotland athletes delayed their departure to Delhi. Wales, too, set a deadline till Thursday evening for the organisers to certify that all venues and the Games Village are safe and secured.         
	I think the next 24 to 48 hours is the critical time which will tell us whether the Village  which is where the main problem is now  has got enough accommodation for everybody to come into it. I think were at an absolutely vital time (regarding) whether the major teams go, Commonwealth Games England chairman Andrew Foster said.         
	Our staff have been round all the 17 sports venues and they are in good order So the key remaining feature is the Village. The other problems have been resolved. Its a situation that hangs on a knife-edge. It is not certain and we will not be sending our team unless we are confident, he said.         
	Foster, however, was still hopeful that the Indian government and the organising committee would be able to save the Games.         
	Commonwealth Games Scotland chairman Michael Cavanagh said that they have delayed the departure of the first party of 41 athletes, which included the boxing, rugby 7s and wrestling contingent.         
	By delaying the arrival of our athletes by a few days, we hope to give the Organising Committee the necessary time to address the concerns that have been raised by both the Commonwealth Games Federation and the countries which arrived early, Cavanagh said.

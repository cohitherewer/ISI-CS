The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Allan: Dale is bowling the best he ever has 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Allan: Dale is bowling the best he ever has 
  - Steyns smart and knows how to outthink batsmen...       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Allan Donald       
	Durban: Eighteen years ago, on Indias maiden tour of South Africa, Allan Donald held a huge psychological edge. On this visit, Dale Steyn has that Donald-like hold over India.         
	Dale gets his length right and is able to control the swing... At high pace, thats a wonderful combination to have, the talismanic Donald told The Telegraph, on Sunday.         
	Speaking over a rushed lunch of chicken curry-rice and salad, Donald added: Dont also forget that Dale is aware of the value of patience. At 27, hes probably bowling the best he ever has... Dales smart and knows how to outthink batsmen...         
	For India, then, is it all about being intimidated?         
	Grinning, Donald said: Its a fine line... Obviously, the Indian batsmen are giving Dale respect... Equally, the intimidation bit is there... Generally, it was the same with Glenn McGrath.         
	Because Dale is given so much respect, the batsmen try and score off (Lonwabo) Tsotsobe... In taking chances, they risk getting out to him too.         
	According to Donald, theres not much that Steyn has to improve upon. Just a few things here and there, but not much...         
	Asked if hed expected India to be at the receiving end with a capital R and E, Donald replied: No... I never expected your team to look so surprised (by the conditions and the South Africa attack) on the first day, in Centurion... Ever since then, its been about playing catch-up cricket.         
	Donald complimented Graeme Smiths team for executing plans in such a professional manner. Its one thing to have plans, quite another to execute them so well... Full marks to South Africa.         
	The Bloemfontein-based Donald, who was briefly talked about for the bowling consultants job in India, is coaching a franchise in Zimbabwe.         
	I started in September and my contract is till March... Its something different, yes, Donald signed off.

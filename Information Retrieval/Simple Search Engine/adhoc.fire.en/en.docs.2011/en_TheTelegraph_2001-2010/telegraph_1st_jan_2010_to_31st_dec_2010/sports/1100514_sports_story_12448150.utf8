The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan look to halt Aussies 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan look to halt Aussies 
                      
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): After their miraculous entry into the last-four stage, defending champions Pakistan face the uphill task of halting the Australian juggernaut in the second semi-final of the Twenty20 World Cup here on Friday.               
	Key player Umar Akmal, its learnt by The Telegraph, is in doubt. He has a back problem and was sent for a scan on Thursday afternoon, reports Our Special Correspondent in Gros Islet               
	Pakistan were pushed to the brink after their one-run defeat to New Zealand in their second Super Eight match but Shahid Afridis men bounced back to beat South Africa and with a stroke of luck sneaked into the semis.         
	Australia, on the other hand, have crushed whosoever have come under their wheels and remain unbeaten in the tournament so far. But that reputation wont count for much on Friday.         
	For Australia, their battery of lethal fast bowlers have knocked the stuffing out of the opponent batsmen, while Pakistan have an array of spinners who have dominated on the slow wickets here.         
	Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes have been devastating as a fast bowling pair, as much as Shane Watson and David Warner have been with the bat and they will hold the key to Australias success.         
	For Pakistan, their spinners  Abdur Rehman and Saeed Ajmal  could pose many questions to the free-scoring Aussie batsmen and it will be interesting to watch who calls the shots in this crucial game. Will it be the Aussies pacemen or the Pakistani spinners?         
	On a player-to-player basis, Australia are a superior lot. They can bat right up to number nine, which is something Pakistan lack. Their fielding, too, has been outstanding, something which Shahid Afridis men cant match.         
	Given the depth and fire power in his side, Michael Clarke is confident of playing the final in Barbados on May 16.         
	I will love to travel to Barbados because that wicket will be really beautiful for our fast bowlers. Our batters like a little bit pace to come on to the bat.         
	Clarke, however, was wary of the defending champions and said they have to be at their best on the morrow.           (PTI)

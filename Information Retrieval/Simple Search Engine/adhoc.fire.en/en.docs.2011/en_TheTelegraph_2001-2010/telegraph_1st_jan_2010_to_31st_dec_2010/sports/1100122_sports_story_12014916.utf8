The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big boys shut out Bangla
                                                                                                                       7                                        Big boys shut out Bangla
    - Centurion Mushfiqur Rahim accuses Indians of sledging           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mushfiqur Rahim on way to his century on Thursday                                   
	Chittagong: Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag, who definitely wouldnt top a popularity poll in Bangladesh, declined to answer whether he still thought the home team was an ordinary side.         
	He did, however, reiterate that Bangladeshs attack wasnt capable of taking 20 Indian wickets. Of course, eight had fallen in the second innings when the declaration was made.         
	Sehwag, who was greeted with shouts of go back, go back during the post-match ceremony at the Z.A. Chowdhury Stadium, on Thursday afternoon, bluntly said next question when the ordinary issue was raised at the media conference.         
	That was soon after Indias 113-run win in the first Test, which was affected by fog and/or insufficient light on all days, for the Idea Cup. The second and final match will be played in Dhaka, from Sunday.         
	Despite the top-order failing (five down for 135), Bangladesh took the Test into the extended second session on the last day, thanks entirely to a superb 101 from vice-captain and wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim.         
	Forget winning, but had the Mohammed Ashrafuls applied themselves, a draw wouldve been more than possible.         
	Mushfiqur, by the way, caused a flutter by accusing the visitors of sledging. They were at me throughout, with most of the sledging coming from Sreesanth, the 21-year-old maintained.         
	He also felt that Sehwag shouldnt have tried to belittle Bangladesh with his series-eve comments. Being the No.1, India should try and encourage us, allow us to be inspired...         
	An interesting point that, but theres no charity involved at the highest level.         
	Among other things, the Indians, apparently, kept calling Mushfiqur a schoolboy. He may look one, but played like somebody whod got his doctorate.         
	When The Telegraph contacted Match Referee Andy Pycroft, he didnt say anything beyond I havent heard of that and have no comment to make.         
	As for Sehwag, he said cant do anything about it. Blunt, again.         
	Mushfiqur, in fact, showed better technique than quite a few going ahead of him and it wouldnt be a bad idea if the management promoted him, instead of keeping him at No.7.         
	Hed contributed a solid 44 in the first innings, too.         
	Indias win was comfortable, yet one didnt see much rejoicing or an overflowing of emotions on the field. Perhaps, that had everything to do with the rankings  India at No.1; Bangladesh at No.9.         
	Bottomline, though, is that the first series as the No.1 started on a winning note, as did 2010.         
	Its good to start the year with a win... Hum log jeet ke khatam bhi karenge... Its important to keep winning... Main kafi khush hoon, Sehwag remarked.         
	Sehwag, however, acknowledged that the team didnt always come across as being the No.1. It happens... Just recently, Australia scored 127 in the first innings (Sydney), but still won against Pakistan...         
	Regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, speaking exclusively, pointed out that winning was important, for it gave momentum. He added: Im very happy.         
	The biggest gain, surely, was Ishant Sharmas return to form. He bowled fast, wasnt averse to letting go the short-pitched stuff and swung the ball. Statistically, he finished with only five wickets, but was an impact-bowler.         
	Sport has much to do with confidence and, clearly, Ishant looked upbeat at the end of the match. Incidentally, his Test debut had been in Dhaka, on the last tour, in 2007.         
	Being dropped for the recent tri-series seems to have served as the perfect wake up call.         
	The MoM award went to Sachin Tendulkar, for playing the most crucial innings  105 not out in the first innings. Because of the circumstances (India had been reduced to 150 for six), he regards the hundred and the award as special.         
	Sachin collected something else as well: The Bangladesh Cricket Board presented him with a memento for completing 13,000 Test runs. A nice gesture that.         
	No award was given to curator Shaiful Alam, but he and his men deserved one for producing a truly excellent wicket. Even on the last day, there was something in it for the batsmen as also all types of bowlers.         
	Some of the curators back in India could learn from the men here.

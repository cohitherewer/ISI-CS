	Karachi: The touring Pakistan squad may undergo some big changes during the remaining part of their tour as pressure grows on PCB, national selectors and team management after the string of defeats in England.         
	Chief selector Mohsin Khan said he would be meeting PCB chief Ijaz Butt in the next two days in which future strategies for the team would be discussed.         
	The selectors are surprised at the decision to neither play Yasir Hameed in the four Tests so far despite the frequent batting collapses, nor to push Mohammed Yousuf to play the second Test against England although his presence was requested on urgent, one source said.           (PTI)

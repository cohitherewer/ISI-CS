The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Playing with Tendulkar is an honour, says Pollard
                                                                                                                       7                                      Playing with Tendulkar is an honour, says Pollard
                      
	New Delhi: For West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard, who was bought by Indian Premier League (IPL)team Mumbai Indians for a whopping $750,000 in Tuesdays auction, chance to share the dressing room with Sachin Tendulkar came as an additional bonanza.         
	It is an honour to play with Sachin Tendulkar. I have grown up watching him on television, Pollard said after he was sold to the Mumbai team during first round of the IPL auction in Mumbai.         
	Its brilliant to get a chance to play in the IPL.         
	It will be an exposure and also an opportunity to show what I can do as a player, the 22-year-old cricketer told a television channel.         
	Pollard, who started with a base price of $200,000, was expectedly one of the most sought after but was ultimately bought by the Mumbai outfit with a silent tie-breaker bid after four franchises ended up bidding the maximum amount on him.         
	Speaking on his attacking brand of cricket, Pollard said, I have confidence in myself. You are not supposed to have any doubts in yourself while playing.         
	I just go out and try to play some big shots.           (PTI)

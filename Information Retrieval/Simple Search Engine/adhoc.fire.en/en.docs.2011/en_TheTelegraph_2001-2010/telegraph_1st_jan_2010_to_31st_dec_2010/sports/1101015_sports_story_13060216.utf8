The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shock loss for Nadal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shock loss for Nadal
                      
	Shanghai: Exhausted world No. 1 Rafael Nadal suffered a surprise 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 defeat by Austrias Juergen Melzer in the third round of the Shanghai Masters, on Thursday, while Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray marched on.         
	Nadal, who won the Tokyo Open on Sunday and was playing in his third tournament back-to-back, had not lost a set to Melzer in their three previous meetings.         
	The crowd was left stunned, on Thursday, as he lost that record in wretched fashion, dropping serve twice in the first set amid a series of unforced errors on his way to defeat by the 13th seed.         
	World No. 2 Djokovic reached the last eight with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Frances Richard Gasquet, while Andy Murray won 6-3, 6-4 against Jeremy Chardy.         
	The fourth seed will next meet Frances Jo-Wilfred Tsonga, who celebrated wildly after beating German Florian Mayer 7-5, 6-3.         
	Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi moved to the second round of the tournament with their respective partners, after getting a first-round bye.                 (AGENCIES)

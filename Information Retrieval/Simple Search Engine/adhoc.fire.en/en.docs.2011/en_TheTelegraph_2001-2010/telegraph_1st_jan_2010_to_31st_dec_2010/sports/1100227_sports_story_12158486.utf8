            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: South African batsman AB de Villiers feels that Indian tour was a learning experience for them and the Proteas are taking back a lot of positives from the month-long tour.         
	This tour has been a learning experience for the boys especially the younger lot. We have definitely had a few positives. Drawing the Test series was a good effort. Not much has gone our way thereafter. We have learnt our lessons the hard way. This will enable the youngsters to work and improve their game, De Villiers said, here on Friday.         
	De Villiers, who scored a century in the Gwalior one-dayer also agreed that not all the senior players were able to perform as per expectations.         
	I must admit that senior players didnt take the responsibility as expected and the Indians sensed their chance. In India, you shouldnt allow the home team an opportunity to come back, he stated.         
	He is however confident that South Africa will win on Saturday.

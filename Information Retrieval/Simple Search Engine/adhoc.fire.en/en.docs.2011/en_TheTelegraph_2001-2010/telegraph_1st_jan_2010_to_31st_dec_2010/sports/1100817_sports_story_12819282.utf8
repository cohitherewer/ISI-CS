                                                                                                                       7                                        Andy eyes US Open 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Andy Murray in Toronto, on Sunday                           
	Andy Murray said he was delighted to have beaten Roger Federer and win his first title of 2010 at the Rogers Cup as his preparations for the US Open remain on course.         
	The defending champion prevailed 7-5, 7-5 after outlasting the former world No. 1 in a match which was severely disrupted by two lengthy rain delays.         
	The win improved Murrays record against the Swiss ace to seven victories from their 12 meetings and also gave him an element of revenge after he was comprehensively beaten in the final of the Australian Open earlier this year.         
	It has taken the Scot some time to recover from that Melbourne setback, but he was in sparkling form on the Canadian hardcourts, sweeping aside world No. 1 Rafa Nadal and Federer to claim his first tournament victory of the season.         
	The 23-year-old becomes just the fifth player to beat Nadal and Federer in the same event and becomes the first man to win back-to-back Canadian hardcourt titles since Andre Agassi in 1995.         
	It was good for me to win  three good results in a row against (David) Nalbandian, Rafa (Nadal) and Roger, so that will give me confidence for next week, he said.         
	The US Open is the main goal but this is a good start. I played five days in a row from Wednesday  all the matches right in the heat of the day so it was good for me physically.         
	Ill try to keep it going in Cincinnati (at this weeks Cincinnati Masters) but the most important thing is getting ready for the US Open.         
	When the weather relented, it was Murray who forced the issue, his aggressive approach paying dividends against a subdued Federer.         
	It was very difficult today, said the 23-year-old. I was up a lot in the first set and probably should have won it a bit easier.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyis run ended with the semi-final defeat against Mike and Bob Bryan. The fourth-seeded Indo-Belarusian pair lost 6-4 3-6 4-10 to the second seed Americans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCA probes pressure angle
                                                                                                                       7                                        PCA probes pressure angle
  - Overseas players forced to relent after Indians agreed to play in bangalore       Paul Bolton            Kevin Pietersen                                 
	The Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) is investigating claims that players were put under pressure to go ahead with Saturdays Indian Premier League (IPL) match between the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Mumbai Indians despite a bomb blast outside the stadium in Bangalore.         
	[The Telegraph had reported on Monday that, among others, Kevin Pietersen and Jacques Kallis didnt want to play against the Mumbai Indians. They had to be persuaded by captain Anil Kumble and owner Vijay Mallya.]         
	Competition organisers have switched the IPL semi-finals which were due to be played in Bangalore on Wednesday and Thursday to Mumbai in response to the blast which injured at least 14 people.         
	A second bomb exploded close to the Chinnaswamy Stadium and two further unexploded devices were found on Sunday.         
	But the PCA still wants more details about the circumstances that led to Saturdays match being played after one of the non-Indian players involved claimed the decision was left to the players.         
	The immediate worry for us, and I have heard this direct from one of the players, is that after the initial explosion and a sweep of the stadium, the decision that the game should go ahead was taken by the players, said Ian Smith, the PCAs legal adviser.         
	From what I have been told, the Indian guys said very quickly that they felt unfazed. But the foreign guys then felt under pressure to agree with their colleagues. The idea that you can determine whether conditions are safe by a referendum of the players is outrageous.         
	They were out in the middle warming up when the bomb went off. We dont know who provided them with the information on which they made their decision.         
	Smith has been unable to speak to any of the six English players  Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Owais Shah, Michael Lumb, Pietersen and Ravi Bopara  who are involved in the IPL.         
	But Smith has had email communication with them and advised them to await a full report from IPL security experts Nicholls Steyn Associates and Reg Dickason, security adviser to the Federation of International Cricketers Associations.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said the decision to relocate the semi-finals had been taken reluctantly. The incidents were assessed by local police and the IPLs security agency as being of a minor nature but they have forced our hand, he said. We do not want to take any chances and we want to ensure total safety for the players and the spectators.         
	Saturdays bomb blast coincided with the start of an International Cricket Council board meeting in Dubai and is bound to raise renewed concerns about security for next years World Cup.

	Melbourne: Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard appeared for an interview in front of a seven-member committee to select the vice-president designate of the International Cricket Councils (ICC) on Thursday, but the committee is yet to make up its mind, according to a report.         
	The vice-presidents post will be left vacant after Indias Sharad Pawar takes charge as chief of ICC, in June.         
	[That the cricket Boards of Australia and New Zealand would be meeting to break the deadlock over who should be nominated as the next vice-president of the world body had been reported by The Telegraph on January 24. Also, that Sir Roderick Eddington of Australia would be the independent member on the seven-member panel.]         
	Howard appeared before a seven-member committee after Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket failed to nominate a single candidate for the post. A seven-member committee  three from Australia, three from New Zealand and an Australian independent member, Roderick Eddington  interviewed Howard and former New Zealand Cricket chairman Sir John Anderson for the post, the report said.         
	But the committee could not reach a conclusion and may take two more weeks to decide who the successful candidate will be, the report added.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne offers to help out Hauritz
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne offers to help out Hauritz
                      
	Melbourne: After using his famed digits to publicly criticise captain Ricky Ponting on Twitter during Australias Test loss to India on Wednesday, Shane Warne has proffered them to help embattled spinner Nathan Hauritz get his groove back.         
	Warne said Hauritz remained Australias top spinner, but needed to find form ahead of the Ashes starting next month after Indian batsmen tore him apart on the way to sealing a thumping seven-wicket victory in Bangalore.         
	Thats up to Ricky Ponting and (coach) Tim Nielsen, but if they are happy for me to work with Horry (Hauritz) before the Ashes, then Im more than happy to, local media on Friday quoted Warne as saying.         
	I will make myself available and fit it into my schedule. Murali, Daniel Vettori and myself and a lot of other spinners have been smashed in India at times. How Horry bounces back in Australia this summer is the key.         
	Warne, who blamed Ponting for the porous field placement for Hauritz in his Twitter rampage on the final day, said that there was no question of rushing legspinner-in-waiting Steve Smith into the pressure cooker of Ashes cricket. In my opinion, Steve Smith is still a long way short of being Australias No. 1 Test spinner, Warne said.         
	The retired leggies offer may be viewed dimly by Ponting, who earlier dismissed the Twitter critique as ill-informed and said Hauritz had set his own field. Me and Ricky are mates and just because we have a disagreement ... doesnt mean we suddenly hate each other, Warne said.

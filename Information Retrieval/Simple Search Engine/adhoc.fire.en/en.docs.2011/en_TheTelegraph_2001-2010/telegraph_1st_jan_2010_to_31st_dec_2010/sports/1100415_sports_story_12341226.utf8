The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to go a step further: Kumble
                                                                                                                       7                                      Want to go a step further: Kumble
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Anil Kumble-led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) took a step further towards the semi-finals of the Indian Premier League after a convincing five-wicket victory over the Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur on Wednesday.         
	After a fine performance from the RCB bowlers, who restricted Shane Warnes side to 130 for six, Kevin Pietersen hit a match winning 29-ball 62 to see the home side through.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, Kumble credited his bowlers for putting up a disciplined show in the must-win tie. His counterpart, Warne thought the first six overs of their innings, in which they managed a meagre 30 for three, cost them the match.         
	Man of the Match Pietersen, too, felt that their bowlers had set the tone for victory.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Kumble: It is nice to win this must-win match We were also conscious about our net run-rate as that may prove to be crucial in the race for the semi-finals. In fact, we lost some wickets in our urgency to up the net run-rate. But overall, it was a solid all-round performance from the team to clinch this must-win game. I thought 150 would be the ideal total in this sort of a wicket. Our bowlers did a splendid job in restricting them (the Royals) to a low score. Someone like Pankaj Singh, who didnt play much in this IPL, came off the bench and performed straightaway. Pietersen batted exceptionally well. Our last match is against the Mumbai Indians and, importantly, it is at home. Playing in Bangalore does give us an advantage. Our goal this time is to go one step further than what we did last season. Hopefully, we will be able to achieve that.         
	Warne: I think we lost the match in the first six overs. We simply didnt manage to score enough during that period We didnt get the start we wanted. But all credit goes to the Royal Challengers bowlers for putting up a great show. On this wicket, 160 would have been a good score So, I think we were 20-30 short of the ideal total. However, it was a pretty good wicket and cant blame it for the loss. After losing early wickets, we did well to reach 130. Considering we have an inexperienced side this time, we have done quite well. After losing the first few games, we did well to recover. It has been a fantastic journey and shows the character of the team. We need a miracle from here on to make it to the semis But no matter what, we have learnt a lot from our journey in this IPL.         
	Pietersen: It was a good night for me But I think the bowlers set the tone for our victory and we just carried on from there. It was a do-or-die situation and the team did really well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henin talks tough 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Henin talks tough 
                      
	Paris: The last time Justine Henin faced Maria Sharapova she suffered a 6-4, 6-0 spanking, but the 2008 Australian Open scenario is unlikely to repeat itself at Roland Garros, the Belgian warned on Friday.         
	A few months after that crushing quarter final defeat in Melbourne, Henin announced her retirement. As she heads into her French Open third-round tie with another former world No.1, the four-time French Open champion is brimming with a desire to play  and win again  on her comeback season after a 20-month break.         
	It seems so far away. I mean, it even seems like it never existed, that moment, Henin told reporters of the Sharapova defeat after beating Czech Klara Zakopalova 6-3, 6-3.         
	I didnt want to be on the court anymore at that time, and now I have a lot of motivation to be out there and to fight and try to keep winning.         
	Back in the place she calls her Paris garden, where she triumphed in 2003 and from 2005-07, Henin has shown glimpses of her brilliant best.         
	Although Sharapova has lost both her clay court meetings with her, Henin is not taking anything for granted. She remains very, very strong. Because she has fighting spirit, its going to be a question of attitude and just try to be aggressive. I want to win the match, the Belgian said.

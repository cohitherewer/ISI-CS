The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symmo: Ashes will be an even contest 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Symmo: Ashes will be an even contest 
                      
	New Delhi: England are the favourites to win this years Ashes as Ricky Pontings men have lost their aura of invincibility, feels former Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds.         
	Symonds, who turned into a freelance cricketer last year, feels Australia are no longer the winning machine they used to be in the past.         
	If you look at form, England have to be the favourites. Thats what people say. But that means nothing. Obviously, Australia had some injury problems with their bowlers, but come Ashes, I think they will have their full quota of bowlers to select from. Personally, I will love to see Australia win, the 35-year-old Australian said.         
	But it will be an even contest. England will think they definitely can beat Australia. I think every team is realising that Australia are a team that can be beaten.         
	Australia thrashed England 5-0 the last time the Ashes were contested Down Under in 2006. England, however, returned the favour by winning the home series in 2008. (PTI)

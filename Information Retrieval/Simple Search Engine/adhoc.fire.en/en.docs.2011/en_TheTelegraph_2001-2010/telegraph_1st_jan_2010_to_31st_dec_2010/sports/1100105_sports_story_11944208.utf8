The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morkel, Steyn rock England 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Morkel, Steyn rock England 
                      
	Cape Town: Seamers Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn took three England wickets each to lift South Africa on the second day of the third Test on Monday. England, replying to the hosts 291, reached 241 for seven at the close thanks to battling knocks by Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Matt Prior.         
	Cook fell just after tea for 65, paddling Morkel to mid-wicket, and Prior and Bell added 41 for the sixth wicket before Bell cut the nagging seam bowling of Jacques Kallis straight to backward point.         
	Bell made 48 in nearly three hours at the crease and Prior, who survived several anxious moments, completed his 12th Test half-century two balls before the close. He finished unbeaten on 52 with Graeme Swann on five. South Africa, resuming on 279 for six, lost four wickets for 12 runs in a dramatic collapse in the morning.         
	Were probably marginally ahead and if we can knock over their tail tomorrow like they did to us this morning and then get through the new ball ourselves, well feel really on top, centurion Kallis said.         
	Kallis fell to the first ball he faced, the second of the morning, when he edged a Graham Onions to wicket-keeper Prior for 108.         
	Steyn also failed to add to his score of 26 when he edged James Andersons first ball of the day into the slips, Jonathan Trott taking a sharp catch. Anderson gained reward for his top-class swing bowling when he dismissed Morkel, Swann taking a superb diving catch at second slip, and Friedel de Wet for ducks to complete fine figures of five for 63.         
	England were quickly in trouble when captain Andrew Strauss edged a flat-footed drive at an away-swinger from Morkel to be caught behind for two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viraat feat plotted in Australia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Viraat feat plotted in Australia
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Viraat Badhwar became the latest from the country to prove that making a mark in world sport is not entirely beyond Indias reach.         
	But as his countrymen celebrate the soon to be 14-year-olds amazing triumph in the Callaway World Junior Championship, they would do well to note that Viraats title was won, not on the fairways of his native New Delhi, but on the playing fields of Brisbane. The youngster moved Down Under some two-and-a-half years ago to take advanced coaching in golf.         
	Viraat became the first Indian to win the prestigious title in San Diego, on Friday, when, after turning in brilliant cards of 69 and 71 in the first two rounds, he sank five birdies and an eagle against three bogeys in the final round. His total score was eight-under 208 as he clinched a one-stroke win over his nearest rival Rico Hoey.         
	And the credit, according to an American daily that spoke to Viraat right after the momentous win, goes to his Australian mentors.         
	(Australia) is just brilliant for golf, and my coach has changed me from an average golfer to what I am today, Viraat told the San Diego daily.         
	Viraat is just one among a new posse of Indian athletes who are increasingly opting for academies and coaches based abroad to train them for a career in sports. Somdev Dev Varman found what he was looking for in the United States and rose to prominence while attending college at the University of Virginia.         
	Then there is Abhinav Bindra, the countrys only individual Olympic gold medallist. Bindra, has frequently travelled to Germany for training and it was a Swiss lady, Gabriele Buhlmann, who was his coach when he shot his way to gold at the 2008 Games. Also World chess champion Viswanathan Anand who is settled in Linares with a team of experts working in tandem to improve his game.         
	There are many more Indians, who, like the above, have benefited from foreign assistance. So does Indias road to sporting glory lie through foreign lands? Viraat, for one, has no doubt that it is so.         
	It (the shift to Australia) has done great wonders for me, Viraat said. India wasnt a destination for my golf. There was no competition. I wanted to go somewhere with better golf courses and better fields.

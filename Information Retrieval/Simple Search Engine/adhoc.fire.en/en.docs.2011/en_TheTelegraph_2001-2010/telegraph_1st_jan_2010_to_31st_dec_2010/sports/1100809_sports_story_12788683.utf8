The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wozniacki has it easy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wozniacki has it easy
                      
	Copenhagen: Caroline Wozniacki defeated Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 7-6 (5) to win the Danish Open on Sunday.         
	Under pressure to win the inaugural event in front of an expectant home crowd, the top-seeded Wozniacki had wobbled as she advanced to the final, but needed just 78 minutes to claim her eighth Womens Tennis Association Tour title in straight sets at the Farum Arena.         
	Zakopalova had beaten the second-seeded Li Na of China in the semi-finals of the indoor hard court tournament, but was unable to upset Wozniacki, who broke twice and held serve to take the first set comfortably.         
	Seventh-seeded Zakopalova did manage to break Wozniacki with the scores at 2-2 in the second, but the No. 3-ranked player fought back to take the set to a tie-breaker.         
	Wozniacki had five match points before finally closing out the match, to the delight of the crowd.         
	It was only the second time that the pair had faced each other. Wozniacki won the first meeting in three sets at the Japan Open in 2007.         
	Victory at the $220,000 tournament gives Wozniacki her second title of the year. In May, she also won the Ponte Vedra Beach event.         
	I think its great for Danish tennis that this event happened, and its just nice that so many people came here to support me, said Wozniacki after the victory.         
	Ive got a big stretch of tournaments coming up, but I felt like I needed a lot of matches  my ankle is no longer an issue and when Im healthy I feel like I really want to play.

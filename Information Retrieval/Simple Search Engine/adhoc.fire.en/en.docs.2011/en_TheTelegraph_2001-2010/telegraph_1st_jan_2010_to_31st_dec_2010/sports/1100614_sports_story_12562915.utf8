The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Abidal for right fouls
                                                                                                                       7                                      Abidal for right fouls
                      
	Knysna: France defender Eric Abidal says players have to make the right fouls to avoid getting a yellow card early at the World Cup because he thinks referees give them out more easily at that stage of the tournament.         
	Franck Ribery and Patrice Evra were booked by Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura within the first 20 minutes of Frances 0-0 draw against Uruguay on Friday for tugging opponents back.         
	Abidal says the referees will be more attentive to detail in the first matches and will put their hands in their pockets more easily compared to later in a tournament.         
	Meanwhile, France players dont want anything to do with the countrys sports minister who publicly criticised the team for staying at a lavish hotel, Abidal said before the team visited a township Sunday.         
	France is staying at a resort in Knysna, overlooking the Indian Ocean. Sports minister Rama Yade previously said this lacked decency during an economic crisis.         
	Yade played down the rift, but gave no suggestion there would be an immediate reconciliation.(agencies)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Despite an injury worry, Bhaichung Bhutia, on Monday, was named to lead the 23-member Indian team for the Asian Cup, beginning in Doha, on January 9.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, Bhutia, whose inclusion in the team looked doubtful after he sustained an injury in the right calf muscle in Dubai, was cleared for selection after the team management received green signal from the doctor and physio. My chances of making the starting line-up in the opener against Australia is 50-50, said Bhutia from Dubai.         
	Still, I have a different role to play for the national team in this tournament. I am seeing my doctor in the next couple of days and would try my best to make a comeback before the start of the meet, said the ace striker.         
	Bhutia is a big player and his presence itself is a huge boost for the team, said an AIFF official. For the Indian team, Bhutia is like what David Beckham was for the England team in the last World Cup. We sincerely hope he regains his fitness in the next few days.         
	Yet, the team management has left the options open and has kept striker Mohammed Rafi, who is not in the list of 23, as standby and a possible last moment replacement for any injured footballer, mainly the captain. Rafi was adjudged the man of the tournament in the last I-League. Houghton, however, has not officially announced his list of standbys.         
	As per tournament rules, in case of an injury, each team is allowed to replace a footballer in the squad six hours before the start of the first match. The replacement has to come from the original pool of players, who were registered early his month.         
	However, Houghtons plan to keep all the excluded footballers along with the selected lot so that they can watch the Asian Cup matches from the stands did not materialise, as most of the dropped players wanted to return home immediately. At least five of these players  Mohan Raj, Jagpreet Singh, Samir naik, James Singh and Baljit Sahni  said they were willing to leave and would be coming back on Tuesday.         
	Two senior AIFF officials  vice president Subrata Dutta and general secretary Kushal Das  are also expected to leave for Dubai, where the team is camping at the moment. They are to leave, latest by Wednesday, to meet the team members especially after the controversy that forced manager Pradeep Chowdhury to leave the team in a huff. The AIFF has appointed Raul Fernandes as Chowdhurys replacement after the former manager refused to return to Dubai.         
	While Chowdhury said he was shocked and hurt by statements issued by the players against him, team sources in Dubai claimed that not all the players shared the opinion that was issued as a statement on behalf of the entire national team. In the meeting held by the players after Chowdhury decided to leave, we only said it was an unfortunate incident, said a footballer on condition of anonymity.         
	Many of us have nothing to do with what the rest of the statement says, he said, adding there are several players who would like to remain neutral on this issue and rather concentrate on their game.

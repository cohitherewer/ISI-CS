                  Roger Federer during his match against Marcos Baghdatis in Indian Wells, on Tuesday                     
	Indian Wells: Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis celebrated the greatest victory of his career after upsetting world No. 1 Roger Federer 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 in the third round of the Indian Wells ATP tournament on Tuesday.         
	The 24-year-old, who had lost to the Swiss master in all six of their previous meetings, saved three match points before clinching the decisive tiebreak 7-4.         
	Baghdatis kissed the ground in celebration after his opponent failed to return a powerful first serve.         
	The Cypriots shock win against a 16-times grand slam champion earned him a place in the fourth round against Spaniard Tommy Robredo, who beat Israels Dudi Sela 6-3, 6-0 earlier in the day.         
	A lot of emotions are going through right now, the 27th-ranked Baghdatis told reporters. Its the best win of my career.         
	I lost a lot of matches against those top guys, and its a relief to win a match like that. Its a great moment for me.         
	Federer, beaten for only the second time in 13 matches this year and playing his first tournament since winning the Australian Open in January, reflected on the fine line between victory and defeat.         
	I just couldnt find the way to win, the 28-year-old said after losing the third-set tiebreak 7-4. I was maybe one shot away. Thats how much it takes sometimes from winning or losing.         
	Thats why you cant say I played a bad match, and if I win Im going to tell you its a good match. It was a decent match, but maybe wrong choices at the wrong time for me.         
	American Andy Roddick booked his place in the fourth round with a clinical 6-3, 6-4 win against Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker, where he was joined by fourth seed Andy Murray, who suffered a late wobble before beating American Michael Russell 6-3, 7-5.         
	Murray appeared to be cruising to a routine victory when he led by a set and 5-2 but Russell offered dogged resistance to extend the Scot who was not at his best. (Reuters)

                                Saina Nehwal,      
	Hyderabad: The quarter final ouster in World Championship is a thing of past for ace shuttler Saina Nehwal, whose only target is now to clinch a medal for the country in next months Commonwealth Games to be held in Delhi.         
	My aim is to win a medal for the country at the Commonwealth Games, the shuttler said even as she went into intense preparations at the Pullela Gopichand-Nimmagadda Foundation Badminton Academy at Gachibowli here.         
	I have four more weeks for that (Commonwealth Games). This time I will be preparing even harder, because its happening in India. Its a big tournament. I am focusing on my game and I have to win a medal. Lets see what happens finally, the World No.3 Saina said.         
	For me its only preparations now for doing well in the Commonwealth Games, she added.         
	Asked about her experience at the World Championship in Paris, where she lost to Chinese Shixian Wang, the 20-year-old said: I think I was not moving quite well on that day. It was really a slow game for me, though I gave her a tough fight.         
	I need to work more on my movements and also on my mental strength, because in this match I noticed that I gave up some points. I didnt even think I will do such kind of silly mistakes. May be next time I will overcome (mistakes), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awardee noted.         
	Meanwhile, Sainas predecessor, Aparna Popat feels that the ace shuttler should aim for nothing less than fetching the country its first womens gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. She has to go for the gold medal. Nothing less will do, said Aparna           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I should keep scoring fifties: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                      I should keep scoring fifties: Sachin
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar said at the post-match presentation ceremony Sunday that it felt nice to clinch the maiden semi-final berth in the IPL in Jaipur, where they had lost out on a last-four berth during the first edition. The Mumbai Indians, incidentally, could not make it to the last four in the second edition, too.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Sachin Tendulkar: I am happy that we have put up a solid performance today. I think 170-plus was par for the course on this wicket. It was a competitive total. Our bowlers put up a solid show. Zaheer bowled a great first spell. I didnt panic when we were around 116 for five at the end of 15 overs. I knew it was a matter of couple of big overs, which would come at some stage. Since I was there, there was added responsibility. I must also give credit to our fielders. The fielding was really sharp today. There were some important run-outs, and the catches were well taken. It was a special performance indeed. I am happy that whenever I score a fifty, Mumbai Indians win. I better make sure that I keep scoring fifties and Mumbai Indians keep winning. It is definitely a huge relief now that we are in the semi-finals. Its all the more special because this is the same ground (Sawai Mansingh Stadium) where we lost out on a semi-final berth during the first edition. The pitch was a good one as the ball was nicely coming on to the bat. However, there wasnt much bounce.         
	Shane Warne: We were outplayed today. We had things under control till the 15th over (of the Mumbai Indians innings). However, we couldnt finish it off as we would have liked. Also, our batting in the first six overs was in shambles. There were quite a few run outs. I guess net run rate will be a crucial factor while determining the other semi-finalists. We did pretty badly on that account today. We needed to get as many as possible in order to be up on the table. I believe 170-plus was gettable but we should have restricted them to 150. The key to success was to get off to a good start, but unfortunately, we panicked and paid the price.         
	Zaheer Khan: I am thoroughly enjoying the responsibilities of the vice-captain. Im happy that we have reached the semi-finals but we would like to maintain the same level of intensity. We would go out there and play to win the remaining matches as well.

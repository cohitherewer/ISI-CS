The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Toal: Focus should be on youth development
                                                                                                                       7                                      Toal: Focus should be on youth development
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Colin Toal      
	Calcutta: The countrymen might be basking in the warmth of the World Cup, but that the country is still struggling to get the basics of the game right was once again reminded by India under-19 football coach Colin Toal, here on Wednesday.         
	In the city to spot some young talents in the ongoing national under-19 tournament for the BC Roy Trophy, Toal urged the state associations to play a more active part in youth development programmes.         
	The U-14, U-16 and U-19 national are very important for Indian football because that will provide us with the core for the senior team in the coming years. The state associations should be actively involved because unless that is done, there remains a gap between top level and the grassroots level. That kind of explains why we havent made much progress in the Fifa rankings, Toal said.         
	Citing the example of Goa, who he said were doing a good job for the development of the game, Toal said: In Goa there are different age group tournaments not only for the clubs but also among the villages. They are doing a good job.         
	Speaking about the 2011 Asian Cup, the Englishman said: The AFC (Asian Football Confederation) stressed on the fact that while it is a good thing that India will be playing the prestigious meet after a long gap, the country needs to strengthen the I-League for better results.         
	He also informed that he will be selecting 75 players from the U-19 tournament, which will later be curtailed to 30, and they will undergo training in Goa.         
	Toal, however, didnt sound much interested with the All India Football Federations idea of including an under-19 national team for the I-League. We will have to wait and see I have taken a step back from that squad as they are now ready. I will work with the juniors to mould our next U-19 team, he said.

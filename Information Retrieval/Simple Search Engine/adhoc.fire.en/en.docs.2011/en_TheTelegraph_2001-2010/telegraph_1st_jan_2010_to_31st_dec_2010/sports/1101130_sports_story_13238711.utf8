The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara predicts a competitive Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sangakkara predicts a competitive Cup
                      
	New Delhi: With one-country domination over after Australias decline, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara feels that the 2011 Cricket World Cup is going to be one of the most competitive and open ones in recent times.         
	Yes, the World Cup next year is going to be the most competitive in recent times for a number of reasons. Australia have been defeated all around the world. The domination of spin in the sub-continent is also not what it used to be earlier as a lot of teams play spin better now. And for the sub-continent teams, the format of the tournament makes it very competitive, Sangakkara said on Monday.         
	The straightaway elimination after the first round to make it to quarterfinals and then moving on to the semifinals and final will surely make the mega-event even more tougher this time, Sangakkara added.           (PTI)

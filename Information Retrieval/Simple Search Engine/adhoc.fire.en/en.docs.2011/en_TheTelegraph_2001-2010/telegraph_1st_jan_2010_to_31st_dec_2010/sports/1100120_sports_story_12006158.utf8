The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bonds a nice package: Whatmore
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bonds a nice package: Whatmore
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dav Whatmore                           
	Chittagong: Dav Whatmore, the Kolkata Knight Riders coach, is delighted that the franchise bagged Shane Bond during Tuesdays auction for IPL III.         
	Im very pleased... Bond meets our requirements... Hes a very fine bowler and a hard trier... Besides, hes a very decent bloke... Bonds a nice package, Whatmore told The Telegraph, when contacted on his cellphone.         
	Availability, too, is a factor  the 34-year-old speed merchant is through with Test cricket for the Black Caps.         
	On the flip side, Bond, who had sweaty palms while the auction was on, has been injury-prone throughout his career.         
	Acknowledging that, Whatmore pointed out: But who doesnt get injured? Were aware of Bonds condition and will try our best to see that he remains fit... Also, you must remember that, for a bowler, T20 is a four-over game...         
	In other words, ideally suited for strike bowlers.         
	Whatmore didnt dwell much on the craze for Kieron Pollard, whod hardly been heard of till a few months ago. The Knights were keen on him, but lost out in the tiebreaker.         
	Ishant Sharma, meanwhile, is looking forward to partnering Bond.         
	Ive only seen Bond on the TV... Hes a good bowler and Im looking forward to playing with him... This is a crucial year for us, Ishant, who is doing duty in the Test here, said.         
	The Shoaib Akhtar-Ishant combination didnt set the Hooghly on fire, in the IPLs inaugural edition (2008). Perhaps, the Bond-Ishant pair will.         
	Footnote: Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasan, who wasnt bought by any franchise, insisted he wouldnt lose sleep. Aamar chinta chilo na... Na chinta hobe... Im fine...

	Singapore: Ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal is in line for a second Super Series title after scoring a come-from-behind victory over Lan Lu of China in the semi-finals of the Singapore Open here on Saturday.         
	The top-seeded Indian, currently ranked sixth in the world, rallied from a game down to beat her fourth-seeded opponent 8-21, 21-17, 21-8 in 49 minutes to storm into the final of the Super Series tournament at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.         
	Saina, who bagged her maiden Super Series title in June last year by winning the Indonesian Open, will meet qualifier Tzu Ying Tai of Chinese Taipei in the summit clash on Sunday.         
	Saina had won an event in India before this meet.         
	Tai defeated Youn Joo Bae of Korea 21-16 21-18 in the other semi-final.         
	In the mens singles, however, Indias Parupalli Kashyap lost to seventh seed Indonesian Sony Kuncoro 19-21, 20-22 in a hard-fought semi-final match that lasted 48 minutes in the Stadium here.

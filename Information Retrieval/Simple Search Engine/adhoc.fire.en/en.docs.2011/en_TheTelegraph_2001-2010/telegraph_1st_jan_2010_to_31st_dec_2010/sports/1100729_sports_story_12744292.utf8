The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru: Were in good position
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru: Were in good position
            A CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag in Colombo, on Wednesday. (AFP)                           
	Virender Sehwag was not all that disappointed at losing out on a hundred on Thursday. The anodyne for him was another memorable innings by Sachin Tendulkar. The maestros century kept India in the second Test and gave Sehwag much to be hopeful about.         
	The vice-captain led Team Indias reply to the massive Sri Lanka total but had to depart on 99, after going for an unnecessary shot against Suraj Randiv. But Sachin stepped up once again and, in the company of debutant Suresh Raina, scripted a recovery.         
	Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Sehwag said a lot now depends on Day IV when India will have to ensure that they avoid following-on.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On getting out on 99         
	Yes, Im disappointed... Not that I got out on 99, but because the day couldve been very good for us... We had a great opportunity (because of the wicket) to post a big total, but let it go... Thanks to Sachin, were in a good position If we play well tomorrow (Thursday) then we can avoid the follow-on and also bat the whole day.         
	If he regrets having gone for that shot on 99         
	Yes. I read it, I knew it was the doosra but went for the shot.         
	Whether anyone had anything to say to him after he got out on 99         
	Now I have played many Test matches, so nobody will tell me that I have missed a hundred. It is written there in big letters that I made just 99.         
	On watching the scoreboard         
	Yes. I was watching the scoreboard every time. Sometimes I was counting my runs 81, 82, 83. What if the scorer made a mistake.         
	Learning from Sachin         
	It is difficult to say Everyday we hear him in the dressing room and that is equal to learning for us. Sachin (Tendulkar) still has the hunger of a debutant... When both Suresh Raina and he were batting, kaun debutant tha kehna mushkil tha... The point about Sachin is that when he gets down to playing, its as if hes in his first match... Today also there is as much hunger (in him) as there is in a youngster. Look at Raina batting and Tendulkar one cant tell who is making his debut. The big plus point about Sachin is that whenever he gets down to playing, it is as if he is playing his first game.         
	If at one stage he felt India would be unable to avoid the follow-on         
	Not really. Because the wicket is so good to bat on. I knew somebody would make a big one. I was expecting V.V.S. (Laxman) and Sachin to complete the hundreds. (But) unfortunately Laxman got out. Full credit to Suresh Raina. He batted really well and scored his 50. I am hoping tomorrow he will complete his hundred.         
	Batting after fielding for a day-and-a-half...         
	It is a tough job. But there was the opportunity that if you batted for 18 overs, youd have a chance to score 50 and I did that. I grabbed the opportunity and tried to score a big one, but unfortunately I got out.         
	If there will be a result         
	It is difficult to say, but I think there will be a result. It doesnt matter who wins...         
	The wicket         
	Last time, too, it was a slow track. In the subcontinent you will get wickets like that  first two days are good for batting, on the third day there is a little bit of spin, and, on the fourth and fifth days, the spinners will get more help. It is difficult batting on the fourth evening or the fifth day. We will try to bat a full day and score as many as we can.         
	Hoping for cracks on the pitch         
	We are hoping that the track will crack Cracks were opening up, so I am hoping that a result will come.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1950s: Peleful and loving it
                                                                                                                       7                                      1950s: Peleful and loving it

	The hiatus caused by World War II saw Italy remain world champions for 12 years. Finally, when the World Cup resumed in 1950, the emergence of some highly entertaining superstars gave it something of a glam quotient.         
	To add to it, some great strategists guided their respective teams from the sidelines and football, now, came to be regarded as sport that had a lot to do with tactics.         
	The ups and downs that World Cup witnessed in its three editions in the decade  1950, 1954 and 1958  remain unmatched till date.         
	Who could imagine the mighty Brazilians would bite the dust on home turf against Uruguay in the 1950 final or the great Hungarian side would have to stand and watch West Germany receiving the Cup four years later in Switzerland.         
	All the great memories of World Cups past, however, simply faded when, in 1958, debutant Pele burst onto the scene with a band of highly skillful Brazilians that destroyed everything in its path. Absolutely unstoppable as he always has been, Peles dazzling display not only won the cup for Brazil but also opened a new chapter in world football.         
	There were other greats as well, in this era, but sadly enough, they ended up tragic heroes. Ferenc Puskas, of the great Hungarian team revered as the Magical Magyars, was perhaps the most outstanding player of his era.         
	His fierce left footers made him a threat even from distance and his stamina meant there would be no respite during ninety minutes of football.         
	In eighty-four games for Hungary, Puskas scored no less than eighty-three goals but the Galloping Major ended up on the losing side in the 1954 final.         
	In 1958, Juste Fontaine of France had ample opportunity to become the No.1 star but his 13-goal effort was totally overshadowed by Peles epic exploits.         
	The final was an absolute massacre of the innocents as Brazil demolished hosts Sweden 5-2.               
	MEMORABLE MATCH         
	Hungary and Brazil met in 1954 as arguably the two best sides in the world but those who turned up at the stadium that day expecting a feast of football, got no more than a ringside view in an ill-tempered brawl from which neither side emerged with any credit. Named as the Battle of Berne, Hungary were up 2-0 after seven minutes and 3-1 till 20 minutes into the second half.         
	The rough encounter became a boxing match in the end and there were three send-offs. Hungary won 4-2 and the Latin Americans stormed into the Hungarian dressing room.         
	In a free for all, Puskas, who did not play the match, found himself hitting Pinheiro, centre-half, with a bottle. The Brazilian was seen leaving with a bandaged five-inch head wound.               
	THE GREATEST               
	In the 1958 World Cup, Brazil would finally realise its potential. That was the championship from which would emerge a new star: Edson Arantes do Nascimento, or Pele, a name acquired at the age of nine. Pele seemed to be without a weakness: he was exceptionally fast and agile, his superb sense of balance created an impression of grace no matter what position his body adopted; he had a powerful shot and a strong header. The greatest footballer of all time had finally arrived to conquer the world.               
	TRIVIA               
	For the first time in 1958, World Cup received international television coverage and the world could see the mastery of the stars of modern football  Kopa, Fontaine, Yashin, Garrincha, Vava and Pele. The sixth Fifa World Cup was also to be marked by a record number of countries taking part  55 of them. The qualifying rounds threw up some startling surprises: Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Uruguay and, most unexpectedly, Italy, all failed to qualify.

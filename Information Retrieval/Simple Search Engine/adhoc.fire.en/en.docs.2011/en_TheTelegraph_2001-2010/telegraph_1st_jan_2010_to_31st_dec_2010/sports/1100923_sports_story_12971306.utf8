The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morgan lifts England
                                                                                                                       7                                        Morgan lifts England
                  Eoin Morgan                     
	Southampton: Eoin Morgan scored an unbeaten 107 to help England to 256 for six at The Rose Bowl on Wednesday in the fifth and deciding one-day International of an ill-tempered series against Pakistan.         
	Pakistan required 257 from their 50 overs at 5.14 runs per over to salvage consolation from a difficult tour. Left-hander Morgan, who helped take 19 runs from the 50th over, faced 101 deliveries and shared a stand of 93 with Paul Collingwood, who defied a migraine for his 47. Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar claimed three off 40 runs from his 10 overs.         
	With the series at 2-2, Pakistan is hoping to end a troubled tour on a positive note after a 3-1 Test series loss and 2-0 defeat in the Twenty20 series.         
	Off the field, three of their players were suspended by the International Cricket Council on corruption charges earlier this month. The ill-feeling progressed further when Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt alleged on Sunday that England lost Fridays third ODI at the Oval on purpose.         
	Englands players were incensed by the slur and are considering legal action. The hosts were jolted early at a packed Rose Bowl, losing three wickets for 16 runs to slump to 47 for three after being 31 without loss. It was effectively 59 for four when Collingwood was forced to retire with a migraine on 5.         
	After Steven Davies was stumped off Mohammed Hafeez for 17, Jonathan Trott and captain Andrew Strauss followed him to the pavilion.         
	Trott, averaging 70 in one-day internationals at the start of the series, continued a downturn in form by following scores of 2 and 4 with a 3. He was bowled by a quick delivery from Akhtar that swung into him.

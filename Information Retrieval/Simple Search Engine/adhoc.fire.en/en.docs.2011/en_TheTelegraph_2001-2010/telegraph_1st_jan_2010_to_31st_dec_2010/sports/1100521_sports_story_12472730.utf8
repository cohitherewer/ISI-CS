The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB warning 
                                                                                                                       7                                      ECB warning 
                      
	London: Without mentioning Lalit Modis name, the England and Wales Cricket Board has warned its Counties against holding discussions with suspended Indian cricket board officials.         
	The ECB had caused a stir a few days ago by sending BCCI an e-mail which allegedly revealed that suspended IPL commissioner Modi was secretly planning a parallel Twenty20 league in collusion with at least three Counties.         
	Modi was show caused by the BCCI on the basis of that e-mail. In its latest statement, the ECB said the BCCI has asked it to keep off suspended officials.         
	The BCCI has further reminded ECB that it does not authorise any discussions with suspended officials of its Board and should any person involved in English cricket receive any contact from a suspended official then ECB has been asked to immediately report this matter to BCCI, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss: Draw not an option
                                                                                                                       7                                      Strauss: Draw not an option
                      
	Johannesburg: England captain Andrew Strauss said his side would pay dearly if they tried to play for a draw in the fourth and final Test against South Africa starting at the Wanderers on Thursday.         
	England go into the match with a 1-0 advantage but Strauss cautioned against trying to protect that lead.         
	Well be going in trying to win, its as simple as that, well be using the same style that was successful before, Strauss told a news conference.         
	If you go into a Test thinking you only need a draw that can be very dangerous because then your mindset can be negative and hesitant and you end up handing the momentum to the opposition.

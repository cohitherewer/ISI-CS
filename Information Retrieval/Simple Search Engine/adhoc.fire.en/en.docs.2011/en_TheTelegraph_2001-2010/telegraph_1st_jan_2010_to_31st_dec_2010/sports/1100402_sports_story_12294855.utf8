The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is an inspiration in   all forms, says Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin is an inspiration in   all forms, says Sourav
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The favourite whipping boy of Indian cricket (no matter that hell soon be 38), Sourav Ganguly, did some whipping himself, on Thursday night.         
	As for the targets, they were both seen and unseen.         
	In the second category being those who made Dada into a Dadubhai, earlier in the day, and asked him to retire in the best interests of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).         
	[Sourav, by the way, responded calmly  off the field, that is. I still dont know the details... Once in a while, this can happen.]         
	The visible targets were the Deccan Chargers bowlers, particularly Pragyan Ojha, hit for three sixes in one over.         
	MoM Sourav appeared to make a point, even if he didnt set out to, that the national selectors did nothing wrong by not picking the left-arm spinner for the upcoming World T20.         
	Knight No.1 scored 88 off 54 balls (9x4, 5x6) his second-highest in the IPLs three-year history, and got out (146 for four, 17th over) while trying to push the scoring rate even more instead of eyeing a personal landmark.         
	It was an innings which made principal owner Shah Rukh Khan say Dadas looking good... A change from his recent tweets.         
	Souravs masterly innings allowed his bowlers to go about their job without too much pressure and they responded superbly. Shane Bond was outstanding, as were Murali Kartik (wonder why Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. dont find him worthy of a recall) and Angelo Mathews.         
	Asked if dear friend Sachin Tendulkars amazing run (314 runs at an average of 52-plus) in IPL III had been an inspiration, Sourav smiled and told The Telegraph: Its not about T20... Sachins an inspiration in all forms of the game...         
	Unusually, Sourav thumped his chest more than once on reaching his second half-century of the season. However, speaking exclusively, he insisted he hadnt been sending a message.         
	No... There was nothing to it... I was happy... Thumping the chest is one way of conveying happiness, Sourav pointed out.         
	Little happiness was, of course, shared between Sourav and Andrew Symonds, who is known to sledge hard.         
	Indeed, at the media conference, Sourav made it clear that Symonds hadnt congratulated him after the match. For obvious reasons, he didnt get into their on-field exchanges.         
	What matters is that the two points went into KKRs ledger, as an Adam Gilchrist would put it.

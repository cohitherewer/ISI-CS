	Indore: Pankaj Advani on Thursday completed a hat-trick of titles at the Asian Billiards Championship after edging past Singapores Peter Gilchrist 6-5 in a closely fought final here.         
	The double defending champion held his nerves to beat the competition from Gilchrist, who gave a tough time to the Indian with his never-say-die spirit.         
	After losing the opening game 62-103, Pankaj came back well and went on to create a 3-1 cushion. Gilchrist narrowed the margin by taking the fifth game but the Indian got another clearance break of 102 in sixth game.         
	The keen tussle continued till the 10th game but Pankaj did not give any chance to his rival in the deciding 11th game which he sealed with an unfinished break of 100. (PTI)

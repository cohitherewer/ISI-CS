                                                                                                                       7                                        Indian athletes find Village good enough
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Indian hockey players at the dinning hall of the Games Village, in New Delhi, on Saturday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: The Games Village for the Commonwealth Games may not be safe and hygienic for players from England or Australia, but the Organising Committee (OC), it seems, feels it is good enough to house the Indian athletes.         
	The OC, on Saturday came under fire for asking around 150 Indian athletes to check into the Village while the 21-member batch of English athletes was allowed to stay in a hotel.         
	When asked why the authorities had set different rules for the Indians and the visitors, CGF president Mike Fennell came to the rescue of the OC, and said it was the choice of the Indian athletes to stay at the Village.         
	Its a matter of personal choice. The Indian athletes have felt that arrangements are fine. Also the part of the Village that they are staying in, the work has been completed, Fennell said.         
	Sources in the Indian contingent, however, said that though the living condition has improved considerably in the past 24 hours because of constant monitoring by the Delhi government, a lot of work is yet to be completed.         
	The mosquito menace has to be tackled, said an athlete. With the fear of dengue looming large, the foreign athletes, I am sure, will complain once they move into the Village, he said.         
	To tackle the problem, all athletes were given mosquito repellents along with their room keys, the moment they came to Village.         
	On Saturday, Delhi chief minister Shiela Dikshit visited the Village for the second time in two days and met with senior officials of the Delhi Government.         
	Later in the evening, first batch of athletes from foreign nations  Malaysia, Barbados, Sri Lanka and Gibraltar  checked in at the Village. Delegates from Rwanda, Ghana and South Africa have also arrived in Delhi, OC sources said.

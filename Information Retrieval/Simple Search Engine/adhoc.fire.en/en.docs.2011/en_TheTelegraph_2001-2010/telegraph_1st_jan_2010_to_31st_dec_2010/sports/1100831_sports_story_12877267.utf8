The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC will be ruthless: Pawar
                                                                                                                       7                                        ICC will be ruthless: Pawar
    - Buzz is that the ecb wants the tainted players to be sent home             OUR BUREAU            A board with messages left hanging outside the Pakistan team hotel, in London, on Monday                                 
	The International Cricket Council (ICC), on Monday, said the Twenty20 and ODI series between Pakistan and England will go on as per schedule and appropriate action on spot-fixing allegations, against Pakistani cricketers, will be taken after the completion of investigation by the London police.         
	Its the desire of the ICC, England and Pakistan that the game should continue.         
	Moreover, the British Police are still investigating the matter and they have not called any player for interrogation.         
	Unless and until the process of investigation is complete and we get a report that there is a prima facie case, it will be difficult for the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take appropriate action, ICC president Sharad Pawar said.         
	The former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief held a video conference with Giles Clarke, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Ijaz Butt, chairman of the PCB, Alan Isaac, ICC vice president, Haroon Lorgat, chief executive of the ICC and Ravi Sawani, general manager of the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), in Mumbai, on Monday afternoon.         
	In the news conference, though, Pawar said he expected some clarity in the next two-three days.         
	The PCB chairman (Butt) himself is conducting an inquiry and preparing a confidential report to both the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan. He is expecting guidance from the countrys leadership, Pawar said. The ICC is waiting to get more definitive information from the PCB and the ACU. We hope to get those reports in the next two-three days.         
	If, unfortunately, there is a truth (in the allegations) then ruthless actions will be taken, Pawar said         
	Meanwhile, according to a report, top officials of the ICC and the PCB are understood to be considering suspending four Pakistan players, including captain Salman Butt, from the rest of the England tour.         
	According to sources, the ICC had asked the PCB to drop tainted players like Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif from the team for the limited-overs matches.         
	It is learnt that senior England players are reluctant to play unless the tainted players are dropped.         
	Though there was no official confirmation, sources said that ECB officials had made their position clear to Pawar, who then called up Butt and apprised him of the development.         
	Pawar defended the role of the ACSU, which failed to unearth anything substantial despite the whiff of corruption that has been in the air for a while now.         
	They (ACSU) have given the facts, Pawar said.         
	Lorgat, meanwhile, issued a statement which said: Senior ACSU investigators were in the United Kingdom conducting inquiries into the allegations. That investigation has the full support and co-operation of the ECB and the PCB. In addition, the ACSU officials are assisting Londons Metropolitan Police with their criminal investigation.         
	Make no mistake, once the process is complete, if any players are found to be guilty, the ICC will ensure that appropriate punishment is handed out.         
	We will not tolerate corruption in this great game, the statement added.         
	Sources said that the ACSU would study all 82 Tests and ODIs played by Pakistan in the period bookie Mazhar Majeed reportedly claimed to have rigged matches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag get past Mumbai FC
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chirag get past Mumbai FC
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Joshimar                           
	Mumbai: Brazilian Joshimar renewed his love affair with the Cooperage as he starred in Chirag Uniteds morale boosting 2-0 win over Mumbai FC in the I-League football clash here on Tuesday.         
	Joshimar put Chirag in front in the 16th minute after John Coutinho had come up with a gallant header at the goalline to clear the ball but that wasnt good enough. Gouranga Dutta sent the ball back to Joshimar whose close range shot hit the cross bar before bouncing in to the net.         
	Martins then returned the favour to Dutta. Sprinting away on a counter attack, in the added time of the first half, Martins easily outpaced and outsmarted Bernard Achaw and crossed it for Dutta to smash it home.         
	This has become a happy hunting ground for me. I have three goals from two matches here now, the 25-year-old Martins said, referring to his twin strikes in the 2-2 draw against leaders Mahindra United in the fifth round earlier in the season.         
	Martins is now also the top scorer with 13 goals.         
	The win improved the Calcutta clubs tally to 26 points and catapulted them ahead of Bagan to fourth place in the standings. Third placed Churchill Brothers have the same number of points but a better goal difference.         
	The third defeat in a row saw Mumbai FC slip one rung to ninth place.

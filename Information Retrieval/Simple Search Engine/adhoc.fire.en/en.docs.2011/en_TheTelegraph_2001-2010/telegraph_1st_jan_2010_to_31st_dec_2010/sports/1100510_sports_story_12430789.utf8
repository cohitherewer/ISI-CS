The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colaco: Unity key to success
                                                                                                                       7                                      Colaco: Unity key to success
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Armando Colaco Sunday earned his place among the greatest managers in Indias football Hall of Fame.         
	At a time when recruiting the right kind of foreign player is regarded as the key to success, the Dempo coach displayed incredible guts and foresight by not signing the third foreigner or an Asian footballer. And yet Dempo have left the other teams miles behind in the race for the I-League title.         
	The record fourth title is there for all to see. Equally commendable is the yeoman service Armando has rendered to Indian football, especially at the local level in Goa. He kept his faith in footballers like Peter Carvalho, Joaquim Abranches, Anthony Pereira and Clifton Gonsalves and, more importantly, made them deliver the goods.         
	At the same time, Armando has been able to strike a balance. When Sunil Chetri decided to move to the US, I was not a bit worried, the Dempo coach said.         
	I had faith in the likes of Clifton and Abranches, and they have proved me right. They have been fantastic support for Ranty (Martins), one player who I can always depend on, Armando added.         
	The key to their success, Armando said, was the sense of togetherness among the players. The entire team has been wonderful and one reason why Dempo have been successful is the togetherness. This team is a closely-knit unit that knows what it means to stay and play together. I think we will continue with our domination for some time to come, said the coach.         
	Armando was modest enough to not mention how his presence made a major difference. Like all great managers, from the days of S.S. Rahim, G.M. Basha, P.K. Banerjee to Sukhwinder Singh and Subhas Bhowmick recently, Armando has the ability to rally the players around him. No wonder that with arguably the deepest pocket among the I-League clubs and the presence of such an understanding coach, the Goa club would be able to retain the entire team for the next season.         
	The good thing about Dempo is that we have a succession of players ready to challenge for a place in the first team. When any of our regulars get injured, we have no reason to worry, said Armando.

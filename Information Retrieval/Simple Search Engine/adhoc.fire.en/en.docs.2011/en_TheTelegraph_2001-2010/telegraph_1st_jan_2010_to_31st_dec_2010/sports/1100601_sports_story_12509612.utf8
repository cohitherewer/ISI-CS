            TRESS FACTOR                        
	Carlos Valderrama: The coincidence would have been poetic; the man with the bleached blonde Afro leading his team at the first World Cup in Africa. Although there have been many more since  Evertons Marouane Fellaini for one  none has been as recognisable as the Colombian captains permed look. But the hair sure did not get into the eyes of this midfielder known for his vision and creativity with the ball.            
	Ronaldo: Arrived for the 02 finals giving minimalist designers something to think about. The Brazilian superstar just had a sliver of hair at the front of his head. A crescent black patch adorning a clean pate. The teams performance was as memorable as the hairstyle with Ronaldo being the highest scorer.            
	Taribo West: This Nigerian had some radical views on coiffure and was savvy enough with his scissors to try them out. It was not all about the hair though; he had the game to back it up even if it was not out of the world like his hairstyle was outlandish. Has played for both Inter Milan and AC Milan.            
	Umit Davala: This midfielder had hair only in the middle of his head and the look captured the imagination of the fans and the media in 02. The Turks went as far as the semis, where they lost to eventual champions Brazil, and Davala went on to cut a rap album  UD 2004, Here too, another signature volume          
	Ruud Gullit: The dreadlocks quite suite this dreaded practitioner of the game who could play in every position from defence to the frontline. Wore his mane with pride and made sure opponents had a hairy day when he turned on the style.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jadeja ban upheld
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jadeja ban upheld
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ravindra Jadejas hopes of playing in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) went up in smoke after the ban imposed on him for contractual violations was upheld by the IPL governing council-appointed one-man committee.         
	A release from the IPL said the committee chairman and eminent lawyer Arun Jaitley, who is also the president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association, rejected Jadejas appeal and also reprimanded the Mumbai Indians for showing interest in signing the all-rounder midway through his contract with the Rajasthan Royals.         
	In his report, Jaitley said Ravindra Jadeja committed a breach on two counts.         
	First, by not signing the contract with the Royals for the 2010 edition of the IPL. Second, by meeting representatives of the Mumbai franchise and sending his contract documents to them for inspection.

  - Hope to make most of home advantage in Cup             Virender Sehwag in   New Delhi, on Tuesday                                 
	New Delhi: Not amused with the praise and brickbats he gets in equal measure, Indian opener Virender Sehwag Tuesday hit out at critics, saying that he has never been bothered by their comments and would concentrate on playing his natural game.         
	Jab haathi chalta hai toh bahut saare kutte bhaungkte hai (when an elephant walks a lot of dogs bark), but the elephant keeps walking without giving much importance to the lesser animals. And that is exactly how I like to deal with my critics, Sehwag told reporters.         
	It is the players who go out there and perform and not the critics. It is very easy to sit and criticise players. Anyone and everyone can do that, said Sehwag during a promotional.         
	One day they (critics) will make you God and then the very next day they would simply pull you down. So, I just concentrate on playing my natural game and putting in maximum effort, said the swashbuckling opener.         
	Sehwag felt India will have home advantage in the 2011 World Cup.         
	Playing in India would benefit us in the World Cup as we have been playing in these pitches since we were kids and that would certainly give us an edge. However, since other teams also tour India on a regular basis so they also have a fair idea about the tracks and ground conditions We hope to make most of the advantage, he said.         
	He, however, refused to give a direct reply to whether India would be able to break the jinx of no host country having won the World Cup.         
	We will try our best to win the World Cup. All we can do is make more than 100 per cent effort and we will surely do that, he said.         
	He also did not answer when asked if the Indian team was prepared enough for the World Cup. You should ask this question to the selectors, he said.         
	I dont think so, he replied when asked about the listless performance by the Indian middle-order in the tri-series in Sri Lanka last month. (PTI)

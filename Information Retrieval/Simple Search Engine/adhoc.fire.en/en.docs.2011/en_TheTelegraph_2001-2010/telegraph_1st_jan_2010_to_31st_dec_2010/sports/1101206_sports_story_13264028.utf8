The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kochi gets the BCCI nod 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Kochi gets the BCCI nod 
  - All the attention is now on Sunil Gavaskar       OUR BUREAU            Sunil Gavaskar                                 
	Calcutta/Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Sunday allowed the squabbling Kochi franchisee to participate in the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). With this decision, the focus now shifts on Sunil Gavaskar who had been earlier approached by the Kochi franchise for an advisory role in cricket operations.         
	While the former India captain had admitted of receiving an offer, he had made it clear that he would only think about the matter once the fate of the franchise is decided. As things stand now, it is only a formality before Gavaskar comes on board with the Kochi team.         
	The IPL governing council, which met here to take a final decision on the Kochi franchise, did not disclose the exact stakes of each partner in the group, but a source confirmed that the equity of promoters Rendezvous Sports World Pvt. Ltd. had been brought down to 10 per cent.         
	Sundays green signal to the franchise, which would be now called Kochi Cricket Pvt. Ltd., became a formality once the owners met the November 27 deadline set by the BCCI to resolve their internal dispute and set up a joint venture as required in the Franchise Agreement.         
	The source of discord had been the controlling stakes of 25 per cent held by RSWPL.         
	Like in any business venture, we had a difference of opinion. Now that has been resolved and our franchise has been approved by the BCCI. We are happy, Mukesh Patel, owner of Parinee Developers, one of the investors, said after the meeting.         
	Besides Patel, Mehul Shah and Chintan Vohra of Anchor Earth were also present at the meeting. The fact that none from RSWPL negotiated with the BCCI pointed to the erosion of their power.         
	As per the agreement signed by the investors at the time of bidding, the Gaekwad family of Baroda that owns the RSWPL also had the right to appoint the chief executive officer.         
	The Gaekwads would still have representation on the managing committee, though.         
	Its still not clear as to what would be the nature of the equity to be held by the Gaekwads. Patel said that it would be an equal mixture of paid and free equity, but his claim could not be verified.         
	Of the 15 per cent equity off loaded by RSWPL, four per cent has been given to Vivek Venugopal, an individual investor who earlier held one per cent share. The remaining 11 per cent has been distributed among the other investors including Film Wave Combines and Shyam Estates.         
	[PTI adds from Thiruvananthapuram: Former union minister Shashi Tharoor said that the sacrifices he made for the Kochi IPL team were worth it and added that the presence of the Kerala team in the hugely popular league would boost development and promote tourism in the state.         
	Though I had to make some sacrifices, the most important thing is Kerala got the team in the end. That is what I always wished. The recognition will boost development prospects of the state and also promote tourism in a big way, he said.         
	Meanwhile, speedster Sreesanth said that he would like to play for the Kochi IPL team. I would like to play for Kochi team. However, I cannot say if I will be part of the team or not as the process is through auction, he said.]         
	With Kochi coming on board, the number of teams in the IPL, as of now, stands at nine. The stay on the termination of the Rajasthan Royals has created a great deal of uncertainty. But the statement from the BCCI, apart from confirming the approval to Kochi, did not mention any other issues.         
	At their meeting today (Sunday), the IPL governing council confirmed that the Kochi franchisee had satisfactorily responded to the notice issued to them by the BCCI, and decided that the franchisee Kochi Cricket Pvt Ltd, would play in the IPL from 2011 onwards, BCCI secretary and president-elect N. Srinivasan said in a release.         
	The BCCI had last month announced that the 2011 season would feature eight teams playing 60 matches, with the tournament set to run from April 8 to May 22. Crucially, the fresh player auction was fixed for January 8-9.         
	One thing is sure, the IPL 4 will be held. If there are going to be nine or 10 teams, then we will play with nine or 10 teams, a source in the IPL governing council said.         
	The source however remained tight-lipped when asked whether the auction could be postponed.         
	Lets wait for the court to give a decision, the source said, referring to the BCCIs appeal against the six-week stay granted to the Royals, as well as the petition filed by the Kings XI Punjab, against their termination, in the Bombay High Court.

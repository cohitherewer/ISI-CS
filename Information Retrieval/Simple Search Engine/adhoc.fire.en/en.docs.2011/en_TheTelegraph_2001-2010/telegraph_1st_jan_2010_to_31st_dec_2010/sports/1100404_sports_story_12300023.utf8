The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon dilemma for the Knights
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brendon dilemma for the Knights
            A STAFF REPORTER              Sourav Ganguly, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain, welcomes his predecessor, Brendon McCullum, during practice at the Eden, on Saturday. McCullum joined the team on Friday after completing his engagements in the   Australia-New Zealand series. (PTI)                             
	Calcutta: Inconsistency has been Kolkata Knight Riders bane in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL). They have had some really good performances, like Sourav Gangulys blinder against the Deccan Chargers Thursday, as well as some really forgettable outings like the ones against the Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad or the Delhi DareDevils in Delhi.         
	Much of it can be attributed to indecision in selection matters. Repeated changes to the playing XI have definitely had an impact on KKRs performance in the matches they lost.         
	As KKR take on the bottom-placed Kings XI Punjab in their ninth IPL encounter at the Eden on Sunday, there is both good and bad news for the team.         
	The good news is the presence of a certain Brendon McCullum, whose unbelievable 158 not out in the inaugural match of the first edition is still fresh in every KKR fans memory. The bad news is, Knights most consistent bowler, Murali Kartik, looks to be a doubtful starter for Sundays match.         
	It was learnt that Kartik is suffering from a back injury and was rushed to a city nursing home for a precautionary MRI. The report didnt reveal much of a problem but a call on his selection will be taken on Sunday morning.         
	Coach Dav Whatmore did admit that one player is injured but did not name him. Kartik was not seen at the nets Saturday. If he fails to make it, Iqbal Abdullah is likely to replace him.         
	McCullums timing of arrival could not have been better, considering KKR are, slowly but surely, starting to look good for many more wins. They will definitely start firm favourites against a Punjab side who are out of contention for a place in the semi-finals after their seventh defeat in the tournament, on Friday, against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	It will be interesting to see how KKR captain Sourav Ganguly manages to find a slot for McCullum. Among the four foreigners who played the last match, Chris Gayle is a match-winner who hasnt fired till now, but can come up trumps any day; David Husseys presence has been reassuring in the middle-order; Angelo Mathews is the only genuine all-rounder in the side; Shane Bonds intimidating pace and subtle variations at the death is a must in this format.         
	Obviously, you wont drop Angelo who is an all-rounder. The choice would be between Chris and David if we play McCullum. He is an opener and ideally he should open the innings.         
	But then Chris is a match-winner and match-winners dont perform everyday. But the day they perform, they win you matches, Whatmore said at the press conference Saturday, indicating McCullum would be playing.         
	The New Zealander had a good hit at the nets, so did Hussey, who was hit by a stomach bug on Friday. Incidentally, Shah Rukh Khans best friend Vivek Khushalani was present at the practice session to encourage the players.         
	Sourav sustained a minor waist injury but said: I am absolutely fine. No problem.         
	Off-spinner Mohnish Parmar may also be replaced by Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, whose omission has been pretty baffling. Parmar who was drafted in as the surprise element, hasnt done anything to deserve a second chance.         
	Moreover, Kings XI batsmen like Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Ravi Bopara and Yuvraj Singh would have little difficulty in reading Parmars predictable off-breaks (he has lost his effective doosra after being reported for suspect action).         
	Shukla, on the other hand, can complement Angelo Mathews as a bowling all-rounder.         
	Talking about the Kings XI, they look exactly like the KKR squad during IPL II. Controversies regarding the change of guard (Kumar Sangakkara taking over the reins from Yuvraj Singh) and the string of losses have definitely affected the morale of the team although outwardly everything looked ok when the squad checked in at the team hotel on Saturday evening. The likes of Yuvraj, Mahela and Sangakkara all looked in high spirits. With nothing to lose Kings XI players will play with a free mind.         
	That however doesnt stop Sourav and his boys for going for the kill.         
	Sourav, who got the Man-of-the-Match award when the Kings XI played at this venue two years back, would suddenly like to repeat the act. And if Dada hits, its surely going to be a Super Sunday for KKR supporters.

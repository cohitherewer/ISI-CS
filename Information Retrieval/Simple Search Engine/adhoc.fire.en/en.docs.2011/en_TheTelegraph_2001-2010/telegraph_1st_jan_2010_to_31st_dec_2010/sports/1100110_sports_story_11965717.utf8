	New Delhi: The payments dispute between the national hockey players and Hockey India was resolved late on Saturday after a marathon meeting that paved the way for the resumption of the preparatory camp that had been hit by the row.         
	Six senior players, including captain Rajpal Singh, flew down from Pune to hold discussions with top Hockey India officials and the parleys produced an amicable solution with both parties promising to move forward.         
	Hockey India president A.K. Mattoo declined to elaborate on the financial details of the agreement but did confirm that the dispute was over.         
	The issue has been resolved. Hockey India is for the development of hockey in the country. We had a meaningful dialogue and discussion with the players in a free and fearless atmosphere, Mattoo said.         
	We have understood their issues. They have also understood our problems. Both parties have decided to move forward because, right now, the World Cup is our priority. I am confident of a podium finish in the World Cup.         
	Rajpal also addressed the media and said the players were ready to resume practice since all issues have been resolved. We are going in for practice tomorrow (Sunday). Whatever the problem, it has been solved. Our job is to play on the ground and the administrators job is to look after all other issues, Rajpal said.         
	It was good that we met face-to-face and discussed the matter in detail. The meeting turned out to be a very positive one, Rajpal added.         
	The skipper, too, refused to divulge the details of the solution, saying it was not for public consumption. It is between us and Hockey India I wont comment on it.         
	Apart from Rajpal, five other senior players  Prabhjot, Singh, Sandeep Singh, Arjun Halapaa, Tushar Khandekar and Sardara Singh  were part of the negotiations. Hockey India was represented by Mattoo, Harish Sharma, Jagbeer Singh and Rajiv Mehta.         
	Assistant coach Harendra Singh was also present in the meeting which stretched to four hours. Rajpal was confident the payments row would not affect the World Cup preparations.         
	No, it will never affect the morale of the team. The boys are training as a unit and, hopefully, we will finish on the podium in the World Cup, he said. It is learnt that the players have been promised a graded payment structure along with hefty incentives for winning titles at international meets.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid in Mohali, on Sunday                           
	Mohali: Rahul Dravid, who scored 77 on Sunday, feels the Mohali track is good. Speaking at a media conference, Dravid said India need to exploit the rough surfaces while bowling on Monday and that anything below 250 shouldnt be that difficult to chase.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If India are disappointed at the end of the day         
	A little bit We were pretty well-placed at one stage when (Suresh) Raina and Sachin (Tendulkar) were batting. We thought we would be able to take a lead and put pressure on the Australians. But they bowled very well in the last session. That has left the game on a pretty even keel.         
	Whether it was a case of nervous 90s for Sachin         
	I dont think so Somebody who has scored 48 hundreds in Tests is never nervous. He has been there and done that before.         
	His own performance         
	Im quite happy with my batting. My feet were moving well and the timing was good Also, I got dismissed by a good ball. But yes, Im a little disappointed that I couldnt convert the start to a big innings. I love scoring runs. I didnt get too many in Sri Lanka, so I was quite keen to get some runs under the belt.         
	Status of the match         
	All the three possibilities  a win, a loss and a draw  are possible now. It has been a good Test match We need to bowl well in the first session tomorrow (Monday) and take two or three quick wickets. That way we can put the pressure on them.         
	VVS Laxmans injury         
	He has a back spasm. That is the reason he came down the order. It does affect you if one of your specialist batsmen is paralysed. We cant help it. I think the other batsmen who got a start should have gone on to play a longer innings.         
	Rainas performance         
	His partnership with Sachin was crucial for us. They scored at a pretty good rate and that has opened up the game. Now, theres a chance of a result.         
	If the tailenders should have batted better         
	You cant expect the tailenders to be successful every time. They were good in Sri Lanka This time they couldnt, but you cant blame them.         
	An ideal total to chase on this pitch         
	Anything under 250 should not be difficult to chase.         
	Australias bowling         
	(Mitchell) Johnson bowled extremely well and (Nathan) Hauritz too plugged away. They bowled well collectively.         
	The wicket         
	Its pretty good and certainly not that bad as it seems. There are some rough patches which throws a surprise at times Its a little uneven. We have to try doing the damage tomorrow by the time the ball is hard.         
	The importance of the decision review system         
	If the technology is foolproof, we dont have a problem. However, different systems are used in different series. So there is some ambiguity. If they have a common system theres no reason why it cant be used.

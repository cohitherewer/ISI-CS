The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England are bad losers:   Blatter
                                                                                                                       7                                      England are bad losers:   Blatter
                            
	Zurich: Fifa is not corrupt, Sepp Blatter insisted Wednesday, though it needs a better image after the World Cup hosting contests.         
	The Fifa president fiercely defended his organisation in a Swiss magazine interview, and denounced England for reacting like an arrogant bad loser ever since Russia and Qatar were chosen to stage the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.         
	Ill say it clearly: there is no systematic corruption at Fifa. Thats nonsense, Blatter said. We are financially clean and transparent.         
	Within 24 hours of Fifa inflicting a humiliating rejection, officials from Englands 2018 bid also accused several voters of breaking promises of support they gave to a lobbying team that included Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron.         
	Blatter said he was surprised by the reaction in England, which he called the motherland of fair play.         
	Now some of them are proving to be bad losers themselves, he said. I sense in some reactions a little bit of arrogance of the western, Christian kind.         
	However, Blatter defended Fifa for choosing the riskiest, most expensive bids, which saw the World Cup hosting rights awarded to Eastern Europe and the Middle East for the first time.         
	Its my philosophy to drive forward the expansion of football. The next regions that we need to conquer would be China and India, Blatter said.           (AGENCIES)

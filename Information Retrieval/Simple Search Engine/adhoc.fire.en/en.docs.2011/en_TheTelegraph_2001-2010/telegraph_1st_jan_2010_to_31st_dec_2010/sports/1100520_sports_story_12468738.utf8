            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: West Indies captain Chris Gayle has warned his under-performing batsmen that the limited-overs series against South Africa could be their last chance. Gayle said the results during the World Twenty20  the hosts exited after the Super Eights  had been noted and the performance must improve.         
	It should be a wake-up call but from my point of view may be it is a pressure situation, Gayle said in Antigua on Tuesday. The couple of days off could have let the players look into themselves a bit more and look to step up against South Africa They are tough opponents. When you look at their bowling attack it is one of the best in the world.         
	The challenge is once a particular batter can put his hand up and be counted, then it should be good for them and the team, Gayle said highlighting that the Windies batting in the ICC World T20 was below par.         
	Our batting display wasnt up to scratch. Weve got to try and start fresh and take it from there, the Windies captain noted. The opener also said that should the batsmen continue to under-perform the selectors could look to bring in players who are currently on the West Indies A tour and singled out Trinidadian top order batsman Darren Bravo.         
	Thats (the Windies A team) a good place to start. (Darren) Bravo is doing pretty well. Hopefully, he can continue from where he started. We are looking to turn around the situation. The selectors have come up with new strategies and hopefully when we come about the situation hopefully they make the right choice, Gayle said.         
	Coming off the loss in the (World) T20s, its going to be difficult. But, it is for us to lift ourselves and rebound from where we faltered, Gayle said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Perform or pay, for   NZ players
                                                                                                                       7                                      Perform or pay, for   NZ players
                            
	Wellington: New Zealand cricketers are bearing the brunt of their disastrous tour of India as they have been issued a warning by their Players Association to either perform or get ready for a less pay package.         
	Heath Mills, general manager of the New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA), said the leading players are all on annual contracts and if they play well they will be rewarded or else they must be ready to drop down the pecking order with an associated cut in salary.         
	If they dont perform during the year they will slide down the rankings and get paid less money. Its as simple as that and its happened over the last few years under our system, Mills said in a New Zealand daily.

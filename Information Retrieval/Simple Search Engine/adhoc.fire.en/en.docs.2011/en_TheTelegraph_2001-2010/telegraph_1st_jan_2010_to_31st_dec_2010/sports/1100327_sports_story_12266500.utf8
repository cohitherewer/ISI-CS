	London: Brendon McCullum has warned one-day cricket is in danger as an international format.         
	The New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman believes Test crickets traditions can withstand the rise of Twenty20 cricket, a form of the game in which he excels.         
	But even though the International Cricket Councils premier tournament is the 50-overs-a-side World Cup, McCullum fears established one-day cricket may not survive the rise of T20.         
	Its a dangerous time for the 50-over format, McCullum said. One-day cricket is in danger.           (AFP)

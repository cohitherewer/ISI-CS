The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Darren wary of Wolves 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Darren wary of Wolves 
                      
	London: Darren Fletcher has admitted even though Manchester Uniteds players are thinking ahead to next weeks derby with Manchester City, he is wary of Wolverhampton Wanderers.         
	Alex Fergusons team entertain Wolves at Old Trafford, on Saturday, before a mouth-watering Manchester derby at the City of Manchester Stadium next Wednesday.         
	Fletcher revealed that the City match was already playing on the minds of the United players even though they have an important game with Wolves first.         
	But Uniteds Scotland international insisted that it was vital the team, who start the weekend in third spot, five points behind leaders Chelsea, go into their biggest match of the campaign with another win behind them.         
	That would ensure United face their city rivals on the back of six successive wins in all competitions.         
	Obviously we are aware the Manchester City game is next midweek and everyone will have it in the back of their minds, said Fletcher.         
	But it cannot become any more than that. Wolves is also a massive game because it is the next one. And three points then would set us up nicely for what is to follow.         
	Ferguson saw his side move to within a point of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Turkish champions Bursaspor in midweek.         
	But the victory came at a cost with both Fletcher and Nani, who has been in exceptional form this season, suffering ankle and groin injuries respectively.         
	Both players are likely to be missing against Wolves while Ferguson is also expected to make sweeping changes after fielding a young side in Turkey.         
	Mick McCarthys side gave a good account of themselves before being knocked out of the League Cup last month courtesy of Hernandezs last minute goal.         
	McCarthy has been backed by Ferguson this week, with the United boss defending Wolves manager in the wake of Danny Murphys recent rant on bad tackles.         
	But McCarthy is determined to risk his friendship by landing a major blow on Ferguson as the United manager attempts to land another title.   
	Saturday rsquo;s matches  
	 Bolton vs Spurs, Birmingham vs West Ham, Blackburn vs Wigan, Blackpool vs Everton, Fulham vs Aston Villa,   Manchester United vs Wolves, Sunderland vs Stoke   (AGENCIES)

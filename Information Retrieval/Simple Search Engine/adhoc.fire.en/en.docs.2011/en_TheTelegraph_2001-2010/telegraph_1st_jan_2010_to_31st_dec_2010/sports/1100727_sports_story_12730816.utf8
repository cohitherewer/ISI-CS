	Calcutta: Former champions Kerala put up a thoroughly professional performance as they outclassed Assam 5-2 in a Cluster VII match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday. Kerala will now meet Mizoram in a pre-quarter final match on Wednesday.         
	The Kerala duo of M.P. Sakeer and Javed .K. tormented the Assam defence time and again on a slippery artificial turf.         
	In the 19th minute, Javed overlapped from the right and kept a low cross that went in after a deflection from rival defender Naoba Singh.         
	However, their joy was short-lived as Assams prolific striker Akum Ao took advantage of a defensive lapse and volleyed home from close range, within two minutes.         
	Against the run-of play, in the 32nd minute, it was Sanjay Boro of Assam who took a crack at goal from about 30 metres but his effort was brilliantly fisted out by goalkeeper K. Sarath.         
	In the 41st minute, Kerala captain Jaseer Karanath took an inswinging corner as Justin Stephen headed home. In the 68th minute, it was another bustling sprint down the left flank by Javed, whose neat pull back for Sakeer saw the latter unleash a powerful shot to make it 3-1 for Kerala.         
	With Kerala taking complete control of the midfield, most of the Assam players were busy in their own half. In the 81st minute, it was another set-piece movement that increased the tally. Sakeers corner met Bijesh Ben, who fired a booming volley that crashed into the net.         
	After Sisuram Chutiya pulled one back for Assam in the 86th minute, former Mohammedan Sporting striker K.P. Zubair scored in the third minute of stoppage time to complete the rout. Zubair sprinted about 35 metres before unleashing a powerful right footer which beat the keeper.         
	Teams         
	Kerala: K. Sharath, Jaseer Karanath, Anus, Surjith V.V., Javed .K., Sakeer M.P. (Johnson A, 88th), Sumesh N., Martin John, Bijesh Ben, Rakesh K. (K.P. Zubair, 46th)         
	Assam: Daoga Bramha, Raghubir Singh, Naoba Singh, Sisiuram Chutiya, Ajit Singh, F. Warry (Priya Kumar Singh, 77th), Thoiba Singh, Bulu Zigdung, Sanjay Boro (Jelendra Bramha, 59th), Biplab Sonowal, Akum Ao         
	Referee: Amjad Khan         
	In the other matches of the day, Mizoram pipped Railways 1-0 in a Cluster VIII tie to make it to the pre-quarter finals by virtue of scoring more goals. In another match, of the same cluster, Orissa defeated Bihar 3-0. In a cluster VII encounter, Uttarakhand beat Himachal Pradesh 4-0.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi is more like me: Richards
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvi is more like me: Richards
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Legendary West Indian cricketer Vivian Richards feels that Yuvraj Singh, and not Virender Sehwag, plays like him.         
	Its Yuvraj who plays more like me and has got my style of approach, not Sehwag. You will notice a Caribbean flair in his batting and when he gets going         
	He is deadly and can just tear apart any attack. We still remember those six sixes he hit off as many balls, said the former West Indies captain on the sidelines of a function, here, on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | African stimulants a concern for Fifa
                                                                                                                       7                                      African stimulants a concern for Fifa
                      
	Sun City: Fifa is concerned that players at the World Cup could use undetectable stimulants derived from traditional African medicines that arent currently banned substances.         
	FIFA medical committee chairman Michel DHooghe told said on Sunday that he wants the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to analyse some African plants that could give athletes an unfair advantage. I have a big concern  and I can confess that. We were learning a lot about the traditional African medicines and we are not sure what all of these products contain, DHooghe said. I think some products are not detectable. This makes it difficult. They can deliver stimulation and diuretic activity.         
	DHooghe said he became aware of the extent of the issue at Fifas medical conference this weekend in Sun City ahead of the World Cup in South Africa, which starts June 11.         
	We received a lot of examples, going from things that we know but also going into absolutely unknown things for me. If I dont know the names, how can I know what they contain, DHooghe said of the plants. This is certainly a challenge for Wada... If we dont have control over these specific traditional medicines, then we cant say we have control over all the medication in football.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bond, Pollard hot picks
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bond, Pollard hot picks
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) bagged New Zealand speedster Shane Bond, while West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard was bought by the Mumbai Indians for a staggering sum, during the IPL III player auction here Tuesday.         
	The KKR scooped up Bond with a secret bid amount, following a tie with the Deccan Chargers, who had to be content with another upcoming player from the Caribbean islands, Kemar Roach.         
	The Mukesh Ambani-owned Mumbai Indians were believed to have shelled out nearly $1.5m (approx Rs 6 crore) over and above the spending cap of $750,000 to get Pollard, after a four-way tie with the Royal Challengers Bangalore, KKR,and the Chennai Super Kings.         
	The KKR, too, seemed to have splashed no less than Rs 2 crore in excess of the budget cap on Bond, according to a source in the Indian Premier League (IPL). However, it may be noted that the secret bid goes to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and not the player.         
	Pollard, 22, is yet to play Tests, but made a deep impact in the inaugural Champions League T20 in October, in which he played for Trinidad and Tobago.         
	For the KKR, getting Bond was a huge relief after missing out on Pollard. Co-owner Jai Mehta refused to buy the argument that the management had gambled by putting their money on the injury-prone New Zealander.         
	He is not going to play Tests, but only ODIs and T20s. And the coach said that he is in pretty good shape, Mehta said.         
	He did not wish to speculate on whether Bond would meet the same fate as Bangladeshs Mashrafe Mortaza, who was clinched after a fierce bidding for $650,000 but ended up playing only one match in IPL II. That depends on the captain and coach, he said.         
	The Delhi DareDevils pulled off a silent coup by bagging South African left-arm pacer Wayne Parnell for $610,000.         
	Having failed to get the top three, and their strike bowler Fidel Edwards doubtful with an injury, the Chargers ended up paying $720,000 for Roach. The base price for the 21-year-old right-arm fast bowler from Barbados, who has played just five Tests and seven one-dayers, was $100,000.         
	Much of the excitement was restricted to the bidding for Bond, Pollard, Roach and Parnell. Thereafter, 23 players went under the hammer and only two of them were sold. Thisara Perera was sold to the Chennai Super Kings and Damien Martyn to the Rajasthan Royals.         
	After that, IPL chairman Lalit Modi intervened and announced a change in the process. With five slots remaining  one each for the Super Kings, the Deccan Chargers and the Kings XI Punjab, and two for the Royals  Modi asked the franchises to name their desired player in a closed bid.         
	Accordingly, the Super Kings, the Royals and the Kings XI won Justin Kemp, Adam Voges and Yusuf Abdullah respectively at their respective base price. As expected, there were no takers for Pakistani players, including star performers like Shahid Afridi and Sohail Tanvir.         
	Mohammed Kaif was bought by the Kings XI in a second round of bidding for $250,000.         
	At the end of the day, two slots, one each of the Rajasthan Royals and the Deccan Chargers, were left unfilled. All franchises have the option of seeking a replacement for which the budget cap of $750,000 would not apply.

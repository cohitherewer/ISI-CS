The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Franklin to replace Bennett
                                                                                                                       7                                      Franklin to replace Bennett
                      
	Ahmedabad: All-rounder James Franklin will replace injured paceman Hamish Bennett in the New Zealand squad for the remaining two Tests against India, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said in a statement, on Tuesday.         
	Bennett, who made his debut against India in the first Test, injured his groin while bowling on the first day.         
	Its an unfortunate injury for Hamish, which will see him miss the remainder of the Test series against India, said New Zealand coach Mark Greatbatch, in a statement.         
	In view of the injury to Hamish and some concerns about Jesses (Ryder) ability to bowl in the next match, the selectors made the decision to go with an all-rounder.         
	Franklin showed good form with the bat and ball in Zimbabwe where he successfully led New Zealand A to a series win.         
	Franklin, who has played 26 Tests, will arrive in Hyderabad on Wednesday with the second Test starting on Friday.         
	The third and final Test will be played in Nagpur from November 20-24.                 (REUTERS)

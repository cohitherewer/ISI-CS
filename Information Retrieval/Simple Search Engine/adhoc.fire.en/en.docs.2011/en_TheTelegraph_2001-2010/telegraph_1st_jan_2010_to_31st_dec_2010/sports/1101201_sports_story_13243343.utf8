            JAYDEEP BASU            Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli during a practice session, in Jaipur, on Tuesday. (PTI)                            
	Jaipur: After a perfect start in Guwahati, India are determined not to let the momentum slip when they take on New Zealand in the second one-day International at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The Airtel Cup may have lost much of its sheen with the hosts deciding to rest their top players, but it also provides the youngsters with an opportunity to make some impression ahead of next years World Cup.         
	Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin have already grabbed the opportunity with both hands, delivering the goods in Guwahati. No wonder there were loud cheers reserved for Kohli here when he came to bat at the nets.         
	Having scored two back-to-back centuries in Ranji Trophy, the Delhi batsmans fine hundred in the first one-dayer steered India to victory. Gautam Gambhir, the stand-in skipper, said on Monday that his team was looking to continue their winning streak. We would like to carry on from where we left off in the first match, said the stand-in captain after a practice session.         
	There is no place for complacency, he warned.         
	We are missing the seniors but it is also a huge chance for the youngsters to make their presence felt. I believe they are doing a great job and would continue to do so for the rest of the series, he said.         
	Like Kohli, equally impressive was off-spinner Ashwin, who along with Yuvraj Singh combined to expose New Zealands frailties against spin bowling in Guwahati. Ashwin bowled beautifully and picked up three important wickets, including that of Ross Taylor who top-scored for the visitors with a well-compiled 66.         
	Spinners, both Gambhir and New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori observed, would play a crucial role in shaping the fortunes of the second match. The dew factor would also prove decisive. The team winning the toss would, in the circumstances, opt to bowl first as gripping the ball becomes difficult when the dew factor comes into play in the second session.         
	The dew is a big factor here. I think chemicals will be used. But then, it is something that is not in your hands and cannot be controlled. We have experienced bowlers who have handled such things earlier. Bowlers know what to bowl and how to bowl Toss is going to be an important factor here, said Gambhir.         
	The Indians had a long practice session in the morning. Even Ashish Nehra and Sreesanth were made to spend considerable time with the bat by coach Gary Kirsten. Bengal wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha spent around 20 minutes with the bat though he was mainly pitted against local bowlers.         
	There was some good news for the visitors. Vettori is fit and would be available for the match, though doubts still persist over the availability of Brendon McCullum. To add to their woes, New Zealand will also miss pacer Daryl Tuffey for the rest of the series.         
	Daryl developed discomfort in his right bicep while he was playing but was able to manage it during the match. It appeared to be fine when he was bowling, but now hes unable to throw without pain so he will return home for further assessment and treatment, Mark Greatbatch, New Zealands coach and selector, said in a statement. Tuffeys replacement has not been announced.         
	New Zealand captain Vettori said: We did create some chances to win the first game but didnt take them. I am sure things are going to change on this ground, he added.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans Edeh Chidi tries to make his way through the Kalighat MS defence, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: One Jose Ramirez Barreto can singlehandedly change the complexion of a game. At the Mohun Bagan ground on Wednesday, the home side was locked 1-1 with Kalighat MS, after trailing in the first half.         
	The situation changed, once the Brazilian entered the fold in the 64th minute. No great moves, no individual brilliance, no tactical manoeuvrings, it was Barretos leadership that saw Bagan overcome the crisis.         
	A 4-1 scoreline in their favour was not something the most diehard of supporters had thought possible after an insipid display in the first half. Manish Mathani restored parity, and then Edeh Chidi struck twice while Subair Murithala Ali scored the other goal.         
	Kalighat MS had banked on zonal marking to keep a tab on the Brazilian, but their attempts werent too successful as Bagan made good use of the open spaces that followed.         
	Manish led the midfield, creating openings in the rival penalty area and Chidi proved dangerous in the circumstances. The result came as a relief for Stanley Rozario after the shock defeat against Aryan in their earlier match.         
	The first half dished out soccer as drab as ditch water with Bagan struggling to make forays.         
	Kalighat scored completely against the run of play in the 43rd minute when Christophers cross from the right as Biswajit Saha fumbled.         
	Sangram Mukherjee parried the ball away, but it fell in front of Bapi Das, who netted it gleefully. The Bagan defence was caught napping with three defenders standing in a straight line.         
	Bagan showed some urgency in the second session and got the result almost immediately. Snehasish Chakrabortys corner ran lose to Manish who scored from almost 25 yards.         
	That was the adrenaline Bagan needed and Chidi made it 2-1 after another 14 minutes. Barreto put it on to Manish who in turn headed it down for Chidi. Chidi had to move a few yards before placing it to the left of the goalie.         
	By now Bagan were calling the shots and Kalighat MS resistance was all but broken. Murithala missed the target from sniffing distance but made amends in the 80th minute. Surabuddin Mallicks cross from the right was well targeted and Murithalas volley gave the rival goalie no chance.         
	Chidi wasnt done yet. Getting a ball from the middle, he dodged his way in, got past a couple of defenders and the advancing goalkeeper, before slotting home.         
	Im happy with the way the team played today We got some work to do in the defence, Bagan coach Rozario summed it up well.

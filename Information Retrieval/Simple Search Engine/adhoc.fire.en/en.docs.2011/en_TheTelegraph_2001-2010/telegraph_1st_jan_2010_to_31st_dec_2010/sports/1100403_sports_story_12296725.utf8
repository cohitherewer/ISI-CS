The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI denial on Yuvraj 
                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI denial on Yuvraj 
                      
	New Delhi: An agitated Yuvraj Singh Friday hit back at speculation that he was deliberately under-performing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) after being stripped of the Kings XI Punjabs captaincy, saying he was disgusted and horrified by the reports.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has stood behind Yuvraj as Board spokesman Rajiv Shukla said on Friday that the BCCI has not received any complaint on Yuvrajs desire to leave the Kings XI and too much should not be read into the players bad patch.         
	I am disgusted and horrified that a news reporter can stoop down to such a level. I, in all my career, havent seen such a disgusting piece of news, the flamboyant batsman said on his Twitter account, reacting to reports that his poor run in the IPL was deliberate as he was upset at being replaced as captain of the side by Kumar Sangakkara.         
	Reports suggested that he wanted to shift to another team  speculated to be the Mumbai Indians.         
	The explosive all-rounder said he was being targeted because of his lean patch and blamed the recent injury breakdowns for the current lack of form.         
	To come out of injury is not easy and Ive had three in a row I hope to bounce back soon. I always try to give my best no matter what the circumstances are and right now, I am struggling with my form. It happens to every player, he said.         
	There is no truth in such claims that a complaint was made to BCCI regarding Yuvraj. Yuvraj is a great player but is currently out of form, which can happen to any cricketer. People should not read too much into the issue, Shukla said.         
	There is no truth in such claims that a complaint was made to the BCCI regarding Yuvraj. I think Yuvraj is just out of form and to say that he has intentionally under-performed is extremely unfair and wrong. People should not read too much into the issue, Shukla added.         
	Yuvraj also found support from Kings XI Punjab co-owner Preity Zinta. There is no truth to speculative reports that are being carried in various segments of the media and these get accentuated when the tide is not in our favour, Zinta said.

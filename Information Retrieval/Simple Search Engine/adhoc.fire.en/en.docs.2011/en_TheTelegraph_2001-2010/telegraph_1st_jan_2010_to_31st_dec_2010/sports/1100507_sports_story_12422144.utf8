They (the BCCI umpires) will officiate as we dont want any clubs to raise questions about neutrality which has been a case for local umpires, a CAB official said. The nine umpires are Ravi Shankar, Sanjib Rao, Nitin Menon, Somenath Jha, Monish Jain, Subrata Das, Nilkhil Patwardhan, Subhash Thadkar and Nitin Pandit. They are likely to be paid Rs 7,500 each per match.

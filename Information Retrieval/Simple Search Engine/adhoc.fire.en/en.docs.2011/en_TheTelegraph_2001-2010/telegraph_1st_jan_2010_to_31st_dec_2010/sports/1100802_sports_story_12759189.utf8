	Colombo: Sachin Tendulkar is available for the third and final Test, against Sri Lanka, from Tuesday.         
	Sachins been rested for the tri-series, because of soreness in his left groin, but hes going to play in the Test, a member of the team management told The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon.         
	Comforting news, not just for the squad here, but an entire nation.         
	The soreness kept Sachin off the field on the last day of the second Test, at the SSC. He did, however, work out at the P. Sara Oval.         
	Opener Gautam Gambhir, though, is still not fully fit. My right knee is better, lets see how I feel tomorrow (Monday), Gambhir said, speaking exclusively, at the Taj Samudra.         
	He missed the action at the SSC, where the Test ended in a draw.         
	Harbhajan Singh, too, has a problem  his left side is strained, but he wont be missing the crucial Test. Like Sachin (and Gambhir), hes been rested for the tri-series.         
	The hosts, Sri Lanka, are ahead 1-0.

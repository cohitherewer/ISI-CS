                                                                                                                       7                                      Pietersen gets the axe
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/London: England batsman Kevin Pietersen has been omitted from the squads for the two Twenty20 Internationals and the five-match one-day International series, against Pakistan, according to a media release by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), on Tuesday.         
	Pietersen will play the remainder of the county season with Surrey following a loan agreement between Hampshire and Surrey at the request of the England team management and the ECB.         
	Pietersen, however, had revealed on his Twitter account that he had been omitted from the England squad to play Pakistan in the Twenty20 series starting this Sunday.         
	The revelation appears to have been made in error by Pietersen, who Tweeted the news before hastily deleting the post.         
	Pietersen, who was named Player of the Tournament at this years World Twenty20 in the Caribbean, wrote on the site: Yep... Done for rest of summer!! Man of the World Cup T20 and dropped from the T20 side too... Its a f--- up!! Surrey have signed me for ..., at which point the Tweet cuts off.         
	It is the first time Pietersen has been dropped since his England career began in 2004.         
	Pietersen is also likely to face some kind of sanction for revealing selection details before an official team announcement, just days after the ECB issued a warning to players Tweeting sensitive or offensive information.         
	Australia batsman Phillip Hughes was reprimanded for revealing that he had been left out of the side for the third Ashes Test, at Edgbaston, last summer, while Yorkshire players Tim Bresnan and Azeem Rafiq have both landed themselves in hot water after expletive-laden Tweets.         
	Pietersen will play his first match for Surrey, on Wednesday, a Clydesdale Bank 40 fixture, against Worcestershire, at The Brit Oval.         
	The Twenty20 squad of 12 players, captained by Paul Collingwood, sees both Steven Davies and Craig Kieswetter selected, the former assigned the role of wicketkeeper.         
	Davies has also been included in the 14-member ODI squad, with Kieswetters omission the only change from the T20 squad along with the addition of captain Andrew Strauss, Jonathan Trott and Ajmal Shahzad.         
	Speaking on Pietersens omission, England selector Geoff Miller, said: Kevin Pietersen has been omitted from both squads as we feel that his game would be best served by getting as much cricket under his belt as possible before a long and challenging winter.         
	Pietersen said: While Im naturally disappointed to have been omitted from the England squad. I fully understand the reasons why and will be doing everything I can to get back into the England team. I have no issues with the selectors omitting me from the limited-overs squads and my sole focus now is working on my game ahead of an exciting winter.

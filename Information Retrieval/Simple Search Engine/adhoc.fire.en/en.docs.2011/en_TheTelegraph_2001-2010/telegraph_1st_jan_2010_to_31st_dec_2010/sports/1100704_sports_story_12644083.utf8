                                                                                                                       7                                      Manohar downplays legal threat
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday downplayed the threat of legal action from World Sports Group (WSG) whose contract for the Indian Premier Leagues global media rights was scrapped earlier this week.         
	That issue will be decided in the courts if they (WSG) want to take it to court, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said after a Special General Meeting of the BCCI here.         
	The BCCI terminated the contract with WSG on Monday, alleging that the latter had committed fraud in receiving Rs. 425 crore as facilitation money from Multi Screen Media who have the India rights.         
	The WSG then hit back at the BCCI, saying it would take whatever steps are necessary to keep the contract alive, and that the facilitation money it received from MSM was legitimate.         
	Manohar refused to respond to Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadis letter to sports minister MS Gill, asking him to convince the BCCI to reschedule its series against Australia that coincided with the Delhi Common Wealth Games in October this year.         
	We have not been asked to respond. Its between Kalmadi and the sports minister, Manohar said.         
	Meanwhile, the BCCI marketing committee, which met prior to the SGM, would be floating tenders for the ground and production rights.

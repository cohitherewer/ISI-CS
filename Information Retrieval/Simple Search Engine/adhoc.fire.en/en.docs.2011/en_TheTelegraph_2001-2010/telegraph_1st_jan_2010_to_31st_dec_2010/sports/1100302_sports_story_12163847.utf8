The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal hope to be third time lucky
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal hope to be third time lucky
            A STAFF REPORTER                      Laxmi Ratan Shukla,Dinesh Karthik                            
	Calcutta: Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla firmly believes that Bengal will be third time lucky when they take on defending champions Tamil Nadu in the final of the national one-day championship for the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.         
	Bengal had gone down to Tamil Nadu by 66 runs in last years final in Agartala.         
	Bengal, who have lost the last two editions of the championship to Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu respectively, will like to shed off their chokers tag against a formidable Tamil Nadu squad that includes the likes of Dinesh Karthik, S. Badrinath, Murali Vijay and Ravichandran Ashwin among others.         
	It will be a very tough match for us. Obviously we want to be third time lucky, but you must also remember that to have luck going your way, you need to play well. I have told the boys to think that they are just playing another match and not too much about the final.         
	Once it works on the back of your mind, you invite a lot of unnecessary pressure on yourself. For us, it will be another 100 over affair where we need to give our best, Shukla told The Telegraph from Ahmedabad.         
	The Motera pitch proved to be a belter on Saturday during the India versus South Africa ODI where the Proteas scored 365 for two in 50 overs. Shukla said the final would be held on an adjacent pitch which has a bit of grass on it.         
	There is a bit of grass on the surface. Also, our match will be a day affair. So one can expect a fair bit of movement with the white kookaburra ball early in the morning, the Bengal captain said.         
	The Bengal team may see one change with Anustup Mazumdar replacing an off-colour Avishek Jhunjhunwala, who has scored only one half century (versus Assam) in the entire tournament. However, Avishek may just be preferred because of his experience.         
	Much will depend on how Bengals top four, Sreevats Goswami, Arindam Das Sourav Ganguly and Manoj Tiwary perform on the day. Goswami, who has scored 487 runs in the tournament with three centuries, would like to add one more to his kitty. During last years final, Manoj scored a fighting 76 in a losing cause.         
	On a personal front, Shukla, who is still livid with his exclusion from the East Zone squad for the Deodhar Trophy, will like to prove a point to the zonal selectors. I have a lot to say but I will once I am through with the final, the skipper said.         
	Bengal (likely): Arindam Das, Sreevats Goswami, Sourav Ganguly, Manoj Tiwary, Anustup Mazumdar/Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Sourasish Lahiri, Saumya Pakre, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose.

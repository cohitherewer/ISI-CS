The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Openers let us down: Raina
                                                                                                                       7                                      Openers let us down: Raina
                      
	Harare: Stand-in captain Suresh Raina expressed concern over the poor form of openers Murali Vijay and Dinesh Karthik who have failed to fire in the three matches they have played so far in the tri-nation tournament.         
	The Zimbabwean team are turning out to be formidable opposition for the second-string Indian side who have now lost back-to-back matches against them. The most striking factor was the confident performances by their top-order batsmen, especially Brendan Taylor who has developed a liking for Indian bowlers and won his second Man of the Match award.         
	In order to reach the final, the Indians will now have to defeat Sri Lanka handsomely and then pray for a favourable result when the islanders play the hosts. The bonus point earned by Zimbabwe on Thursday could prove to be a decisive factor in the end.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Elton Chigumbura: We had a disappointing match against the Sri Lankans. I would say its a good comeback for us after our performance in the last game. Our bowlers bowled well. Andy Blignaut, especially, was outstanding. Its always a special performance if someone gives away only 22 runs in his 10 overs. Their openers started cautiously but we knew we were in control. We needed one breakthrough and that was it. When we were batting, we needed a good start. Our openers gave us a very good start . All the rest of the bowlers bowled well. We had the bonus point in mind and the boys played positively.         
	Raina: We didnt bat well. We should probably have scored in the range of 260-270. Credit to the bowlers as they bowled very well. We are not getting good partnerships from the openers. We have to learn from the mistakes that we have made in the tournament. It affected our performance as the openers didnt get runs in the last two games. Partnerships are the key to success. I must admit we havent collectively batted well so far in the tournament. Now the only way to go forward is to play well. Sri Lanka are a good side, lets hope we do well against them.         
	MoM Brendan Taylor: I am very happy with this performance after our dismal effort against Sri Lanka. The best part is opening the batting with Hamilton (Masakadza). Whenever Hamilton is around, I feel very relaxed as he does the bulk of the scoring. He is a powerful hitter. For some reason, I was ahead of him today. I am feeling happy that I have now got two Man of the Match awards in this tournament. My biggest problem, over the years, has been a lack of consistency. These two innings have given me the required confidence. I would be happy to get another good knock.

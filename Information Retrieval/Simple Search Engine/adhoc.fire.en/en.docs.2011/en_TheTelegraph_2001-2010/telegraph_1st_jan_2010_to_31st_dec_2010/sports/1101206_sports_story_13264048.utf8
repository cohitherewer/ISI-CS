	Thousand Oaks: Tiger Woods capped a third-round 68 with a birdie as he homed in on his first victory in more than a year at the World Challenge golf tournament. Woods four-under effort gave him a 17-under total of 199 and maintained his four-shot lead over US Open champion Graeme McDowell.         
	After a bogey at the par-five second, Woods rebounded with three birdies in a row from the par-five fifth.         
	He put an exclamation mark on his round with an approach that left him a tap-in for his sixth birdie of the day at 18. Northern Irelands McDowell also carded a 68 for 203.         
	The next closest rival in the 18-man field was Englands Paul Casey, who carded a 69 for 207.         
	Im excited about tomorrow because of the way Im playing, said Woods, whose last victory was at the 2009 Australian Masters.         
	In 2010, his struggles on the course have mirrored the personal travails that saw his marriage end.         
	Although this unofficial event that Woods hosts for the benefit of his charitable foundation wouldnt give him a PGA Tour title, it is worth world rankings points and could provide a valuable boost as he heads into 2011.         
	Certainly over three days of play in rolling country west of Los Angeles, Woods has looked more like a 14-time major champion than he has all season.         
	To be honest with you, I dont look at it that way when Im out there playing, Woods said of the chance to end his drought with a wire-to-wire victory. Its just that Im in the moment, trying to put the golf ball on the different sides of the fairway, where I need to put it on the green. I just play.         
	Woods has won the title here four times, but missed last year as a sex scandal exploded around him and missed the year before as he recovered from knee surgery.         
	As Woods bogeyed the second, where his approach found the creek left of the green, McDowell notched a birdie, then picked up another shot at the par-three third to narrow the deficit to one stroke.         
	But Woods got things going with a birdie from a bunker at the par-five fifth, drained a 20-footer for birdie at six and made a short birdie putt at the seventh. Woods led by five at the turn, but found it far from smooth sailing coming in.

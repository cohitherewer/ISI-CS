	Calcutta: A registration faux pas on part of Kalighat and Mohun Bagan will rob the fans of a chance to watch Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya in action for the CAB club matches.     
	Friday was the last day for registration of players for the CAB league, the knock-out and the AN Ghosh Trophy matches.    
	Both Bagan and Kalighat submitted separate registration cards, each with Jayasuriyas photograph and signature on it. When the CAB assistant secretary spotted it the matter was brought to president Jagmohan Dalmiyas notice.    
	After a round of heated exchanges between the representatives of both the clubs in front of Dalmiya, both agreed to withdraw their cards which means that Jayasuriyas name cant be registered.

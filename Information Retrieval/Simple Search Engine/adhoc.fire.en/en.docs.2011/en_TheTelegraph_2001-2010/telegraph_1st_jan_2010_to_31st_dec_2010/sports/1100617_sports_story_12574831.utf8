The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Priority is to know each other
                                                                                                                       7                                        Priority is to know each other
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Manohar                           
	Calcutta:The June 24 meeting between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchisees is unlikely to have a fixed agenda.         
	Called in Mumbai, the meeting will be the first between the two sides in the post-Lalit Modi era. Indeed, possibly the first-ever featuring only the owners and the top officials of the BCCI and not the entire governing council of the IPL.         
	President Shashank Manohar, secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan (who wears two hats), treasurer Mohinder Pandove and joint-secretary Sanjay Jagdale are all on the governing council, but that body has nine other members as well.         
	Modi, who ran the show unchecked in the first three editions, has been suspended from all posts in the BCCI, including those of the chairman and commissioner of the IPL.         
	Strictly technically, the IPL is a sub committee of the BCCI.         
	We dont really know the owners All along, Modi had projected himself as the face of the IPL and dealt with the franchisees almost on an exclusive basis. So, next Thursday, well actually be getting to know the owners for the first time, one of the officials told The Telegraph.         
	He added: Thats why a fixed agenda is unlikely At this stage, nothing has been circulated and there can always be another meeting should there be major issues to address         
	One understands that the IPLs interim chairman, Chirayu Amin, BCCIs chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty and the IPLs chief executive officer, Sundar Raman (yes, hes still around), will also be present during the meeting at Cricket Centre, the BCCIs HQ.         
	Apparently, each franchisee has been asked to nominate two representatives. Its assumed that the owners would themselves make it a point to attend.         
	Significantly, some of the franchisees were pretty vocal in their support of Modi, in the days immediately after his suspension, but its to be seen what is said behind closed doors.         
	Today, they have to do business with Manohar and Amin, not Modi. Thats the reality.         
	While eight franchises have been around from the beginning, Pune and Kochi are the rookies and their teams will be seen in action from the 2011 IPL.         
	In a sensible move, the IPLs governing council is going to meet the very next day and, so, suggestions/reservations which require immediate attention may straightaway be discussed by the body.         
	Manohar, one learns, has taken the initiative to call both meetings.

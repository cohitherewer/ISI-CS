The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robben will miss opener vs Danes 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Robben will miss opener vs Danes 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Johannesburg: Arjen Robben has been ruled out of the Netherlands opening World Cup game against Denmark, after flying in to join his teammates six days late because of a hamstring injury. Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk said Saturday it was too risky for the Bayern Munich winger to play at Soccer City on Monday.         
	But he hopes Robben will be fit in time to face Japan in Durban on June 19 and and Cameroon in Cape Town five days later. Van Marwijk said Robben virtually had only one full training and he was going to quot;take it easy quot; with him.         
	Robben picked up the injury in a warmup game against Hungary in Amsterdam on June 5.         
	Meanwhile, Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba skipped training as a precaution to rest his broken arm ahead of the Elephants opening game against Portugal. The Ivory Coast face the Portuguese in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday and the Chelsea star faces a race to be fit for the match after breaking his arm in a World Cup warm-up game against Japan in Switzerland.         
	The Ivory Coast team trained at the George Thabe Stadium here in Sharpeville, south of Johannesburg, under coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, while Drogba stayed back at the hotel to receive treatment.         
	Didier is back in the hands of the doctors, but that doesnt mean anything for the game against Portugal, a member of the Ivory Coast staff.         
	The same source said Eriksson will decide at the last possible moment whether to play the Chelsea striker against Portugal.         
	Italy also have another key injury concern just three days before their opener. Daniele de Rossi sat out a training match against the Gauteng All Stars on Friday with a right calf problem, although team physician Enrico Castellacci said the midfielder has a chance of recuperating in time for Mondays game against Paraguay.         
	Another midfielder, Andrea Pirlo, could miss the entire group phase with a left calf injury.

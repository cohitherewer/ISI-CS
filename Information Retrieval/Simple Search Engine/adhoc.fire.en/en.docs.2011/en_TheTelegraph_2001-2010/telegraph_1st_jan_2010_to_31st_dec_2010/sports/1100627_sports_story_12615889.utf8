The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj back, Saha in
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvraj back, Saha in
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Strong support from Narendra Hirwani and Surendra Bhave, who landed in Chennai just hours before the selection committee meeting, on Saturday, helped Wriddhiman Saha make the India squad for the three-Test series in Sri Lanka.         
	Both had been on duty in England, travelling with India A, and spoke highly of Sahas batting there. The 25-year-old, in any case, is seen as an accomplished keeper.         
	While Hirwani and Bhaves recommendation made a big difference, what also helped is that Easts Raja Venkat is on good terms with his colleagues and was able to convince chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth that Saha deserved to make the cut.         
	Yashpal Sharma wasnt around, as hes reached England, as one of the replacements for the duo. Venkat, by the way, left on Saturday night.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was present, but not coach Gary Kirsten, the other co-opted member of the committee.         
	Once Murali Vijay got picked and not Dinesh Karthik, who could have been the second keeper, too, the road became pretty clear for Saha... The one other contender was Parthiv Patel, but he lost out, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Bengals Saha, it may be recalled, made his Test debut earlier this year  against South Africa, in Nagpur  in rather bizarre circumstances. He played not as a keeper, but as Rohit Sharmas last-minute replacement in the middle-order!         
	Rohit had himself been added to the squad, as a cover for V.V.S. Laxman.         
	Speaking exclusively while making the seven-hour trip by coach from Glasgow to Northampton, Saha said: Its nice to be chosen, but Im not the type to get carried away... Im feeling normal.         
	Asked whether hed been expecting to get selected, Saha replied: I dont carry expectations, either my own or of others... Dont think about what could happen... If I perform, Ill be there... Thats my attitude... Aami beshi bhabhi naa.         
	Incidentally, Sahas father Prasanta called and informed him of his being in the 16.         
	Reflecting on the India A experience in England, Saha was honest in saying that while hed made some good contributions with the bat, he wasnt very happy with his keeping.         
	Few are that candid, but it appears Saha is his own fiercest critic.         
	A few weeks ago, Saurabh Tiwary had been pulled out of the India A squad and sent to Sri Lanka, for the Asia Cup.         
	As tipped in these columns, Yuvraj Singh, Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma are back in the Team India fold.         
	The squad has only three new-ball bowlers, though. Thats largely because no more than two will ever feature in an XI there. Yet, all three (Zaheer Khan being the third) are prone to getting injured...         
	Meanwhile, Board president Shashank Manohar met the selectors for a few minutes before they began their deliberations. Nothing specific was discussed, someone who was present, pointed out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea up 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chelsea up 
                      
	London: Holders Chelsea advanced to the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a 2-0 home win over Stoke City while Aston Villa joined them after coming from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Reading with a John Carew hat-trick on Sunday.         
	Stoke, seeking their first semi-final since 1972, went close after 15 minutes when Hilario punched a Rory Delap long throw straight to Dean Whitehead, whose shot was cleared off the line by Jon Obi Mikel.         
	However, Chelsea, beaten in their last two games, soon took control and went ahead after 35 minutes with a trademark Frank Lampard shot from the edge of the box.         
	Defender Andy Wilkinson cleared two goal-bound efforts as Chelsea cranked up the pressure in the second half.           (REUTERS)

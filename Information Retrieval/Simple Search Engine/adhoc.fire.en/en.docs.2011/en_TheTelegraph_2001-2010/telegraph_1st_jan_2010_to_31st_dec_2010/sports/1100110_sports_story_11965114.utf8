                                                                                                                       7                                      Arindam to be showcaused
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: The I-League committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to show cause Churchill Brothers goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya for getting into a brawl with the spectators in the match against Mohun Bagan in Barasat on Friday.         
	Arindam went up to the stands after the match and roughed up a spectator for allegedly throwing a missile at Churchill midfielder Ogba Kalu.         
	Last month, the lanky goalkeeper saved two spot kicks in the tie-breaker to guide India to a fine triumph in the final of the SAFF Cup against the Maldives in Dhaka. He was also adjudged the best goalkeeper of the tournament.         
	According to AIFF sources, the committee also decided that no more I-League matches will be held at the Barasat Stadium this season. The committee, which met in the capital on Saturday, was also unhappy with the match commissioners report on the entire episode. JP Singh, the commissioner, would therefore not be given any further posting in the I-League.         
	However, the committee did not recommend any action against Churchill supremo Churchill Alemao, who recently accused Mohun Bagan of hatching a conspiracy against his club.         
	The AIFF is planning to recruit referees from South Asian countries  as part of an exchange programme  for crucial matches in the I-League.

	New Delhi: The North Korean national team, currently in the news for being allegedly mistreated by their government for the World Cup defeat, are likely to play a friendly match against India in the second week of September.         
	According to sources, the DPR Korea Football Association (DPRKFA) has accepted an invitation from the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to play against Bob Houghtons side in the Capital. This would the North Koreas first international encounter after their disastrous World Cup showings.         
	A top official of the DPRKFA has verbally confirmed to play in India, sources said. A written confirmation is expected in the next few days. The Korean federation has also agreed to send their full national team for the match.         
	Reports coming out of North Korea have suggested that the national side, which lost all their three World Cup matches in South Africa, allegedly faced punishment by government officials when they returned home.         
	The Indian team, currently camping in Portugal to prepare for the Asia Cup campaign in January in Doha, are expected to play a series of friendly matches starting September.         
	Indias first match is scheduled on September 4 against Thailand in Bangkok followed by the return match against the same team at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium on September 8.         
	Apart from the matches against Thailand and North Korea, India may also play against Jordan and a couple of other top teams in Asia. The final picture should emerge by the end of this month, sources said.         
	The India under-23 side, which will take part in the Asian Games in November, will also play four friendly matches before travelling to China.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadia overpowers Venus

    - Federer wallops friend Wawrinka; Henin edges past Sharapova           [+uc('John Branch   NYT News Service')+]            Nadia Petrova after defeating Venus Williams, in Paris, on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	Paris: There was a sense that this might be Venus Williamss time, finally, at Roland Garros. Her see-through lace dress became the sartorial sensation of the French Open. Her rise back to No. 2 in the world this spring, and her strong play in the opening rounds, turned Williams into an emerging tournament favourite. She had buzz.         
	But all that build-up came tumbling down in two sets. In a bit of a role reversal, Venus was overpowered in the fourth round Sunday by Nadia Petrova, the 19th seed.         
	The veteran Russian has a heavy-handed game and a thundering serve not that different from Venuss. She used it with great aplomb in battering Venus, 6-4, 6-3, to move to the quarter finals.         
	Defending champion Roger Federer is into the French Open last-eight after securing his fourth consecutive straight-set victory.         
	The top-ranked Federer beat his friend, protege and 2008 Olympic gold medallist doubles partner Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-2 Sunday.         
	With one more victory, Federer will reach the semi-finals at a 24th straight Grand Slam tournament.         
	Petrova, a top-10 mainstay through much of the past decade, had not beaten Venus in four previous attempts. But with Venus wearing a sweatshirt over her much-discussed dress because of the cool conditions, Petrova seemed as loose as ever. She had full control of her serve, and broke Venus early in both sets to cruise to victory.         
	It was part of a day that felt like a bit of dj vu in womens tennis. The game is in a bit of a static funk, the list of its best players barely different from what it was for much of the previous decade.         
	That was apparent at Court Philippe Chatrier, even before the match involving Venus and Petrova, who first met at Wimbledon in the fourth round nine years ago.         
	It began with Elena Dementieva, the fifth-seeded Russian, a top-20 fixture since 2003 and a runner-up at Roland Garros six years ago, beating the unseeded Chanelle Scheepers.         
	Petrova will play Dementieva in one of the quarter finals.         
	Then Justine Henin and Maria Sharapova, their fruitful careers no longer interrupted, added to the time-warp feeling. They are former No. 1s, winners of a combined 10 Grand Slam tournaments, escalating toward the elite again.         
	A grand litmus test unfolded over two days of a third-round match on the clay of the main show court. After splitting the first two sets and taking a break for darkness, Henin and Sharapova returned to finish what they started on Sunday.         
	Momentum swings came as hard as their forehands, and serving seemed a losing proposition. But when the red dust settled on another blustery day, it was Henin, the four-time champion, skipping away with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory.         
	For Henin, it was her 24th consecutive victory at the French Open, a streak dating to the first of three-consecutive championships in 2005 and interrupted by a two-year absence in 2008 and 2009.         
	You always need to test yourself and go through tough moments, Henin said. Its true that this was a match that I feared a bit, because I have great admiration for this girl. She proves it all the time.         
	Henin will face No. 7 Samantha Stosur in the fourth round.         
	In other early results on Sunday, Italys Francesca Schiavone, seeded 17th, beat No. 30 Maria Kirilenko in two sets. Schiavone reached the quarter finals nine years after her previous quarters appearance here, keeping the back-to-the-future theme mostly intact.         
	Breaking the trend was 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki. The third seed slid past No. 14 Flavia Pennetta, 7-6(5), 6-7(4), 6-2.         
	Venuss loss was not inexplicable, even as she rose to No. 2 this month for the first time since 2003. Petrova leads the tour in aces and is a two-time semi-finalist (2003, 2005) at the French Open. She recently beat No. 1 Serena Williams, Venuss sister, on the clay at Madrid.         
	Venus has struggled at the French Open more than at any other Grand Slam event. She made the final in 2002, losing to Serena, but has otherwise never advanced past the quarter finals.         
	She lost in the third round the past three years. This year seemed like it might be the one. But it was a lot like all the others.         
	Likewise, Henin and Sharapova were familiar foes. They had met four previous times in Grand Slam tournaments, but never before the quarter finals. Sharapova earned one of her three Grand Slam titles by beating Henin in the 2006 United States Open final.         
	But they had not met since the 2008 Australian Open, months before Henin retired from the game after years of championships and personal strain and tragedy.Sharapova, 23, missed nine months in 2008 and 2009 with a shoulder injury, dropping from the top 10 to outside the top 100 in the rankings.         
	However, it was Henin who has moved comfortably into what she has called her second career, who pushed her record at Roland Garros to 38-4, who has made the present feel an awful lot like the past.

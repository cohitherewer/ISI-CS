	Calcutta: Cricket Australia on Thursday advised that Mitchell Johnson has been ruled out of the ODI part of the VB Tour of the British Isles due to injury and will be replaced in the Australia ODI squad for that component of the tour by NSWs Josh Hazlewood.         
	According to a media release, Australia team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: Mitchell had an infected right elbow during the ICC World Twenty20, which had resolved towards the end of the tournament. Since returning to Australia he has had a flareup of the condition and is currently being treated for it. As part of the treatment he requires specialist medical management over the coming weeks and as such hes been ruled out of the six ODIs against Ireland and England.         
	Meanwhile, Andrew Strauss will lead a 13- man England squad in the competition.         
	National selector Geoff Miller said: We are very pleased with the progress of our ODI squad has made under the leadership of Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower over the past 18 months and the challenge facing the squad now is to maintain the form they showed over the winter against the worlds No. 1 side in 50-over format.

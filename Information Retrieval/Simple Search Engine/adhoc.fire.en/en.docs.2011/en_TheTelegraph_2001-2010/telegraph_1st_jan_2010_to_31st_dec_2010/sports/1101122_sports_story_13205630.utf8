The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin keeps India on tenterhooks
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin keeps India on tenterhooks
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag in Nagpur, on Sunday. (PTI)                            
	Nagpur: If you have an appointment for Monday morning, postpone it to late afternoon. If you have to report for work, ensure you have a television set in place, and if you have other commitments, the easiest thing would be to bunk.         
	Sachin Tendulkar is only 43 runs away from his 50th Test hundred. The common notion is that he wont disappoint, this time.         
	There is a sudden clamour for tickets at the Vidarbha Cricket Association office, as plans are already being finalized for a grand felicitation in the hometown of BCCI president Shashank Manohar. Flights and trains arriving in the city are reportedly running full after stumps on the second day of the final Test.         
	The Airtel series wont experience a more dramatic and eventful day again. May be, the accomplishment would also remain unmatched.         
	Such was the excitement surrounding the impending slice of history that it has pushed to the backburner Indias stupendous all-round performance on the day forcing New Zealand to wear a resigned look.         
	Sachin and Rahul Dravids unbroken 100 run partnership, on Sunday, for the third wicket has already left India sniffing victory with a 99-run lead after New Zealand were restricted to 193 in the first hour.         
	The visitors ploy of bowling short to unnerve the Indians on this slow wicket never really took off. Even Chris Martin, who took a five-for in the opener, didnt try to pitch the ball up and concentrated on working up pace.         
	Martin hit Sehwag in his finger with a snorter in the first over and tried to repeat it once too often against him. The opener, however, enjoyed the challenge pulling and upper cutting with disdain. He is far too hard nosed and experienced to fret in such situations.         
	Sehwag blazed away to his 74 off 73 balls with 12 boundaries and a six before falling to Vettoris guile. He drove a wee bit early as the visiting captain latched onto it.         
	Gambhir (78) once again wasted a good start. He kept rotating the strike as Sehwag carried on with his flamboyant ways. The one-day captain in the forthcoming series, however, survived a scare when Jesse Ryder failed to hold on to a chance.         
	The 113-run opening stand set the foundation as Dravid and Sachin made merry. It is possibly their contrasting approach to the game that has made this opening pair so successful.         
	The sparse Sunday crowd stood up to greet Sachin, as he walked in, a few seconds past two, after Gambhir had poked at a short Southee delivery outside off.         
	Pressure or not, Sachin did not show it. Relaxed yet determined, the walk didnt take more time than usual. But the visitors had sensed an opportunity and were determined not to let it pass.         
	 Vettori packed the on-side field with a silly mid on, a short mid wicket and a short fine leg. The third ball was punched through extra cover for a boundary. The elegance and grace wasnt to be missed.         
	It took another 32 balls to hit his next boundary, but by then Sachin had settled into his own. There were no quarters given, no undue risks taken. Southee decided to test him with a few short deliveries but he swayed away from the line. Twice the ball didnt bounce as expected and he took them on his body and arm guard.         
	There was also a straight drive off Andy McKay that left everyone stranded. Little later came his half-century, a cut off Guptill that fetched three runs. The celebrations were a bit restrained, perhaps, in anticipation of bigger things to come.         
	Only once did Sachin look a bit rattled after failing to get away from the line and being hit on his right shoulder. An inspired Southee bounced the next one, and just to prove a point, the Little Master pulled it away.         
	Dravid, on the other hand, was erratic at the start. But once he got used to the bounce and pace of the wicket, he looked composed.         
	There was only one blemish in his unbeaten 69, a nick off McKay, which was floored by the wicketkeeper. There was also a straight drive that reminded one of the purity in his technique and the assurance he brings to the crease.         
	But it was all about Sachin. Dravids useful innings wasnt the talking point. It will remain so, unless

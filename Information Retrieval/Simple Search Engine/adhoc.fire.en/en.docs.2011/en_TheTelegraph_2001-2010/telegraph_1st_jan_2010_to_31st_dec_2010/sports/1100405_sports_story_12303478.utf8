The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chris Gayles 88 off 42 in vain
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chris Gayles 88 off 42 in vain
            KUSHAN SARKAR            Chris Gayle on way to his 88 at the Eden, on Sunday                           
	Calcutta: It was a battle between brutality and artistry. In the end, Mahela Jayawardenes swift copybook assault got the better of Chris Gayles brutality.         
	If Gayles afternoon mayhem pumped up the capacity Eden Gardens crowd, it was Mahelas silken drives that stole the purists hearts and ensured that the Kings XI Punjab were the spoilsport. A 55-ball century reiterated the fact that there is a place for cricketing shots out of the MCC manual. The innings had only one blemish when Murali Kartik dropped a sitter at backward point off Angelo Mathews. Mahela was batting on 51 then,         
	Otherwise, it was one of the most graceful innings (110 not out, 59 balls, 14x4, 3x6) one can watch in a T20 match. It is all the more sweet as Mahela wouldnt have played in the first place had Shaun Marsh not sustained a freak injury during pre-match warm-up.         
	Fittingly enough, the former Sri Lanka captain got a chance to hit the winning runs as the Kings XI registered only their second victory, winning by eight wickets. Not to forget that they chased down a target of 201 with 10 balls to spare.         
	Skipper Kumar Sangakkara (38) and under-pressure Yuvraj Singh (33 from 16 deliveries) starred in nice little cameos and played the perfect second fiddle to the Man of the Match.         
	Out of contention for a semi-final berth, the Kings XI were able to play without any pressure while Sourav Ganguly and his boys invited pressure on themselves.         
	May be the bowlers thought that 201 could not be chased down by a side who have lost seven matches so far in the tourney. Now, the chances of a last-four berth are again starting to look bleak.         
	The likes of Shane Bond, Ajit Agarkar and Murali Kartik may have underestimated the franchise from Punjab and, not only that, they appeared to have forgotten the kind of talent that is present in their top-order.         
	The Knights team management again went for needless experimenting and fielded India colts seamer Jaydev Unadkat instead of the experienced Ashok Dinda.         
	It turned out to be hara-kiri of sorts as the poor little fellow gave away 32 runs in his 2.2 overs. With his senior partners also bowling length balls in abundance, Mahela, Sangakkara and Yuvraj made merry.         
	When they were bowling, not for once did it look like the Knights were playing with the purpose of winning.         
	However, the afternoon was the time for a Gayle storm.         
	Poor Brendon McCullum! He will now have to wait. Gayles 42-ball 88, which contained eight towering sixes, had one statement in it: If you think of dropping me, do it at your own peril.         
	Sourav and Gayle began in contrasting styles. Sourav peppering the off-side and even effortlessly lifting one over long on. Gayle, however, was strangely subdued. Partly because Sourav was hitting at one end and Ramesh Powar was bowling a good line.         
	Once the Powerplay was over (the Knights were 53 for no loss in six overs), suddenly both found runs hard to come by. When Sourav (36, 31 balls, 5x4, 1x6) was caught by Ravi Bopara, suddenly things went quiet.         
	Gayle was dealing in singles and the crowd was beginning to get impatient.         
	The first time Gayle showed some urgency was when he danced down the track to hit the last delivery of Powars spell for a six. It was the 11th over. A couple of boundaries  through extra cover and mid-wicket  were signs that he was trying to break the shackles.         
	Then came the 13th over and suddenly one got an idea of what brutal hitting means. A hapless Ravi Bopara saw his second, third, fourth and fifth deliveries disappear into the stands. The first two were in the mid-wicket region, as was the fourth, while the third one was over extra-cover.         
	Manoj Tiwary (35, 32 balls) added 101 with Chris Gayle but was strangely not in his element. May be the Knights, in the end, fell short by 15 to 20 runs.         
	But given the manner in which Mahela batted, it wouldnt have made much of a difference. Kudos Mahela Jayawardene.

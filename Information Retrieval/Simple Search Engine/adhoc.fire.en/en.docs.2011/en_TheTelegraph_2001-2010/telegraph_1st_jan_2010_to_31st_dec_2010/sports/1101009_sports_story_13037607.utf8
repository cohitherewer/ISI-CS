	Karachi: In a surprising move, the Pakistan Cricket Board Friday appointed Misbah-ul Haq as captain for the Test series against South Africa next month in the United Arab Emirates.         
	The PCB also retained Shahid Afridi as captain for the one-day Internationals and T20 matches against South Africa.         
	The national selectors had recalled Misbah to the one-day and T20 squads on Thursday. He was dropped after the T20 World Cup this year and last played a Test for Pakistan in Sydney earlier this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sutil sizzles at practice 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sutil sizzles at practice

	Spa-Francorchamps: Force Indias Adrian Sutil sizzled in the rain-soaked Spa circuit to post the second fastest time in the second free practice session ahead of Sundays Belgian Grand Prix, here Friday.         
	The German clocked 1:49.157 seconds in his 17 laps in the second session of the day which was marred by extreme weather conditions.         
	Sutils teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi was 15th on the timesheet after the Italian posted 1:51.520 on the clock.         
	Fernando Alonso led the practice session. Alonsos lap of 1: 49.032 on a dry Spa circuit was the quickest and 11 seconds quicker than the Ferrari drivers leading morning time, which came in rain.         
	McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton was third after trailing by just over two-tenths of Sutil. Alonsos time came on his last lap after stewards had red-flagged the track with 15 minutes remaining as it deemed there may be spectators in a dangerous area.         
	That left only five minutes for teams to go all-out on a dry surface for the first time.         
	Overall Formula One leader Mark Webber celebrated his 34th birthday with the 18th fastest lap, while Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel was sixth, behind Renault driver Robert Kubica and Ferrari driver Felipe Massa.         
	 McLaren driver Jenson Button finished the day in seventh with a lap of 1:49.755.         
	With more rain and cool temperatures expected through Sunday, Red Bull, McLaren and Ferraris duel for the title may not be so straightforward as Force India showed good pace at a track where they finished second last year.         
	Even Michael Schumacher believed the mixed conditions could help Mercedes despite dropping 10 places from qualifying as a penalty for nearly forcing Rubens Barrichello into a wall at the Hungarian GP.

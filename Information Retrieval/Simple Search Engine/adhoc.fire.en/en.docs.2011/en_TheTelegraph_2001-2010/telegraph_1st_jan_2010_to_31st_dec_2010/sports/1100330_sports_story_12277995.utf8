                                                                                                                       7                                      Harbhajan is fined 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mumbai Indians off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was Monday fined $15,000 for swearing at Deccan Chargers batsman Tirumalasetti Suman during Sunday nights match at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.         
	It happened in the 11th over of the Deccan Chargers innings. Suman was foxed by a Harbhajan full toss and lobbed it back to the off-spinner. A pumped-up Harbhajan took the catch to complete the dismissal before giving a piece of his mind to the departing batsman.         
	Harbhajan pleaded guilty to a Level 1 offence (Article 2.1.4), which relates to excessively audible or repetitious swearing, the IPL said in a release.         
	As a result, Match Referee Gundappa Viswanath imposed a penalty of $15,000, the statement added.         
	For Level 1 breaches of the IPL Code of Conduct, the Match Referees decision is final and binding.         
	The fine notwithstanding, it was a memorable outing for Harbhajan who blasted an 18-ball 49 and then returned to claim three for 31 to grab the Man of the Match award.         
	It was in the heat of the moment, Mumbai Indians director of cricket T.A. Sekar said in Mumbai. We needed a wicket at that moment. We all know Harbhajan is always high on adrenaline Lets not make an issue out of it, he added.         
	Interestingly, Sekar said that a decision was yet to be taken as to whether the fine would be paid by the franchise or deducted from the players fee.

	New Delhi: Gagan Narang finally established himself as countrys top rifle shooter when he beat Beijing Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra to win the 10m air rifle gold in the Commonwealth Games, on Wednesday.         
	So impressive was Narangs show that Bindra himself heaped praise on his compatriot after the event.         
	Gagan is outstanding, one of the best in the world. I am sure he will win many more international tournaments, the World Championship and an Olympic gold medal, Bindra claimed.         
	Narang returned the compliments saying: When I was trying to get into shooting, I had heard a lot about Bindra who was already there. There is a lot to learn from each other. Its always nice to compete with a great shooter like him.         
	While Gagan won the clash of titans, Indian shooters once again dominated the field, winning three gold and three silver medals to add to their overnight tally of two gold and two silver.         
	The second gold of the day for India was won by Anisa Sayyed in the 25m womens pistol event. Omkar Singh wrapped it up with a gold in the 50m pistol event.         
	Shooters continued the winning spree, with junior world champion Asher Noria and world No.3 Ronjan Sodhi teaming up, to net the silver in the mens pairs double trap. Rahi Sarnobat also bagged a silver in the 25m womens pistol event.         
	On Wednesday, with a capacity crowd watching the battle between two of the worlds best shooters with bated breath, Narang won the gold in style. By doing so, he bettered his own world record of 703.5 at Bangkok World Cup final in 2008 and Commonwealth Games record in Melbourne, four years ago.         
	The record, however, will not be ratified by the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) as it only recognises records set at the Olympics, World Cups, World Cup finals and World Championships.         
	ISSF delegate David Parish said he was waiting for a clarification whether Narangs performance could be considered a world record.         
	Narang has broken his world record, but it wont be counted because the Commonwealth Games is not recognised by the ISSF. I still have to get a clarification from the ISSF, Parish said.         
	Narang, who equalled his own world record in the qualification round with a perfect shot of 600, went on to score 103.6 in the final round, leaving Bindra (698 points, 595+103) behind. The bronze medal went to James Huckle (693.5, 591+102.5) of England.         
	It was a great feeling to perform so well at home. I would strive to keep performing the way I have done here, said Narang.         
	Bindra said: I am happy with my performance in the Commonwealth Games and it feels good. Gagan has been very consistent in the last 3-4 years.

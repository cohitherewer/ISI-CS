                                                                                                                       7                                      Aravinda:   Fantastic sportsman 
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Former Sri Lankan captain and current chairman of selectors Aravinda de Silva feels that although it will be difficult but they need to fill up the void created after the retirement of legendary off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	De Silva, who played alongside Muralidharan, termed the spin wizard as incomparable and someone who has always given his hundred per cent.         
	I think the team will have a big void after the departure of Muralidharan, which needs to be filled. He is a kind of player, who will come through once in a generation and its difficult to find anyone comparable to him,         
	De Silva aired his views on ICC Cricket World audio show.         
	On the field, he gave hundred per cent. Off it, hes a tremendous guy. He was a fantastic sportsman and supported all his teammates on the field. I think thats something all senior players should take as a piece of advice from him. Hundred per cent support for teammates, says De Silva.

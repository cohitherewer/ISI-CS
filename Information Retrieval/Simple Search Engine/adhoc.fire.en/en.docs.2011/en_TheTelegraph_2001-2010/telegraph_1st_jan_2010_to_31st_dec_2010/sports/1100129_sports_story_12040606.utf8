The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salgaocar shock for Bencharifas boys
                                                                                                                       7                                      Salgaocar shock for Bencharifas boys
                      
	Margao: Salgaocar played their heart out to overcome a one-goal deficit and beat Mohun Bagan 2-1 in a Round XII of the I-League, here, on Thursday.         
	Bagans Japanese recruit Ryuji Sueoka put them ahead in the first half but the local favourites scored through Keita Mandjou and Ekene Ikenwa on either side of the lemon break for a morale-boosting win.         
	Salgaocar played with more determination in the first half as they moved around the ball well and created a couple of early chances, but failed to score.         
	Bagan, who failed to combine in the first half, created only one move and that got them the goal.         
	Defender Zenith Mashangva from the right sent a long ball into the box and Ryujis glancing header found the far corner.         
	Salgaocar suffered a setback midway through the first half when Avneet got injured and was replaced by Ikenwa. Salgaocar did not lose hope after the setback and put the rival defence under pressure and the efforts paid off in the 44th minute.         
	Milagres Gonsalves delivery from the right found Keita Mandjou inside the Bagan penalty box. He got past his marker NS Manju and hit a low drive that beat goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee.         
	Salgaocar went into the lead a minute after the lemon break. Francis Fernandes beat a couple of defenders and cut into the box before laying a pass to Keita Mandjou who failed to connect the ball. Ekene Ikenwa, slotted it home.         
	The win takes Salgaocar to 10 points from 11 matches, while Mohun Bagan remained on 20 points from 12 matches. (PTI)

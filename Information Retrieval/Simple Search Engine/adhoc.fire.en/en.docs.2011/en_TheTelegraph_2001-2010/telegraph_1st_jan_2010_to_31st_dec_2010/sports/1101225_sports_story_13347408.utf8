The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pujara likely to play
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pujara likely to play

	Calcutta: Indications are that an out-of-form Suresh Raina will finally be dropped and Cheteshwar Pujara fielded in his place, against South Africa, on Sunday.         
	The team management hasnt said anything publicly, but it does look as if Pujara is going to play his second Test, a well-placed source told The Telegraph from Durban.         
	Speaking on Friday evening, the source added: Often, the body language at nets says quite a bit... Today, it was pretty clear that Pujaras the one who has his nose in front.         
	Raina hasnt done anything of late and India (down 0-1 in the three-match series) can ill afford to have a weak link in a most crucial Test, at Kingsmead.         
	Defeat, clearly, has to be avoided at all costs.         
	Zaheer Khan, who is fit, will be back in the XI and Jaydev Unadkat is going to sit out. The latter made his debut in Centurion, last week, when the spearhead was nursing a hamstring injury.         
	Saurashtrians may not have to be disappointed as Pujara, too, is from that region.

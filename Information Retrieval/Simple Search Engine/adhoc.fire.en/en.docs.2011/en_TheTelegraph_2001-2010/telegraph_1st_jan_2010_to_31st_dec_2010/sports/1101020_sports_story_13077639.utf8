The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rankings a trifle for Mike
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rankings a trifle for Mike
                      
	Melbourne: Mike Hussey has rejected the International Cricket Councils Test rankings, which place his team at fifth, saying that the Aussies are definitely better than that and the system is not a true reflection of their form.         
	Australia dropped to an all-time low of fifth after being blanked 0-2 in the just-concluded Test series against India but Hussey said the side does not deserve to be at No. 5.         
	I dont think were the fifth-best team in the world. I dont think thats a true reflection of our team Were definitely better than that, Hussey was quoted saying by an Australian newspaper. With the new Test Championship coming in, that will probably give a better indication of where teams are at and a better understanding of where teams are ranked.         
	The proposed Test Championship, if contested now, would not feature Australia because the side is not inside the top-four bracket. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Becks and Milan ready for United

  - Real madrid star ronaldo is not Lyons only worry               David Beckham with a teammate, in Carnago, on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Milan: David Beckham is not guaranteed to start for AC Milan in Tuesdays Champions League last-16 first-leg match against former side Manchester United.         
	The midfielder has been on the bench for the last two league games and the return from injury of forward Alexandre Pato makes it even less likely the 34-year-old will play.         
	However, coach Leonardo knows how much it means for Beckham to face Alex Fergusons men for the first time even if the former England captain is trying to stay cool.         
	I always said when I came to the club that I never expect to start any game, Beckham, who won the 1999 Champions League with United before leaving in 2003, told reporters.         
	Ive started the first three or four games. Obviously last week I didnt play and then this week I came on so no Im not frustrated at all.         
	Milan, who have never lost to United over two legs and have won their four encounters in Italy, snapped a four-game winless run in Fridays 3-2 victory over Udinese watched by Ferguson.         
	On-loan Beckham came on with 15 minutes left and played one dreadful pass which almost led to an Udinese goal.         
	Worse for Milan was a thigh muscle injury which forced centre back Thiago Silva to go off.         
	The Brazilian is battling to shake off the problem for Tuesday and partner fit-again Alessandro Nesta at the back while striker Marco Borriello is a doubt and Klaas jan Huntelaar could again deputise, having scored twice against Udinese.         
	Ronaldinho had one of his better games on the left of the front three but the return of Brazilian compatriot Pato, out since the start of the year with a thigh problem, will give Milan more pace on the right.         
	United have fewer injury worries but centre back Nemanja Vidic has stayed at home because of a nerve problem in his leg and Beckhams ex-team mate Ryan Giggs is out with a broken arm.         
	Its a big shame that Giggsy is out. To play on the same field as Giggsy against him would have been really nice. Hopefully hell be fit soon and may make the second leg (on March 10), Beckham added.         
	Last seasons runners-up United, who lost to Milan in the 2007 semi-finals before winning the trophy for the third time in 2008, have had a free weekend because of their FA Cup exit and also welcome back Rio Ferdinand from a domestic suspension. Striker Wayne Rooney is in the form of his life but is taking nothing for granted against the seven-time champions.         
	Olympique Lyon will not be obsessed about Cristiano Ronaldo when they host Real Madrid as the La Liga side have plenty of other weapons in their arsenal, according to coach Claude Puel.         
	The Portuguese forward looked in ominous form on Saturday on his return from a two-match La Liga suspension, netting twice as Real crushed bottom club Xerez 3-0, but Puel told a Spanish daily they would not be marking him man-to-man in the last-16 first-leg clash at the Stade de Gerland.         
	We cannot just focus on Ronaldo as there are other players who can make the difference, he said.           (AGENCIES)

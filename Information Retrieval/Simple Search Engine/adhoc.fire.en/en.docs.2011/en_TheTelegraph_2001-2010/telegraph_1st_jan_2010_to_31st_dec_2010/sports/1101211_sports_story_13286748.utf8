The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clinical finish by India
                                                                                                                       7                                        Clinical finish by India
  - Yuvraj Singh adjudged Man of the Match for all-round show; Gambhir is MoS                 Man of the Series Gautam Gambhir fop) and Man of the Match Yuvraj Singh, with their awards, on Friday                             
	Chennai: India rode on a clinical show by their bowlers and Parthiv Patels unbeaten half century, as they crushed a hapless New Zealand by eight wickets in the fifth and final one-day International to complete a 5-0 series whitewash, here, Friday.         
	Stand-in captain Gautam Gambhir lost the toss but that proved to be a blessing in disguise as the Indian bowlers came up with a disciplined effort to bundle out New Zealand for 103 in just 27 overs, the lowest total for the visitors against India in one-dayers.         
	Chasing a mere target of 104 to win, India stuttered initially with Gautam Gambhir (0) and Virat Kohli (2) falling early but Prathiv (56 not out) and Yuvraj Singh (42 not out) kept their cool to take the home side past the target with 28.5 overs to spare at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium.         
	Patel struck the winning runs  a four  as India reached 107 for two in 21.1 overs to rout New Zealand and wrap up a remarkable performance by a young side without senior players like Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh.         
	It was Indias second instance of a 5-0 series whitewash against any country, having achieved the feat against England in 2008-09.         
	This also turned out to be best ever victory against New Zealand by India in one dayers. India won this match with 173 balls to spare with eight wickets in hand. The earlier best against the Black Caps was 160 balls to spare with seven wickets in hand.         
	New Zealand ended their tour of India on a humiliating note. They had lost the three-match Test series 0-1 before the five ODIs. Fridays ODI loss was also their 11th on the trot after beating India by 200 runs in Dambulla on August 10.         
	India, however, made a wobbly start in their run chase with Gambhir, who had scored back-to-back centuries to end as the series top-scorer, dismissed cheaply in the third ball for a duck.         
	Gambhir edged a Nathan McCullum delivery to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum when he went for a cut shot. Three overs later Kohli was caught at the slip by Ross Taylor off captain Daniel Vettori to leave India at 10 for two in the fourth over.         
	The target was too small to bother India but Yuvraj and Parthiv played sensibly as they settled down without taking much risk. But once they settled down, the Indian duo were not troubled by the visiting bowlers.         
	Parthiv hit Kyle Mills for three fours in the ninth over before hoisting Vettori for a six. Yuvraj also joined the party with a four and a six off Nathan McCullum in the same over. He also hoisted Grant Elliot for another six towards the close of run chase.         
	Parthivs unbeaten 56 came from 70 balls from which he hit six fours and a six while Yuvrajs 46-ball unbeaten 42 was studded with six fours and two sixes.         
	Earlier, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin continued to impress with figures of three for 24 while Ashish Nehra (2/34), Yuvraj (2/5) and Yusuf Pathan (2/11) scalped two wickets each to destroy the oppponents.         
	New Zealands 103 is the lowest by a team against India and also the lowest at this ground after Zimbabwes 139 against Australia on October 30, 1987.         
	New Zealands struggle can be gauged from the fact that only four of their batsmen  Brendon McCullum (14), Jamie How (23), Scott Styris (24) and James Franklin (17 not out)  could manage double figures.         
	Opting to bat after winning the toss, New Zealand never got going as they lost wickets at regular intervals to finally surrender at 103 in 27 overs.         
	Praveen Kumar (1/20) started New Zealands downfall when he had opener Martin Guptill caught behind by Parthiv Patel in the fourth ball with the visitors yet to open their account.         
	McCullum, who looked susceptible during his stay at the crease, followed suit when he was caught plumb in front of the wicket by Nehra after the batsmen went for a wild cross-batted shot.         
	His 10-ball stay at the wicket was studded with three hits to the fence.         
	It was double delight for Nehra in his next over when he achieved his 150th career wicket in the form of Ross Taylor.

	fifth odi highlights  With Brendon McCullum rsquo;s wicket, Ashish Nehra claimed his 150th wicket in one-day Internationals, becoming only the 11th Indian bowler to achieve this milestone.   Nehra claimed his 150th wicket nine years after his ODI debut in June 2001.  Since his comeback in June 2009, Nehra has claimed 59 wickets and has been the highest wicket-taker for India in that period.

  - Warne and Co. beat Kings XI Punjab for second victory in the IPL             Shane Warne celebrates a wicket with Yusuf Pathan and Naman Ojha in Mohali, on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	Mohali: A resilient Rajasthan Royals put a competitive total on the board and defended it with all their might to secure a 31-run win over the Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday.         
	Put into bat at the PCA Stadium, the Royals rode brisk cameos by Adam Voges (45 ..), Faiz Fazal (45) and Michel Lumb (41) to post a handsome 183 for five.         
	Returning to defend that total, Shane Warne and his men put up a tremendous team effort to skittle out the hosts for 152 in 19.1 overs and register their second victory in the tournament.         
	It was their stars who once again let the Punjab side down with the bulk of their runs coming from the bats of Manvinder Bisla (35), Kumar Sangakkara (29) and Ravi Bopara (25).         
	Shaun Tait claimed three wickets for 22, while Yusuf Pathan and Siddharth Trivedi got two apiece for the Royals.         
	But things had looked different at the beginning of the Punjab innings with Sangakkara setting the tone for the chase and hitting back-to-back boundaries off Munaf Patel.         
	Tait copped three boundaries in his second over as well before the Australian removed Sangakkara but by then 41 runs had come in four overs.         
	Bisla (35 off 18 balls) then lit up the stadium with some power hitting and Munaf bore the brunt of his ire.                     
	The right-hander opened his account with a boundary, followed it up with a six and hit fours off the last two deliveries in that over.         
	Warne did not get the respect he is used to and was hit for a four followed by a six before the wily Australian returned to avenge the mauling.         
	Yuvraj Singhs quest for form continues with the star player failing to make a mark despite getting a lifeline upon being dropped by Lumb in the deep.         
	Bopara and Irfan Pathan (1) fell in the same over and Mohammed Kaif (8) flopped once again as the home side saw the match slip through their fingers.         
	Earlier, put into bat on a track which seemed to have something for the pacers, the Royals got off to a flying start in the match billed as the basement battle involving two teams languishing at the wrong end of the points table.         
	Lumb straightaway was in the thick of things as he smote two fours of Irfan Pathans first over. Opening partner Naman Ojha (13) meted out the same treatment to comeback man Sreesanth, who was drafted in at offie Ramesh Powars expense.         
	Boundaries came thick and fast and the Royals had cruised to 35 when Ojhas stay was cut short in the fourth over with the batsman receiving an animated send-off from Sreesanth.         
	An unperturbed Lumb hit Shalabh Srivastava for back-to-back boundaries and was inching close to his fifty when a smart piece of stumping by Sangakkara, off Piyush Chawlas bowling, cut short the Johannesburg-born Englishmans 30-ball knock that had seven crisp fours in it.         
	Next man in Yusuf Pathan has done precious little after that 37-ball century against the Mumbai Indians and if his score at all went beyond seven on Wednesday, it is because of brother Irfan.         
	Irfan came running from long-off to pouch Yusufs miscued skier off Srivastava but eventually grassed it.         
	Yusuf prospered to hit a brisk 19-ball 28 before Srivastava got him.

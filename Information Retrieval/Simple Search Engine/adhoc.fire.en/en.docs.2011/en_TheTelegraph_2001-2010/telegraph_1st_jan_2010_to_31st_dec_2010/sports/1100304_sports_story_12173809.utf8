The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav: Bowling   our strong point
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav: Bowling   our strong point
  - Jogiyani tipped to be Sahas backup       A STAFF REPORTER            Dav Whatmore and Sourav Ganguly at the Eden, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                       
	Calcutta: Saurashtras wicket-keeper batsman Sagar Jogiyani is the favourite to be Wriddhiman Sahas standby in the Kolkata Knight Riders squad for the upcoming Indian Premier League.         
	Although, a formal announcement is awaited, it is clear that there will be a two-way fight between Jogiyani and former Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta during a practice match scheduled on Thursday. Rohit Sabharwal and Thilak Naidu are out of contention for the third wicket-keepers slot as of now.         
	It has been learnt that the KKR captain Sourav Ganguly was impressed with Jogiyanis performance in the recently concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy and summoned him to the camp. On Wednesday, Sourav was seen talking to the youngster and also giving him valuable suggestions.         
	Sourav seemed pretty certain about the composition of the squad for the first match against Deccan Chargers on March 12. I have a fair idea about what kind of squad we would take to Mumbai for the first match. The squad of 15 is in the process of finalisation. We will have a couple of practice matches before we take a final call, Sourav told reporters after a two-hour session at Eden Gardens. Ajit Agarkar, Ishant Sharma and Manoj Tiwary were also present at practice.         
	Sourav, though, is still not sure about his batting position  whether to open or bat No. 3. Throughout my international career, I have mostly opened or batted at No. 3. Though I havent decided, it will be either opening or at No. 3.         
	Asked whether he will be missing Tiwary, Ashok Dinda and Wriddhiman Saha who will not be available for the camp due to Deodhar Trophy commitments, he seemed unperturbed.         
	Its always good to play matches... They will get some serious match practice in the process, he said.         
	Sourav also feels that contrary to popular belief, bowling is the KKRs strong point.         
	We will be getting the services of Shane Bond from the second match. His raw pace can make a lot of difference. There is Ishant Sharma who is a current India player. We have a seasoned campaigner in Ajit Agarkar. I wouldnt count Eklakh Ahmed out as he is a left-arm pacer. Left-arm pacers have done quite well in the IPL. Eklakh brings in the necessary variation. We have a good prospect in Varun Aaron who can bowl at 90 miles per hour.         
	He feels it will be difficult to choose four foreign players. When you have players like Chris Gayle, Brad Hodge, David Hussey, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis in your ranks, it becomes a difficult choice.         
	On the Bengal players, Sourav said that he has spoken to Manoj about his batting position. He also made it clear that Wriddhiman and Dindas form were not a worrying factor.         
	Wriddhi, in fact, batted well in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But he is batting way down at No. 6 whereas he should be batting up the order. Obviously Sreevats (he plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore) was outstanding. Laxmi (Shukla) is bowling pretty well but he also needs to score runs. Dinda did pretty well. But we played mostly on good batting wickets where the batsman made good use of the Power play overs.

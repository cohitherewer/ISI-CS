            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Lalit Modi, the suspended Indian Premier League chairman and commissioner, on Wednesday upped his ante against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and secretary N Srinivasan in particular, terming the Special General Meeting convened next month to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him as illegal.         
	In a statement issued through his legal counsel Mehmood Abdi, Modi also ridiculed Srinivasans dismissal of his replies to the three show cause notices issued by the Board, saying the manner in which the secretary was acting was akin to khap panchayat.         
	Convening of Special General Meeting of the BCCI by N Srinivasan is only a cover up for inherent illegality committed by the secretary, Abdis statement read.

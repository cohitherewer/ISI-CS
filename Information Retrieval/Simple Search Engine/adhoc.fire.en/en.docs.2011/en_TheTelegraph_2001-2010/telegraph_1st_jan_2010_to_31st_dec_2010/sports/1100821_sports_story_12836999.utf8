	London: Having opened the defence of their Premier League title with a 6-0 thrashing of West Bromwich Albion last week, Chelsea now face the team they beat 8-0 to secure the crown three months ago.         
	Chelsea went into that final fixture with a measure of trepidation having lost to Wigan earlier in the season but tore them apart to end Manchester Uniteds three-year grip on the trophy.         
	Didier Drogba weighed in with a hattrick to end the season as the leagues top scorer and he picked up where he left off with another treble against West Brom.         
	Wigan, humbled 4-0 at home by a Blackpool side odds-on for immediate relegation, could hardly have been handed a tougher assignment than this on Saturday.         
	Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, though aware of some away day slips last season, is demanding total concentration.They didnt start well (against Wigan) last year but we have to learn to play against teams with strong motivation, said the Italian.         
	Manchester United also return to the scene of one of their defeats last season, and the season before, as they face Fulham, on Sunday.         
	While Chelsea and Uniteds title credentials are undoubted, there are still question marks over Manchester City, which added Mario Balotelli and James Milner to their bulging squad this week. Manager Roberto Mancini faces a hard task to gel a team together in time to claim a first win over Liverpool since Kiki Musampas last-minute goal secured a 1-0 victory in April 2005.

                                  Andrew Symonds in Cuttack   on Friday          
	Cuttack: Irfan Pathans blitzkrieg went in vain as Andrew Symonds produced an all-round display to guide Deccan Chargers to a thrilling six run victory over Kings XI Punjab in an Indian Premier League match here Friday.         
	Symonds first scored a sparkling 38-ball 53 to guide the Deccan Chargers to 170 for seven. He then followed it up with the crucial wicket of Mahela Jayawardene (14 off 9) and two important catches off Ravi Bopara (38 off 32) and Irfan Pathan to restrict Kings XI to 164 for eight.         
	For Kings XI, Pathan played a gem of an innings with a blistering 60 off just 26 balls to single-handedly bring the Punjab side inches clos to the target. Apart from Pathan, Bopara and Jayawardene, only one Kings XI batsmen  Sreesanth (12 off 5)  managed double figures. Vaas (2/27) was the pick of the bowlers for the Deccan Chargers, while Symonds (1/22), RP Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Rohit Sharma all accounted for a victim each.         
	Earlier sent into bat, Symonds notched up back-to-back half centuries in the event while skipper Adam Gilchrist made a quick-fire 12-ball 33 to help the Deccan Chargers post 170 for seven. With this victory, the Deccan Chargers has returned to the top half of the points table with two wins out of three matches, while Kings XI slumped to their third consecutive defeat.         
	It was a dismal start to Kings XIs run chase as they lost two wickets, including that of their skipper Sangakkara inside the third over.         
	Last match half centurion Manvinder Bisla was run out for a duck as T. Suman came up with a direct hit. Four balls later Vaas castled Sangakkaras stumps with a beautiful off-cutter. As if that was not enough, Yuvraj Singhs (4) poor show with the bat continued as he ballooned a Vaas delivery to give a simple catch to Gibbs at cover point. Symonds then sent packing a dangerous-looking Jayawardene and after Boparas dismissal, victory was just a formality for the Hyderabad side.         
	But Pathan ensured that it was not an easy win for the Hyderabad side as he used his long handle to great effect and hit three fours and five sixes to take Kings XI very close to the elusive win.

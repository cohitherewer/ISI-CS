	Bangalore: After Shane Watson, who had praised the Chinnaswamy track as a beautiful batting wicket , Marcus North expressed satisfaction with the wicket on Sunday.         
	North, who hit a career-best 128, said: It is a pretty good batting wicket... It is a satisfying hundred without doubt I just got in to a positive stride and worked on my on-drive and that really set my business up, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Baljit accuses Gill of neglect
                                                                                                                       7                                      Baljit accuses Gill of neglect
                      
	New Delhi: Former hockey goalkeeper Baljit Singh Thursday accused sports minister M.S. Gill of not fulfilling his commitment of helping him regain his full vision and alleged that the minister brought him back midway through his treatment in the US.         
	I lost an eye while practising in the national camp. But the sports minister has no sentiments associated with any player. If he had any sentiments then he should have been with me till I am cured, as promised, Baljit said.         
	When I suffered the injury, Mr Gill had made the commitment that he will see to it that I regain my full vision. If he had made the commitment, then he should fulfil it.         
	But they (the sports ministry officials) called me back from America when I was about to undergo a second surgery which was necessary to repair my eye, he added.         
	Baljit suffered a career-threatening injury on his right eye while practising with a golf ball in a national camp in Pune last year.         
	Soon after the incident, the sports minister had announced that the government would bear all the cost of Baljits treatment till he regains his complete vision and accordingly sent him to Alabama for treatment.         
	But after one successful surgery in the US, the Chandigarh lad had to return back prior to a major surgery after the ministry refused to fund his treatment any further, saying the operation can easily be done in India.         
	Baljit said that for the last three months he has been banging his head from one door to the other without result.         
	I constantly appealed to the sports minister to complete my treatment, but he bluntly refused saying there is no money with the Hockey India, the Indian Olympic Association and the sports ministry, too, could not afford any further, he said.         
	Where were these people in the last three months when I was sitting at home hoping for treatment to be completed?         
	My team raised their voice for me and when the matter came out in the media, the Hockey India told me that they will pay me Rs 2.5 lakh which I have spent from my own pocket for the treatment in the US, he added.         
	Baljit, however, thanked Gill for all his support till date but requested the minister to come forward and complete his treatment. (PTI)

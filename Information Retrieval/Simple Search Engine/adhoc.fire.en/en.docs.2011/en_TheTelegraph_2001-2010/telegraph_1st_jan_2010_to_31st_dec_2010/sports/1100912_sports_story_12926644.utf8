	New York: Top-seeded Rafael Nadal blew through No. 12 Mikhail Youzhny 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 to reach his first US Open final on Saturday and set up the first half of his sports dream match-up  Nadal vs. Roger Federer for a Grand Slam title.         
	Nadal is 5-2 against Federer in Grand Slam finals but they have never met in Flushing Meadows, where Federer has five championships but Nadal had never even reached the final.         
	Until now.         
	For me, it is a dream, Nadal said. Im going to play for the first time in the final here, in the biggest centre court in the world.         
	Looking to complete the career Grand Slam, Nadal came to the US Open as fresh, both mentally and physically, as hes ever been. He also came with a serve thats been either revamped or tweaked  or something in between  and it has made a difference, allowing more easy points for tennis ultimate grinder.         
	Nadal won 13 of his 14 service games against Youzhny and, through six matches, has been broken only twice in 91 games.         
	He still hasnt lost a set, either, and Youzhny barely pressed him.         
	The Russian, playing in his second career Grand Slam semi-final, was coming off a four and a half hour, five-set win over Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland in the quarter finals.         
	He came in with a respectable 4-7 win-loss record against Nadal, but from the beginning of this meeting, he never looked like he had the legs to position himself for an upset.         
	There was a brief delay midway through the second set while Nadal had his left foot re-taped. A slight opening? Well, no. Nadal came out and held the next service game at love, then pinned Youzhny deep, forcing the Russian to hit a forehand long on break point to make it 5-3. He said the new tape job was no big deal.         
	Nadal and Youzhny played on a day where the flag above Arthur Ashe Stadium flew at half-staff, on the nine-year anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks across the river in Manhattan.         
	In his post-match interview on court, Nadal expressed his support for the victims of 9-11 and their families.         
	This is a very special day for everybody, he said.         
	On a day when the wind that has plagued the tournament finally eased up, Youzhny got his single break of serve to pull to 4-4 in the third set.         
	Just as quickly, Nadal broke back, then served it out for the win and found himself one victory away from becoming the seventh man to round out a collection of major championships.         
	He has eight so far: five at the French, two at Wimbledon and one at the Australian in 2009, where he beat Federer in five sets  the last time they met in a Grand Slam.         
	Nadal is seeking to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the French, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year.         
	Nadal lost in the semi-finals in 2008 and 2009. This year, Nadal says, is different.         
	Before the semis, he had said: Man, Im great. Last year, I was in the semis, and that was close to a miracle. This year has been the opposite.         
	When youre in perfect condition, theres a different perspective, said Nadal, who turned 24 earlier this year.         
	Im happy, because everything has turned out great with my physical form. Without being healthy, you cannot aspire to anything. And when youre OK, then at least you have the chance to do it.         
	Nadal had defeated compatriot Fernando Verdasco in the quarter finals.         
	Federer also advanced to the semi-finals without losing a set.

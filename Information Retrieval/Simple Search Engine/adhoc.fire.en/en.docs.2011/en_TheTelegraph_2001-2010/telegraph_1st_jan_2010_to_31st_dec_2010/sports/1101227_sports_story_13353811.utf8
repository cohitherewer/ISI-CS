The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | VVS: 250 will be a good score
                                                                                                                       7                                      VVS: 250 will be a good score
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Durban: V.V.S. Laxman, who top-scored (38) on Sunday, Day I of the second Test, spoke to the media in general and, briefly, to The Telegraph separately, after the early stumps.         
	No more than 56 overs could be bowled and a 9.30am start may become the norm right through the match.               
	The following are excerpts         
	India losing too many wickets on a weather-hit first day         
	Yes, four down for 183 instead of being six down wouldve been a better position... Rahul (Dravid) and I got out in quick succession, when we needed to carry on.         
	[Dravids exit made it 117 for four; Laxmans made it 130 for five.]         
	The importance of Monday         
	If we get 250 and the weather stays the same, then I think it will be a good score.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni losing the toss yet again, in conditions not conducive for batting         
	At the international level, youre supposed to tackle the challenges as they come... Youve got to face them.         
	Difference between the wicket in Centurion and here         
	That, in comparison, was soft and slow... Kingsmead is quicker and with more bounce... In Centurion, the wicket had eased with the sun coming out, making it better for the batsmen... Hope conditions stay the same when the South Africans bat.         
	Batting at Kingsmead...         
	Because of the weather, the bowlers always have a chance... If a batsman gets a start, then he should build on it... Today, at least one of us ought to have finished on a 50 or a 60 not out.         
	Hammering Dale Steyn for a six, the fifth over-boundary of his 119-Test career         
	(Laughs) It was my fifth? Ill cherish this one... Ive hit a few only.         
	Much now depending on Indias lower order         
	Our lower order takes pride in batting... Only recently, Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) had two brilliant hundreds, against New Zealand.         
	Steyn vis-a-vis Wasim Akram, Allan Donald and Glenn McGrath         
	Hes right up there... Steyn and Morne Morkel are top-class bowlers.         
	Approach which the Indian bowlers must adopt         
	Theyll have to be patient.         
	Finally, on the work he put in before arriving in South Africa         
	I trained a lot at the NCA (Bangalore)... Worked on my back and practised with wet tennis balls and plastic balls...               
	After Laxman, it was tormentor Steyns turn to take questions. Hes already bagged four for 36. Here goes:         
	The approach South Africa intend taking on the second day         
	(Grins) The same as the first day! We arent going to get too ahead of ourselves, though, as Dhoni and Harbhajan can still take the game away.         
	Whether 250 by India would actually be a good score, as Laxman put it         
	Looks like, not that Im bothered about what the batsmen could get... We had to really work on the ball as a wet outfield stopped it from swinging...         
	Top challenge for the South Africa batsmen         
	To be patient.         
	Bowling in Centurion and bowling at Kingsmead         
	Much the same... That Graeme decided to again field shows the confidence he has in his bowlers... It gets down to the basics and Graeme has been setting good fields.         
	Lonwabo Tsotsobe getting two wickets and taking a brilliant catch off his bowling to send back Laxman...         
	He bowled nicely and will be a part of this attack for some time to come... Yes, he took his first catch in Tests... Id say I had only three wickets and one was his. There have, of course, been times when he goes off to sleep!         
	Getting cramps in the groin region         
	Im fine now... For the first time, the physio (Brandon Jackson) told me I was over-hydrated.         
	Lastly, on being the bowler he is         
	(Laughs) Im lucky... I dont try to be a hero on every ball, but do what the captain wants me to.

            QUICK TAKES                
	Johannesburg: Even his 70-year-old grandmother had harsh words for the referee who gave him a red card in Brazils match against Ivory Coast, said Kaka, who pledged to be more careful because of the severe refereeing at the World Cup. The playmaker said his grandmother, Vera, was as upset as he was with being sent off late in Brazils 3-1 victory at Soccer City Stadium on Sunday. I cant repeat here what she said about the referee, a laughing Kaka said Tuesday. quot;She was happy with the way I played, but sad with the sending off. With all the respect that she has, she launched a bit of a tirade at the referee.

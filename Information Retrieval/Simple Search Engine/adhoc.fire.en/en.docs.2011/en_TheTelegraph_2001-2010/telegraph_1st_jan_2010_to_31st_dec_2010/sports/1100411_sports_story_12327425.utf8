	Robin Uthappa clobbered the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) bowlers and Rahul Dravid played a classy innings as hosts Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) recorded an emphatic seven-wicket victory in an 11th round IPL encounter at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore on Saturday.         
	Uthappa attacked in such a manner that RCB reached the target with 17 balls to spare.         
	While Uthappa smacked an unbeaten 21-ball 50 (4x4, 4x6), Dravid hit a 35-ball 52 (5x4, 2x6).         
	With the crucial two points, the Royal Challengers are now on 12 points, while KKR stay on 10. From here on, it will be an uphill task for Sourav Ganguly and his men to qualify for the last four stage. The Knights fought gamely despite defending a modest target. When Dravid was out in the 14th over, the Royal Challengers still needed 59 runs from 40 deliveries. However, in the next 3.5 overs, Uthappa-Ross Taylor (14, 6 balls, 1x4, 1x6) added 60 runs.         
	The Knights Ishant Sharma (0/46 from four overs) and Ajantha Mendis (0/44 from four overs) gave away 90 runs in eight overs.         
	Earlier, disciplined bowling efforts from the Royal Challengers skipper Anil Kumble (1/17), Ranganath Vinay Kumar (3/23) and Jacques Kallis (2/31) restricted the Knights to 160 for nine.                     
	All the top three KKR batsmen  Sourav Ganguly (33, 32 balls, 2x4, 2x6), Chris Gayle (34, 14 balls, 6x4, 1x6) and Brendon McCullum (45, 36 balls, 5x4, 2x6)  got starts but couldnt carry on. As a result, there were too many dot balls during the middle overs. And the Knights could never recover from a middle-order collapse.         
	Interestingly, while the top three KKR batsmen compiled 112 runs, the last eight barely managed 37 among themselves. And, for the record, 11 runs were courtesy extras.         
	Put in to bat, Sourav and Gayle started off in a scratchy manner. The fifth over of the innings, the third from Praveen Kumar, opened the floodgates for the Knights.         
	The visitors openers smashed the India seamer for 21 runs with both Sourav and Gayle hitting a six each. Gayle, however, fell in the very next over.         
	A bowling change by Anil Kumble actually did the trick. Kallis, who was brought on during the last over of Powerplay, got Gayle off his very first delivery. The West Indies skipper tried an uppish drive through covers but was easily caught by Dravid.         
	Sourav, however, cut Kallis over point for a six as the visitors reached 60 for one at the end of Powerplay. The KKR captain perished in the 12th over when he lobbed a simple catch to Kumble, who had stationed himself at square-leg, off Vinay Kumar. Manoj Tiwary (0) was back in the dugout when Kallis cleverly dug one short and Cameron White lapped up the simplest of catches at backward-point.         
	Angelo Mathews holed out in the deep in the next over. From 103 for one, the KKR slumped to 105 for four. McCullum did hit some lusty blows but never looked in his element. The Knights lost five wickets in the last four overs with adding only 27 runs.         
	The match, actually, was lost at that point.

  - Barreto, Snehasish on target for Mohun Bagan in seasons last derby       A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto nets in Mohun Bagans first goal on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Coming out of the Salt Lake Stadium tunnel, Phillippe de Ridder had no clue, which way his teams bench would be. He went left and had to be pulled back by one of the East Bengal officials. This way, the official told him and the Belgian, regaining himself, walked briskly to take his seat.         
	As things unfolded in the next 90 minutes, his boys were equally clueless. Having no idea whatsoever how to go about things. And, expectedly, a much-more disciplined and motivated Mohun Bagan came up trumps, winning the I-League derby 2-1.         
	After Jose Ramirez Barreto headed home the first goal in the 14th minute, substitute Snehasish Chakraborty slotted home four minutes from close. And by the time, Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu reduced the margin, four minutes into the injury time, Mohun Bagan were already into the celebration mood.         
	The win will definitely give Bagan fans something to smile about but for De Ridder it might prove catastrophic. After this spineless display, where Alvito DCunha was played on the right and Sanju Pradhan warmed the bench for the first 45 minutes, it would be highly surprising if the officials go for a contract renewal.         
	If everything went wrong for De Ridders men, things panned out exactly the way Bagan wanted. Barreto played a little deeper, Rakesh Masih was used as the screen in front of the back four. That was enough to shut out Mehtab Hossain in the centre of the park and East Bengal were all at sea.         
	Finding acres of space in front of them, the likes of Ryuji Sueoka, Ishfaq Ahmed, N Mohanraj and Surkumar Singh revelled. Sueoka, in particular, hasd a great game and played a big role in Bagans two goals. Rightfully so, he was adjudged the Man of the Match.         
	The Japanese, in fact, could have got his name in the scoresheet just a minute before Barreto got the first but he shot into the side-netting with only rival goalkeeper Gupreet Singh Sandhu, at his mercy.         
	With the midfield nowhere in sight, the defence crumbled every time Bagan went on the offensive. Meharajuddin Wadoo, Harmonjyot Singh Khabra and Uga Okpara gave a pathetic account of themselves. Certainly, they would like to forget this match as quickly as possible.         
	Take the first goal for instance. Mehrajuddin was so slow in retreating that Barreto headed in Sueokas delivery almost unmarked. By the time, Khabra tried to close him down, the damage was done.         
	During the second goal, Sueoka delivered a cross from the right with Mehrajuddin and Okpara too busy marking Barreto. In the process, they left Snehasish unmarked. And the wide man did not make any mistake in slotting it home.         
	Still, East Bengal had their chances when B Beokhokheis attempt from close was first parried by Sangram Mukherjee and then volleyed out of the danger zone by Deepak Mondal. And then, Yusif Yakubu, playing through pain, got past Sheikh Azim and Deepak before losing control in front of the goal.         
	For the record, this was Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharyas first win in a Derby match. He may not be there at the helm in the next season but he will always remember this Sunday.

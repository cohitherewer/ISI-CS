The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Having a ball
                                                                                                                       7                                        Having a ball
                              
	Like in every World Cup, the ball to be used in South Africa has come under fire from the players and the coaches. The name of the ball is Jabulani which means to celebrate in Zulu but from the mood of the players there seems to be fewer occasions to celebrate.         
	A large number of coaches, goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and strikers feel the ball is harder to control and it changes direction without the consent or idea of the player.         
	The critics include Brazil coach Dunga, Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas, Englands David James, Italy striker Giampaolo Pazzini, Brazil striker Luis Fabiano and a host of other top players. All of them suspect the ball has been manufactured in an attempt to have more goals in the World Cup.         
	Itll allow some people to score extra goals, but leave some goalkeepers looking daft, said Spain custodian Iker Casillas.         
	Adidas, the maker of the ball, and Fifa, however, have staunchly defended the ball.         
	English sports scientist Andy Harland, who came up with the concept for the new ball with a team from Loughborough Universitys Sports Technology Institute, said he was not unduly perturbed. This ball has been around since December and been used since then around the world with very few comments, he said.  Sports Desk  KNOW THE BALL
    Unlike the regular 32 hexagonal panels, the Jabulani ball only has eight. 
    The ball has a lsquo;grip n groove rsquo; texturing, which allows a smoother flight and a better grip.
    The number 11 is symbolic of the 11 official languages of South Africa and the number of players in a football team. To honour this, 11 colours were used on the ball. 
    The four triangular design elements on the white background give the ball a unique African look and as with Johannesburg rsquo;s Soccer City, they capture the colourfulness of South Africa.
    The ball has a circumference of 69 cm and weighs 440 gms.  THE HISTORY
    The Jabulani ball was used as the match ball for the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in the UAE. A special version, called the Jabulani Angola, was used during the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations.

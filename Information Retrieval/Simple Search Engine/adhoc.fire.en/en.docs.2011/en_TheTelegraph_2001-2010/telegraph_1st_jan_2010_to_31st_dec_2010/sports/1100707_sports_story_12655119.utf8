	Berlin: Soccer fans across Germany will be hoping a psychic cephalopods fabled skills of prophecy have failed him after Paul the octopus predicted a German loss in their World Cup semi-final with Spain.         
	With a 100 per cent record so far, the British-born aquarium dweller at Sea Life in Oberhausen, western Germany has become a celebrity having correctly predicted a series of German wins and even Germanys surprise group stage loss to Serbia.         
	Two dead         
	Berlin: Police say two Italian men have died after being shot following an argument at a German bar that apparently centred on the World Cup records of Italy and Germany. Both victims were taken to a hospital with head wounds after the Monday morning shooting in Hannover.         
	Heroes home         
	Accra: Thousands of football fans thronged Ghanas main airport to welcome back home the national team who gallantly and narrowly lost to Uruguay in quarter finals at the World Cup in South Africa. Kotoka international airport was choked with fans who started gathering as early as six hours before the teams expected arrival on Monday.         
	Torres price         
	London: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has flown to South Africa to try to secure the signing of Fernando Torres for a British-record of 50million. The extraordinary fee still falls short of Liverpools 70 million valuation of their prize asset in what is set to be a summer of turmoil at Anfield.         
	Good view         
	Johannesburg: Ninety per cent of the Germans with television sets watched their sides spectacular 4-0 demolition of Argentina in the World Cup quarter finals, Fifa said on Tuesday. Spokesman Nicolas Maingot said an average of 27.7 million people watched the game last Saturday, when Germany reached the semi-finals.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Penn Orji                           
	New Delhi: A draw against Salgaocar on Monday will ensure a place for East Bengal in the semi-finals of the Durand Cup, but coach Trevor Morgan is not ready to encourage any such idea.         
	I know that on paper we need only a point but that is not going to be our target, said the British coach after a practice session on Sunday.         
	We have won 17 matches in a row and our target will be to keep it going as long as possible. My boys are ready for the challenge, he added.         
	On Monday, East Bengal are going to make only one change in the team that played against Air India. Midfielder Reisangmi Vashum, who was injured in the first half against the Mumbai outfit, will make way for Sanju Pradhan. Vashum has undergone an MRI scan and the result is awaited, the East Bengal coach said.         
	Going by the current form, East Bengal are certainly favourites to make the grade but Salgaocar, too, have the ability to cause an upset.         
	In their earlier match against Air India, the Goan team played good football in the second session with players like Rocus Lamare, Tomba Singh, Ryuji Seuoka and Francis Fernandes doing a commendable job in the midfield. An early goal from Salgaocar can easily upset East Bengals plans.         
	East Bengal are a good team and playing well this season. But we have a bunch of youngsters, who are eager to do well. My boys shouldnt be taken lightly, said Karim Bencharifa, the Salgaocar coach.         
	Against Air India, the Calcutta team looked disjointed in the first half till the time Penn Orji decided to take control of the midfield. East Bengal, it seems, need a leader in the middle, who could be the guiding force.         
	However, the East Bengal attacking line has the capability to make the difference. While foreign recruit Tolgay Ozebe is a true goalgetter, Robin Singh has the right height and approach to breakthrough the Salgaocar defence.

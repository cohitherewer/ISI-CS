The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shouldve got 750: Kumar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Shouldve got 750: Kumar
  - Dropping Sachin on 29 turned out to be crucial, says Sri Lanka captain       A CORRESPONDENT            Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag celebrate the fall of a Sri Lanka wicket, on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Though they failed to beat India, in the second Test, in Colombo, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said that he was quite satisfied with the performance of his bowlers. He, however, rued, at a media conference, that they should have batted on till around 750, instead of declaring at 642 for four, in the first innings.               
	The following are excerpts               
	When did he realise that there wont be a result in this Test         
	Perhaps, by tea on Thursday Just after tea, when they went beyond our score. Maybe we should have batted for around 750 runs in the first innings. Probably, we didnt bowl more on the last day.         
	Calling off play before the scheduled close on the final day         
	I dont know how the sponsors and the television networks will look at that. It was not the most interesting final days play. Until the ICC changes its rules, theres nothing much you can do.         
	If he was negative at the start of Fridays play         
	When we started in the morning, we tried to see whether we could take a wicket by checking the run flow. Time was also vital. We had six hours. The spinners got some assistance in the last four hours. At one point, we had to bring the fast bowlers, bowl a few bouncers and unsettle the batsmen.         
	The wicket         
	The crowds like to see an even contest between the bat and ball. Unfortunately, that wasnt the case. The wicket at the SSC has been always flat. I remember, when we played against Pakistan, we had to bat out about five sessions to save the Test and at the end we were 424 for four. Still there was some bite on that wicket in the last session, but it was a foregone conclusion by then.         
	Lankas bowling attack         
	Our bowling strength is good. The only issue was that the ball didnt swing. The wicket had a lot of bounce. They tried their heart out. When we got three quick wickets we had a chance, but after that we let things off again. Given the track, the performance of the bowlers was quite impressive.         
	Not playing Rangana Herath and Chanaka Welegedara         
	We had a good chat with both of them. We worked on a few things on Welegederas run-up and we had four to five days of work with the coaching staff. It would have been probably unfair for us to play him in this Test and to drop him for the third Test if something went wrong. We also had a chat with Rangana. He didnt do anything wrong in Galle.         
	We wanted to see whether two more attacking bowlers could do the job, but he didnt. They are bit more attacking than Rangana. He has bowled well for us against Pakistan and New Zealand. But India have played well against him in the last two series. We had to take that into consideration. He understood that.         
	On Malinga         
	He is pretty good for the third Test. He had stiffness and soreness after the first Test. He had a bout of fever as well. Well assess his conditions as soon as he we start training again. Everyone has been keeping an eye on him. If hes back for us in the third Test, itll be a bonus.         
	His eight double hundreds         
	I have a long way to go before matching the greats. They are amazing cricketers. My job as a batsman is to score runs  score as many runs as possible. The wicket being flat also helped. I just enjoyed batting on that track.         
	The positives from this Test         
	Batting, I think, was pretty good. In bowling, I think we had lot of intent We created opportunities. Dilhara (Fernando) was impressive. He bowled with a lot of heart. It was tough working (on this pitch). He tried bowling short, tried bowling full. We had to try many things. The Indians handled it properly.         
	On Sachin being dropped on 29         
	It turned out to be a big miss at the end. But Prasanna (Jayawardene) rarely misses anything. This was one off-day when he just missed one chance. Unfortunately for him, Sachin went onto make a double hundred. We created a few chances against him, but couldnt capitalise after three quick wickets fell.  
	DAY V HIGHLIGHTS   
	 India registered a score of 700-plus in a Test match for the third time, two of them now being against Sri Lanka. India rsquo;s score of 707 is the highest score made in a Test away from home beating the 705/7 vs Australia at Sydney, 2003-04.  
	 It was only the 9th instance of India having batted 200 overs (1200) balls in a Test match. By batting for 225.2 overs (1352 balls), it was the third longest India have batted in a Test. The longest being 241.5 overs (1451 balls), against New Zealand, in Delhi (1955-56)  
	 By bowling 73 overs in his debut innings in Tests, Suraj Randiv moves into second position in the list of most overs bowled by a debutant in his first innings. Only Tom Cartwright, who bowled 77 overs (Eng vs Aus, Old Trafford, 1964) has bowled more on debut.  
	 However, Randiv (73-16-222-2) does enter into the record books via a dubious record. He has now conceded the most runs by a debutant. Australia rsquo;s Jason Krejza had conceded 215 runs in his debut Test, against India, in Nagpur (2008-09).  
	 The match aggregate of 1478 runs is now the second highest for any Test played on Sri Lankan soil. The highest still remains the Test at Colombo (RPS), also against India, in 1997-98, which saw 1489 runs.   
	 This was the first drawn Test played between India and Sri Lanka on Sri Lankan soil in 11 years. The last Ind-SL drawn Test in SL was played at the same venue in February 1999.

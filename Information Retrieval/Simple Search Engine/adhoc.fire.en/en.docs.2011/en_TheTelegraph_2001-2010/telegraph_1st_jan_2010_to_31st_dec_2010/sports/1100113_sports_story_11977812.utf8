The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sol close to Arsenal comeback
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sol close to Arsenal comeback
                      
	London: Former England defender Sol Campbell could be about to rejoin Arsenal on a free transfer after agreeing to play a trial match for the Gunners reserve team.         
	The 35-year-old Campbell has been without a club since leaving Notts County in September but has kept fit by training with the club he left more than three years ago.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said last week that Campbell was still good enough to play in the Premier League.         
	He now plays on a reserve league registration with a view to a permanent move back to Arsenal, Arsenal said Tuesday in a statement.         
	Campbell had looked set to join League Championship leader Newcastle after walking out on fourth-tier club Notts County but may instead bolster Arsenals unexpected challenge for the Premier League title.         
	Wenger has long been rumoured to be seeking to bolster his young squad with an experienced signing.         
	Former Arsenal players Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry had both been linked with returns to the club, with Vieira eventually joining Manchester City this month and Henry remaining at Barcelona.

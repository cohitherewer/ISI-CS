	New Delhi: Hockey-player-turned-boxer Amandeep Singh (49kg) out-punched Malaysian M Redzuan, while Jai Bhagwan (60kg) didnt even step inside the ring to make the finals as a record six Indians assured themselves of at least a silver in the fifth Commonwealth Championships here today.         
	Good news started trickling in early in the day for India when Jai got a walkover into the finals after his English opponent Danny Philips was found medically unfit in the weigh. Jai will face Bahamian Valention Knowles in the final on Wednesday.         
	Amandeep thrashed Malaysian M Redzuan 7-1 in a lopsided bout to enter the final. He will face Kenyas Peter Mungai, who notched up a 7-0 win over Botswanas Bathusi Mogajane.         
	With Vijender Singh (75kg), Suranjoy Singh (52kg), Dinesh Kumar (81kg) and Paramjeet Samota already through to the finals, the Indian team is in contention for lifting the team championship as well.         
	In the only bout to feature a local favourite on Tuesday, Amandeep fought from long range to get past his opponent, who was aggressive throughout.         
	A few jabs earned Amandeep a crucial 3-0 lead in the opening round and though he couldnt add to the tally in the next three minutes, the Indian ensured that none of his opponents wild swings could get to him.         
	Looking ahead at Wednesdays final, Sandhu said the performance of his wards has surpassed his expectations           (PTI)

	Orlando: Tiger Woods had a cortisone shot in his right ankle 10 days ago to relieve lingering soreness. By Tuesday, he was back to work hitting balls and filming a commercial.         
	Mark Steinberg, his agent at IMG, said Woods had intended all along to have the shot after the Chevron World Challenge, which ended December 5. Woods has nearly two months off before his next tournament at Torrey Pines.         
	This was always the plan, Steinberg said. Hes looking at 2011 as a big year for him. At this years Masters, Woods revealed he ruptured the Achilles tendon in his right leg in December 2008 while recovering from knee surgery. Steinberg says it still causes soreness, prompting the cortisone shot.         
	Woods, meanwhile, posted two tweets, Tuesday, of photos from his EA Sports shoot at Isleworth, referring to one as a tough day at the office.

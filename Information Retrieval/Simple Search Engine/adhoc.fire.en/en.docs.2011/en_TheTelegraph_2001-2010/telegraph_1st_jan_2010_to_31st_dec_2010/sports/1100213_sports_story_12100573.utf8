                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Raghuvansh may lift Queens Cup
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The prestigious 2,800m Queen Elizabeth II Cup takes the centre stage in Saturdays nine-event card, which also includes the 1,600m Calcutta Million and The Metropolitan, over 1,200 metres. Trophies sponsored by the consulates of Germany, Portugal and Fillipine are the added attractions on the day, to which the RCTC has tried to give a carnival-like look, with fashion and designers hats making their presence felt, and also the coming under judges scanner.          
	Nevertheless, Raghuvansh gets the first call in the Queens Cup. The Arti Doctor-trained horse is not only sitting pretty by the terms of the race, the horse is also in form. The Calcutta Million also appears to be in the safe keeping of trainer Vijay Singhs Hall Of Glory who is heading for a hattrick of wins. The Metropolitan, on the other hand, seems to be a tricky race.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

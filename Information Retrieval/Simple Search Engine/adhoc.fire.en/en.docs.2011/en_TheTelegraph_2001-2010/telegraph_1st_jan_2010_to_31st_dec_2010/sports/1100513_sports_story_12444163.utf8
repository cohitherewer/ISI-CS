                                                                                                                       7                                      Shuttlers bow out 
                      
	New Delhi: Indian men and women badminton teams crashed out of the Thomas and Uber Cup after suffering identical 0-3 thrashing at the hands of Indonesia and China, respectively in their quarter final matches in Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday.         
	Top Indian shuttlers Parupalli Kashyap and Saina Nehwal gave a scare to their higher-ranked opponents Taufik Hidayat and Yihan Wang before eventually bowing down 12-21, 21-10, 17-21 and 21-14, 11-21, 18-21, respectively.         
	However, all other Indians suffered straight-game defeats as their campaign ended on a disappointing note.         
	In the Thomas Cup quarter final, Kashyap was the first to take the court and the world No. 33 shuttler came back strongly to win the second game 21-10 after losing the first 12-21.         
	In the decider, Kashyap was ahead 10-8 before Hidayat made it 10-10. (PTI)

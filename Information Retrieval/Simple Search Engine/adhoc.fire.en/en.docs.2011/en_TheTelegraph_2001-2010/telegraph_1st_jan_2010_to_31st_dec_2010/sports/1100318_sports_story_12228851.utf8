            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Bangalore: Cricket fans can now get glimpses of the little-known goings-on inside the dressing rooms of Team India, thanks to the shutterbug that is Anil Kumble.         
	The former India captain Wednesday released his book  Wide Angle  a compilation of photographs he had taken over the last 20 years which, as he put it, was an attempt to bring out what happens behind the scenes.         
	A hobby since his teens, Kumble said he took all the photographs featured in the book while on tour and between matches.         
	Cricket for me is a passion and as a cricketer I felt that many of the good things that we do are not published and what we dont do does get into print. So I decided to compile the rare happenings of my twenty years journey as a cricketer, he said.         
	I wanted to bring to front the things that happen behind the scenes, celebrations of performances, victories, achievements and birthdays where cake would be smeared on the face. Photography has been a stress buster for me and I have always sought to capture sights and sounds, he added.         
	A wildlife enthusiast as well, he is also the vice-chairperson of the Karnataka Wildlife Board.         
	When I first travelled on a longish trip from Bangalore to Sri Lanka for an India under -17 camp, my brother Dinesh packed a small aim-and-shoot camera and said that this will capture all your memories, Kumble said at the launch of his book.         
	Since then Ive always had a camera with me right throughout my career.         
	He recalled telling teammates that their privacy was under threat as long as he was in the team. I hope theres a lot more privacy now that Ive retired, he quipped.         
	But he added that the while the book did not reveal too much, it gave some insight into what happens in a cricketers life on tours.         
	Among those who ensured there were lots of entertainment were Venkatapathi Raju, Jawagal Srinath, Vinod Kambli and Harbhajan Singh, Kumble said. He also recalled an incident when Srinath had tried on a turban.         
	Probably, Bhajji is a live wire in the dressing room, he said.         
	Kumbles favourite shots includes a snap of lightning in the night sky over Durban and another of Sachin Tendulkar getting his 35th Test century in Delhi.         
	The book  which was released by Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne  is priced at Rs 5,900 and is produced and marketed by Tenvic , a division of Anil Kumble Sports Pvt Ltd.         
	Warne revealed his admiration for Kumble, describing him as a thorough gentleman.         
	What Anil has achieved and what he has delivered to his fans has been fantastic. Playing against Anil, fortunately or unfortunately, I have found him to be a thorough gentleman, a humble guy, said Warne.         
	He was told that he cannot spin the ball. They said he cannot bowl leg spin. But he has shown over 20 years what he can do by doing it.         
	The one stand out thing about Anil for me is that he has a big heart. He is a giver, a hundred per cent team man, a man with a real big heart. He has always held his head high with his performances, said the Rajasthan Royals skipper.         
	For all the youngsters and many more, Anil is the role model, the way he conducts himself on and off the field. It is not just talent, but passion and love for the game that has seen Anil play the game for 20 years and that proves he has a big heart, said Warne.         
	Kumble also showered praise on the Australian legend and said he wished he could spin the ball like him.         
	I wish I could bowl and spin the ball like him. I would secretly watch how he went about setting up the batsmen for taking a wicket, revealed Kumble.

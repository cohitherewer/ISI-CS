The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Samaraweera takes Sri Lankans home

	Dhaka: Thilan Samaraweeras second ODI century and Thissara Pereras cameo tilted the scales as India slumped to a five-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka in their tri-series opener here Tuesday.         
	Defending a 279-run total, India fancied their chances but the 122-run stand between Samaraweera (105 not out off 106 balls) and Kumar Sangakkara (60), followed by Pereras breath-taking unbeaten 15-ball 36 turned the match on its head.         
	The spirited Lankans cruised to 283 for five in 48 overs and their second successive win in the tournament would be some solace for the islanders who had lost both the Test and ODI series in India before coming to this tournament.         
	Put into bat, India earlier rode a fit-again Yuvraj Singhs well-paced 74 to recover from a top-order wobble to post a competitive 279 for nine.         
	Virender Sehwag (47), MS Dhoni (37), Suresh Raina (35) and Ravindra Jadeja (39) chipped in with useful cameos but India missed the 300-mark, managing just 20 runs from the last five overs and that proved costly in the end.         
	Sri Lanka got off to a brisk start and Sangakkara and Samaraweera raised 122 runs at a rapid rate to prop up the innings.         
	With Tillekaratne Dilshan nursing a groin injury, Lahiru Thirumanne (22) had the openers role thrust on him in his debut match and the youngster calmed his nerves with three fours off Sreesanths first over.         
	Sreesanth returned to settle scores in his next over when Gautam Gambhir pouched Thirumannes top edge at square leg but not before adding brisk 48 runs with Upul Tharanga (30).         
	Tharanga also looked in good nick before he tamely drove Harbhajan Singhs fifth delivery back to the bowler for a simple caught-and-bowled dismissal.         
	What followed was a 20-over toil for the Indian bowlers, who struggled to grip the wet ball and break the Sangakkara-Smaarweera stand that put Sri Lankas chase back on track.         
	The experienced duo added 122 runs in just over 20 overs before Sangakkara  who became the fifth Lankan to score 8000 ODI runs  fell to Harbhajan.         
	Harbhajan removed Thilan Kandamby too, but Perera then came up with a gem of a cameo to take the match away from India.         
	Earlier, Yuvraj struck a well-paced 74 to bail India out of the woods.         
	The left-hander played a crucial knock after coming in to bat when India were 62 for two and shared a 99-run stand for the fourth wicket with Dhoni to repair the innings.         
	Sehwag, who made a quickfire 31-ball 47 and Jadeja, who contributed a 34-ball 39, were the other main contributors.         
	At one point of time India looked like they would cross 300 but they added just 20 runs from the last five overs, losing four wickets in the process. Raina, Harbhjan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Jadeja fell in a heap towards the close.         
	For Sri Lanka, Chanaka Welegedara was the most successful bower with figures of five for 66 while his pace colleagues Thissara Perera and Thilan Thushara chipped in with two wickets each.

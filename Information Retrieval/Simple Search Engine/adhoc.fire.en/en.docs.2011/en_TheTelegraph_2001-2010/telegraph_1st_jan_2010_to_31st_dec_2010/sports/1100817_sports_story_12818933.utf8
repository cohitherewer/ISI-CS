The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pavin   doesnt   rule out Woods 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pavin   doesn't   rule out Woods 
                  Tiger Woods                                 
	Milwaukee: US captain Corey Pavin says Tiger Woods is high on his list to be one of his four picks for the Ryder Cup, without saying for sure he would take the worlds No.1 player.         
	Woods failed to finish among the top eight in the Ryder Cup standings who qualified for the American team. He tied for 28th at the PGA Championship.         
	Pavin does not have to announce his picks until September 7. That gives Woods at least one more tournament to show hes improving.         
	But for Bubba Watson, the disappointment of his playoff loss to Martin Kaymer in the PGA Championship didnt last long after his show earned him a spot at the Ryder Cup.         
	Dustin Johnson also secured one of the eight automatic spots for the Americans.         
	Phil Mickelson led the standings for the first time in his career, followed by Hunter Mahan, Watson, Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker, Jeff Overton and Matt Kuchar, who nailed down the final spot for the October 1-3 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor, Wales, when he tied for 10th at the PGA Championship. Woods needed to finish at least in the top five to make the team.           (AGENCIES)

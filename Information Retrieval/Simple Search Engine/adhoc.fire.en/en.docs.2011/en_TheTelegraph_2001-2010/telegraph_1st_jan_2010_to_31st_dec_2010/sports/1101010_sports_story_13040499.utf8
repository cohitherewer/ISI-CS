	New Delhi: Indias hopes of a gold medal in tennis just seems to be slipping away. Sania Mirza, who qualified for the womens singles final on Friday, had to settle for a Commonwealth Games (CWG) silver at the RK Khanna Stadium on Saturday.         
	Ultimately, it seemed as if the tennis draw was suitably drawn with the top-seeded Australian, Anastasia Rodionova, beating the second seed 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (3) in the womens singles final.         
	People often claim that rankings dont matter. But, maybe, they do at times. Sania, at 137 in the Womens Tennis Association chart, had the game and ability to defeat her much-higher ranked opponent (62), but a flurry of unforced errors and poor shots did her in on Saturday.         
	The home favourite failed to hold her serve even once during the first set. But things looked up in the second, when she changed her style of play to counter Russian-born Anastasias aggressive nature.         
	It proved to be a fantastic decision as Sania managed to break Anastasia at a very crucial time to go 2-1up.         
	It seemed to boost her confidence, as her forehands became razor sharp. She soon wrapped up the set with the scoreline reading 6-2.         
	As the third set began, Anastasia, who became an Australian citizen less than 12 months ago, looked determined for gold. She kept the pressure, forcing Sania to miss her signature shots.         
	However, the 23-year-old was not done. She clawed her way back and won three match points to equalise the score to 6-6. The gold medal decision boiled down to a tie-break then.         
	Though Sania tried her best, her forehands just refused to fall in place, and, very soon the Indian found herself at 3-6, on her serve in the tie-break.         
	It seemed the pressure was too much for Sania, as she finally settled for silver with a double fault.         
	Its never easy playing Sania, but Im consistent with my all-round game, said 28-year-old Anastasia, breathing a sigh of relief. She began her Commonwealth quest seeking three gold medals and shes already fulfilled one-third of it.         
	This is one of the biggest wins of my career, she said beaming. Im just happy to have made Australia proud.         
	In the bronze-medal play-off match, Australian Sally Peers got the better of compatriot Olivia Rogowska 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.         
	The day was simply not Sanias as, partnering Rushmi Chakravarthi, she lost the womens doubles semi-final too.         
	The Indian duo were humbled 4-6, 4-6 by the Australian team of Rodionova and Peers.         
	In the all-Indian bronze medal play-off match, top seeds Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi got the better off Rohan Bopanna and Somdev Dev Varman, the second seeds, 6-3, 7-6 (4).         
	Now, Indias gold-medal hopes only rest on Somdevs shoulders. Hope the Indian gets the better of Australias Greg Jones in the mens singles final on Sunday.

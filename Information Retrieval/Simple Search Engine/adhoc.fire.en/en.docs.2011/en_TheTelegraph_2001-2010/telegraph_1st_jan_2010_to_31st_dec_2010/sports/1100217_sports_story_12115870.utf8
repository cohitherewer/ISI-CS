                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni amp; Co. bowl over everyone
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Some of the celebrated sports personalities present at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday, praised the centuries by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and VVS Laxman.               
	Following is what some of them had to say               
	DEEP DASGUPTA: Todays situation was different from yesterday. Ill give credit to Amit Mishra, who not only scored some valuable runs but also consumed the first hour. The pressure was much less on Dhoni and Laxman after that. They were mentally free to play their shots. I would give a lot of credit to Dhoni as he scored the runs pretty quickly.         
	LEANDER PAES: A fabulous performance by Dhoni and his boys. I have always maintained Dhoni is a wonderful leader and he has again proved that by leading from the front. Four centuries from great cricketers. What more can you ask? Although I missed the century but I got to watch Dhoni and Laxman bat. It was a scintillating sight to see them hit the big South African fast bowlers hard. The deliveries seemed like big serves of Goran Ivanisevic. However, thats a softer ball and this one is a hard leather ball. The only one I missed on the field is Dada (Sourav Ganguly), who has been a great ambassador for Indian cricket.         
	KRISHNAMACHARI SRIKKANTH: An awesome performance by the boys. I am really proud of the manner in which they batted. Laxman has always been a special player and he has proved that again. Dhoni also played really well. Well, I missed the centuries of Sachin and Sehwag yesterday (Monday). Many people ask me whether I find my style in Sehwag. All I tell them is that he is 10 times better than what I was. Well, I am not going to predict whether well win inside four days, but Im pretty confident we would win this one convincingly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton charged over stunt

	Lewis Hamilton will not need to travel to Australia to answer charges of intentionally losing control of a vehicle after the date for his hearing was officially set for August 24, the week of the Belgian Grand Prix.         
	Hamilton, 25, was charged after being spotted doing burnouts and fishtails on a public road prior to the Australian Grand Prix in March and there were fears the McLaren driver, still in contention for the world championship title despite a frustrating season to date, might have to be present at Melbourne Magistrates Court just three days before practice for a European race.         
	However, it is understood that his punishment will amount to a small fine which can be paid by a local lawyer on his behalf.         
	Hamilton was pulled over by Melbourne police after doing some crowd-pleasing wheel skids, an offence known as hooning in Australia where it is taken extremely seriously, as he left the Albert Park circuit after Friday practice.         
	Although he was questioned at the time and his silver AMG Mercedes road car was impounded, it was unclear whether any official charges would be brought and plenty of people within the Formula One community were of the opinion that the whole episode was blown out of all proportion, including title rival Mark Webber who was critical of his home countrys nanny state.         
	Hamilton, though, was contrite. I was driving in an over-exuberant manner and, as a result, was stopped by the police, he said. What I did was silly, and I want to apologise for it.         
	Although he found support from Red Bulls Webber for a rash act off the tracks, there would be no favours exchanged in the race for the title.         
	Red Bull have started on pole in all six Grands Prix races this season and Webber led from start to finish ahead of teammate Sebastian Vettel for a one-two in Monaco.         
	The Red Bull pair now head the drivers standings on 78 points to lead Fernando Alonso and reigning world champion Jenson Button by three and eight points respectively.         
	But Hamilton, currently sitting seventh on the leaderboard, said: If they had also won every race they would be miles ahead by now so for us its quite good at the moment to see weve got a chance.

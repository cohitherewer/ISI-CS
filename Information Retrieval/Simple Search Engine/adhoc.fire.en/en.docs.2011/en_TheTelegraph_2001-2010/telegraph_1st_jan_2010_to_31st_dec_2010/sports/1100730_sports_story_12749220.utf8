The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India nose ahead in run fest
                                                                                                                       7                                        Team India nose ahead in run fest
                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Colombo,on Thursday                
	Colombo: Sachin Tendulkar slammed a monumental 203 and Suresh Raina notched up his maiden century as India surpassed Sri Lankas mammoth first innings total with a solid batting display in the second Test which seemed headed for a tame draw here today.         
	Tendulkar gave ample display of his class and stamina by anchoring the innings brilliantly as the visitors cruised to 669 for nine at close on the penultimate day in reply to Sri Lankas first innings total of 642 for four declared.         
	Debutant Raina, who came into the team as a replacement for the indisposed Yuvraj Singh,made the most of the opportunity by scoring 120 while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (76) was the other notable performer for the Indians.         
	Ishant Sharma (10) and last man Pragyan Ojha (0) were at the crease at stumps with India enjoying a slender lead of 27 runs.         
	With just one day left and the track at the Sinhalese Sports Club still playing easy, it is almost certain that the match will end in a draw. In Dhonis men can force a draw, they will maintain their status as the No. 1 Test team in the ICC rankings.         
	It was Tendulkar again who stole the spotlight on the penultimate day as he notched up his fifth double century and featured in a 256-run partnership for the fifth wicket with debutant Raina which proved to be the backbone of Indias resistance. The champion batsman was a picture of concentration as he steered India to safety with a masterly knock which spanned almost four sessions.         
	Overnight 382 for four, India needed 61 more runs to avoid the follow on at the start of play Thursday, and it did not seem to be much of a problem with Tendulkar and Raina batting confidently.         
	Raina became the 12th debutant century-maker for India. He did well to drill a short-pitched Dilhara Fernando delivery between extra cover and mid off for boundary to get to his hundred.         
	Dammika Prasad rattled Tendulkar with a short-pitched delivery which hit the maestros helmet and raced to the boundary. The 256-run partnership between Tendulkar and Raina was brought to an end by Ajantha Mendis, much to the relief of the hosts.

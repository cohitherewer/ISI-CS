	Centurion: South Australia Redbacks beat Highveld Lions by 11 runs in the Champions League Twenty20 tournament on Sunday with Shaun Tait taking three for 36 and captain Michael Klinger hitting 78 from 48 balls.         
	The Lions finished at 167 for eight, chasing Redbacks 178 for six. Lions captain Robin Petersen scored 56 from 35 balls.         
	Australia fast bowler Tait dismissed the Lions Jonathan Vandiar in the first over and followed up with the wickets of Werner Coetsee and Robert Frylinck at the close of the Group B match at SuperSport Park, near Pretoria. Daniel Christian took two for 30 off four overs and spinner Aaron Brien got one for 32.         
	Klinger hit five sixes and six fours, and shared a 97-run partnership with Callum Ferguson (47) after the Redbacks had started slowly in their first match of the competition after being asked to bat by Petersen.         
	The pair combined for a 97-run partnership in under 10 overs. Ferguson hit seven fours in his 47 from 27 balls.         
	Tait gave Redbacks the perfect start by beating Vandiar for pace with the fourth ball of the Lion innings, knocking down the left-handers stumps.         
	Vaughn van Jaarsfelds promotion to number three failed for the Johannesburg team as he fell for just eight. Richard Cameron blasted two sixes and a four, and then got carried away against Brien to be stumped by Graham Manou for 17 from 10 balls.         
	Only Lions skipper Petersen was on form, bringing up his half century off 32 balls with a six over extra cover.         
	But the Redbacks were in charge, taking wickets at regular intervals through Tait, medium pacer Christian and Brien.         
	Petersen departed to Christian soon after guiding the Lions past 100, and the innings fell away. Neil McKenzie and Zander de Bruyn were both run out, McKenzie by a throw from the boundary from Gary Putland.         
	With the Lions falling well behind the required run rate, Tait tempted Coetsee into a pull to square leg where he was caught by Daniel Harris.           (AGENCIES)

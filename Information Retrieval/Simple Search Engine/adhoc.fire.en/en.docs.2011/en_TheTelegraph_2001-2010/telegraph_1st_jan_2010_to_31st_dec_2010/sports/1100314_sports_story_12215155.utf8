            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal played a 1-1 draw with Mahindra United in a 16th round I-League encounter, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	After a goalless first half, Mehtab Hossain, in the 65th minute, latched on to a loose ball and unleashed a goal-bound shot. Mahindra keeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury didnt expect the shot to be within the framework and initially didnt attend the shot. However, on realising the danger, he tried to make amends but the ball, by then, had hit the far post and gone in.         
	For Mahindra, forward Mohammed Rafi pulled one back nine minutes later.

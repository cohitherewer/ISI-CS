The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dont mess with Messi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dont mess with Messi
            ANSHUMAN ROY              Lionel Messi                           
	Some six years back Fabio Capello, who was at the helm of Juventus at the time, had a request for the then Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard. Give me this kid on loan. Well this kid that the present England coach was referring to was none other than Lionel Messi.         
	First time I saw him was during a pre-season friendly against Barcelona. He was doing things on the field which not many would have dared to do even during training sessions, Capello later said.         
	That was 2004. Now, two Champions League medals and four La Liga titles later, Messi is showcasing his mesmerising skills at the, what do they call it, the biggest show on earth.                     Player of the week,Lionel Messi
      
	And if the first seven days is seen as the morning, then the day will be very bright for Messi and Argentina at the 2010 World Cup. Unless, of course, like it has happened since 1994, Argentina flatter to deceive once again. His performance against Nigeria and South Korea was just awesome as the Argentine No.10 toyed with his rivals.         
	The most enduring moment of this seven days will be Messi first getting rid of a Korean defender with a deft touch and then making a feint which left three of his markers dead.         
	What followed was more audacious. A delectable chip which missed the target by a whisker! It didnt miss the lensman who captured the image of a host of defenders flummoxed and Messi about to chip the ball.         
	Something similar to what we saw in 1982 with Diego Armando Maradona holding onto the ball and six Belgian players waiting for the unexpected!         
	Messi has yet to score at the World Cup, but that wont worry Argentina. He had a hand in three of the four goals on Wednesday and, against Nigeria, had Vincent Enyeama not come up with an out-of-the-world performance, he would have got at least three.         
	His impact in these seven days has been so huge that even the cynics are praying for him to stay in South Africa till July 11.         
	Messis detractors say he is not as dangerous for Argentina as he is for Barcelona. They have a point since Messis record for the national team hasnt been that impressive.         
	But then a meeting with Maradona in April might have had an effect on him. He was told that he would be the fulcrum of an Argentina team filled with some dazzling talents.         
	As Maradona himself said about the meeting: He is no longer Leo, he is now Messi. I have a Rolls Royce and Messi will drive that in South Africa. Its a profound statement, which announced the coming of age of both the master and his heir.         
	Till then, Maradona was seen as a coach who did not have a clue as to what was happening in the team and Messi was seen as someone who leaned more towards his club than country.         
	So, we now see Messi playing a more dominant role in the Argentine line-up like he does for Barcelona. He is getting more touches on the ball, and suddenly Argentina are looking like potential champions.         
	These seven days havent been good for stars. Thank God there is at least one who is living up to expectations. We need Messi to enthral us like he is. Otherwise, the coming days wont be that bright for his millions of fans.

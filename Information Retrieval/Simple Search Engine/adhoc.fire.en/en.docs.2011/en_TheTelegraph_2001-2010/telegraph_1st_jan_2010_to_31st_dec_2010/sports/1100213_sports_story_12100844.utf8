The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough job for Portsmouth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tough job for Portsmouth
                      
	London: Portsmouth have an opportunity to shift attention away from their financial woes when they meet south coast rivals Southampton in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday.         
	The 2008 Cup winners are bottom of the Premier League and fighting a winding-up order over an unpaid tax bill.         
	The bitter rivals meet for the first time since Southampton were relegated from the Premier League in 2005 and Saturdays derby is given added piquancy because the hosts are recovering from near financial meltdown themselves.         
	After losing their Premier League status, Southampton spent four seasons in the Championship (second division) but were relegated last season and started this campaign in League One with a 10-point penalty for going into administration.         
	Despite that handicap, Southampton are comfortably placed in mid-table and would be challenging for a playoff place but for the points deduction.         
	FA Cup holders Chelsea should advance against Championship Cardiff City at Stamford Bridge, although they will be without their captain John Terry who has been given time off to sort out his off-field problems.         
	There are two all-Premier League clashes between Manchester City and Stoke City and Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur. (Reuters)

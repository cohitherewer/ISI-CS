The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I felt very nervous: Henin
                                                                                                                       7                                        I felt very nervous: Henin

	Paris: Justine Henin hopes of a fifth French Open title have been ended with a fourth round defeat to Sam Stosur.         
	The Belgian, who won three consecutive titles from 2005 to 2007 before an 18-month period in retirement, was beaten 2-6, 6-1, 6-4, by Australian Stosur.         
	I just wanted so much that the adventure could keep going, she said.         
	But after taking a 4-3 lead in the final set against the No. 7-seeded Stosur, Henin showed signs of nerves and was betrayed by her elegant backhand.         
	Serving at 4-all, the Belgian double-faulted to reach break point, then yanked a backhand wide. In the final game she pushed three backhands into the net, including a potential put away on the first point.         
	My nerves were simply not strong enough today, said Henin, forced to play for a fifth consecutive day because of weather interruptions.         
	I felt very nervous, very upset, which is normally not the way I am. Maybe today I was feeling some nervous fatigue. Maybe that nervous fatigue prevented me from seeing things in a calmer way. quot;         
	In the final two sets, Stosur had a 20-8 edge in winners and converted four of five break-point chances. I knew what I had to do, she said. I kept going for it and I believed in myself.         
	As for that double-fault on the next-to-last point? I just tried to shake it off and tried to have a laugh at myself, not worry about it and get the next one in, Stosur said.         
	The 26-year-old Stosur has won 18 matches on clay this year, the most on the womens tour.         
	She was a Roland Garros semi-finalist last year and is ranked a career-best No. 7  the highest ranking for an Australian-born woman since Wendy Turnbull in 1985.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Will be a new experience: Akram
            A STAFF REPORTER            Wasim Akram at a city hotel on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram reached town Thursday evening to attend the eight-day Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) camp for domestic cricketers that is scheduled to start Friday. He arrived from Lahore via New Delhi and despite the travelling, one of crickets all-time greats was kind enough to spare some time for the waiting media.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	Thoughts on the camp         
	It will be a new experience for me. This is the first time I am working with an Indian Premier League franchise and I am looking forward to it. I am excited to work with youngsters.         
	His role as a consultant         
	Basically, I will be grooming the youngsters. Giving them tips to improve their bowling wherever I feel it necessary. I have always enjoyed working with youngsters.         
	Working with Sourav Ganguly and Dav Whatmore         
	We (Sourav and I) have played against each other many times. But for the first time we will be working towards a common goal. He is a close friend of mine. His knowledge of the game is immense. It will be quite an experience for sure. As to Whatmore, he is one of the best in the business. A great thinker.         
	His take on KKRs performances till date         
	I dont think KKR performed poorly in the first edition. They just lost a bit of the momentum in the latter part of the tournament. Yeah, the second was a disaster. But this team has managed to sort out the problems. Sourav now has a clear idea about who will be doing what. So, this time I think there wont be any confusion. The KKR of 2010 will be a totally different proposition.         
	Pakistans loss in the Sydney Test         
	I was shocked. I was in Lahore watching the match on TV. At stumps on Day IV, we were some 80-odd runs ahead and needed two wickets. I thought that on the final day, Pakistan will take those two in the first half-an-hour and chase down say 100 runs. But I was shocked to see them letting Australia off the hook. A target of 176 was always difficult to chase... And my worst fears came true.         
	Whether the Pakistan batsmen could have done better         
	Yeah. They just didnt apply themselves. Test cricket is more about the craft, not flamboyance. Our batsmen went for extravagant shots and paid the price. They didnt know that batting in a five-day match and Twenty20 are as different as chalk and cheese. It was madness...         
	The reaction in Pakistan         
	Kamran Akmal has drawn a lot of flak. Those dropped catches pegged us back. He should have done better. Theres a lot of criticism.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Boards decision not to send Younis Khan Down Under         
	I am really surprised with that. Its a mystery to me.

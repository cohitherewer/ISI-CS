            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Fabiano after scoring his first goal, in Johannesburg, on Sunday. (Reuters)      
	Johannesburg: Brazil defeated Ivory Coast 3-1 in a scrappy World Cup Group G match on Sunday. The victory took the five-time champions into the tournaments second round.         
	Luis Fabiano scored two goals and Elano added another before Didier Drogba pulled one back for Ivory Coast.         
	The match turned ugly towards the end with players of both teams failing to keep their cool. Kaka was sent off in the 88th minute after a second booking for elbowing an Ivory Coast player.         
	A brilliant goal by Fabiano in the 25th minute put Brazil ahead .         
	It was superb finishing by the Sevilla striker after Kaka rode a couple of tackles on the edge of the Ivory Coast box and put Fabiano through. The shot beat goalkeeper Boubacar Barry on the near post and walloped into the roof of the net.         
	Fabiano added the second in the 50th, beating Siaka Tiene and shooting past Barry. Replays appeared to show Fabiano handled the ball, possibly twice, on the second goal.         
	Elano scored in the 62nd minute.         
	The match did not rise to any great heights in the first session despite all the hype it generated for the past couple of days here. The stands were full hours before the start of the match and thousands of people could still be seen looking for tickets outside the Soccer City.         
	On Saturday, Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar said he expected their African rivals to play an open game. The early signs, on the contrary, were not all that encouraging.         
	Ivory Coast were dropping all ten men back into their own half whenever they lost the ball, just as they did against Portugal. It was the most anticipated match of the first round and Ivory Coast were considered one of Africas brightest hopes. But they could hardly live upto their promise.         
	Equally disappointing was Didier Drogba, the Ivory Coast captain and the star of the show. Allowed by Fifa, the Chelsea striker took the field with a cast around his fractured arm but couldnt make an impact in the first 45 minutes.         
	The first time Drogba could be spotted on the field was when there was a tussle between Drogba and Lucio on the left and the referee awarded a free kick in favour of the African team. Emmanuel Eboue took the free kick but Cesar was alert under the bar to punch the ball away. A couple of minutes earlier, Drogba hit another free kick over the bar.         
	Brazils plans were going in the right direction in the first half. They wanted to snatch full points from this match, which would assure them a place in the second round before their showdown with Portugal in Durban.         
	Unlike the first match against Portugal, Sven-Goran Erikksons Ivory Coast looked tactically unimpressive. They lined up a 4-3-3 formation but that did not prove to be productive and there was less balance between defence and attack.         
	Ivory Coast had a half chance in the 37th minute when Aruna Dindane had the ball inside the rival box. All he managed was to do was hit a defender.         
	A lot was said about Kakas form and fitness and there was a big debate whether the former World Player of Year should be replaced in the first eleven. Despite all this, Dunga kept his faith on Kaka.         
	To say the player was at his best would be wrong but the Real Madrid star produced glimpses of his form occasionally and even played a big role behind the first goal.

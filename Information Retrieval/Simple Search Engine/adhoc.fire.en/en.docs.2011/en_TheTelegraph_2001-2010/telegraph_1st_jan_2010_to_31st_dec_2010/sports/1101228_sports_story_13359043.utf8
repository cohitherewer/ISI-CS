                                                                                                                       7                                        Ive tried to learn from achievers 
  - Roger Federer, Tiger Woods have inspired Dale Steyn       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dale Steyn in Durban, on Monday. (Getty Images)                                 
	Durban: Dale Steyn doesnt wish to be a hero on every ball, but hes almost turning out to be one.         
	On Sunday evening, after a media conference, the wrecker-in-chief (14 wickets so far in the series) took a few questions exclusively from The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His role model(s)         
	No one person, really... Ive drawn inspiration from the biggest performers... Roger Federer, Tiger Woods... Ive tried to learn from the achievers.         
	Inspiration in cricket...         
	Like Ive pointed out, no one person... But, yes, I found Brett Lee impressive and one could learn from him.         
	Approach to life         
	I try and listen to as many people as possible and, then, try and absorb the better things. I see myself as a listener and a learner.         
	Importance of speed         
	Isnt everything.               
	Now, excerpts from the media conference               
	Bowling in Centurion and bowling at Kingsmead         
	Much the same... That Graeme (Smith) decided to again field shows the confidence he has in his bowlers... It gets down to the basics and Graeme has, indeed, been setting good fields.         
	Lonwabo Tsotsbe getting two wickets and taking a brilliant catch off his bowling to send back V.V.S. Laxman...         
	He bowled nicely and will be a part of this attack for some time to come... Yes, he took his first catch in Tests... Id say I had only three wickets and one was his. There have, of course, been times when he goes off to sleep!         
	Getting cramps in the groin region         
	Im fine now... For the first time, the physio (Brandon Jackson) told me I was over-hydrated.         
	Lastly, on being the bowler he is         
	(Laughs) Im lucky... I dont try to be a hero on every ball, but do what the captain wants me to.

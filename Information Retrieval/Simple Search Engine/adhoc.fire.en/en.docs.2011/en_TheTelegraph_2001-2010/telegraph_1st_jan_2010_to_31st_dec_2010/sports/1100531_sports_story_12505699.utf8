                                                                                                                       7                                                                                                        
	London: Barely six months before the Ashes, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) finds itself in a pay dispute with star players, including skipper Andrew Strauss, who are unhappy with the new central contracts tabled last October.     
	The English players are concerned about the payments they would receive during the rest period since the board has a squad rotation policy. The players salaries are incentivised by appearance fee and win bonuses under the current payment system, which means a player who is rested will see his income dwindle.        
	New Delhi: Breaking a 44-year-old tradition, Queen Elizabeth II will skip the Commonwealth Games in Delhi but the Organising Committee for the event said they were okay with it. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the Queen had a tight autumn schedule which makes it impossible for her to visit Delhi for the October 3-14 Games. Prince Charles will represent the royal family in India.        
	Madrid: Briton Luke Donald claimed a first Tour victory in four years at the Madrid Masters on Sunday after finally shaking off the challenge of Rhys Davies with an eagle at the 16th. Donald led from start to finish, closing with a five-under-par 67 for a 267 total, a stroke better than fellow-Briton Davies (68) who stuck with him almost to the last.        
	Istanbul: Formula One is hopeful of making a decision on next seasons tyre supplier in the coming days, after failing to reach an agreement at the Turkish Grand Prix. Current supplier Bridgestone is abandoning the sport at the end of the season. Pirelli and Michelin are the front-runners to replace the Japanese company, which has been the sports sole supplier since 2007.        
	London: Tottenham Hotspur have announced that Luka Modric has signed a new six-year deal to stay at White Hart Lane until 2016. The 24-year-old Croatia midfielder has been rewarded for playing a major part in Tottenham finishing fourth in the Premier League to capture a spot in next seasons Champions League.        
	Milan: Lecce and Cesena were promoted to Serie A on Sunday after climbing out of the troubled second tier of Italian football on the final day of the regular season. Brescia had to settle for third after a 2-1 defeat at Padova and will now enter a four-team playoff with Sassuolo, Torino and Cittadella to determine the third and final promotion spot. Atalanta, Siena and Livorno were relegated from Serie A earlier this month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India tighten grip on No.1 spot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team India tighten grip on No.1 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa slipped further behind in their quest to regain the No. 1 spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship as a result of drop in their ratings points.         
	The Proteas loss has only strengthened Indias position at the top.         
	The only way Graeme Smiths men, ranked No. 2, can go to the top now is if Bangladesh beat No. 1 ranked India in the two-Test series, which started in Chittagong on Sunday.         
	South Africa had entered the series against fifth-placed England on 122 ratings points, trailing India by two points.         
	But after the four-Test series ended in a one-all draw in Johannesburg on Sunday, South Africa have dropped to 120 ratings points.         
	England, on the other hand, have gained two ratings points and now have 107 ratings points.         
	South Africa, who conceded their No. 1 spot to India on December 6, could have regained the top spot if it had beaten England by 2-0 or better.         
	Such is the gap in the ratings points between India and Bangladesh that even if India win the series 1-0, it will drop to 123 ratings points while a 1-1 draw in the series will put them alongside South Africa on 120 ratings point but ahead of the Proteas by a fraction of a point.         
	If Bangladesh win the series 1-0, India will drop to 117 ratings points while in case of a 0-2 series loss, they will slip to 116 points.

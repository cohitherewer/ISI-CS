                                                                                                                       7                                      Im playing for the love of it: Sachin
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Centurion: Sachin Tendulkar, who seems to defy age and time, added another feather to his crown of achievements as he created history by notching up his 50th Test hundred on Sunday.         
	Sachins entry was necessitated after Dale Steyn removed nightwatchman Ishant Sharma and the maestros handling of the Proteas pacers exuded a different level of confidence altogether.         
	India have a tendency to produce their best when the chips are down and even though the top-order showed the intent, Sachin executed it to perfection flailing the likes of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel.         
	When the moment arrived, the Little Master was not overtly ebullient but a pump of the fists and hands outstretched towards the sky marked a small celebration.         
	For a man, who has scored 49 Test hundreds, the number 50 wasnt significant in terms of the numerical value. Sachin was on a mission to save the first Test, which was gradually slipping out of Indias control.         
	The Little Masters professionalism came to the fore when he said after the days play: It was extremely important for us to comeback strong and send a strong message. And I think we have been able to do that. Its (the 50th Test hundred) just another number for me.         
	I am happy but I dont know how to express it. Its good that it has come. Hopefully, it doesnt stop and just continues.         
	I am playing for the love of it. If I were chasing records, I wouldnt have missed those one-day matches in between. Its about producing quality cricket, and thats what I want to do, he added.         
	The adrenaline goes up for millions of his fans who watch Sachin walk out to bat. And the maestro said he considers it his duty to do something special for his country.         
	Every time I go out, the country needs me. Its important for me anytime to go out and do something special.         
	And my frame of mind is such that in every innings I want to go out and score runs. There hasnt been a match where I have said that, fine, if I get out early, its ok. I have never thought like that. Its this hunger that keeps one going. I am glad that its still there in me, Sachin said.         
	The series between the two Test sides has plenty of sub-plots, the most interesting being the contest between Dale Steyn and Sachin Tendulkar.         
	While Steyn rattled the visitors top order in the first innings, Sachin played aggressively against the Proteas pacer in Indias second essay. Its difficult to get under Sachins skin and even though the South African pacers tried to unsettle him with snorters, the Master Blaster negotiated them with ease.         
	Asked if the contest with Steyn reminded him of his debut Test against Pakistan, Sachin said: Such things keep happening on the field. I am a sort of a person who likes to keep everything on the field and once off the field we are friends again. I would like to keep it that way.         
	In the first Test I played way back in 1989 against Pakistan, there were three world-class bowlers (Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Abdul Qadir), and the fourth one (Waqar Younis) was starting his career. Later on, Waqar went on to become one of the greatest fast bowlers.         
	It was challenging and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also learnt a lot on that tour. Whenever I have played them later on, it has always been a fantastic contest.         
	Sachin refused to give any excuse for Indias poor start in the series.         
	I wouldnt want to use it (losing the toss) as an excuse. Definitely, the conditions were different on the first day and not only me, but both teams will agree on that.         
	Had we won the toss the match could have been different, who knows. At this level, one cant make excuses. Thats how I look at things, he said.

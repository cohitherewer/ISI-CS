The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Doctor reveals French secret
                                                                                                                       7                                      Doctor reveals French secret
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	France's battered football reputation has been dealt a new blow with claims from a former national team doctor that several players provided suspect blood samples just before their 1998 World Cup win.         
	In an interview in a daily French newspaper, on the day before his book The Implosion is due to be released, Dr Jean-Pierre Paclet lifted the lid on what he claims is an open secret.         
	Blood tests revealed anomalies for several Bleus just before the 1998 World Cup, he said. You can have strong suspicions when you know the clubs where certain players played.         
	Its public knowledge that there were practices which were borderline, to say the least, Dr Paclet added.         
	Dr Paclet, the France team doctor from 2004 to 2008, continued: Ive invented nothing. Having a high hematocrit level did not prove that they took Erythropoietin. As there was no proof we didnt bother them.         
	He added: Reasons of State carried the day. It was stronger than everything else. In addition that year (economic) growth was at stake for the country... Nevertheless it cant be said that if we had pursued the tests we would have found proof.         
	The claims heap further misery on French football following a summer in which the team were humiliated at the World Cup amid a revolt for which the entire squad was suspended, while a number of players were also involved in an under-age call-girl scandal.         
	Dr Jean-Marcel Ferret, the France team doctor at the time of their 1998 World Cup triumph, said he was flabbergasted by the new allegations.         
	We found nothing, he told the French daily. There were two slight anomalies concerning the level of hematocrit. But they were linked to tiredness from the league. Nobody forced me to do anything. My conscience is clear.         
	Meanwhile, France midfielder Franck Ribery will not appeal the decision by the French Football Federation (FFF) to ban him for three matches for his role in the revolt, the players lawyer said on Wednesday.         
	Ribery was one of four players banned this month after the France squad boycotted a training session in South Africa in support of striker Nicolas Anelka, who was banished from the team for insulting then coach Raymond Domenech.         
	Franck Ribery, even though he regards the sanction taken against him by the disciplinary commission (of the FFF) as unfounded and unfair, has decided not to appeal, his lawyer, Jean-Didier Lange, said in a statement.         
	Anelka was banned for 18 France matches, World Cup captain Patrice Evra for five, Ribery for three and Jeremy Toulalan for one. A fifth player, Eric Abidal, had also been summoned by the FFF but he escaped without sanction.         
	Evra is the only player so far to have said he would appeal.

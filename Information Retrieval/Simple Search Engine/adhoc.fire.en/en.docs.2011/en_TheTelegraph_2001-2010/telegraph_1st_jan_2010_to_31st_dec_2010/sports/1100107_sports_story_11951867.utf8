The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan looking to buck trend
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bagan looking to buck trend
  - Karims boys have mental edge vs Churchill         A STAFF REPORTER            Edeh Chidi and Jose Ramirez Barreto at the Mohun Bagan ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa should be a happy man; after all he has an opportunity to get even with Churchill Brothers when the sides meet in the I-League on Thursday. And whats more, the controversy involving the Goan clubs skipper Okolie Odafe means Bagan go into the match more composed and focused than the defending champions.         
	Odafe , Ogba Kalu and Arindam Bhattacharya, and other team members had a harrowing time in Mumbai and obviously they would not be in the right frame of mind.         
	It goes without saying that Churchill reached the city exhausted by the events of Tuesday. With players still shaken by the incident, Churchills Brazilian coach Carlos Pareira decided to do without the usual pre-match training session. Instead, the players did some light stretching in the hotel.         
	An ideal chance to tighten the noose around the league leaders. But the million-dollar question is whether Bencharifas boys have it in them to turn the heat on the Goan outfit.         
	Statistically, only three points separate the two sides. Churchill have 16 points from eight games while Bagan, who are placed fifth, have 13 from eigth outings.         
	In the current season, the green-and-maroon brigades defence has failed to solve the Odafe riddle.         
	On the couple of occasions the two have met this season, Odafe has netted four goals, including a hattrick in the Durand Cup final. The fourth goal came in the 2-0 triumph in the IFA Shield final last year.         
	However, this time the Bagan fans would be hoping that, for once, Odafe leaves his scoring shoes behind. As it is, the Nigerians mind would be cluttered and the Bagan back-four can expect a tension free day at office. Bencharifa, for one, would like it that way; the Moroccan coach admitted that his back-four has been a real problem.         
	You have to realise that I didnt get the services of N.S. Manju and N. Mohanraj. Ive always had a problem in organising my back-four. However, I dont want to take any credit away from Sagram Mandi and Sheikh Azim, both of whom have done really well for us, Bencharifa said on the eve of the match.

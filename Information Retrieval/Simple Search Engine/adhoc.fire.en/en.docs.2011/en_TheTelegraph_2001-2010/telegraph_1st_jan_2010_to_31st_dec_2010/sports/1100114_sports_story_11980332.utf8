	Melbourne: World No. 3 Novak Djokovic and US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro kicked off their Australian Open preparations with easy first-round wins at the Kooyong Classic in Melbourne on Wednesday.         
	Del Potro cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Croatian Ivan Ljubicic, before Serbian Djokovic made light work of experienced German Tommy Haas 6-2, 6-3 at the eight-man invitational event.         
	Despite blustery conditions at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, Del Potro was in fine touch for his first hit-out of the season, although he may hope for tougher encounters this week after Ljubicic repeatedly gifted him key points with unforced errors.         
	The weather conditions were tough, a lot of wind, Del Potro told reporters. I returned very good, I served very good so thats important for this kind of match, this kind of surface. Its a good victory in the beginning of the season, of course.         
	After breaking the 24th-ranked Croatian in the opening game, Del Potro cracked two forehand winners to set up two set points at 5-3, and was duly handed the set when his opponent double-faulted.         
	Ljubicic raised his game after conceding an early break in the second, but fluffed a chance to break back later and eventually succumbed after saving three match points.         
	The 30-year-old Ljubicic, who took Roger Federers place after the world No. 1 elected to skip his usual Australian Open warm-up, was upbeat about the loss despite spending most of the time between points frowning with his head bowed.         
	It wasnt all that bad actually. Probably the most disappointing thing is that I didnt feel bad at all and I still lost 6-3, 6-3, he said.         
	The 2008 Australian Open champion and top seed Djokovic needed less than an hour to defeat 18th-ranked Haas, racing to a one-set lead after breaking the German early and then carrying the momentum into the second.         
	The 22-year-old Serbian, who eschewed season-starting tournaments in the Middle East, appeared in top fitness after coming off high-intensity training camps in the Italian Alps and the Middle East.         
	Djokovic may face more of a work-out in the semi-final against Spanish world number nine Fernando Verdasco, who defeated Chilean Fernando Gonzalez 7-5, 6-1 in an occasionally farcical match later on Wednesday.         
	Verdasco, who made his presence felt in the very first game by cannoning a first serve into his opponents crotch, was taken to 5-5 before the Chilean appeared to self-destruct, conceding the first break and set in a hail of unforced errors.         
	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga will take on Del Potro in the other semi-final after dismantling Robin Soderling 7-6, 6-1.         
	The hard-hitting Frenchman crushed the Swedish world No. 8 7-0 in the tiebreaker and sealing the match with an ace.           (REUTERS)

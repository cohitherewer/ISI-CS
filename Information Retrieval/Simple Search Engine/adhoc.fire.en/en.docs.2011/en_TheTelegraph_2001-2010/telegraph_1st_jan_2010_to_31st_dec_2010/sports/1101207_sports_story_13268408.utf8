                            Asian Cup preparation in shambles
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With only a day left for preliminary registration of players for the Asian Cup in January, the Indian preparation seems to be in shambles at the moment. According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, nearly dozen players in the 31-strong contingent in Dubai are, at present, carrying injuries and could be out of action for longer periods.         
	So much so, the federation, on national coach Bob Houghtons insistence, may now be forced to send additional reinforcement of another six players to Dubai. Since the AFC rule permits all participating nations to register 50 players initially, another 10 to 12 players could be added to the list to be submitted on Tuesday.         
	Today (Monday) morning, we received a report from the team physio in Dubai stating 11 players are nursing injuries, said AIFF general secretary Kushal Das. We are worried with the development. The team doctor has returned home and we are planning to send an experienced doctor immediately to join the team, Das said, adding he hoped the players would be fit in the next few weeks.         
	Our Asian Cup dream is likely to end in a nightmare, said another senior AIFF official. The entire Goal 2011 project cost us more than Rs 16 crore. But after doing so much, the team has conceded 27 goals in their last nine friendlies with seven defeats.         
	The spate of injuries, however, remains the most worrying factor. While leading players like Bhaichung Bhutia, Sunil Chetri and Samir Naik have not recovered in many weeks, several other players like Govin Singh, Mohan Raj, Steven Dias and NP Pradeep have suffered injuries during the camp.         
	But what has happened with the goalkeepers remains the biggest mystery. While Subroto Paul played in most of the matches, the two reserve goalkeepers  Subhasis Roy Chowdhury and Arindam Bhattacharya  suffered injuries. Houghton first asked the AIFF to send Jagroop Singh as a replacement and when the AIFF XI player returned home to play I-League, Gurpreet Sandhu was sent to Dubai. Now, Houghton is believed to have asked the federation to send another senior goalkeeper.         
	Though no AIFF official is ready to come on record, serious resentments have been brewing up against the coach among the top functionaries. Houghton, they feel, has taken the AIFF for a ride. Everything was done as per Houghtons advice, said an AIFF official on condition of anonymity. The coach should now explain why there are so many unfit players in the team after months of training in Portugal and Dubai.

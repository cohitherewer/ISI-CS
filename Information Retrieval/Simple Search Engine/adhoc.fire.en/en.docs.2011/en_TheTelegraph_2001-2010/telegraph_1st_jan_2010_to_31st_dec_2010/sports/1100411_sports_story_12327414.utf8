	Augusta: Saturday dawned clear and bright for the third round of the Masters, and the committee that sets up the course at Augusta National Golf Club served notice to the field that anyone who expected to make a run at the lead  or to hang on to it  had better be ready to play their golf balls around the greens.         
	With the breezes blowing out of the northwest, as they did on Friday when the course played more than a shot harder than it did on Thursday, the pins were set in some challenging spots right from the start.         
	The back left pin at No. 1, eight paces from the left edge, produced a double bogey and triple bogey from early starters, and few were able to birdie the par-5 second hole, where the pin is tightly tucked behind the front left bunker.         
	With a stroke average of 4.6, the second hole has yielded the most birdies (41) and has so far been the easiest of the 18 holes, but the pin placement will make it difficult to get close to the hole to jump-start a round with an early eagle.         
	This will come as no surprise to the leaders, who will be expecting the course to firm up with a second consecutive day of high skies and breezes.         
	By the time the leaders go off, the greens will be running at about 12 on the Stimpmeter and only the crispest of iron shots will be holding on the firm greens.         
	In all, the holes have been cut five paces or fewer from the edges of seven of the greens, including Nos. 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16 and 18.         
	And where else but Augusta National would a 440-yard, par-4 hole with no water and no greenside bunkers rate as the toughest on the course? That is the case with the 14th hole, where the 30-yard-wide, sloped and undulating green brings three- and four-putts into the equation and where on Friday the co-leader Lee Westwood made a double bogey to tarnish his round down the stretch.         
	Among the leaders, Westwood has been the best ball-striker in the tournament so far, hitting 29 of 36 greens in regulation to tie for first. There was a time when a double bogey might have derailed him, but he showed his maturity on Friday by bouncing back with a birdie after the double. In fact, until he ran out of holes after bogeying 18, he bounced back with a birdie after each time he played a hole over par.         
	Im a lot more patient and mature than I used to be, Westwood said. I know not to panic now when things go wrong. You know, everybody out there is going to have the odd mistake. Its just minimising those mistakes and bouncing back from them.         
	The player who can do that best will be the player who leads after what promises to be another challenging day .         
	On Friday, though, the tough old golf course awoke in a bad mood. The gloves came off, the scores went up and things got serious.         
	The top of the leader board was ceded by the 50-year-old Fred Couples and the 60-year-old Tom Watson, who yielded to the years and a couple of tough Britons. Ian Poulter and Westwood have been pounding on the major championship door for the last few years, and on Friday they each stuck a foot inside.         
	Poulter shot his second straight 68. Westwood added a 69 to his opening 67, and they are tied at eight-under-par 136.         
	Tiger Woods led a group of five players that included Phil Mickelson tied for third place, two strokes behind the leaders. Woods, who shot 70, is casting a longer shadow than the tallest pine in Amen Corner.         
	Three years ago, Poulter told a golf magazine that when he finally reached his potential, it would be just him and Tiger dominating the landscape. After winning the W.G.C.-Accenture Match Play Championship in Tucson this year, his first win in the United States, he has reached his potential, and if he were to win the Masters, he would be right behind you-know-who.         
	Sure, if I win this week, Ill probably go No. 2, which would be lovely, Poulter said with a smile. So I guess its a work in progress. Im working towards that. So, well see.         
	Westwood, who finished a stroke behind at the United States Open at Torrey Pines in 2008 and a stroke out of the playoff at the 2009 British Open at Turnberry, now has the confident mien of a player who realises just how good he is.         
	I know my games up to the level it has to be, said the 36-year-old Westwood. My long games always been up to it and now I feel my short game is, as well, not that I had to use it too much today.         
	It is not bragging when you can do it, and had Westwood not made one of his few bad swings of the day on the tee at the 14th  setting up a double-bogey six  he would have had the lead alone.         
	 The Italian amateur Matteo Manassero, 16, became the youngest player in the history of the tournament to make the cut. Demonstrating his mettle, Manassero made a 4-foot downhill slider at the 18th hole to close out his 76.         
	Im very proud of this, Manassero said, because Ive always been a player that played very straight and regular and miss some important putts.         
	Mickelson said he thought the course was made more difficult by some of the nasty hole positions that greeted the players, along with a cool breeze out of the northeast and a high, bright sky.         
	I thought the pin placements were as lot more difficult and I knew it was going to be a lot harder to shoot in the 60s because it was going to be tough to get to them, Mickelson said, adding that he  like most strong players  likes the conditions hard and fast.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting thumped Calcutta Customs 5-0 in a CFL Premier Division match on Friday.         
	Anupam Sarkar scored the first goal in the 36th minute, heading in a Edu corner, and after the change of ends, Mohammedan Sporting banged in three in a space of four minutes through Bapi Choudhury (second and fourth) and Dipendu Biswas (third). Substitute Nilendra Dewan scored the fifth.         
	In the 57th minute the goalkeeper failed to clear a loose ball and hit straight to Bapi Choudhury. The under-19 midfielder recovered well and slotted it home before Das could retreat.         
	Then came an Edu through from the middle and Dipendu volleyed it home past an onrushing Das.         
	The fourth came when the Customs keeper failed to collect an innocuous cross from Bijoy Das. Choudhury made no mistake in slotting it home.         
	The fifth and the final came when Nilendra made his way through the Customs defence and his powerful grounder did not give substitute goalkeeper Rana Choudhury any chance.

  - Amla is No.2 after sensational show in Test series       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag Friday rose to the top the ICC Test rankings for batsmen after his two consecutive hundreds in the just concluded India-South Africa series.         
	Sehwag toppled compatriot Gautam Gambhir from the top position and now has 863 points. Gambhir has slipped to fifth slot with 824 points.         
	Sehwag smashed a quick-fire 165 in the first innings of the Calcutta Test after his 109-run knock in the first innings of the first match in Nagpur.         
	South Africas Hashim Amla, who played magnificently throughout the series with three centuries, including a double hundred, also reaped rich rewards and has jumped to second spot with 842 points.         
	Amla was also adjudged Man of the Series for his brilliant performance in the 1-1 drawn series.         
	Another Indian in the top-10 in the latest rankings chart is Sachin Tendulkar, who is at sixth place with 805 points.         
	Zaheer Khan is the top ranked Indian among bowlers at sixth while off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who was instrumental in India winning the Eden Test with a five-wicket haul in South Africas second innings, is one rung below at seventh, in the list headed by Dale Steyn.         
	On Thursday, India retained the No.1 spot in the Reliance ICC Test Championship after winning the Eden Test by an innings and 58 runs.         
	India were in danger of losing their top spot after South Africa won the Nagpur Test last week, but Indias victory here meant the series ended 1-1, prolonging Indias reign.         
	Even though India managed to maintain the pre-series status quo in terms of positions, they slipped to 124 ratings points after conceding one ratings point.         
	The series result meant Mahendra Singh Dhonis side will not only retain the Mace but will also pocket a cheque worth $175,000, which is presented to the side that reaches the April 1 cut-off date as toppers.

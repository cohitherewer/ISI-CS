The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI has issues to settle

  - Sending some Test players to S. Africa in advance       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is moving towards sending some of the players early to South Africa, for the three-Test series, but there are issues to be settled.         
	No.1 is just how many should figure in the advance party? Also, who all? Yet another issue which hasnt yet been sorted out is exactly who, from the Team India support staff, will accompany those going early?         
	The BCCI is having to set a precedent because of the scheduling. Specifically, the five-match ODI series against New Zealand gets over on December 10, in Chennai, a mere six days before the first Test, in Centurion.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten, a former Proteas player, first suggested to the BCCI that his wards have enough time to acclimatise. Not only are the wickets very different, but the altitude and weather are factors, too.         
	Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Sreesanth are among the confirmed Test specialists, even Amit Mishra. However, where the last-named is concerned, theres no guarantee that the Krishnamachari Srikkanth-headed selection committee is going to pick three spinners (Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha being the first two).         
	Its worth noting that Andrew Strausss England reached Australia over 25 days before the first Ashes Test, in Brisbane, on November 25.         
	Thats the way to prepare for a tough series. India and South Africa are ranked No.1 and 2, respectively, in Tests.         
	Eventually, selecting the players component of the advance party may not be difficult, but what about the support staff?         
	Nobody knows South Africa better than Kirsten... Ideally, he must go... But if he does, then what happens to, say, the last two or three ODIs against New Zealand? Its a tough one, acknowledged a senior BCCI official, who spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	The BCCI could, of course, ask Eric Simons to go early. Hes from South Africa, as well, and has worn different hats for the Proteas. Indeed, besides having played 23 ODIs, Simons coached South Africa for around two years.         
	Simons started as Team Indias bowling consultant, this January, but is effectively the assistant coach.         
	If the Mahendra Singh Dhonis start with a bang, the BCCI may decide to book Kirsten with the advance party and designate Simons as acting coach for the last two-three ODIs against New Zealand.         
	Till late on Saturday, though, the selectors hadnt been involved in any of the discussions. Officials alone seem to be finalising everything.

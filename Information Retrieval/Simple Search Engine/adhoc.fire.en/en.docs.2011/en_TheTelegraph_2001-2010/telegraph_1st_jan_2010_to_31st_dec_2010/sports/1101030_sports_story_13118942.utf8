The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arthur: We suspected match-fixing in Lahore
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arthur: We suspected match-fixing in Lahore
                      
	Johannesburg: Former South Africa coach Mickey Arthur had a strong suspicion that Pakistan was involved in match-fixing in a one-day International (ODI) series in 2007, he said in an interview published on Thursday.         
	Arthur told a South African website that his team suspected match-fixing when Pakistan collapsed dramatically to lose the fifth and decisive ODI to South Africa in Lahore three years ago.         
	There was a strong suspicion of match-fixing and it took some of the gloss off the series win, Arthur said according to the website.         
	Needing 234 to win the series, Pakistan went from 149 for two and 209 for six to 219 all out. No allegations were made against the Pakistan team at the time.         
	We did not have any proof, but when you have been involved in the game long enough you know when something is not right, he said.         
	How else do you explain a batting side needing only 40 runs with seven wickets in hand, and then losing?           (AGENCIES)

    - Australian skips CWG to undergo surgery                   Stephanie Rice                           
	Melbourne: In yet another setback to the controversy-ridden Commonwealth Games, Australias triple Olympic gold medallist swimmer Stephanie Rice has pulled out of October 3-14 mega-event in Delhi, due to a shoulder injury.         
	The 22-year-old, decided to skip the Delhi Games to undergo a shoulder surgery in the hope of becoming fully fit before the 2012 London Olympics.         
	She had earlier put off the surgery till the Commonwealth Games but decided to fix her inflamed joint after consulting with coach Michael Bohl.         
	To not be able to compete at 100 per cent here at the Pan Pans has been hard enough, but to make the decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games has been very difficult. Its the right decision, long-term though, because the sooner I can get the shoulder looked at properly and have the surgery done, the sooner I can get back in the pool, training at 100 per cent, she said.         
	The Beijing gold medallist in the 200 and 400m individual medley and the 4x200m freestyle relay will return to Australia next week to undergo surgery.         
	Coach Bohl said, looking at the larger interest, his ward had taken the right decision.         
	We have to think about London, and work backwards from there, he said.         
	Having the surgery now will give Steph (Rice) every chance to be fit for the national trials next year, ahead of the World Championships, which ultimately then leads into preparation for London 2012, Bohl added.         
	Disappointed Swimming Australia head coach Leigh Nugent said Rices loss was a big setback for the Delhi-bound team.         
	There is no question Stephanie is a fantastic athlete, but unfortunately all athletes have their hurdles. The priority is to get her back to top fitness as soon as possible and to do that she will have to miss the rest of the these championships and the Commonwealth Games. She will come back stronger from this injury, she said.           (PTI)

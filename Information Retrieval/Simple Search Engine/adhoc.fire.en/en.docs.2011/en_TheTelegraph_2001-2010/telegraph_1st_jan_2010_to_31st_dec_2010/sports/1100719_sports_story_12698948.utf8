  - Depleted bowling, poor fielding let India down as Lanka make 256/2             Kumar Sangakkara after his century, in Galle, on Sunday                           
	Galle: Tharanga Paranavitana scored his first Test hundred and shared a 181-run stand with another century-maker, captain Kumar Sangakkara, as Sri Lanka dominated the first day of the first Test against India, on Sunday.         
	Sangakkara (103), who notched up his 22nd century, and Paranavitana (110 batting), exposed Indias toothless bowling attack to pile up a comfortable 256 for two at close, on a rain-truncated day.         
	Electing to bat, the Sri Lankan batsmen capitalised on easy batting conditions at the Galle International Stadium to take control of the match which is star spinner Muttiah Muralidharans swansong Test.             DAY 1 Highlights      Sri Lanka are playing their first Test of the year 2010. The last Test they played was also against India mdash; in December 2009. This is the 20th Test of the year. Bangladesh and South Africa have played a maximum of 7 Tests each.  Abhimanyu Mithun became the 264th player to represent India in a Test.   When on 84, Sangakkara (103) posted 7000 runs at the No. 3 position. He becomes the only third player to do so after Ricky Ponting (9447) and Rahul Dravid (8970). Sangakkara now has 7019 runs at this position.  On 134, the Paranavitana- Sangakkara second-wicket partnership bettered the previous highest for the same on this ground, of 133 by Bandula Warnapura amp; Kumar Sangakkara, also against India in 2008.   On 168, the Paranavitana- Sangakkara second-wicket partnership surpassed the highest partnership for any wicket in Galle during India-Sri Lanka Tests. The previous highest was 167, by Gambhir-Sehwag in 2008.  Kumara Sangakkara registered his hellip;
    22nd Test century 
  21st at the No. 3 position 
  14th in Sri Lanka 
  4th as captain 
  4th against India
  3rd in Galle  2nd century in consecutive Tests/innings (he made 137 in Sri Lanka rsquo;s last Test vs India in Mumbai, December 2009)  Sangakkara also moves to the third place in the list of hundreds scored by No. 3 batsmen, yet again behind Ponting (32) and Dravid (23) and going past Sir Don Bradman rsquo;s 20 hundreds at No 3.  Aged 28 years amp; 94 days Tharanga Paranavitana (110 batting) recorded his maiden Test hundred in his 11th Test. Paranavitana rsquo;s century also happened to be the fiftieth Test hundred of 2010.   
	 Compiled by Mohandas Menon      
	Paranavitana and Mahela Jayawardene (8) were at the crease when play was called off, shortly after the tea break, because of rain.         
	It turned out to be a miserable day for the Indians. With a depleted bowling attack, they struggled to make any impact on the Lankan batsmen who scored at a brisk pace. Neither did the dropped catches help Indias cause. The hosts could have been in a far more comfortable position had bad light and rain not deprived them of 21 overs during the day.         
	Sangakkara and Paranavitana capitalised on a solid start, of 91 for one at lunch, and the duo treated the hapless Indian bowling attack with disdain by sharing 181 runs for the second wicket in exactly 51 overs to take the game away from the visitors.         
	India removed Sangakkara early in the final session, caught by Sachin Tendulkar off Virender Sehwag. He faced 145 balls and hit 12 fours. It was his fourth century against India. He also went past West Indian Gordon Greenidge and Englishman Colin Cowdrey to become the 23rd most prolific batsman.         
	The second wicket pair of Sangakkara and Paranavitana came together with the total on 55 when Sri Lanka lost opener Tillekaratne Dilshan (25), caught by wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni off debutant Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	The Indian attack, without strike bowler Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth due to injuries, were at the receiving end of a solid Lankan batting display and went wicketless in the whole of the extended second session. They conceded 137 runs in 38 overs bowled in the session.         
	To compound the matters for India, their most experienced bowler Harbhajan Singh suffered from after effects of a bout of flu and, apparently, a hamstring problem. He went off the field mid-way into the post-lunch session but returned after about 20 minutes.         
	Sangakkara and Paranavitana, who were on 25 and 35 at lunch break, played sensible innings as they mixed caution with aggression to deny any success to the Indians.         
	Sangakkara, the more aggressive of the two, was in fine touch, punishing the Indian bowlers whenever they erred in line and length.         
	Opener Paranavitana was more circumspect initially waiting for bad balls but he opened up after reaching his fifty.         
	India also missed a half chance to remove Paranavitana when a forward diving Yuvraj Singh failed to reach the ball after the Lankan opener cut uppishly off a Sehwag delivery on 51.         
	But that was all the Indians had as the bowlers lacked penetration and consistency to trouble the Lankans.         
	Paranavitana went on to score his best Test score, his earlier best being 73 against Pakistan, in Colombo, last year.         
	Harbhajan got the drift and a bit of turn in both the sessions but that was not enough to get any wicket while left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha was also expensive though he extracted some turn.         
	Pacer Ishant Sharma gave away just two runs in his first two overs of the second session before conceding 19 in his next two and Dhoni promptly took him off.         
	Fielding one of the weakest bowling attacks in a long time, luck also did not favour India as Dhoni lost the toss. The start of the match was delayed for 30 minutes due to wet outfield.         
	With the Indian bowlers failing to take the advantage of the moisture after heavy overnight rains, the Lankan openers, Paranavitana and Dilshan, were off to a quick start, sharing 55 runs for the first wicket in 11 overs.         
	The Sri Lankan duo targeted Ishant, who bled 41 runs in his five overs in the morning, as Paranavitana struck him for a four in the first ball of the innings and then repeated it with another boundary in the opening over.         
	Ishant was again punished by Paranavitana for another couple of fours in his second over. Dilshan also joined the party with five fours off Ishant in two overs.         
	Mithun made an impressive debut conceding 41 runs from his 13 overs and with the wicket of dangerous Dilshan, his maiden Test scalp.           (PTI)

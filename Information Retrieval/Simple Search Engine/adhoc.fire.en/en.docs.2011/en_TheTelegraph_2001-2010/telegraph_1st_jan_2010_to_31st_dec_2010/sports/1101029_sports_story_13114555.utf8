The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss laughs off Big Ben sledge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Strauss laughs off Big Ben sledge
  - The team will have to dig deep and deliver, says Michael Clarke       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                             
	England captain Andrew Strauss has laughed off Australias Big Ben sledge on the eve of his teams departure, claiming his side will relish the pre-Ashes mind games.         
	Cricket Australia Wednesday night projected an image of Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke onto the side of Big Ben, with the taunting message: Dont forget the urn.         
	Reminding England cricketers and fans not to expect an easy tour Down Under, Ponting said: Winning the urn back from our age-old rival is the most prized achievement for Australians and we just wanted to send them a reminder not to leave the urn behind.         
	Our message is clear  were prepared and were ready so Bring on the Ashes!         
	Clarke backed these sentiments in Cricket Australia release.         
	The Ashes is the ultimate cricket battle between our nations and this year will be no exception. The team will have to dig deep and deliver. We have some new faces in the squad this series who didnt play in England last time. So theyre fresh and excited to be part of their first Ashes tour.         
	Strauss, Englands phlegmatic captain, said: I didnt see it myself but I think its the fun and games of the Ashes.         
	Thats the great thing about this Ashes series: Australians and English people, they get down and support their countries. It helps to build-up the series.         
	In reality the series doesnt need building up but the banter adds to the atmosphere.         
	England fly out to Perth determined to wipe out memories of the 5-0 Ashes whitewash two years ago.         
	We all feel a slight burden of responsibility to perform, Strauss said. But that is mixed in with a sense of pride in what lies ahead. We all know what a tough place Australia is to tour.         
	We have had a lot of success over the last 18 months and confidence levels are very high. There is a feeling of relaxed excitement of what lies ahead. We are a good, tight unit and know what to expect.         
	Englands recent experiences Down Under have been brutally exposed in the first Test at Brisbane and Strauss admitted that the three first-class games will be an important factor before playing Pontings side on November 25.         
	He said: The key is to hit the ground running. We have prepared as well as we could have done.         
	We have all been thinking about this Ashes series for a long time now. We have pretty much left no stone unturned and we want to hit the ground running.         
	Strauss picked out opposing captain Ponting as the key man for Australia.         
	The great player in their ranks is Ricky Ponting, he said.         
	As captain he has a responsibility to lead the side and his record in Ashes series is very good.         
	Aside from that, neither side is going to be significantly different from the last time we played so well know each other pretty well. Its going to boil down to crucial periods of play and who wins them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina is in no hurry to be No.1
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina is in no hurry to be No.1

	Hyderabad: Ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal is in no hurry to become the world No. 1. She feels winning the prestigious Hong Kong Super Series title, in Wanchai, was as good as achieving the numero uno status, as she had beaten some top players en route to her victory.         
	Saina is participating in the India Open that got underway, at the K Vijaybhaskar Reddy stadium, here, on Tuesday.         
	On Sunday, Saina capped a dream year with her fourth Super Series title, when she won the Hong Kong Open but that is unlikely to push her to the No. 1 ranking.         
	I will be happy if I finish the year at the top. I dont know yet what the system is and how its going to happen. I think, this year, I will stay at world No. 3 or 4, but winning this tournament (Hong Kong Super Series) is like becoming world No. 1. So its okay, Saina said.         
	I will achieve it (No. 1 spot) this year or next year. I mean, all players want to become world No. 1 and I have the same dream. Lets see when I will achieve it.         
	This has been a dream year. I played five Super Series out of 12. Also, winning the Commonwealth gold was memorable, she said. (PTI)

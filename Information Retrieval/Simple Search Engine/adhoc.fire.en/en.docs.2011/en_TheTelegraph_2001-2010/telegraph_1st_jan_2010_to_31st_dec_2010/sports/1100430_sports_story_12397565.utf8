                                  Dhoni        
	St Lucia: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Thursday warned his teammates against taking unheralded Afghanistan lightly in their World Twenty20 opening match here on Saturday, saying any slip-up against them can put his side out of contention for Super Eights.         
	If you ask me, I would not consider our opening match against Afghanistan as a practice game. I dont take my opponents lightly. At the end of the day you have to win whichever team you play, said Dhoni, ruling out complacency in the Indian camp.         
	I dont know much about them. It is good in a way because if we know too much about a side then you are thinking too much about them. However, our preparation will remain the same as if you are playing the best opponent in world cricket, he said.         
	We cant really relax, no matter whichever team you are playing. You are representing India and you have to be at your best when you turn up on the field, Dhoni added.         
	On the criticism for not playing any warm-up game before the start of the tournament, Dhoni said: We dont actually need to play a warm-up game as the way we have shaped up after the long journey, there wouldnt have been any good coming out of it , said Dhoni.         
	Dhoni was also not much worried about the injuries to some of his key players.         
	It is part and parcel of the game. But at the end of the day we have replaced them (Sehwag) with the best possible players available.         
	We are just hoping that we wont miss them on the field. We are hopeful that people who have come as replacements would step up to the occasion and perform, he said.         
	Delving on Yuvraj Singhs injury-riddled form, Dhoni said: He bats at No. 4 and can easily play the big shots. There arent enough grounds in the world that are big enough for him not to clear. It is a big stage for him (Yuvraj) and, as we have seen of him, he loves challenges. His utility as a bowler also comes into play.         
	The flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman said that he likes to be in the present than look at the past and into the future.         
	Rather than thinking too much of the past and into the future, it is very important to be in the present. Right now, we are keen to play the games here (St Lucia). We are not looking too far. It is the not first time that we are touring the West Indies. So we know what the conditions would be like and are mentally prepared for it, Dhoni said.

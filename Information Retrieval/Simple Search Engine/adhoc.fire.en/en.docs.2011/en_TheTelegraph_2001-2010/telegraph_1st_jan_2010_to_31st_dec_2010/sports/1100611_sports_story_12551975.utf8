                                                                                                                       7                                      Azhar call
                      
	New Delhi: Projected as an outsider by the ruling camp, cricketer-turned-politician Mohammad Azharuddin on Thursday fired a salvo at Badminton Association of India (BAI) president VK Verma, saying the BAI chief is not eligible for re-election and should gracefully walk away having played a long innings.         
	Azhar referred to the sports ministry guidelines that the term of a National Sports Federation president should be 12 years and said its time to go for Verma.         
	Verma has not challenged the validity of the government guidelines in any court of law and, as such, is bound by the same and ineligible for a re-election, Azhar said.           (PTI)

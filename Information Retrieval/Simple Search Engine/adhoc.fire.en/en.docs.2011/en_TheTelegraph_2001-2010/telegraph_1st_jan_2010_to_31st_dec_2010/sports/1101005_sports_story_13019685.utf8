The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Day of fluctuating fortunes
                                                                                                                       7                                        Day of fluctuating fortunes
    - Indias hopes rest on Tendulkar as australia nose ahead           SUDIPTO GUPTA            Ben Hilfenhaus celebrates after dismissing Virender Sehwag, in Mohali, on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Mohali: Reversing the reverse was the theme of the day. Sounds confusing? It definitely is and that is exactly how the game unfolded on Monday, in Mohali.         
	At the end of the fourth days play in the first India-Australia Test of the two-match series, India were standing on a pointed cliff having been reduced to 55 for four in their pursuit of a 216-run target. Mahendra Singh Dhonis men were staring at the depths of defeat with adversities threatening to push them down on a precarious fifth day.         
	At the crease, were Sachin Tendulkar on 10 and Zaheer Khan on 5. And the maestro will have to add to his tally if India are to win.         
	Earlier, India restricted Australias second innings to 192 with the help of collective bowling brilliance, a helpful pitch and careless batting by the visitors.         
	Getting back to the role of reverse: As fortunes oscillated every hour, happiness changed to sighs, only to revert to joy. And it was not only the shaft of dominance that changed hands frequently, the subplots reversed themselves too.         
	Note the following:         
	i) The Mohali pitch, which had drawn surprise from every quarter for losing its traditional flair of pace and bounce, suddenly woke up from its slumber on Monday. After the first three days each produced 5, 7 and 8 wickets respectively,         
	Day Four witnessed the downfall of 14 wickets! The reason, to put it in curator Daljit Singhs words: The Day Four track is behaving like a first day wicket. The bounce that it produced and the pace it generated certifies that. Fourth day tracks normally disintegrate and assist the tweakers. But for pacers?         
	ii) Before Monday, Ishant no ball Sharmas exploits with the ball in this Test was as poor as the crowd attendance in Mohali.         
	No one expected him to spit fire, hustle up the Australian batsmen and lend India a helping hand when needed most.         
	 However, he trumped expectations. In a fiery spell of fast bowling, which had enhanced Indias chances in the early part of the day, he removed Shane Watson (56), Ricky Ponting (4) and Michael Clarke (4). His figures read in that spell read 3-2-8-3. Hows that?         
	But at the end of the day, its advantage Australia. When it appeared that India did well to restrict the target to 216, Ben Hilfenhaus (three for 22) claimed Gautam Gambhir (0), Virender Sehwag (17) and Suresh Raina (0) to paralyse Indian hopes and reverse Aussie fortunes.         
	Rahul Dravids wicket was claimed by Doug Bollinger.         
	While Sehwag and Raina fell prey to short deliveries, Gambhir was the victim of umpire Billy Bowdens blunder, his bat-pad being adjudged lbw.         
	The umpires performance, too, oscillated between good and bad all through the day. While Bowden was sharp with a few tough calls, Ian Goulds decision to declare Mike Hussey (28) leg before to Harbhajan Singh was questionable.         
	At the start of the day, Australia couldnt have expected for a better opening stand as Watson and Simon Katich put on 87 runs at a considerable speed. The occasional edges were there allright, but as has been the norm, they kept their distance from the fielders.         
	Watson, the lone centurion in this match so far, was once again productive with his willow, garnering runs. His brisk operation earned him his fifty off 51 balls. Then came Ishants whirlwind spell.         
	And there was some drama too. After scalping Watson and Ponting, the pacer forced Clarke to flick straight to Sehwag at mid-wicket, in that same over. As the Indians were busy jubilating, Bowden stopped Clarke from walking back to the hut and checked with the third umpire if it was a no ball. And a no ball it was!         
	The Indian spin duo of Harbhajan (2/40) and Pragyan Ojha (2/59) did a fine job between themselves. Zaheer was once again devastating with his swing, reverse, that is. He was almost unplayable and took three for 43, completing 250 scalps in Tests.         
	With the Australian pacers bouncing with energy, and the track providing the platform, VVS Laxman could have been Mahendra Singh Dhonis oxygen on Tuesday. While his teammates insisted he is fit to bat, one really doubts if he is fit enough to fight.         
	What a Test! And thats straight from the heart, no reverses here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germans to four-front again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Germans to four-front again
    - Diego Maradonas inexperience as a coach gets exposed                   Guest Column

	Ones out of the world performance knocked the other out of the Cup. Argentina did not have any answer to Germanys onslaught and Joachim Loews men were the deserving team to enter the semi-finals.         
	Before the match very few could have predicted a 4-0 scoreline in favour of the Germans but then this team is a class apart. Now, unless and until they bungle big time, the World Cup is going to Duetschland. Thats for sure.         
	What a match the Germans played; really mind-blowing football. Bastian Schweinsteiger was deadly in the midfield, Sami Khedira was equally good and Lucas Podolski was brilliant. Then there was the defence led by skipper Philipp Lahm. Not for once the Argentinas much vaunted frontline managed to make a headway. The Germans were that good on Saturday.         
	This multi-ethnic German team reminds me of Les Bleus of 1998 World Cup. A Turkish (Mesut Oezil, a Ghanaian (Jerome Boetang), a Tunisian (Khedira) and two Polish (Miroslav Klose and Lucas Podolski) in the line-up, the Germans have reinvented themselves. And how!         
	Look at this Thomas Mueller, who was a Bayern Munich reserve just a year-and-half back. Now he is a vital cog in the German wheel and already has four goals in South Africa.         
	Unfortunately, he will be missing the semi-final but I dont think Loew will be that worried. His team is on a roll. On Sunday last, it was England who got a taste of the German blitzkrieg and within six days it was Argentinas turn.         
	I can safely put my money on this team to win the World Cup and also the Euro 2012. Pardon me if I am going overboard But once in while, you can actually. Isnt it?         
	The Germans made a blazing start going into the lead as early as the third minute. Schweinsteiger curled in a free-kick and Mueller flicked in a header past the rival goalkeeper.         
	Podolski was a revelation on Saturday. He followed Loews order to the T. Whenever Argentina were building up moves, Podolski was there to hound either Lionel Messi or Angel di Maria. Every German player, including Klose, was chasing down the Argentines whenever they had the ball.         
	The South Americans clearly did not have any answer to that. Both Argentina and Brazil were not really tested in this World Cup. But once they came up against quality oppositions they were found wanting. I was also surprised by Diego Maradonas decision of keeping Juan Sebastian Veron on the bench.         
	A midfielder par excellence, he would have been the perfect man to put the ball in Messis foot. Messi needs someone who will deliver the ball to him.         
	In Barcelona, this thing is done by Xavi and Andreas Iniesta and in the Argentine team Veron is the only one who is capable of doing that. And Maradona kept him on the bench? Ridiculous and blasphemous!         
	This decision showed how inexperienced Maradona is as a coach. He can be one of footballs all time greats but as a coach he needs more experience.         
	He may have the passion but his tactical acumen is zero. After this debilitating loss, I doubt whether the Argentine football federation will keep him at the helm.         
	So what we saw was a lost and lonely Messi dropping deep for the ball and the Germans were too happy with that. And the moment he went into the attacking third, at least four Germans were snapping on his heels.         
	 Even if he managed to get past two, the third one would stop the little magician. Poor soul! He did not get his name on the scoresheet even for once in this World Cup. May be the 2014 World Cup in Brazil will be his. At 27, he will be more mature and physically stronger and will be able to lead Argentina to greater heights.         
	The Germans were physically stronger and fitter. They defended dourly and did not give the Argentines any shooting angles. .         
	The second goal came in the 68th minute when Podolski broke into the Argentine box and then unselfishly played it to Klose who happily obliged with a tap in. Six minutes later came the third. Schweinsteiger slalomed three defenders and then cut the ball back to central defender Arne Friedrich for a simplest of tap-ins. It did not end there.         
	In the 89th minute, Klose, who was lurking inside the box, volleyed in past a hapless Romero. What a way for Klose to celebrate the 100th appearance for his country!         
	The seeds of 2010, were actually sown in 2006 when under Juergen Klinsmann we saw a different Germany. It was so unlike of 1980s and 90s when they used to play dull football and almost unnoticed would go all the way.

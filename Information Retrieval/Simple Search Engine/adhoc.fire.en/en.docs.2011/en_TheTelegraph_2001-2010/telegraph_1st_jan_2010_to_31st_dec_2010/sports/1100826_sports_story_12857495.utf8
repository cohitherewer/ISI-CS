  -   English Athlete Marilyn Okoro pulls out               David Rudisha                           
	Nairobi: In a big boost to the upcoming Delhi Commonwealth Games, middle distance running powerhouse Kenya are sending a strong athletics team which will be led by mens 800m world record holder David Rudisha and Olympic 1500m champion Nancy Jebet Lagat.         
	Rudisha, who smashed the 13-year-old world 800m record with a new time of one minute 41.09 seconds at the Berlin leg of Diamond League last week, and Lagat will earn direct entry to the Kenyan athletics team without taking part in Saturdays national trials, a newspaper reported Wednesday.         
	Lagat had become the first Kenyan athlete to secure a Diamond League title in the London leg on August 13.         
	World 3000m steeplechase and 5000 champions Ezekiel Kemboi and Vivian Cheruiyot are expected to get direct entry in the Commonwealth Games team, the report said.         
	Other athletes considered for the Commonwealth Games are those who already are in Africas team for the VTB Continental Cup, formerly World Cup of Athletics, to be held on September 4 and 5 in Split, Croatia.         
	Top leading athletes of the season from four continental groupings  Asia Pacific, the US, Europe and Africa  will take part in the Croatia event.         
	Most of the Commonwealth Games bound athletes are also taking part in Brussels Diamond League event on August 27, the final leg of the inaugural 14-meet Diamond League series.         
	Athletics Kenya chairman Isaiah Kiplagat said his country wants to send the strongest athletics team in the Commonwealth Games.         
	We want to ensure we do not falter at the Commonwealth Games. Most athletes including David Rudisha have confirmed they will take part and collect medals in India, he said.         
	This year has been good for athletics with our teams excelling at World Cross, World Juniors, African Championships and Youth Olympics Games and we want to continue that, Kiplagat said.         
	Englands Marilyn Okoro, however, said she was pulling out of the team for the Commonwealth Games.         
	The 25-year-old 800m runner, has struggled for form this season following a knee problem and has recently been troubled by a back injury.         
	Okoro, who was also a member of the 4x400m relay squad, said: I am hugely disappointed not to compete at the Commonwealth Games and my decision was not an easy one to make but I have to remain focused on my 2012 dream.         
	My body just isnt as ready as my mind for Delhi but with help and support from my coach Ayo Falola and the UKA medical team I will be back for the 2011 season.         
	I wish the team the best of luck, theyre a great team with lots of experience mixed with fresh young talent.         
	Okoro, a finalist in the World Championship title race won by South Africas Caster Semenya in Berlin last year, won a bronze medal in the 4x400m relay at this years European Championships in Barcelona.         
	Australian swimmer Ryan Napoleon has been ordered to serve a three-month doping ban and miss the Commonwealth Games even though Fina accepted that his failed test was not his fault.         
	Finas doping panel accepted that Napoleon tested positive for the banned drug formoterol last year because a pharmacist wrongly labelled an asthma inhaler.         
	Meanwhile, the Games organising committee said that they have finalised deals with right holding broadcasters from 13 countries across six continents.         
	The committee said to make the Games a visual treat, host broadcast partner Prasar Bharati has roped in Satellite Information Services, UK for production and coverage and for the first time in the history of the Games, all 17 sports disciplines and the opening and closing ceremonies will be covered on High Definition Digital Format (HDTV).         
	The committee also said that the October 3-14 Games will be viewed across Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, the Caribbean and the United States, with additional daily news coverage reaching across 160 countries.         
	Many of the worlds best production crew will be handling the broadcast. It is for the first time the US has shown interest in the Commonwealth Games, OC treasurer AK Mattoo told reporters here.

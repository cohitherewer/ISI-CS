The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani pockets gold 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Advani pockets gold 
  - This feels great... I cant ask for more, says ace cueist             Pankaj Advani after winning the gold in the mens billiards singles event, in Guangzhou, on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Guangzhou: Pankaj Advani showed nerves of steel under severe pressure to clinch the first gold medal for India in the Asian Games on Sunday when he came twice from behind to edge out Myanmars Oo Nay Thway 3-2 and retain his title after a bitterly fought billiards singles final here.         
	The 25-year-old Advani was down 1-2 after losing the first and third frames, but fought back to clinch the fourth to take the match into a nerve-wracking final frame.         
	A visibly happy Advani said this was the biggest title of his career. This feels great. This is Olympics for me as unfortunately we are not there in the Olympics. This time I made it a point to win the first gold for the country. Its an absolutely emotional moment for me. I cant ask for more, said the Bangalore-based Advani at the media conference.         
	Advani took early lead in the deciding frame against his rival to lead 64-17 before his Myanmar opponent staged a grand fightback to reduce the lead to a mere 19 points.         
	But a red pot miss by the opponent provided Advani an ideal chance to get back into the gold medal hunt. And he did with a superb unbeaten break of 36. He finished off the match with a red pot to the top right pocket. Advani won the match 33-100, 100-61, 12-101, 101-4, 100-45. This was Advanis second Asian Games gold medal having won one in Doha four years back.         
	Advani said that both the players faced immense pressure in the gold-deciding match and that led to several errors.         
	Advani also revealed the tremendous responsibility that he carried into the title match as the defending champion.         
	It was the toughest final in terms of the responsibility on my shoulders as everyone expected a gold from the defending champion. I prefer not playing well and winning rather than playing well and not winning. After all winning is everything, he added.         
	The match saw both playing inconsistently with Advani yet to get into the groove when his opponent ran up a big lead and won it comfortably.         
	The Indian ace was on song from the beginning of the second frame and ran up a commanding 46-8 lead but a break of 15 by his Myanmar rival reduced the gap. But a succession of red pots and in-offs enabled Advani to compile a break of 28. An error by Oo got the Indian back on the table to reel off an unfinished run of 26, that included an excellent cushion-canon, to bring him on par at in frames (1-1).         
	Oo jumped to a 58-1 lead in the third with some brilliant long in-offs and then killed the Indians hopes with an unfinished sequence of 43 to win the frame 101-12.         
	But the determination in the Indian champions demeanour was noticeable in the fourth frame as he uncorked crucial breaks of 28 and a superb, unfinished 67 with a red in-off after some immaculate top table play to take the match into the deciding fifth frame.         
	Later, national billiards champion Alok Kumar became the first Indian to win an Asian Games medal in pool events by clinching bronze in the mens 8-ball category despite losing in the semifinals.         
	The 42-year-old bagged a bronze though he lost 5-7 to Kuo Po Cheng of Chinese Taipei in last-four stage. Under rules of the event, both the losing semifinalists are awarded a bronze each instead of playing a third-place play-off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Am ready to walk out: Brasa
                                                                                                                       7                                      Am ready to walk out: Brasa
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Chief coach Jose Brasa Saturday said he was satisfied with Indias World Cup performance despite three defeats in four matches so far.         
	I am ready to walk out with a smile if I am asked to, said Brasa. The team have improved in the last seven months. We have lost to Australia, Spain and England, but I believe we are now among the top teams in the world.         
	Lack of match practice, Brasa said, was Indias only problem. We need to play more official tournaments in order to improve.         
	In many months, this is the only tournament we got to play. Its a pity that we are not there in the Champions Trophy. We would have gone far ahead had we played that tournament, said the Spaniard.         
	The match against England, Brasa claimed, could have gone either way. Once again we conceded soft goals. In the second half, we had our chances but couldnt convert them.         
	England have been playing in that style for 30 years, we have started it only six months ago. It would take time. The boys have done very well and I am proud of them, he commented.         
	England captain Barry Middleton said his team shouldnt have conceded the second-half goals. Actually, we let ourselves down. We wanted to win in a clinical fashion but then conceded goals. We should have scored a couple of goals more.

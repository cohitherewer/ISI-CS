The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lippis orders not followed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lippis orders not followed
                      
	Irene: Italy coach Marcello Lippi lamented that his squad wasnt able to follow his orders in the shocking 1-1 draw with New Zealand at the World Cup.         
	Evidently something is not working if were not able to put the ball in the net, Lippi said in a heated news conference Monday, a day after the shocking result against the 78th-ranked All Whites.         
	We worked the entire week on keeping the ball low and on the ground, but as soon as we grew a little nervous we started booting it high in the air.         
	Italy also drew 1-1 with Paraguay in their opener, and the defending champions now need to beat Slovakia in their final Group F match on Thursday to be sure of advancing.         
	Italy produced 23 shots to New Zealands three and led 7-1 in shots on goal but had trouble finding the target, equalising only with a penalty kick from Vincenzo Iaquinta.         
	The Azzurris problems finishing were also evident against Paraguay.         
	Were having trouble in front of the goal, Lippi admitted when pushed by a foreign journalist.         
	What other problems do you see? Do you understand?

	Calcutta: As Mohun Bagan and Chirag United square off in the Calcutta Football League title decider at the Salt Lake Stadium, here on Tuesday, the rival players and coaches will have different expectations.         
	A draw will be enough for Chirag United to win the title, while Bagan need a victory to make it a hattrick of CFL titles.         
	For Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya, a win will be a big achievement.         
	A chance to write his name in the record books as the first coach in 52 years, apart from Big Three, to guide a team to CFL title triumph.         
	Subrata, once a blue-eyed boy of the Bagan supporters, doesnt share a cordial relationship with the present club management.         
	So, for Bagans most famous Jersey No. 16, there cannot be a better way to make a point than snatching the league from Mohun Bagans grasp.         
	The players know their responsibilities. I am sure they know what it means to be called champions. I am hoping for the best, the coach said after a practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday.         
	For Subrata and the officials, it will be a jittery time as some of their key players (R Dhanarajan, Gouranga Biswas, Ashim Biswas and Kingshuk Debnath) have already decided to switch allegiance with the green-and-maroon brigade next season.         
	They have done a wrong thing having already accepted advance from another club. But we wouldnt like to question their integrity. But it is up to the coach to decide what exactly will be his starting line-up, a senior official stated.         
	On the otherhand, Mohun Bagan have everything to lose if their opponents walk away with the title.         
	A team that boasts of names like Jose Ramirez Barreto, Edeh Chidi, Deepak Mondal, Surkumar Singh to name a few, the season has been disappointing.         
	So, to give the fans something to smile about, Bagan will desperately want the title.         
	If Bagan manage to retain the title, they will achieve something which everyone expects them to do. But if they fail, all hell will break loose. Thats for sure.         
	It will also be testing time for Bagans main hit-man Edeh Chidi. Chidi, who has recently gone through a personal tragedy will be trying hard to concentrate on the game forgetting his sorrow.         
	It is a nice gesture on Chidis part that he has decided to stay back for the important match though he has important family commitments, coach Bhattacharya said.

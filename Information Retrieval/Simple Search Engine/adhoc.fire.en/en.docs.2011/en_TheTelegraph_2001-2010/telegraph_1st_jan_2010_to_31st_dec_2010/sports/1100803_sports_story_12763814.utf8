The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC to move fast on Isaac nomination
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC to move fast on Isaac nomination
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The ratification process of Alan Isaacs nomination for the International Cricket Council (ICC)s vice-presidents post will be done through a circular process so that he can take over the job as quickly as possible, according to a media release from the ICC.         
	On Saturday, The Telegraph had reported that Isaac would make it to the ICC post smoothly.         
	The ICC, on Monday, confirmed that it has received a joint nomination of Isaac from New Zealand Cricket and Cricket Australia.         
	The process now requires Mr. Isaacs nomination to be formally approved by the ICC Board and Council which will be done as quickly as possible through a circular resolution so that he immediately assumes responsibility as ICC vice-president for two years before taking over as the ICC president in 2012, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said.

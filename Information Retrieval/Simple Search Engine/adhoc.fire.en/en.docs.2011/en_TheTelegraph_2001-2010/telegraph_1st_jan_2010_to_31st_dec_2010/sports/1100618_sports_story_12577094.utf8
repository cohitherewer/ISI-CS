The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas aim to clinch series vs WI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Proteas aim to clinch series vs WI
                      
	St Kitts: South Africa look set to continue their dominance over West Indies in Tests, and formalise another Test series victory, when the second Test starts at Warner Park on Friday.         
	The South Africans lead the three-match series 1-0, after they completed a 163-run victory inside four days in the opening Test last Sunday at Queens Park Oval in Trinidad. The Proteas have not lost a Test series against the Windies, since a 52-run defeat in Barbados 18 years ago marked their return to Tests, following isolation from international cricket.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith wants to keep this proud record in place, and land a victory that would also help to keep his team in the No.1 position in Tests.         
	Teams         
	West Indies (from): Chris Gayle (captain), Travis Dowlin, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Dwayne Bravo (vice captain), Darren Bravo, Brendan Nash, Nelon Pascal, Denesh Ramdin, Sulieman Benn, Narsingh Deonarine, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Darren Sammy, Shane Shillingford.         
	South Africa (from): Graeme Smith (captain), Ashwell Prince, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis (vice captain), AB deVilliers, Jean-Paul Duminy, Mark Boucher, Johan Botha, Paul Harris, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Alviro Peterson, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.

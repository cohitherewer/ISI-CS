	No blues over yellows  
	Johannesburg: Fifa has changed its rule on yellow-card amnesties at the World Cup to reduce the chances of big name players missing out on the July 11 final. Germanys Michael Ballack in 2002 and Argentinas Claudio Caniggia in 1990 are some of the players to have missed World Cup finals after picking up second yellow cards in semis. So for this tournament, world soccers governing body has shifted its usual amnesty for yellow cards from the end of the first round until after the quarter finals instead. That means players would only miss the final if they receive two yellow cards  or of course a straight red  in a semi-final game, rather than in the past when they may have carried one yellow card going into a semi.

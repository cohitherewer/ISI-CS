	London: Portsmouth were held 1-1 at home by second tier Coventry in the FA Cup on Saturday, while Aston Villa and Wigan outplayed Premier League rivals to reach the fourth round.         
	There were comfortable victories too for Tottenham, Bolton, Everton, Sunderland, Stoke and Burnley against opponents from the lower divisions.         
	Last in the top flight, Portsmouth fell behind to David Bells strike at Fratton Park but earned a replay through Kevin-Prince Boatengs header in the final minute of the first half.         
	In one of the few all Premier League meetings, Villa beat Blackburn 3-1 with goals by Nathan Delfouneso, Carlos Cuellar and John Carews late penalty. Nikola Kalinic replied for Rovers, who had El-Hadji Diouf sent off just before halftime, but Villas American keeper Brad Guzan saved a penalty from David Dunn.         
	Charles NZogbia came off the bench at halftime to score twice in Wigans 4-1 victory over Hull who had taken the lead through a free kick by Geovanni.         
	Only 5,335 fans showed up to watch the meeting of the two top flight teams.         
	In a meeting of two teams on long unbeaten runs, Birmingham were held 0-0 at Nottingham Forest, who are third in the second tier League Championship.         
	Forest striker Rob Earnshaw had the chance to secure an upset victory but fired a penalty over the bar. Birmingham are now unbeaten in 12 games and Forest in 17.         
	Manchester City won 1-0 at Championship club Middlesbrough with a first half goal by Benjani Mwaruwari and Bobby Zamoras 16th minute strike gave Fulham a 1-0 victory over Swindon from the third tier League One.         
	Niko Krancjar scored twice as Spurs beat Peterborough 4-0, Bolton trounced Lincoln 4-0, Everton knocked out Carlisle 3-1 and Sunderland beat non-league Barrow 3-0. Stoke came from behind to beat non-league York 3-1.

	Johannesburg: Maicon and Elano scored a goal each as Brazil broke through a solid North Korean defence to win their opening World Cup match 2-1 Tuesday.         
	Brazil escaped with a hard-fought victory in the Group G match after struggling to get past the defensive set-up of the North Koreans, who are making their first World Cup appearance in 44 years and arrived as the tournaments lowest-ranked team.         
	Maicon put Brazil on the board at Ellis Park after a through ball from midfielder Elano in the 55th minute, and Elano added to the lead in the 73rd after a well-timed pass from Robinho, finding the net with a one-timer from inside the area.Ji Yum Nam pulled one back for North Korea in the 89th.         
	The atmosphere at Ellis Park was electrifying. Chilling cold and the transport strike in the city couldnt dampen the spirits of the thousands of Brazilian fans who turned up to root for the team who are quite easily the superpowers of world football.         
	Long before the gates of the stadium were thrown open for the spectators, the Brazilian fans were there, waiting patiently in the famous yellow jersey. But they had very little to cheer about till half-time as a spirited North Korean defence kept their mighty rivals at bay with some good positional play and fine clearances. Brazil coach Dunga fielded the same team that played in their last two friendlies. The only talking point was whether Ramires might pip Elano in the starting line-up on the right but Dunga retained the former Manchester City player.         
	Brazil, overwhelming favourites to win the match, went into attacking mode right from the start with Robinho displaying fine skills. He collected the ball on the left and then dribbled past a couple of North Korean defenders easily before playing the ball into the box. However, an alert An Yong Hak was there to dispatch the ball away in a long clearance that landed almost near the Brazil penalty area.         
	Elano and Robinho then tested North Korea goalkeeper Ri Myong-guk with long rangers but both shots were off target.         
	The North Koreans were clearly aware of their limitations and that turned out to be their biggest strength in the first session. They played with just the lone forward and packed the midfield with five men. Three of these had a strictly defensive role and hardly ever moved beyond their own area.         
	Playing their first World Cup finals in 44 years, the North Koreans were able to dictate the pace of the match by slowing things down. Whenever the Brazilians were on the attack, the North Koreans held on to the ball for longer periods to frustrate the five-time world champions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali would make a great administrator
                                                                                                                       7                                        Murali would make a great administrator
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL JAYAWARDENE ON THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Colombo: Mahela Jayawardene, the senior-most among Sri Lanka cricketers playing all three forms at the international level, spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on Muttiah Muralidharan, the 800 man.         
	A former captain, Mahela recently got the vice-captaincy as the selectors want him to be ready to lead, should Kumar Sangakkara get injured either in the build-up to or during the 2011 World Cup.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Some words on Murali...         
	A When people ask me about Murali, I kind of hate it... Not in a bad way, of course, but I hate to talk of his achievements. Why? Because they are beyond even impossible and will remain so. What matters most to me is the quality of a person and Murali is one of the best Ive met. Hes definitely been an influence.         
	With Sanath Jayasuriya through with Test cricket, Murali had been the senior-most till he retired. In particular, how was he with newcomers?         
	Murali would be the first to make the newcomer feel comfortable, hed take him out... He was the first to take me out for a meal, too... His only bad quality is that he cant stop talking... Having said that, teams need players like Murali, for they get everybody around them and around the team... The thing about Murali is that hes very straightforward, hes somebody who cannot hold things inside. That, I think, has much to do with his being honest... Thats good, for transparency is very important... Its because of these qualities that hes got friends all over the world. Id say Murali is one of those peoples persons. (Adds laughing) I would be the last to sit next to him on a flight because the guy cannot sleep and wont let anybody else sleep either! He can talk for four-five hours.         
	Talk about what?         
	(Grins) Anything and everything... Anything in the papers, anything on the television, anything... And hes a guy who follows cricket everywhere, even, for example, club cricket in Australia... Murali would know something, at least, about the youngsters who came into our team... He has sources across the world.         
	Did Murali quit Tests at the right time?         
	Its good to leave the game on your own terms, rather than people asking why you are not going... Hes still a quality bowler and has more cricket left in him... Even Shane Warne still has the quality. Players know when its time to leave and when the responsibility for other things becomes much more. Murali has given everything hes got... It has been a personal decision and we should respect it.         
	Finally, how would you like Murali to be associated with the game once hes done with all forms of cricket?         
	Knowing Murali, he will at least call us two-three times a day! (Laughs) I know he wont come into administration, because he hates it, but he would actually be a great administrator. Why? Because hes an honest guy... Hes business-minded and has very good ideas... Right now, he wants to spend more time with his family, especially son Naren. If he can still get involved in other things, it would be great.

            HONKY DORY                        
	The Bezan Chenoy-trained Scholar is fancied to win the 1,200m Kailashpat Singhania Trophy, Thursdays main attraction. The last run of the Placerville-Cambridge Ball horse, over a scurry, is best ignored. Over the slated trip, the four-year-old is expected to come good in the hands of jockey Imran Chisty. Generalissimo and Saltoro are likely to fight out for the minor placings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mine was the best: Milla
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mine was the best: Milla
                      
	Johannesburg: The World Cups original hip-shaking goal-celebrator Roger Milla believes only South Africa have come anywhere near to emulating him this time.         
	Milla, whose corner-flag dance routine was as famous as his goals for Cameroon when they reached the 1990 quarter finals, has kept a close eye on the modern generations celebrations.         
	If I had to pick one, it would be the South Africans. I really liked it because it was a group dance, Milla said of the locals exultant routine, heading and kicking an imaginary ball, when they opened the tournament with a goal against Mexico.         
	Sneijders was funny too but it was not a celebration in the pure sense. Kloses too was good, but not a dance like mine, the former Cameroon striker said.         
	Absolutely nobody can do it like me, he said, laughing.         
	Mine was the first one, totally improvised. You need natural rhythm, movement of the hips. It is all about spontaneity, and it has to be personal, your own thing. Of course, you also have to score a goal first, dont forget! (Reuters)

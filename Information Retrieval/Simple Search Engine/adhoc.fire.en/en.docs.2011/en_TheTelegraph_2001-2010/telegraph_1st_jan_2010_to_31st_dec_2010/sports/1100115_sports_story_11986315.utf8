The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players back but Brasa has other worries
                                                                                                                       7                                        Players back but Brasa has other worries
  - Hockey coach unhappy with delay in completion of World Cup venue             Jose Brasa                             
	New Delhi: India coach Jose Brasa fears that with the hockey World Cup drawing near, his wards are losing their home advantage and missing out on valuable practise time awaiting the completion of the National Stadium.         
	The senior mens team Thursday returned to the preparatory camp in Pune having successfully negotiated their demands for better pay and resumed practice after a six-day gap, but it appears that the strike was not the only roadblock in their bid to win the World Cup in front of home fans.         
	Brasa said what he and his boys needed immediately was the turf of the Major Dhyanchand National Stadium to give his side enough time to acclimatise before the February 28-March 13 gets underway in the capital.         
	I have talked to (Indian Olympic Association president) Suresh Kalmadi about this. He said that the stadium will be completely ready by the end of this month but I need it as early as possible. We must start practising at the venue from now on, otherwise we will lose the advantage of playing on home turf, the Spaniard said from Pune.         
	Brasa said he would be happy if only the turf, along with the watering facility, was made available to the team.         
	I need only the turf and the watering system. If floodlights are ready that will be fine. But I am not bothered about the dressing room or the VIP rooms. Let that be ready in due course. We first need the ground for practice, Brasa added.         
	The 22 World Cup probables resumed training at the Balewadi Sports Complex in Pune after Kalmadi brokered a compromise deal between the players and Hockey India Wednesday.         
	I am the happiest person on earth today. My players have resumed practice and the most important thing is that they are completely concentrating on the World Cup now. Brasa said.         
	The coach was of the view that the strike episode had come as a blessing in disguise for the team as the morale of the players was high.         
	This new-found unity will do wonders in the World Cup. The morale of the players is very high, which is crucial for a big tournament like the World Cup. I have full confidence in them, Brasa said.         
	Brasa also expressed dissatisfaction with the food provided at the Balewadi complex, but refused to make that an issue.         
	Now all the problems have been solved. But, as far as their diet is concerned, I am not very happy but hope we will get better food in Delhi. Brasa said.         
	Meanwhile, the teams first training session at the Pune camp ended on a musical note with singer-actor Salma Agha performing for the players.           (PTI)

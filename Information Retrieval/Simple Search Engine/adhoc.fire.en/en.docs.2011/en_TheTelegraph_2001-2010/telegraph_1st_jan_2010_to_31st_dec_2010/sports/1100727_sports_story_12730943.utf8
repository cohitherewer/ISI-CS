    - England, Germany on strikers radar                   Raul Gonzalez during a media conference, in Madrid, on Monday. (AP)                           
	Madrid: Striker Raul Gonzalez announced Monday he will leave Real Madrid after 15 seasons, with Germany or England his likely destination, as briefly reported in Mondays Late City edition.         
	Reals all-time leading scorer made a statement at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in front of fans and flanked by new Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho and club president Florentino Perez.         
	The moment had arrived, no? Raul said. You get the feeling that this had to end. Its been many years ... and it was a decision that took a lot of time. (But) Id like to keep playing and competing.         
	Raul is reportedly set to join Bundesliga club Schalke, although the 33-year-old refused to comment on the reports.         
	I want to experience another type of football, a different culture  thats an important challenge in life, Raul said.         
	This afternoon (Monday) or Tuesday Ill decide on my future. But all my attention today (Monday) is on my farewell.         
	Raul, who had one year remaining on his contract with Real Madrid, said he also travelled to the United States and China to study offers as he looks to continue playing.         
	German or English football  those are the only two places I would go, Raul said of his future destination. My motivation is to keep playing football.         
	Perezs return to Real Madrid last summer sparked a euro250 million spending spree and with the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema, Raul found himself mostly relegated to the bench. He scored seven goals in 39 games.         
	Raul made his Real debut as a 17-year-old in 1994 and spent his entire career at the club  a span that includes three Champions League triumphs, six Spanish league titles and two Intercontinental Cups.         
	He leaves with 228 league goals for Real, and a record 44 goals in 102 appearances for Spain.         
	He is also the leading scorer in Uefa competitions with 66 goals, including 64 in the Champions League.         
	Im sure if I stayed I would play, and a lot, said Raul, who passed Alfredo di Stefano last year as the clubs leading scorer.         
	But this moment my body is asking for something else.         
	Rauls departure comes a day after midfielder Jose Maria Guti Gutierrez also announced his departure after 15 years.         
	Goalkeeper Iker Casillas is the only player left in Reals starting line-up who came from the clubs academy.         
	While more than 80,000 fans packed the Bernabeu last year to welcome Ronaldo, only a couple of thousand were on hand to say goodbye to a player who came to represent Real best while galacticos came and went.         
	I will always be available to Real for whatever they need me, Raul said.         
	Perez said this is not so much a goodbye as an hasta luego (see you soon)  this will always be your home.         
	Meanwhile, former Spain international Guti has signed a two-year deal with Istanbul club Besiktas, the Turkish team said Monday.         
	Besiktas said in a statement on its website that Guti would be paid 2.7 million euros ($3.5m) a year.           (AGENCIES)

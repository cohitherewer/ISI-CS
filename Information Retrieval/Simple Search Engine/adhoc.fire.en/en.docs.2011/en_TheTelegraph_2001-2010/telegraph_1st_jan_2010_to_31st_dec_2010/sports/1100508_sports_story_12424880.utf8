	Barcelona: With couple of matches left, Lionel Messi is only three goals away from equalling Ronaldos season-scoring record at Barcelona.         
	The 22-year-old forward has scored 31 goals in the league this season, and 44 in all competitions  three behind the former Brazilian striker in both categories. Messi has a chance to equal or surpass the record at Sevilla on Saturday or against Valladolid next weekend.         
	Coach Pep Guardiola says Messi, who is already in the clubs top-10 all-time scoring list, is the best. Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games during his only season at Barcelona in 1996-97.

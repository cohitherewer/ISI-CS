The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unbeaten 156   by Mukund
                                                                                                                       7                                      Unbeaten 156   by Mukund
                            
	Jaipur: Abhinav Mukund struck an unbeaten 156 while Shikhar Dhawan (83) and S Badrinath too blossomed (72 batting) with the bat as Rest of India piled up a mammoth 331 for one against Ranji champions Mumbai on the opening day of the Irani Cup here Friday.         
	Opting to bat, ROI batsmen capitalised on Mumbais sloppy fielding to end the day on a strong position.         
	Dhawan (83) was the lone ROI batsman to depart Friday, caught by Iqbal Abdulla off part-time spinner Rohit Sharma, but not before stitching a 167-run opening stand with Mukund.         
	Dhawan hit 12 boundaries during his 140-ball stay at the crease.         
	But from there on, it was all Mukund who mixed caution with aggression to end the day on an unbeaten 156 that came off 279 balls and was studded with 17 fours.         
	After Dhawans dismissal, Mukund found another able partner in Badrinath, who remained unbeaten on 72. He hit seven fours during his 134-ball innings.         
	Mukund was of the view that the wicket at the Saw\ai Mann Singh stadium had nothing to offer to the bowlers.         
	Off-spinner Ramesh Powar was the most impressive Mumbai bowler even though he did not get any wicket.         
	Powar also blamed the placid pitch for Mumbai bowlers unimpressive display. It (the wicket) had nothing in it. It was a big disappointment. It should have been better for such an important game, said Powar.           (PTI)

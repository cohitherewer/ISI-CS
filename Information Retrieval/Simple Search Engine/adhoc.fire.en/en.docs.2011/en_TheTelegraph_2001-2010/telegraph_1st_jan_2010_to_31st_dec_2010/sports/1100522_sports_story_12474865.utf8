The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Always played clean: Kamran
                                                                                                                       7                                      Always played clean: Kamran
                      
	Karachi: Pakistani wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal Friday vehemently denied his involvement in match fixing during the national teams recent tour of Australia and said he was not bothered about such allegations as had always played clean for the country.         
	The International Cricket Council (ICC) had Thursday revealed that it was looking into Pakistans poor show in their tour of Australia early this year and fingers of suspicion were raised on Akmal who had dropped four catches and missed an easy run out chance in the Sydney Test.         
	Akmal said he was fed up with the constant talk about match-fixing in Pakistan cricket and no longer bothered to even give credence to such stories. I dont even try to think about these things because I know I have always played clean cricket for Pakistan. I am really not bothered by these allegations because it is nothing new for me. I dont know how anyone can make such statements without evidence, Akmal told reporters in Lahore.         
	I have told the PCB everything I had to about my performances in Australia. I just want to focus on my cricket and on our team, Akmal said after returning from London where he had a short shooting stint for an Indian movie.         
	Pakistans coaches on the Australian tour, Intikhab Alam and Aaqib Javed expressed their suspicions over performance of Akmal and all-rounder Rana Naved for his batting and bowling in a one-dayer and a Twenty20 International match on the tour.         
	Video recordings of the proceedings of the inquiry committee that was formed by the Board in March to probe into the teams poor performance show Intikhab and Aaqib saying they have suspicions over the performance of both players and have heard things about them in relation to match fixing.         
	Akmal said he and the entire team had still not got over the heartbreaking loss to Australia in the semi-finals of the World Twenty20 in the West Indies. It was heartbreaking to lose the match against Australia after we had played so well in the match, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the PCB chairman Ijaz Butt has rubbished claims of match-fixing during Pakistans disastrous tour of Australia. (Agencies)

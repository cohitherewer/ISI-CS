The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tweet with caution, advises Strauss
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tweet with caution, advises Strauss
            Nick Hoult            Kevin Pietersen during a practice session, in Adelaide, on Thursday                           
	Kevin Pietersen has escaped censure for his Twitter outburst against the South Australia groundstaff but Andrew Strauss reminded the team to use the social networking website responsibly.         
	Pietersen was fined last summer for attacking on Twitter the decision to drop him for the one day series against Pakistan, a move which led to the players being issued with a set of guidelines for using the site while on the Ashes tour.         
	But Pietersen used Twitter on Tuesday to accuse the groundstaff at the Adelaide Oval of being pathetic for not covering the pitches in the net area during a rain shower which left England with just one outside practice session before the second Test started.         
	 Kevin was just frustrated because he wanted to have a long bat yesterday (Wednesday), said Strauss He wasnt able to do that so he vented his frustration. We have a set of guidelines for our players and we fully expect them to adhere to those guidelines.         
	Twitter is a way of allowing the players to be in contact with the people who support the game. There are some real benefits but it has to be used responsibly.         
	We dont want anything to distract our attention away from what is important. All I can say is the groundsmen here have looked after us well and we have no qualms with them what so ever.         
	Strauss will have been annoyed by Pietersens criticism which could be read as revealing a suspicion within the England camp that the failure to cover the practice area was some kind of Australian conspiracy to upset the touring side. What England can be certain of over the next few days is they will be reminded on a regular basis of what happened on this ground four years ago.         
	Shane Warne described Australias astonishing win in the last Ashes Test to be played at the Adelaide Oval as his greatest victory.         
	Paul Collingwood scored a double century in that match and is one of five members of Englands top six on this tour carrying bitter memories of the Adelaide Oval. Im proud that I achieved the 200 but I would have traded that in for a victory, said Collingwood.         
	I have always said my best innings are the ones that have been in a winning game or a draw. When you lose a game it doesnt really matter what you have done yourself.         
	Obviously personally it is satisfying to score runs but why do you score runs? It is to work for your team so it will never go down as one of the best innings I played because it was not in a wining cause.         
	 I have been through some tough times for England but it was very, very low after that game.         
	Having gone into the last day thinking we were going to get something out of that game and that we would go into the third Test match 1-0 down, it was devastating to lose and really took the guts out of us. The mood in the camp was very low after that game.         
	The Adelaide Oval has the reputation of being one of the flattest pitches in world cricket but it does produce regular results. Only three of the last 19 Tests played here have been draws with many Australian victories thanks to Warnes ability to exploit wearing pitches.         
	I always think Adelaide as a sub-continent track, said Collingwood.         
	It accelerates at the back end of the Test match with the ball reverse swinging both ways and spinning a lot more. That adds pressure on the batsmen.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

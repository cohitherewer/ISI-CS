                                                                                                                       7                                      Saina is ready for Wang test
                      
	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal fought her way to reach the Hong Kong Super Series final with a gruelling three-game victory over sixth seed, Juliane Schenk of Germany, in Wanchai, Saturday.         
	The second seeded Indian registered a 21-19, 17-21, 21-12 win over Juliane in a 53-minute semi-final match.         
	The 20-year-old Indian will lock horns with third seed Shixian Wang of China in the summit clash Sunday. Shixian beat top seed and compatriot Xin Wang 21-12, 21-14 in the other semi-final.         
	In a battle of nerves, Saina was trailing 8-12 but the Indian won four straight points to first catch up with the German and then level 17-17 before marching ahead to pocket the first game.         
	But Saina couldnt hold on to the lead in the second game and from 5-5, Juliane moved ahead to bounce back into the match.         
	In the decider, Saina gave no chance to her rival and opened a 6-1 lead before surging ahead to 11-3 and 19-9 before wrapping up the match.         
	The final will be a tough match because Shixian is in good form. It has been a fantastic year for Saina and will have to see how she plays tomorrow. She has been very consistent and have done well in bigger events and am happy overall, said national coach Pullela Gopichand.         
	She missed out on at least five super series meets this year because the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games were more important events. However, it also means that she missed out some events which otherwise could have taken her to the No. 1 spot. But it doesnt matter, what matters is the number of wins, he added.         
	Saina registered three back-to-back titles this year, winning the Indian Open, Singapore Open and defending the Indonesian Open. But the icing of the cake for her was the Commonwealth Games gold medal.         
	In the Asian Games last month, Saina, however, lost in the quarter finals to Pui Yin Yip of Hong Kong, in three tough games.         
	She avenged that defeat in the thismeet when she beat Yip, the local favourite, in straight games. The world No. 2 thrashed her opponent 21-11 21-10 in just 26 minutes. Saina proved to be the better player as her opponent was unable to get many points in rallies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India clinch series on a match-less day
                                                                                                                       7                                        India clinch series on a match-less day

	Margao: The 27,000 strong crowd, which thronged the Fatorda stadium on a bright, sunny Sunday morning to cheer the home team, was disappointed a few hours later as the third and final one-day International, between India and Australia, was abandoned without a ball being bowled.         
	A wet outfield was the reason behind the decision. Match Referee Chris Broad inspected the pitch thrice before calling the day s game off.         
	India thus won the three-match ODI series against Australia 1-0 to find themselves ranked second in the ICC one-day International rankings. It was also a historic clean sweep by the hosts, in both the Test and ODI series, against Australia.         
	After the Kochi washout and the Vizag victory, a win in the final match would have helped establish the hosts as a better one-day team after their clean sweep in the Test series. However, with just one match played, it s difficult to draw a crystal clear conclusion.         
	In the presentation ceremony, which lacked the lustre, at the team hotel, Virat Kohli was named the Man of the Series. There was no representation from the Australian team at the ceremony.         
	According to a Goa Cricket Association (GCA) official, the decision to call the match off was due to the unwillingness of one of the teams to go ahead with it.         
	However, at the presentation ceremony, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni clarified that the decision was taken mutually.         
	This was the third match to be abandoned at the venue, the other two being the New Zealand versus the West Indies tie in 1994 and the India versus New Zealand match in 1995.         
	With bouts of rainfall Saturday night, the possibility of the one-dayer was slight. However, as Sunday started promisingly, with a clear sky, the decision to call the match off was surprising.         
	At the most, it was expected to be a truncated affair.         
	The day began with frantic efforts to get the ground dry and fit for play. The ground staff were busy with the Super-soppers and rollers, and were aided by four to five hours of steady sun.         
	All looked perfect for the game to go ahead, but for the outfield, which was declared unfit for the match to take place. Despite there being covers for the ground, the waterlogged outfield did raise a few eyebrows on the ability of the organisers.         
	GCA president Dayanand Narvekar expressed his disappointment at the failure to host the last International match at the venue, but blamed it on the rain.         
	Everything was planned well and it was only due to the rain last night that the situation could not be helped. I am extremely disappointed that this memorable match could not be possible.         
	The crowd displayed amazing energy. As promised, the tickets will be refunded. It is sad because it was after three years that Goa was to see an International being played, he lamented.         
	Meanwhile, the only action at the Fatorda during the day was the collapsing of one of the sight-screens. A frantic repair job followed as ropes and hammers were forced into action to put it back.         
	When asked about the incident, Narvekar shrugged off the issue saying the sight-screens were put there by the advertisers and organisers cannot be blamed for what happened to it.         
	Advertisers put the sight-screen, and the organisers or ground staff can do nothing about it.

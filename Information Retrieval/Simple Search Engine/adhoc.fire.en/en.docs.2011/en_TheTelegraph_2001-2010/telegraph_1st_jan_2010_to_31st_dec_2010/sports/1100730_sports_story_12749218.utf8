The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Move aimed to create least complications: Sangakkara
                                                                                                                       7                                        Move aimed to create least complications: Sangakkara
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Kumar Sangakkara                           
	Colombo: The elevation of Mahela Jayawardene to the Sri Lanka vice-captaincy, from the ongoing Test here, has been done to create the least complications.         
	That, at least, is how captain Kumar Sangakkara put it, in a chat with The Telegraph.         
	Yes, I did have a word with the selectors and I did feel Mahela would, in the circumstances, be the right choice... Its a decision which would create the least complications, Sangakkara said, candidly, as usual.         
	While Sangakkara didnt elaborate, he implied that a Tillekaratne Dilshan had to do more before being considered for the No.2 job.         
	Dilshan led Sri Lanka in the recent tri-series in Zimbabwe, but thats because the seniors had been rested.                   Mahela Jayawardene      
	Eyebrows have been raised at Jayawardenes elevation as hed himself given up the captaincy in early 2009.         
	The 1996 World Cup-winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, is one of those rather baffled.         
	Look, Mahela didnt have to be named the vice-captain... In the Test series, certainly, I wouldve given the job to an Angelo Mathews... The understanding being that Mahela would still lead if Sangakkara got injured... Mathews could remain the No.2 and learn a few tricks, Arjuna, now a third term MP, pointed out.         
	Speaking exclusively on Thursday afternoon, Arjuna, a former chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, added: I can understand the selectors being concerned over what would happen if Sangakkara got injured in the lead-up to or during the 2011 World Cup, but let somebody young learn...         
	At 33, Dilshan is a year older than Sangakkara and definitely not young, as Ranatunga reminded. Mathews is 23.         
	Left to me, Id groom Thilina Kandamby... He has plenty in the head, but hardly gets to play, Ranatunga signed off.

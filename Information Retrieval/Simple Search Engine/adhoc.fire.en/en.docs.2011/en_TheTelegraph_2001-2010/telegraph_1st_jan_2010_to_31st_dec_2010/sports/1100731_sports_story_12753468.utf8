The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India widen gap, retain top spot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team India widen gap, retain top spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Team India retained their No.1 status in the ICC Test rankings after the annual update, earning the right to finish the year at the coveted spot following a draw in the second five-dayer versus Sri Lanka, in Colombo, on Friday.         
	The update sees the Mahendra Singh Dhonis widen the gap between themselves and second-placed South Africa to 11 ratings points  a gain of six ratings points taking India to 130 while the Proteas dropped one point to 119.         
	Sri Lanka, who had challenged India for the top spot with their triumph in the first Test at Galle, slipped to the fifth position. But the Kumar Sangakkaras can jump to second if they win the third Test.         
	It was annual update time for the ODI table as well and here India were second behind Australia after replacing South Africa who lost four ratings points.         
	Graeme Smiths side, who were tied with India on 119 ratings points before the annual update, have slipped to 115 ratings points after some excellent results achieved in 2006-07 were dropped off the rankings calculations.         
	Australia retained their No.1 position and also gained one rating point after the annual update that puts them 14 points clear of India.         
	In the Test rankings, though, Indias 11-point lead at the top will be short-lived following their failure to win the series in Sri Lanka.         
	If India win the third Test (which starts in Colombo, on Tuesday) to draw the series at one-all, they will drop to 127 ratings points, while Sri Lanka will move into third place on 115 rating points, ahead of both Australia and England.         
	If the Test is drawn, India will slip to 124 ratings points, just five points ahead of both South Africa and Sri Lanka. However, Kumar Sangakkaras side will be placed just below Graeme Smiths side when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.         
	Another defeat for India will not only see them plummet to 122 ratings points but will also lift Lanka to 121 ratings points and into second position on the Test Championship for only the second time ever.         
	The ODI list welcomed a new member when the Netherlands earned the right to a place on it as a reward for winning against a full member and also for managing to come out on top in more than 60 per cent of their matches against other Associate Members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Udana stars in Wayamba win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Udana stars in Wayamba win
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Left-arm pacer Isuru Udana recorded the first hattrick of the Champions League Twenty20 as Wayamba Elevens crushed Central Districts by 75 runs, in their last league match of the tournament, here Wednesday.         
	Already out of semi-final contention, it was a consolation win for the Sri Lankan side, who havent won even a single match so far.         
	Wayamba put up a modest total of 144 for six and then bundled out the New Zealand side for a paltry 70, riding on Udanas spectacular hattrick, that came in the third over of Central Districts innings.         
	Udana removed Brad Patton (1), Mathew Sincliar (0) and George Worker (0) in his second over to trigger a batting collapse.         
	Udana first dismissed Patton, caught behind in the fourth ball, and Sinclair was stumped down the leg side off a wide delivery. The left-arm paceman then bowled Worker to trigger wild celebrations.         
	The New Zealander outfit never recovered from the deadly setback and could not even bat for the quota of 20 overs, as they were skittled out in only 15.3 overs.         
	Spinner Ajantha Mendis (3/14) was also successful as the New Zealand side cut a sorry figure, heading home without any wins.           (PTI)

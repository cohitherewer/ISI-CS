	Calcutta: India opener Virender Sehwag remained the highest-ranked Indian batsman in the latest ICC Test rankings issued Sunday as he retained the second spot. Sachin Tendulkar was placed at the fourth spot.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara leads the batting chart while Australian Michael Clarke is on the third spot.         
	In the bowlers list, Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Aamer has rocketed to a career-best 17th after playing a leading role in his sides four-wicket victory over England.         
	The Indian duo of Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh were at the seventh and eighth spot respectively. England off-spinner Graeme Swann has gained one place to regain his second position.         
	In the rankings for batsmen, Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf, Umar Akmal and Azhar Ali, and Englands Alastair Cook and Matt Prior all bettered their rankings. Yousuf, who scored 56 and 33, has climbed two places to the 14th position.         
	There is no change in the top five rankings for Test all-rounders with Jacques Kallis of South Africa leading the field.         
	Meanwhile, Englands four-wicket defeat has ended their chances of moving ahead of fourth-placed Australia in the ICC Test Championship.

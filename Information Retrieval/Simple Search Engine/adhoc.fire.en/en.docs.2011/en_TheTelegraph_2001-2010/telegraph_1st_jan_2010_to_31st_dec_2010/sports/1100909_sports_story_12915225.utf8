The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wont be fair to ban team: Ricky 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wont be fair to ban team: Ricky 
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: The spot-fixing scandal should be dealt in an appropriate manner but it would be unfair to ban the whole Pakistan team for the alleged involvement of their three players, feels Australia captain Ricky Ponting.         
	I think thats going a bit too far. Lets just start with the people we know about at the moment and make sure theyre dealt with in the appropriate manner, Ponting said.         
	I think to ban a whole team would probably be a bit unfair. The world game doesnt really need that, (and) cant really afford that to happen. I know the world game cant afford these sorts of scandals happening in the game either, he was quoted as saying on television.         
	Three Pakistani players  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer  are being investigated in the spot-fixing scandal which surfaced after a British tabloid sting operation.         
	Ponting said the Australian team are aware of anti-corruption laws and their responsibilities.         
	We as an Australian group of players are educated very well on this and know how to handle different situations that pop up, said Ponting.         
	The Australian team will leave for a Test and ODI tour of India on September 19.         
	Former Australian opening batsman Matthew Hayden has called on the cricket fraternity to resolve in order to weed out the corrupt practices like match-fixing from the game.         
	If governments cant control illegal gambling then what chance has a small organisation like the ICC got of making an impact on the global footprint of gambling.         
	The only way that you can build integrity into the sport is if players and administrators make the choice to reject corruption and choose integrity, Hayden said.         
	There is no other way. The decision has to be made by those in the trenches and those on the front line because there is not enough resources to do anything different, the left-hander added.         
	Meanwhile, former South Africa captain Clive Rice thinks that the menace of match-fixing is life threatening and its time the ICC steps in and take stringent actions.

  - Weather permitting, Kirsten confident of wrapping it up today       A STAFF REPORTER            On Wednesday, when rain dictated terms at Eden Gardens, umpire Ian Gould, who has been doing an excellent job in the Test, decided to give a lesson or two to Ishant Sharma.

	Calcutta: Team India coach Gary Kirsten is confident that his wards can wrap it up if they get to bowl around 40 to 50 overs on Thursday, the final day of the second Test against South Africa. Kirsten didnt hide his disappointment at the news conference as he said that the proceedings on the day could have started a bit earlier than the 10.30am start.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	On being hit hard by the weather         
	Obviously, this morning when we arrived here, we could have played in. It was disappointing not to be on the field then. Thats the way it is. We cant fight weather.         
	Chances of getting even in the series         
	Weve a pretty good chance of winning tomorrow (Thursday). The boys are in a positive frame of mind. We had got a good start by taking three wickets Now its matter of taking seven wickets on the final day.         
	Minimum number of overs that his bowlers would require         
	We would be happy to get as many as we can, but hopefully we will require 40 to 50 overs. We have done what we needed to do. We will give our best shot tomorrow (Thursday).         
	The most important dismi ssal         
	(Jacques) Kalliss dismissal was really important. We bowled to our strengths. Amit (Mishra) really bowled well. So did Harbhajan (Singh). With Ishant (Sharma) and Zaheer (Khan) there in the team, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve the targets we have set.         
	On cracking the Hashim Amla code         
	You think Im going to tell you that? Obviously, he is batting very well. Its now up to us to make sure we get him out. The best part about our bowling is that they have bowled in good areas most of the time.         
	The batsmens performance         
	I have spoken about this before also. We have not become the No. 1 Test nation for nothing They are breaking world records. In the last couple of years, there has been quite a few occasions when they have come back hard with their backs to the wall.         
	Laxmans innings         
	He is a high quality player. It was a great day for batting and we all know what he is capable of.         
	If rain plays spoilsport on Day V         
	There is nothing we can do about that. We are proud of our performance. We got only 34 overs today and got three wickets. It would have been good if we would have got 50 overs today. Tomorrow, the pressure will be on them. I would have been happy if we could have got five wickets.         
	On the session with Mike Horn         
	Paddy Upton (mental conditioning expert) knew him (Mike Horn) and it was nice that he spend some time with the players.         
	The pitch         
	The pitch has really played well throughout the Test. Its an even paced wicket and there is quite some bounce for the spinners which will come in handy.         
	Mood in the dressing room         
	If we are able to built pressure, we can make it count.

  - Indian Wells
  -   Its a fantastic feeling, says 31-year-old Croat               Ivan Ljubicic in Indian Wells, on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Indian Wells: Croat Ivan Ljubicic celebrated his first Masters 1000 title after upsetting seventh-seeded American Andy Roddick 7-6, 7-6 in the final of the Indian Wells ATP tournament on Sunday.         
	The big-serving Ljubicic, seeded 20th, fired down 20 aces and hit 42 winners to seal an emotional victory in just over two hours on the stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.         
	Appearing in his fourth Masters final, the 31-year-old clinched the second-set tie-break 7-5 after unleashing a booming service winner before thrusting both arms skywards.         
	Ljubicic then removed his sweatband before walking to the net to shake hands with Roddick, who had saved three match points in the tiebreak after clawing his way back from 5-1 down         
	Its a really fantastic feeling to finally have it, former world No. 3 Ljubicic said after earning the crystal winners trophy and his 10th ATP title.         
	Ljubicic had played some of the best tennis of his life here, eliminating second seed Novak Djokovic in the fourth round and third seed Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals.         
	The 6ft 4in (1.93m) Croat maintained that form in Sundays final with an all-round power game shrewdly mixed with clever angles and deft touches at the net.         
	Roddick, bidding to become the first American champion here since Andre Agassi in 2001, made a poor start and trailed 0-40 on serve in the opening game before recovering to hold.         
	He then had Ljubicic in similar trouble in the fourth but the Croat dug his way back to hold after blasting consecutive aces before hitting a backhand winner down the line.         
	Neither player was broken, however, and the set went into a tie-break which Ljubicic clinched 7-3 after hitting an exquisite forehand crosscourt pass.         
	The second set also went with serve, although Roddick was unable to convert two break points in the ninth game when his opponent responded each time with strong first serves.         
	The match went into another tie-break and again Ljubicic held the upper hand.         
	The Croat delivered back-to-back aces to lead 4-1 and he extended that advantage to 5-1 after Roddick netted a forehand.         
	Although the American saved three match points while battling back to 5-6, Ljubicic made no mistake with his fourth opportunity with a kicking first serve Roddick was unable to return.

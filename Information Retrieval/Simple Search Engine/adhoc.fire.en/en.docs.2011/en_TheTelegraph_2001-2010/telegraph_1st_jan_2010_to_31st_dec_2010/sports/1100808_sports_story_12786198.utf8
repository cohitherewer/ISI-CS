The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When India wins, I win: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        When India wins, I win: Sachin
  - Maestro praises knock by Laxman, says the centurion really batted superbly       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Colombo: Gone was the stubble, with Sachin Tendulkar looking every bit the brand ambassador of cricket that he is.         
	And, yes, hed been generous with Hugo Boss.         
	Ready to head for the last team meeting before the Test specialists went home, on Saturday evening, Sachin said: When India wins, I win. If India loses, its as if Ive lost... Before every game, theres just one objective  to win.         
	Sachin didnt get a hundred in the match where he became the most capped Test cricketer, but nevertheless contributed 41 and 54, runs worth their weight in gold.         
	The accumulator of hundreds praised MoM V.V.S. Laxman, with whom he had a decisive 100-plus partnership in the final innings.         
	A fantastic innings (103 not out), he really batted superbly... Ive seen Laxman batting for many years and Ive seen plenty of such knocks... He has scored on difficult wickets and helped India win...         
	Sachin complimented teammates, too, for quickly recovering from the 10-wicket thrashing in Galle, venue of the first Test.         
	We showed a lot of character after the first two days at the SSC (second Test)... The bowlers did very well, the batters contributed and the tail chipped in as well... It was important to try and level the series and, in that, we succeeded. To win is a great feeling.         
	Sachin dismissed a suggestion, during a media conference, that his 203 at the SSC proved to be the turning point of the series.         
	I wouldnt say so... In fact, I cant... There were partnerships and others did make contributions...         
	Asked if he was hoping to complete 200 Test appearances, Sachin laughed and replied: I dont know as 31 more remain (to reach 200)... That will take a lot of time... Right now, Im enjoying my cricket and it has been an honour to represent the country.         
	For over two decades...         
	Later, talking to The Telegraph, Sachin said that, once home (early Sunday), hed take a break and only concentrate on the rehab specific to his left groin.         
	He played the all-important final Test despite soreness in that region.         
	Once the rehab is over, Sachin will look to prepare for next months Champions League, in South Africa. Hes been rested for the tri-series, in Dambulla.

  -   Tipsarevic gets better of India No.1; Cilic survives Granollers scare

	Chennai: The Indian challenge in the singles event of the $450,000 Chennai Open ended Wednesday with Somdev Dev Varman losing his second round battle against Serbias Janko Tipsarevic.         
	The vociferous support that the Indian star received from the near-capacity crowd at the Nungambakkam tennis stadium hardly made a difference as the well-built Serbian ran away with a 6-2, 6-1 victory in 78 minutes to enter the quarter finals.         
	Earlier, defending champion Marin Cilic survived a scare before beating a gritty Marcel Granollers of Spain 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4 to make the last eight.         
	A lot of hopes were pinned on Somdev, the only survivor in the singles event, to keep the Indian flag flying but the skill and class of Tipsarevic had a telling effect on the 24-year-old Indian.         
	Never for a moment, did Somdev look like having any say in the match despite breaking the Serb twice in the first set.         
	The Indian Davis Cupper caved in rather meekly after a rousing start that saw him breaking his opponent in the first game and repeating the feat in the third game. The crowd went ecstatic but their spirits were dampened soon. The source of the problem was Somdevs own serve.         
	Throughout the first set, Somdev failed to hold on to his serve. Things were no better in the second set and the Indian eventually lost his way.         
	But then, to say Somdev suffered only because of poor service would be to deny Tipsarevic his due. The Serb was a majestic presence in the middle with his graceful forehands and lethal backhands.         
	On the other hand, played some inspiring tennis in the second and the third sets to quell the challenge of a man who looked good enough to run away with the match.         
	Tall and athletic, Cilic looked sluggish in the first set, especially in the tiebreaker, committing too many unforced errors. But just when his opponent looked like taking a grip on proceedings, Cilic returned to his usual self.         
	In the earlier matches, Santiago Giraldo defeated Jan Hajek 6-4, 6-2 and Thiemo de Bakker defeated Robin Hasse 6-3, 6-4.         
	Later in the evening, Indias Yuki Bhambri paired up with Carlos Moya to beat Robby Ginepri and Dudi Sela 6-2, 4-6, 10-5 in the doubles.         
	Later in the night, the Indian doubles pair of Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna were leading 6-3, 5-5 against James Cerretani and Travis Rettenmaier when the match was suspended because of rain.

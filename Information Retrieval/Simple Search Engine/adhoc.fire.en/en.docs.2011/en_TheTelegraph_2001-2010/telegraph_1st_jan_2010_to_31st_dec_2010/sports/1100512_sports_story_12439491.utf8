The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand is king again
                                                                                                                       7                                        Anand is king again
    - Indian GrandMaster beats challenger Topalov in 56 moves                 Viswanathan Anand                           
	Sofia: Viswanathan Anand retained the World Chess Championship Tuesday, beating Bulgarian Veselin Topalov in the final game here.         
	Anand achieved an improbable win playing with black in the final game to retain the world title by a 6.5-5.5 margin after the end of the 12th and final game here.         
	Experts all over the world had predicted that Topalov, at his worst, will draw the last game under normal time control and the match would then head to the rapid tie-breaker.         
	However, it was not to be as Topalov, trying to look for complications, went haywire in a slightly difficult position and could not recover as Anand kept dealing one lethal blow after another to notch up a fourth world title in 11 years.         
	In 2008, Anand won the world title in a match against Russian Vladimir Kramnik, in 2006 he won the world championship tournament ahead of almost all top players in the world, and in 2000, he won when the championship was held on a knockout basis.         
	If the last game was any indication, Anand had indeed reserved his best for it as he knew Topalov will go all out for a win. The reason for Topalovs unwarranted aggression was probably based on the fact that Anand is by far regarded the best rapid chess player in history, and Topalov is not among the best in that format. Naturally, the Bulgarian wanted to avoid the tiebreaker.         
	Anand came up with another opening surprise as he went back to the basics. The Queens Gambit declined as black has a solid reputation and it stood up for Anands quest as the Indian ace went for the rock-solid Lasker variation.         
	Topalov, tried to create complications, but when the game headed towards a perfect balance, the Bulgarian lost his cool. The decisive moment of the game came on the 32nd move when Topalov made a blunder.         
	What followed was a feast for the Indian as he could attack the white king at will. All of Anands pieces joined the party and threats of checkmate loomed large on Topalov. For once, the support of the home crowd did not matter.         
	Anand, apparently, made a mistake on the infamous 40th move, but his position was so commanding that it did not spoil his game. Topalov fought on for some time before giving up as the Indian won in 56 moves.         
	But the going has not been all that smooth for Anand in this 12-game rubber. If on Tuesday he overwhelmed the Bulgarian with superior tactics, in 10th and the 11th games the world champion found himself struggling to hold a determined Topalov.         
	Anand ultimately prevailed by winning the last game but Topalov, too, had two wins while seven games were drawn.         
	Thus, it can be said that the world champion was not able to display his superior form in this match. After losing the first game and winning the second and fourth thereafter, Anands best chance was in game nine when he missed multiple winning opportunities. Game 10, again, was a draw.         
	But Anand had to dig in his heels to salvage half-a-point in game No.11. Topalov pushed the world champion to the brink from where Anand had to use his endgame skills to avoid defeat.         
	That took the fight to the final game where Topalov, who was to play with white pieces, held the edge.         
	 But then Anand turned on the style and underlined his standing as one of the greatest to have graced the game.

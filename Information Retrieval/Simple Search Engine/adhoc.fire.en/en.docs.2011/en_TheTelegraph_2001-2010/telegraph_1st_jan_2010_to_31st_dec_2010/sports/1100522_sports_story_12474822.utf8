    - Champions League Bayern, Inter fight for title today             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Inter Milan players during a training session in Madrid, on Friday. (AP)                                 
	The final days of the emperor Jose Mourinho  part magnificent Caesar, part barking Caligula  have been marked by a kind of biblical madness.         
	Mourinho sei un grandissimo! Non puoi andartene via! wailed a kid amid the throng banging on his car outside the gates of Inter Milans training complex in Appiano Gentile. Oh great one, you cant go!         
	A banner swaying above Inters 50,000 celebrating tifosi in Milans Piazza del Duomo read simply Il Profeta, sure in its belief that this prophet would lead Inter to the promised land of European Cup glory for the first time in 45 years.         
	Thus Saturdays Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan is so much more than just one game of soccer for both these European giants. Myriad intertwined storylines promising an intriguing night whatever happens on the field.         
	The first final to be played on a Saturday brings together two teams gunning for trebles and is crucial to whether Germany or Italy have four Champions League qualifying berths from 2011.         
	The future of Inters larger-than-life coach, who learnt part of his trade under Bayern boss Louis van Gaal  a friend who gave him his major break as his Barcelona assistant  will also be decided after the game with the Portuguese tempted to quit for Real Madrid.         
	If he does leave after taking 1964 and 1965 winners Inter to their first final since 1972, it will be because of his hatred of the Italian press and soccer establishment rather than any problems he has with the club or his beloved players.         
	I love everybody. From the first to the last they give everything. They are great the way they have survived this incredible season playing a match every three days, Mourinho said.         
	Van Gaals future appears to be more clear cut after the Dutchman said he would stay even if Bayern seal a treble, reversing a decision he took some months ago.         
	A defeat can happen in the final... but it would be unbelievable if you won the treble with a new team and a new coach in the first season, said Van Gaal.         
	Many German football fans are viciously envious of the four-time winners but most will be rooting for them on Saturday given a win for Bayern or a draw after 120 minutes would mean four Bundesliga clubs will enter the Champions League pots for the 2011/12 season at the expense of one Italian team.         
	Under Uefas coefficient rules, Inter need to win without penalties to keep the status quo of Serie A having four Champions League slots, one a qualifying round berth.         
	The match itself is struggling to avoid becoming a side issue with neutrals moaning that a Bayern versus Inter final is one of the most boring they could have imagined.         
	Both coaches have hit back, saying their sides can put on a great show despite their tough-tackling traits.         
	Some flair will be missing, though. Bayern winger Franck Ribery and Inters stylish midfielder Thiago Motta are suspended after being dismissed in the semi-finals.         
	Apart from Ribery, Van Gaal has a full squad to chose from with Hamit Altintop the likely replacement for the Frenchman while Mourinhos only variable is whether to play 4-3-1-2 or a 4-2-3-1 with Goran Pandev or Mario Balotelli on the wing.         
	Inter have won repeated Italian titles with barely any Italians in their starting line-up and a side packed with talented and hugely experienced players from Brazil and Argentina, and a creative Dutch midfielder in Wesley Sneijder.         
	Van Gaals team have a strong Dutch influence, too, with Arjen Robben and Marc van Bommel playing alongside Germany internationals Bastian Schweinsteiger and Philipp Lahm.         
	Van Bommel will clash with fellow tough guy Esteban Cambiasso in midfield with the Dutch captain eager for a second Champions League winners medal after clinching the title with Barcelona four years ago.         
	This team has grown together and everything works, Van Bommel said, donning the expensive watch given to him by the Catalan club after their victory in 2006.         
	We will be ready and we should not change a thing from what we have been doing because we want to win this thing with the big ears (the trophy).

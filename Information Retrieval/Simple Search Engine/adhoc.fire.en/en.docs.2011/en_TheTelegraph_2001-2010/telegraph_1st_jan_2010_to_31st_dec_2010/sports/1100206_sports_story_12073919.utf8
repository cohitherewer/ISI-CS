	Dubai: Jeev Milkha Singh slid off the lead to the 10th place after a modest level-par 72 while Shiv Kapur and SSP Chowrasia squeezed themselves inside the cut line after the second round of the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament here Friday.         
	Meanwhile, it was end of all roads for former Asia No. 1 Jyoti Randhawa (148), Anirban Lahiri (152) and Arjun Atwal (154) who finished outside the cut line set at 146.         
	Overnight joint leader Jeevs three birdies got wiped off by an equal number of bogeys as the Indian aggregated four-under 140 to lie four-strokes behind leader Thongchai Jaidee (66) of Thailand.         
	A 10th tee starter, Jeev birdied the 12th hole but a bogey at the 17th meant he took the turn at level-par.         
	His front nine also didnt make things any better as he hit a birdie-bogey-birdie patch from third to fifth hole before losing another stroke at the ninth.         
	Shiv, on the other hand, was one-over at the turn but a couple of birdies at the 10th and 13th hole ensured him a below-par finish at tied 47th.         
	Playing his back nine first, Chowrasia dropped birdies at the 10th and 13th hole, which were negated by bogeys at the 15th and 16th hole. However, the Calcutta-pro didnt lose heart and picked up a birdie hat-trick in the second, third and fourth hole and although he lost a stroke on the eighth, he picked another birdie at the ninth to sneak inside the cut line at tied 53.         
	At the top, there is a three-way tie for the second place among Miquel Angel Jimenez (67), Stephen Dodd (69) and Lee Westwood (65) with a two-day total of seven-under 137.         
	Jimenez, the Spanish Ryder Cup player, reached 8-under 136 with a birdie at the 9th hole  his last  to open up a two shot advantage over his playing partner Rory McIlroy. The young player from Northern Ireland, who share the first-round lead, shot a 70 to be two strokes back.         
	Welshman Stephen Dod completed a 3-under 69 to share the lead.         
	Jimenez had trailed defending champion McIlroy by three shots until a reversal of fortunes at their last hole.         
	While Jimenez sank his birdie, McIlroy drove into the rough, then put his 7-iron recovery shot into water short of the green and finished with a double bogey.         
	Jimenez sank at least four putts from beyond 15 feet while making seven birdies, and gave thanks to his temporary caddy  a Dubai flower importer and family friend.         
	He may be in business now, but he did caddy on the tour for a time, said Jimenez. And we have remained close friends and that is important out on the course.But it is only for this week whatever happens in the final round on Sunday.         
	Despite his late blunder, 20-year-old McIlroy still believed he could join Tiger Woods and Ernie Els as two-time winners of the event. I am happy with the situation heading into the weekend, said McIlroy. Apart from that mistake at the last it was a really good days work.         
	Scoring on the second day was much lower than it had been during the opening round as Thursdays fierce sandstorm had blown over. And with clouds in the Dubai skies accompanied by a threat of rain, it was a cool, calm morning.

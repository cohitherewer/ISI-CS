                                                                                                                       7                                        PCB confirms appointment
                  Waqar Younis                     
	Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to appoint former captain Waqar Younis as the new coach of the national team. The PCB chairman Ijaz Butt on Tuesday confirmed that the board has reached an agreement with Waqar and he would take the charge soon.         
	We will issue an official statement later but from now Waqar is the new coach of the team, Butt said. He however refused to divulge details about the contract being offered to Waqar but well informed sources revealed that contract runs until the 2011 World Cup. Former Test cricketer Ijaz Ahmed will continue as bating and fielding coach.         
	Ijaz will be the assistant coach of the team. We are looking at appointing a foreign consultant in June when the team goes to England this year, Butt said.         
	The decision to appoint Waqar came after the legendary pacer gave his approval to the board but not before minor changes were carried out in the contract.         
	I will sign the contract this week and will take charge of the team soon as we need to start preparations for the T20 World Cup, said Waqar, who is currently based in Sydney. (PTI)

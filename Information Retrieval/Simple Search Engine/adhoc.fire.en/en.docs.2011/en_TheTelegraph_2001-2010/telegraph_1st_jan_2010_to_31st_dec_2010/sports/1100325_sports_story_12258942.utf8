            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: National football coach Bob Houghton has once again stressed on the need for India to improve its sporting infrastructure, citing the example of the US.         
	The 1994 World Cup was held in America, which was a controversial decision. But, the US are eyeing the Cup this year. They have gone from nowhere to No.16 in the Fifa world rankings, Bob said at the India International Sports Summit, a two-day event that commenced Wednesday.         
	Bob said India could never hope to qualify for the World Cup given the current condition. We have only one stadium (in Chennai) in the country which can be used for Cup qualifying events, he quipped.

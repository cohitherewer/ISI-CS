The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Senior players may be dropped, hints Mohsin
                                                                                                                       7                                      Senior players may be dropped, hints Mohsin
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans chief selector Mohsin Khan Monday gave a clear indication that some senior players like Kamran Akmal and Shoaib Malik could be missing from the World Cup preliminary squad but said there would be enough talent in the national team to do well in the mega event.         
	No player is irreplaceable and life goes on. Similar is the case with Pakistan cricket. Even if we lose some of our leading players it would be a setback but not something that would mean we wont be able to do well in our coming series and tournaments, Mohsin said. Let me make it very clear that we cant announce any team without first getting clearance from the Board. Every selection we make for every tour or series, we need the approval of the Board. he said.         
	Reports said that besides the three suspended players  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer  Pakistan could also be without other leading players who have not got clearance from the ICC or PCB to play international cricket.         
	Kamran and Danish Kaneria last week met with the Board officials to find out why they were being ignored for national selection.         
	The national selectors are scheduled to announce the World Cup preliminary squad on Wednesday after meeting with the PCB chairman Ijaz Butt. Mohsin also made it clear that they had been told in clear terms by the Board not to make any compromises on fitness or discipline. We will not pick unfit players. Players have to be passed by the medical panel to be included, the former opener said.         
	He also noted that the forthcoming tour to New Zealand would be a difficult one for Pakistan as batting conditions there were never easy.         
	The PCB meanwhile, has finally permitted five of its leading players to travel to Malaysia for a commercial shoot in relation to the World Cup.         
	A PCB spokesman said on Monday that Shahid Afridi, Younis Khan, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul and Abdul Razzaq had been given permission to travel to Malaysia for two days for the shoot.

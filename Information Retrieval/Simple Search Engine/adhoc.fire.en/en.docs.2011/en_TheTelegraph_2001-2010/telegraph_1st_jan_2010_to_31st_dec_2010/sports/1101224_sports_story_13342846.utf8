	Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema scored hattricks to lead Real Madrid to an 8-0 rout of Levante on Wednesday in the round of 16 in the Spanish Kings Cup.         
	Ronaldo has now scored 25 goals in 24 matches in all competitions for Madrid this season.         
	Mesut Oezil and Pedro Leon also scored Wednesday as Jose Mourinhos team dominated the first leg at Santiago Bernebeu stadium from the start, shrugging off their indifferent form in the 1-0 win against Sevilla at the weekend.         
	Benzema scored the sixth-minute opener by slaloming through the defence and beating goalkeeper Gustavo Munua with a low strike.         
	Oezil doubled Madrids advantage four minutes later after Ronaldo had recovered the ball near the halfway line and raced forward to set up the Germany playmaker near the penalty spot.         
	Benzema added Madrids third in the 32nd, charging into the area to finish off a pass from Angel di Maria. The France striker set up Ronaldo inside the six-yard box for the fourth right on halftime.         
	Benzema chipped Munua from a great pass by Di Maria in the 70th, before Ronaldo scored in the 72nd and 74th minutes.         
	Pedro Leon capped the demolition in the 90th. Simao Sabrosas first-half penalty gave Atletico Madrid a 1-0 win over Espanyol with both teams having a player sent off.         
	Simao converted the 33rd-minute spot kick after Espanyol defender Jordi Amat was ruled to have handled in the area.         
	Atletico winger Jose Antonio Reyes was sent off in the 42nd minute for head-butting Espanyol forward Jesus Datolo, and the visitors went a man down when Victor Ruiz was sent off in the 68th.         
	Atletico president Enrique Cerezo recently said Simao will soon be transferred to Besiktas in Turkey, and the Portugal winger received a standing ovation from the crowd at Vicente Calderon stadium when he was substituted late.         
	I want to thank Simao like the fans have, Atletico coach Quique Sanchez Flores said. He is a brilliant player and it has been an honour to coach him. Koffi Romaric scored twice in Sevillas 5-3 win over Malaga, Jose Ulloa hit a hattrick to give Almeria a 4-3 win over Mallorca, and Getafe beat second-division team Real Betis 2-1.         
	At Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium, Alejandro Alfaro put Sevilla ahead with a rising shot in the 11th. Jose Rondon equalised for Malaga in the 19th with an individual effort, and teammate Quincy Qwusu-Abeye outpaced the defence and crossed for Rondon to score his second in the 26th.         
	Sevilla drew level again when Alvaro Negredo headed home a cross by Romaric in the 32nd, but Rondon returned the favour to set Qwusu-Abeye to score Malagas third in the 41st.         
	Romaric made it 3-3 in the 67th with a left-footed shot off a pass from Frederic Kanoute, and the Sevilla midfielder picked up his double with a header in the 82nd.         
	Diego Capel capped Sevillas win a minute later with a shot from inside the area.         
	Ulloa put Almeria ahead from the penalty spot in the seventh minute, but Mallorca equalized with a volleyed strike from Canadian midfielder Jonathan de Guzman in the 22nd.

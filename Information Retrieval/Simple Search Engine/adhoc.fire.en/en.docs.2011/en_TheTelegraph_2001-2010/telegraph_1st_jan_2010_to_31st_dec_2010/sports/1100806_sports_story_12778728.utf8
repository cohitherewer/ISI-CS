The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru: Must bowl tight 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru: Must bowl tight 
            A CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag is congratulated by his teammates, after taking a wicket, in Colombo, on Thursday. (Reuters)                           
	India opener Virender Sehwag was his usual flamboyant self as he hit a 105-ball 109 in the first innings of the final Test, against Sri Lanka, at the P. Sara Oval, on Thursday. His innings gave the Indians the momentum which they carried successfully to put up 436 on the board.         
	Speaking at a media conference after the days play, Sehwag sounded satisfied with his all-round show having pocketed two wickets as well. He also praised the Indian tailenders for their valiant effort.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His performance on the day         
	Ive been very lucky to score a hundred and take two wickets. Hopefully, we will do well tomorrow (Friday) also and win this Test...         
	On his aggressive innings         
	I was looking for opportunities to score runs, where I can hit the ball. I dont play boring cricket.         
	Any special plans while batting against Sri Lanka         
	I play in the same manner against Sri Lanka like I play against other countries. I dont changing anything. The moment I hit two or three boundaries, the opposition spread the field and bowl short outside the off-stump. Then its easy to get the batsmen out. But if you are lucky, only then you can get him out. If I make a mistake, only then will I get out.         
	Indian tailenders batting         
	Yes of course, at one stage we were 350 for seven and after that, (Abhimanyu) Mithun and Amit Mishra batted really well. They were responsible for us getting the lead Full credit goes to the tailenders.         
	If India could have scored a little more         
	If you see, we got an opportunity bowl 17 odd overs and we got two wickets. It is a good opportunity for us. I am not looking at what could have happened. We are really happy with the way things panned out. Our target was to bat full day That was the idea and we tried. But sometimes you click and sometimes you dont. You cant say that shot selection was not good because everybody was allowed to play their own shots. Nothing wrong with that.         
	Bowling in the right areas         
	Weve been following the process, bowling in good areas and getting help from the wicket. If we get Mahela and Sanga out early, then we will be in the game But we must bowl tight We must not concede too many runs and yet take wickets regularly.         
	Ideal score to chase         
	Anything less than 200.         
	On the decision review system         
	It happens in cricket. Sometimes the umpire gives you good decision and sometimes a bad decision. But yes, I would love to have that referral system in Test cricket or in one-day cricket That is my personal opinion.         
	The P. Sara Oval wicket         
	We knew that wicket would turn on the third or fourth day. Its not turning that much, but there is a little bit of help for the spinners.

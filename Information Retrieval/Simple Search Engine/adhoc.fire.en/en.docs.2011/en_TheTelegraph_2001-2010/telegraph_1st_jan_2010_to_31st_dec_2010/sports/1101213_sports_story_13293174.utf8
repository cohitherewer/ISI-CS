	Calcutta/Margao: Stanley Rozario could feel the noose tightening around his neck after Mohun Bagan sunk to their second consecutive I-League defeat Sunday. Bagan started their I-League campaign on a jittery note and two defeats and a draw are not healthy signs for a side competing for a top-three finish.         
	The green and maroon brigade has been patchy and Stanleys experiments have backfired in most occasions this season. And Sundays loss to Churchill Brothers further accentuated his problems even though there was no official word on him losing his job with Bagan.         
	Rumour has it that the Bagan brass is not too happy with Stanley and are looking for an A licence coach. Though Stanley reportedly had not been told anything till Sunday, he might get the axe if Bagan faltered against defending champions Dempo at home this Thursday.         
	According to sources, Phillippe de Ridder could be the next man in charge as the Belgian is expected to be in the city this week. De Ridder had coached East Bengal last season.         
	It was Okolie Odafes brace, on Sunday that made life worse for Bagan.         
	Churchills plan to attack from the beginning worked as they scored as early as the third minute. Zakeer Mundampara, who gave a good account in the midfield, sent a cross to Odafe who got the better of two rival defenders before essaying a firm right-footer that beat goalkeeper Paul all ends up.         
	Meanwhile, in Kannur striker Sunil Kumars header in the last minute, saved the day for Pune FC, who managed to hold hosts Viva Kerala 1-1, at the Jawahar Municipal Stadium.

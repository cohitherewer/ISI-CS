The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai shut out Delhi 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mumbai shut out Delhi 
                      
	New Delhi: Rohit Sharma hit a classy 148 and added 191 runs for the fifth wicket with Prashant Naik to practically shut out Delhis chances of making it to the knock-out phase of the Ranji Trophy Super League.         
	At stumps on the third day, Mumbai were 487 for eight and stretched their lead to a massive 553 which is virtually impossible to chase down on the final day.         
	Resuming at 74 for two, Mumbai scored 413 on a single day as Delhi bowlers lost the plot in the last two sessions when the visitors were reduced to 169 for five before lunch.         
	After Rohit displayed his class for nearly four hours with good support from Naik, it was young Iqbal Abdulla who took the already demoralised Delhi attack to the cleaners with some lusty blows as the match became dead as a contest.         
	The match which was billed as a contest between two of the best young talents in the country  Rohit and Virat Kohli  went in favour of the Mumbai lad as his silken drives and pull-shots were an absolute delight to watch.

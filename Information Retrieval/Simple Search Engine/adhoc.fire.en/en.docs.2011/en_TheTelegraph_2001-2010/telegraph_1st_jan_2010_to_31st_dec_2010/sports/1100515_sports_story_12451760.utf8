The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chidi: Tough to do encore
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chidi: Tough to do encore
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: On October 25, last year, Edeh Chidi ensured that his name is etched in the memories of millions of Mohun Bagan fans. After all, in Bengals most enduring battle  an East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan clash  no one has ever had a quadruple strike for a side. The Nigerian knows only too well that supporters will expect an encore and, frankly speaking, thats a quite a task.         
	The Nigerian knows that very well. Sunday is a different day. Every time you cant score four goals. Yet, whenever I get a chance to watch the recording of that match, I get pumped up. I know what a derby means to the fans. More than winning the local league, a win against East Bengal worth much more, the striker told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Chidi, who is candid about his offers for the next season said he is not getting distracted by those feelers..         
	I will only start thinking about those once I am done with the Derby. I have told the officials to call me only after the East Bengal match is over, he said.         
	So, which are the clubs running after Bagans super sniper? Apart from Mohun Bagan where I have thoroughly enjoyed my stint, I have got good offers from Dempo and East Bengal too. Even Bagan officials have been very sincere in their approach. But I have told both Bagan and East Bengal officials that I would like to know about your interest after this match. Because if I commit any of them now and then I flunk in the big match, they might retract. Adjusting to any club is not a problem, the problem understanding which is the best offer, he added.         
	While Chidi is gearing up for a repeat act of October 25, Ghanaian veteran Yusif Yakubu is racing against time to get fit. Yakubu is nursing an ankle injury, which makes him a doubtful starter.         
	His absence upfront will lend a telling blow to Phillippe de Ridders plans. De Ridder may have hoped of giving Budiram Tudu a start but the in-form youngster is out with a calf-muscle injury.

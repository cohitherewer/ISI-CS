The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni is yet   to recover
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni is yet   to recover
  - Laxman going home; scan for Sreesanth       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                       
	Chittagong: V.V.S. Laxman was trying to make the most of an awful situation, by engaging in an adda session in Zaheer Khans room, when The Telegraph met him at the Peninsula Hotel on Thursday evening.         
	Also present there were Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh.         
	Laxmans teammates were, perhaps, trying to cheer him up. The tour, after all, has ended for the senior pro, all because of the injury to his left hand during the closing stages of Day IV, Wednesday.         
	Ive got these (micro) stitches on the webbing. I should recover in five days and intend to start my training in a weeks time, Laxman said.         
	Hell be taking a Dhaka-Mumbai flight on Friday and, then, avail of the earliest connection to Hyderabad.         
	While Laxman is missing the second and final Test, in Dhaka, from Sunday, hell be available for the home series against South Africa.         
	It begins on February 6.         
	No replacement has been sought, informed manager Arshad Ayub.         
	The other worrying development is that Sreesanth possibly has a major (left) hamstring problem and will undergo a scan in Dhaka.         
	He went off the field during the middle of a spell, on Thursday.         
	Meanwhile, regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is still not fit  apparently, he had back spasms during a light session on Wednesday, too.         
	The Dhoni-specific call, therefore, may not be made till Saturday afternoon.         
	If Dhoni cant play, then reserve opener Murali Vijay will have to feature in the middle-order. Thats because Dinesh Karthik would be assured of another Test and no replacement has been sought for Laxman.         
	As for Harbhajan Singh, he has recovered from a painful stiff neck. Main theek hoon, he insisted, before leaving for Dhaka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mourinho savours special win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mourinho savours special win
                            
	Milan: Inter Milan battled to a 2-1 win over an impressive Chelsea to hold a slight advantage after their Champions League last-16 first leg at the San Siro on Wednesday.         
	Home striker Diego Milito netted on three minutes when he easily turned John Terry and fired in at the near post from six metres, prompting little reaction from Inters former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho who had promised not to celebrate.         
	In Moscow, Sevilla are favourites to progress to the quarter finals after holding CSKA Moscow to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their last-16 clash on Wednesday, as briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition         
	Alvaro Negredo put the Spaniards in front after 25 minutes, taking advantage of CSKAs defensive miscue to tap the ball in from a Jesus Navas cross.         
	The Russians equalised through Chile winger Mark Gonzalez, who caught Sevilla keeper Andres Palop off-guard with a long-range strike in the 66th minute.         
	The Londoners dominated a thrilling game for long spells and Salomon Kalou deservedly equalised on 51 minutes with a 20-metre shot before Esteban Cambiasso soon put the hosts back ahead after his first shot was blocked.         
	Chelsea keeper Petr Cech was carried off on a stretcher in the second half with a calf injury but Carlo Ancelotti, who spent eight years at the San Siro as AC Milan coach, will be confident of turning the tie around in the second leg on March 16.         
	 quot;It was a high-level Champions League game, quot; Mourinho said. quot;I said to my players, they are not better than us, they are different to us.         
	 quot;Chelsea and Inter can both play better. This is the Champions League, it is difficult to fully express yourself because of the pressure. quot;         
	Just like rivals AC Milan in their defeat by Manchester United on the same pitch last week, Serie A champions Inter got off to a good start.         
	Thiago Motta threaded the ball forward and Samuel Eto miscontrolled it before strike partner Milito confirmed his excellent form this season by cutting in from the left and beating Cech at the near post.         
	Chelseas heads failed to drop despite the vast roar from the Inter crowd and they were soon troubling keeper Julio Cesar, playing despite being shaken in a car crash early this week.         
	Kalou, included on the left with Florent Malouda employed at left back, then had a strong shout for a penalty turned down on the stroke of halftime after a challenge by Walter Samuel five metres out. The Ivorian had his reward after 51 minutes when Julio Cesar failed to stop his curling shot through a crowd of players.         
	Argentine Cambiasso then grabbed the winner, blasting in at the second attempt from the edge of the box.         
	 quot;I think on the balance of play, possession, the shots we had, we were the stronger team, quot; said Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard. (Agencies)

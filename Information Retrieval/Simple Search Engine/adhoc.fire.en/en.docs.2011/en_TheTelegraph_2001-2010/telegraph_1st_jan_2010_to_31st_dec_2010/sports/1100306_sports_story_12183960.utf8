                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Forest Flair for Sprint
            HONKYDORY      
	The stage is set for the weekends racing festival, featuring the 1,200m Sprinters Cup, the 3,000m Stayers Cup, on Saturday, and the Indian Turf Invitation Cup on Sunday. The three events are sponsored by Vandrevala Foundation.          
	However, trainer Karthik Ganapathys Forest Flair (B. Prakash-up) gets the first call in the sprint event, in view of the horses recent track record.          
	The Stayers Cup, on the other hand, may see a close contest among Orochi, Conceptual and Washington Irvine. Conceptual, however, appears to have a slight edge over her two rivals

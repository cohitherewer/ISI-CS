            A STAFF REPORTER                                Jayanta Talukdar      
	Calcutta: Jayanta Talukdar, who recently won the recurve bronze medal at the World Cup finals, in Edinburgh, became the only Indian man to do so at that level. After achieving this feat, Talukdar felt that the competition at the Commonwealth Games will not be as tough as the Asian Games in November.         
	The team are fully geared up for the Commonwealth Games, but the field in Delhi will not be as tough as the one we are expecting in the Asian Games, Talukdar told The Telegraph, on Tuesday.         
	In Delhi, the English, Malaysians, Canadian and Australian archers will give us a fight. However, the field in Guangzhou, will comprise the worlds best. Archers from Korea, Chinese Taipei, Japan, China and Malaysia will be there. We are training for both, Delhi and the Asian Games, added Talukdar, who also won the individual recurve bronze and team gold at the World Cup archery Stage IV in Shanghai, in the beginning of this month.         
	At Delhi, we are aiming for the team gold. Tarundeep Rai, Rahul Banerjee and I have been training well and hope to accomplish the feat. In the individual category, we are aiming for two recurve medals at least, said the archer. The womens team are also training hard and we are expecting medals from them.         
	Choosing to distance himself from all the Commonwealth Games controversies, Talukdar said: We are trying to concentrate only on our game. The controversies are not our headache.

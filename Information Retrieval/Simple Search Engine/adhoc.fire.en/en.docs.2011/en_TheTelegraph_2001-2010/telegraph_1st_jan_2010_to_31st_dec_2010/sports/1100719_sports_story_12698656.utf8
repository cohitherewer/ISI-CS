                                                                                                                       7                                      Katich up to tied 6th spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australias Simon Katich has risen six places to be at joint sixth, with the West Indies Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the ICC Test batsmens ranking list. Gautam Gambhir also climbed up one spot, to be at No. 4.         
	Katich moved a place above Sachin Tendulkar on the list, which is currently headed by Virender Sehwag.         
	In the bowlers list, Mohammed Asif climbed two places to the second spot despite Pakistans loss to Australia, in the first Test.         
	With the Galle Test between India and Sri Lanka underway, the rankings of players from both teams are bound to change. Muttiah Muralidharan, playing his last Test, will be aiming to reach the 800-wicket mark. Such a feat could see him rise from his current fifth spot in the bowlers list.

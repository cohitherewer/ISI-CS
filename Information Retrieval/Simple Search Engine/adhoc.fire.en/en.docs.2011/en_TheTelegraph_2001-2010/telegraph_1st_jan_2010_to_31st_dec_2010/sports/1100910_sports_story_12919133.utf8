The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fernando Alonso has nothing to say
                                                                                                                       7                                        Fernando Alonso has nothing to say
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Alonso                           
	As preparations get under way for Sundays Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso had nothing to say about the F1 team orders controversy.         
	Ferrari were fined $100,000 by stewards at Hockenheim in July for ordering Brazilian Felipe Massa to let teammate Alonso overtake and win the German Grand Prix in a one-two finish.         
	Asked at his teams home race whether he felt any relief the sports governing body had decided to impose no further punishment on Ferrari, the Spaniard said: Its something that is the past for us and we need to concentrate on Monza.Its something we have talked about already too much.         
	I am happy to see the FIA (International Automobile Federation) will go deep into the rules and try to clarify (them). There is no special feeling, nothing to say, added Alonso.         
	The decision was something we were waiting for and were ready to respect, whatever it was ... we respect the decision, we keep everything as it was, points etc, so nothing changed for us.         
	The FIAs world motor sport council decided at a hearing in Paris on Wednesday to impose no further sanctions on the team but to review the rule that bars the use of such orders.         
	The decision kept Alonsos title hopes alive, although he is 41 points adrift of McLarens overall leader Lewis Hamilton with six races, or 150 points, remaining.         
	You win the title, you win the title, Alonso said when asked whether he would consider the title to be on a par with his other two if he won it this season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Neill rages at Terrys tackle 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Neill rages at Terrys tackle 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Martin Neill believes James Milner is exceptionally lucky to have his career intact after the Aston Villa midfielder was the victim of what his manager described as a horrendous challenge by Chelsea captain John Terry.         
	By beating Aston Villa 3-0, holders Chelsea reached their third FA Cup final in four seasons and manager Carlo Ancelotti is on course for the double in his first season as manager, but Neill felt his side had been the victim of injustice in the failure of Howard Webb to award an early penalty and to send off Terry with quarter of an hour left.         
	It was a horrendous challenge on an England colleague and James Milner is exceptionally lucky to have his career intact, Neill said. It was a red card. James is very sore and very, very lucky. We think he has got away with it because his leg was in the air but if you see the challenge, his knee bends out. Ive just spoken to the doctor and he says he is very, very lucky boy.         
	Luck was certainly not with Villa. Neill felt that his side were also denied a penalty in the 16th minute when John Obi Mikel brought down Gabriel Agbonlahor in the box.         
	The penalty was clear cut, Neill said. You could tell by the reaction of the Chelsea players that they knew it was a penalty. The referee has chosen to ignore it because of the possible consequences.         
	It was a clear goal-scoring opportunity so it was a clear sending off but we didnt even get the penalty. Referees should apply the law. Thats all Im looking for, a bit of fair play.         
	It was a case of history repeated for Neill. In the Carling Cup final at Wembley at the end of February Manchester Uniteds Nemanja Vidic was not sent off by referee Phil Dowd after fouling Agbonlahor when clean through on goal. Five weeks ago the referee bottled it completely, he said. And Im sitting here again talking about major incidents that change games, incontestable decisions. I dont know why he didnt make the decisions. Its just maddening.         
	On another poor Wembley pitch, Villa were the better side in the first half but Chelsea responded to Ancelottis angry half-time team-talk, taking the lead when Didier Drogba diverted in Terrys scuffed shot, meaning the Ivory Coast striker has scored in each of his five competitive appearances at Wembley.

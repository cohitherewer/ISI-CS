                                                                                                                       7                                        Lifters join the gold fest 
  - I trained during nights and never cared for sleep, says Chanu after win       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Manoj Kumar (lef) challenges Joe Agbonavbare of Nigeria during their 84 kg mens Greco-Roman match, on Wednesday. The Indian won a silver                                 
	New Delhi: After two days of disappointment, Indian lifters finally put a smile on the hosts face when they bagged both the gold medals at stake, at the Nehru Stadium Sports Complex.         
	With the shooters winning three more gold medals and the wrestlers adding one in Greco-Roman, Indias tally of gold medals went up to 11 on Wednesday.         
	The weightlifting gold rush started in the afternoon, with Renu Bala Chanu winning the 58kg title in the womens section with an overall lift of 197kg (90 kg snatch and 107 kg in clean and jerk), seven kg more than her gold-winning lift in the Melbourne Games, four years ago.         
	Later, K.Ravi Kumar added one more gold medal to the Indian tally in the 69kg category, lifting a total of 382 kg. He also equalled his own national mark in the process.         
	In wrestling, Rajender Kumar won the gold medal in the 55kg Greco-Roman event, defeating Azhar Hussein of Pakistan. Manoj Kumar won a silver in the 84kg event, while Sunil Kumar won a bronze in the 66kg. Dharmennder Dalal clinched a bronze in 120kg.         
	For Ravi Kumar, who comes from Orissa, the Commonwealth Games gold could only turn out to be the beginning of a great career. One of the best talents to emerge in the mens section in many years, Ravi Kumar has the capability to succeed on the big stage.         
	Given his ability, Ravi can win Asian Games and Olympic medals, said Indian coach D.D.Sharma. He is tremendously focussed and a hard worker. We were sure about his winning the gold, said the coach.         
	Equally dedicated is Renu Bala, a product of the Lucknow Sports Hostel. She joined the hostel from Manipur in 2004 and for the next four years never asked for leave to go back home.         
	I trained three times a day for this gold. I trained during nights and never cared for my sleep. It means a lot to me, said an emotional Chanu after the victory.         
	Last time I had lifted very less and still won the gold. My aim was to lift as much as I can this time, she added.         
	Australias Seen Lee came second best in the competition, lifting 192kg (86 kg in snatch and 106 kg in clean and jerk).         
	The biggest surprise came when 16-year-old Zoe Smith of England lifted a decent 188kg (85 kg in snatch and 103 kg in clean and jerk) to secure the bronze medal in her first ever senior international event. The gymnast turned weightlifter also won the gold in the Youth Commonwealth Games, in 2008, in Pune.             The Indian gold winners at the Commonwealth Games, on Wednesday: Shooters Anisa Sayyed (25m pistol), Omkar Singh (50m pistol), weightlifters Renu Bala Chanu (58 kg category) and K. Ravi Kumar (69 kg category) and wrestler Rajender Kumar (55 kg category).

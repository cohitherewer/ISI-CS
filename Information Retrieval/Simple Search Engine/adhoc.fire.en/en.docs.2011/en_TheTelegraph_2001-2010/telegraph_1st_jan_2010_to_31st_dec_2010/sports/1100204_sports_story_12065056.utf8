The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Question mark over Karims future
                                                                                                                       7                                      Question mark over Karims future
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Karim Bencharifas days as Mohun Bagan coach seem numbered. The club and the Moroccan might announce a parting of ways at a news conference on Thursday. The Bagan team returned from Margao on Wednesday evening and no sooner had they landed than the rumour mills went into overdrive about Bencharifas possible ouster. In fact, Bagan officials went into a huddle late in the night to discuss his future.         
	Bencharifa sacking, if it happens on Thursday, will be a fall-out from the clubs indifferent performance on the Goa leg where they lost to lowly Salgaocar and a depleted Dempo Sports Club.         
	A couple of names are doing the rounds as his replacement  Satyajit Chatterjee and Douglas, both of whom share a good rapport with Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	Interestingly, Satyajit was an assistant to Karim but left the job in a huff at the beginning of the season. He went on record saying he would never work as an assistant again. So, if he is catapulted into the hot seat, Barreto will have a big say in team composition.         
	In another interesting development, Tim Hankinson, the Salgaocar coach, stepped down citing ill health and it is being speculated that Bencharifa may try his luck in Goa once again. Salgaocar club officials, though, ruled out anything of the sort happening.         
	A senior Bagan player said that Bencharifa looked fed up with the way things turned out in Goa. It looks like he is on his way out. He will step down, the player said.         
	Bencharifa had quite a successful time with Bagan, winning the 2008 CFL, the Federation Cup and ending runners-up in the I-League. And then, on October 25 last year, Bagan banged five past East Bengal to exorcise the ghost of 1975.

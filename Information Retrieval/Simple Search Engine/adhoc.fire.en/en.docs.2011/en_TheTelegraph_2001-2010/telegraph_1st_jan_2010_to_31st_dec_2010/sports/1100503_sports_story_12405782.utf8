The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wrist is holding up well: Yuvraj
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wrist is holding up well: Yuvraj
                  Yuvraj                     
	St Lucia: The talented Yuvraj Singh feels that he is getting stronger on the wrist and is ready for action in the ongoing World Twenty20.         
	The southpaw made an unbeaten 22-ball 23 but more than the runs he scored, Yuvraj was happy that his injured wrist held good in the game.         
	I am getting much stronger now on the wrist and am ready for action, said Yuvraj. The Punjab batsman said at one point in time, he had decided to go for a surgery but later dropped the idea as he was keen on playing the World T20.         
	If I had to undergo surgery, it would have taken me a lot more time to recover. Definitely, I would have been out for a long time. I had been in and out for a while due to the finger injury and was desperate to play, Yuvraj said.         
	The physios and the specialist in Australia were okay with me to play from the first game of the IPL, added the dashing left-hander, who is known for his magical six sixes of successive balls off Englands Stuart Broad.         
	The 28-year-old middle-order batsman said it is always difficult to come back from injury.         
	Every time you come back from an injury you will take some time to strengthen it. When I came back from my knee injury, I struggled for the first few months. It is just that you need to be careful, make yourself stronger, be careful when to rest yourself and when not to play, he said.           (PTI)

                  Roger Federer of Switzerland celebrates after defeating Taylor Dent of the United States in Stockholm, on Thursday. (Reuters)                           
	Stockholm: Roger Federer cruised into the Stockholm Open quarter finals in his 900th match on the ATP Tour, beating Taylor Dent of the United States 6-1, 6-2 in 51 minutes.         
	Federer outclassed Dent to record his 727th Tour win, in his first match in the Swedish capital for a decade, Thursday.         
	When I look back, in 1998 I played my first one. 900 matches later its quite crazy. Ive done so well. Ive got a great win-loss record, Federer said. I couldnt ask for a better career. I think to reach 1,000 matches, should be rather easy to be honest. We play over 50 a year, so that should be done in a couple of years.         
	Winning my 900th match is obviously better than losing it, he added after taking his win-loss record to 727-173. It took the 16-time Grand Slam winner just 17 minutes to win the first set, breaking Dent twice.         
	Dent put up more of a fight in the second, having two break points in the fourth game, but Federer upped the tempo.         
	Federer never needed to demonstrate his full repertoire of shots, but he ripped one backhand pass in the second set that brought cheers from the crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall. The second-ranked Swiss finished with a delightful drop shot.         
	That was a good night of tennis for me. Hardly any stupid mistakes, stay on the offensive, and tried out a few things, Federer said. Also tried to throw in some serve and volley as the lead got bigger and bigger. Federer will face countryman Stanislas Wawrinka in the next round.         
	Obviously we share something incredible, which is the Olympic gold medal, and I really feel like hes taken a step forward by beating players such as myself at Monaco (in 2009) or (Andy) Murray at the US Open, Federer told of his Olympics doubles partner.         
	Hes been really consistent... and thats why its a tough draw for me to play here against Stan in the quarters. Hes a good friend, its going to be fair play and Im sure its going to be a nice match.         
	Second-seeded Robin Soderling also advanced by defeating Germanys Benjamin Becker 6-3, 6-3. The fifth-ranked Swede broke Becker in the sixth game to take the first set and twice in the second to the delight of the Swedish public.         
	Fourth-seeded Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia breezed past Arnaud Clement of France 6-3, 6-4. Ljubicic had 12 aces on the way to his 10th straight victory over Clement.         
	Ljubicic will face countryman Ivan Dodig next, after he routed Germanys Tobias Kamke 6-1, 6-1, in only 53 minutes. (Agencies)

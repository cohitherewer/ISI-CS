The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karun breaks into F1
                                                                                                                       7                                        Karun breaks into F1
            A STAFF REPORTER            Karun Chandhok                           
	Calcutta: Karun Chandhok Thursday became the second Indian, after Narain Karthikeyan, to break into the Formula One grid after the Hispania Racing F1 team (HRT) signed up the Chennai-based driver for the 2010 season.         
	The 26-year-old Chandhok will partner Brazilian rookie Bruno Senna at the cash-strapped team, who have changed their name from Campos Meta, when the season starts in Bahrain next week, according to a release. Karthikeyan became the first Indian F1 driver in 2005 when he joined Jordan.         
	Team principal Dr Colin Kolles said: We are proud to have Karun as part of our team line-up ahead of our debut in Bahrain As a front-runner in the GP2 series I am confident Karun will step up to the F1 challenge and contribute to a successful debut season for both him and the team.         
	There were doubts initially about the teams participation in F1 this year but those were laid to rest last week when Jose Maria Carabante secured full ownership of the team and engaged Kolles as team principal. Kolles has previously been team principal at Force India, Spyker and the Midland F1 teams. He has also had the experience of running teams in the F3 Euroseries, DTM and for the Le Mans 24 hours.         
	The Cosworth-powered car, Chandhoks F1 vehicle, has not been tested ahead of the March 14 season opener, being unveiled Thursday in the south-eastern city of Murcia where the first Spanish F1 team will be based.         
	So, the inexperienced HRT line-up faces an uphill task in what will be their first season on the grid. But Chandhok is still excited with his appointment.         
	This is just an unbelievable feeling I am absolutely thrilled to be able to fulfil a lifelong dream to break into F1, Chandhok gushed. Weve been working for so many years for this opportunity and now that weve finally made it, to be honest, it feels a bit surreal. Only when I get to Bahrain, I think it will fully sink in that I am going to be on the same grid as (Michael) Schumacher and (Fernando) Alonso.         
	Chandhoks name was not in the official entry list for the 2010 World Championship revealed Wednesday night with only Senna  nephew of F1 legend Ayrton Senna and Chandhoks GP2 teammate at iSport International  named as the teams confirmed driver.         
	Details were not known whether Chandhok, a third generation driver from a family of motorsport enthusiasts, would be driving for the whole season.         
	The car is being designed and built by Dallara in Italy.         
	Not that HRTs newest signing does not know about the challenge his fledgling team face.         
	While it is true that we will be at a disadvantage with regard to testing time, I have a lot of faith in Dallara who are building the car, Chandhok said.

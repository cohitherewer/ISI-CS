The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paul: This one is for fans whove waited 35 years
                                                                                                                       7                                        Paul: This one is for fans whove waited 35 years
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Paul Collingwood in the dressing room, on Sunday. (Picture: ICC)                           
	New York: The pundits had been backing Australia, but England came to the party like never before, on Sunday, scripting a first at the history-oozing Kensington Oval in Bridgetown.         
	Captain Paul Collingwood didnt get carried away, not in public at least, and cut a nice picture during his interaction with the media in general and also when he took a couple of questions, exclusively, from The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	First reaction         
	(Somewhat emotionally) That this is a very special moment... The guys deserve everything theyve got and our first World Cup win (World Twenty20, actually) can never be taken away from this team... Its a monkey off our backs... With the weather and all, we had an awkward time in Guyana (in the first-round), but kept working on our plans.         
	What made the difference         
	Confidence... Lots of self belief... The boys thought for themselves (out in the middle) and made the right decisions... Confidence helped us be spot on both in the semi-final, against Sri Lanka, and in the final... Everybody, including the guys who werent playing, contributed. A real team effort.         
	Mindset in the final         
	We just wanted to win, whether it was on the last ball or with 10 overs to spare... Winning matters, not how ugly or how good you looked.         
	Whether destiny played a part         
	Destiny plays a part, but a lot of things went our way in the tournament... Youve got to remember that.         
	Celebrations         
	(Smiles) Well certainly celebrate, savour the moment for a few days. After that, well kick on from here... Good teams kick on.         
	Feelings vis-a-vis winning the Ashes         
	This one is right up there... No team got a hold of us and, having won the World Twenty20, can have a big smile on our faces.         
	Role, if any, of Test captain Andrew Strauss         
	The work he and (team director) Andy Flower have put in over the past year helped.         
	Player of the Tournament Kevin Pietersens contribution         
	Hes played a huge role.         
	Both Pietersen and MoM Craig Keiswetter being South Africa-born         
	I dont want to get into it... They played for England and are happy doing so.         
	Whether the England players benefited from the IPL         
	The IPL has had a very positive influence... Its tough getting into the XIs, but once you do, you enjoy the experience... If you do well, then the confidence increases... We did use some of the things learnt in the IPL... Its a world-class tournament.         
	If England could soon win another world title, in soccer         
	(Laughs) Im not making predictions... It would be nice, though.         
	 Finally, dedicating this win to...         
	To all of Englands supporters whove waited 35 years (since the first World Cup, in 1975)... This one, then, is for them.               
	Now, excerpts from what Pietersen said...         
	Its a humbling moment... I probably wouldnt have done well if the support staff hadnt supported me on the (lean) tour of Bangladesh... Also, over many dinners, I got Collys reassurance...         
	Id worked incredibly hard in Bangladesh and during nets in Bangalore (for the Royal Challengers)... The gain has been priceless... Id, of course, been disappointed with what Id achieved in the past year...         
	One cricketer gets the Player of the Tournament award, but it was a team effort and this win is the teams...         
	I didnt know how (MoM Craig) Kieswetter played, except that he hit the ball hard... Hes had a great T20 debut, coming in and being part of a World Cup-winning team... He has a great future...         
	The events of the past few weeks have been incredible, really... Im looking forward to returning home and holding my son (Dylan, born last week).         
	As for the Johannesburg-born Kieswetter, the 22-year-old all-rounder, he admitted having to pinch himself to believe what had unfolded.         
	Footnote: This wasnt the Ashes... But, yes, wed come to win the tournament and didnt. We lost to the better team on the day... We needed to be at our best, but werent. There are no guarantees in this world... The selectors will, no doubt, review my performance as captain and my contributions at No.3, Michael Clarke, presenting a brave face, maintained.

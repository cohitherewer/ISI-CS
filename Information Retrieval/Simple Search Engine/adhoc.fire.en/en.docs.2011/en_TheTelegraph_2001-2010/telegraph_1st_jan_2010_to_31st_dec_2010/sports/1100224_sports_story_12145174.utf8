The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians to make specific demands
                                                                                                                       7                                      Australians to make specific demands
                      
	Sydney: The Australian Cricketers Association Tuesday briefed its Indian Premier League (IPL) bound players about the security threat to the event and are looking to demand, of the organisers, specific assurances on their safety.         
	ACA chief executive Paul Marsh met the players contracted with various IPL franchises and handed an independent security assessment on the T20 league prepared by renowned expert Reg Dickason.         
	The meeting came after IPL players like Simon Katich (King XI Punjab) and Shaun Tait (Rajasthan Royals) made public their safety concerns about travelling to India for the event after terror outfit al-Qaeda warned of attacks on foreign players.         
	Indeed, the security apprehensions are beginning to be widely echoed with South Africa captain Graeme Smith saying that his compatriots have developed cold feet about travelling to India.         
	Players remain concerned about the security issues for IPL, Smith said. Everyone is monitoring the situation very closely at the moment.         
	New Zealand cricketers Shane Bond and Ross Taylor revealed they would take a late call on their participation even as their players body remains cagey about the security plans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooneys statement
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooneys statement
                      
	I met with David Gill last week and he did not give me any of the assurances I was seeking about the future squad. I then told him that I would not be signing a new contract.         
	I was interested to hear what Sir Alex had to say yesterday (Tuesday) and surprised by some of it. It is absolutely true, as he said, that my agent and I have had a number of meetings with the club about a new contract. During those meetings in August I asked for assurances about the continued ability of the club to attract the top players in the world.         
	I have never had anything but complete respect for MUFC. How could I not have done given their fantastic history and especially the last six years in which I have been lucky to play a part?         
	For me its all about winning trophies  as the club has always done under Sir Alex. Because of that I think the questions I was asking were justified. Despite recent difficulties, I know I will always owe Sir Alex Ferguson a huge debt.         
	He is a great manager and mentor who has helped and supported me from the day he signed me from Everton when I was only 18. For Manchester Uniteds sake I wish he could go on forever because hes a one off and a genius.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo brace up for D-Day
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo brace up for D-Day
            OUR CORRESPONDENTS                      
	Shillong/Mumbai: Though a point will be good enough, but nothing like finishing with a bang logging home full points. That is exactly what Dempo SC coach Armando Colaco must be thinking as his team gear up for their away match against Lajong FC in Shillong on Sunday.         
	A draw will be good enough for the Goan giants to win their fourth national league title in the last five years. Lajong, who are the first team from the north-eastern region to feature in the elite division, will like to upset the Dempo applecart in the 25th round encounter. A draw would be of little significance for the Shillong side as they are yet to steer clear of the drop zone in their debut year.         
	For Lajong, the Dempo match would be an ideal test as they have done well against the superior teams while fumbling badly against the weaker sides.         
	Dempo, on the other hand would like to end the glimmer of hope for the die-hard Churchill Brothers supporters who are still hoping for an improbable encore after they thrashed Mohun Bagan 4-0 on Friday.         
	It is definitely a very important match for us. As it is, we are playing against the champions. But I hope that my boys will put up a brave fight in their last home game, Lajong coach Stanley Rozario said on the eve of the match.         
	Colaco said the preparation of his team is no different from the past matches and informed that all his main players will be available on the morrow. We are not taking the game lightly and our preparation is no different from other matches, Colaco said.         
	In the other match of Sunday, Chirag United will be looking to break their winless streak and gain maximum points when they take on a beleaguered Air India in Mumbai.         
	The Calcutta club havent recorded a win in their last seven matches of which they have lost four. The second phase of the league has been nothing but disaster for the team that lost its coach Subrata Bhattacharya midway through the season.         
	On the other hand, Air India face the grim task of avoiding relegation. The airmen, too, have not won in their last seven outings and are placed second from bottom with 25 points. In fact, it would be a battle of survival for not just the team but for Mumbai football itself.

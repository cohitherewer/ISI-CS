                                                                                                                       7                                      CFL tie abandoned after crowd trouble
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Southern Samitys CFL Premier Division match against Port Trust, at the East Bengal ground on Monday, was abandoned due to insufficient light.         
	There was a 40-minute stoppage in the second half due to crowd trouble. Eventually, when play resumed, the referee had to abandon the match in the 27th minute of the second half due to fading light. Both teams had failed to break the deadlock till then.         
	After a barren first half, Southern Samity, coached by I.M. Vijayan, began well in the second session. In the 53rd minute, Southerns Francis Xavier collided with Port Trusts Kaushik Prasad. According to Prasad, Xavier hit him for the second time, after getting up. This prompted referee Ajit Dutta to show a second yellow as Xavier got marching orders. Suddenly, a bunch of partisan Southern fans went berserk protesting against referees decision.         
	Suddenly, the Southern fans started pelting stones as policemen tried to control the irate fans. The situation was so bad that Vijayan had to request the Southern fans to calm down. After almost 40 minutes of disturbance, the match officials gave green light for play to resume.         
	 quot;Its nothing new, Ive faced similar incidents in my playing days in Calcutta, quot; said Vijayan before walking up to Shabbir to shake hands. Shabbir, on his part feels that match could have started much earlier.         
	Ona different note, when Vijayan was quizzed about Subhas Bhowmick, he said: quot;I have utmost respect for him. I have no problems if he joins as the technical director. quot;         
	The IFA tournament committee will decide the fate of the match which in all likelihood will be replayed.         
	At Barasat, Tollygunge Agragamis match against Aryan was postponed due to heavy rain.

	England cricketer Graeme Swann told police he was popping out to buy screwdrivers to rescue his cat after he was pulled over for drunk driving, a court heard Monday.         
	The 31-year-old spin bowler had been out with friends when he returned home to West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, and discovered his pet trapped under the floorboards, he told police.         
	He said he then got in his white Porsche Cayenne and drove towards a branch of Asda when he was pulled over by Pc Steven Denniss, Nottingham Magistrates Court heard.         
	Pc Denniss told the court he decided to pull Swann over initially because he was driving a high-performance car in an area where there had been a spate of burglaries.         
	He said when he turned round to pursue the cricketer, Swann initially accelerated before eventually stopping.         
	Pc Denniss, who had just started his patrol at 3 am on April 2, said: Mr Swann stated he had been out that evening and had come back to find his cat trapped under the floorboards in his house. He had gone to Asda to fetch some screwdrivers to remove some floorboards.         
	A blood test found he had 83mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. The legal limit is 80mg. Swann denies charge of drunk driving.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

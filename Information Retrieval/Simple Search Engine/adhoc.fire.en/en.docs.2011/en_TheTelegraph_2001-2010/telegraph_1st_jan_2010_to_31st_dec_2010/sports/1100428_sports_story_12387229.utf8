	London: English clubs are unlikely to participate in this years Champions League Twenty20 because of a clash of dates between the international club event and their county season, England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive David Collier has said.         
	The September 10-26 Champions League Twenty20 clashes with crucial fixtures in the English county season which runs till September 16.         
	At that time England will be playing Pakistan in an ODI series.         
	To add to it, the final two rounds of the County Championship as well as the semi-finals and final of the ECB40 competition will be on then.         
	It is extremely improbable that any English county will be taking part in the Champions League.         
	The sanctity of the domestic season is of utmost importance, as all the clubs agree, Collier said.         
	Collier, instead, said he has proposed matches between Champions League Twenty20 winners and runners-up and their English counterparts.         
	We are awaiting a response from the Board of Control for Cricket in India on a number of proposals.         
	One of them is for the winners and runners-up of the Champions League to play our winners and runners-up. Now that the IPL is over we hope to hear from them soon, he was quoted as saying by an English daily.         
	Sussex and Somerset took part in the inaugural tournament, last year in India.           (PTI)

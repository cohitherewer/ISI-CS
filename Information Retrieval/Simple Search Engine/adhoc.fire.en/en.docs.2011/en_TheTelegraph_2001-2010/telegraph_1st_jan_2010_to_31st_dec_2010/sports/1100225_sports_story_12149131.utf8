            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Deepak Thakur                           
	New Delhi: The Indian fans are not the only ones eagerly looking forward to Sundays clash against Pakistan in the hockey World Cup. Legendary Dutch goalkeeper Guus Vogels, too, is excited about the prospect of watching the archrivals cross swords on Indian soil.         
	One of the worlds best custodians, Vogels was in the goal when the Netherlands bagged Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2006. He also has four Champions Trophy winners medals in his pocket.         
	Although Vogels is aware of the declining standard of hockey in India and Pakistan, he wants to be present at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on the inaugural day. I am sure the India-Pakistan match will be a very exciting one. I will definitely be there on Sunday to watch the two teams play.         
	Vogels, who will bid adieu to the game after this World Cup, said he was not really aware of Indias strengths but praised Pakistan for their ability to play a quick counter-attacking game.         
	We last played against India almost a year-and-a-half ago. We didnt do much homework on them because they are in the other pool, said Vogels. All I know is that the hosts are a good opposition.         
	Pakistan are strong in counter attacks. No team should make the mistake of allowing them space and time It is important to come up with the right tactics against the Pakistanis, he added.         
	Pakistan hammered India 6-3 in the Champions Challenge, in Argentina recently, but Deepak Thakur, one of Indias most experienced players, is not too bothered about previous results. Speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday, Thakur said his team would do everything to please the sold-out crowd on Sunday.         
	We have been practising very well for the past few months, Thakur said. If we can hold on to that form, we dont need to fear any team. We have the strength to beat not only Pakistan but any team in this competition. Dont be surprised to see us reaching the semi-finals, he said.         
	India and Pakistan have long stopped ruling the world of hockey but there is still a mad rush for the opening days match. A total of 15,000 tickets were put on sale and they were sold out in no time.         
	There are no tickets for the first day, confirmed Hockey India (HI) secretary Narendra Batra. Even the online booking has been closed, he added.         
	Meanwhile, protesting the ban on coverage of training and practice matches, sports journalists Wednesday walked out of an FIH event to announce a sponsorship partner. As soon as FIH media officer Arjen Meijer rose to speak, all the journalists present at the press conference left the venue.

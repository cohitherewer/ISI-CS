                                                                                                                       7                                      Bolt targets 9.4 seconds
                      
	Sydney: Jamaican sprint superstar Usain Bolt hopes to lower his 100 metres world record from 9.58 to 9.4 seconds, a mark he believes would never be beaten, a report said Wednesday.         
	Next season Im going to work hard to try and lower that record and Ive said over the last two years that the mark will go down to 9.4. For me, anything is possible and Ill go out there and do my best, said Bolt.         
	However, Bolt, in Sydney for 10-year anniversary celebrations of the 2000 Olympics, said bettering the time he set last year in Berlin was not an obsession.         
	Thats where the record is gonna stay, he told an Australian daily, referring to 9.4sec. But its not an obsession. I already have the world record.         
	Bolt, a double world record-holder in the 100m and 200m and the Olympic and world champion in both events, also said he hoped to seal his legacy at London 2012.         
	London is a very big stage for me because there are so many Jamaicans in London, he said.         
	It will change my career there. Ill keep doing, but Ill do something different.         
	Bolt is reportedly considering tackling the 400m and challenging American legend Michael Johnsons 1999 record of 43.18sec.           (AGENCIES)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Lalkamal Bhowmick was the only notable omission as the Indian Football Association on Tuesday named a 20-member Bengal squad for the Santosh Trophy.         
	Bengal coach Shabbir Ali wasnt impressed with the attacking midfielders form at the camp and preferred veteran Jayanta Sen and Chirag Uniteds last season captain Denson Devadas.         
	Denson and Jayanta are in good form. I am happy with the squad which has a fair blend of youth and experience, Shabbir, who was present at the Howrah Stadium to watch the quarter final match between Delhi and Chhattisgarh, said.         
	Mohun Bagan left winger Snehasish Chakraborty, will be leading the team. Apart from goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal, who is injured, and left-back Saumik Dey, who has high fever, the others who were excluded from the probables list are Mohammed Rafique, Bikash Narjery, Tapan Maity.         
	The forward line is weak link for Bengal as none among Robin Singh, Shankar Oraon, Tarif Ahmed and Nilendra Dewan have done anything noteworthy in recent times.         
	The Squad         
	Goalkeepers: Sandip Nandy, Somnath Khara, Abhra Mondal; Defenders: Rajib Ghosh, R. Dhanarajan, Habibur Rahman, Safar Sardar, Arnab Mondal, Anupam Sarkar, Sheikh Azim; Midfielders: Snehasish Chakraborty (captain), Gouranga Datta, Subhash Chakraborty, Denson Devadas, Jayanta Sen, Souvik Chakraborty, Forwards: Tarif Ahmed, Shankar Oraon, Robin Singh, Nilendra Dewan. Coach: Shabbir Ali; Goalkeeping coach: Debasish Mukherjee Manager: Biswajit Guha Roy

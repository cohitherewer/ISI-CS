The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Just thought of hitting straight: Vijay
                                                                                                                       7                                        Just thought of hitting straight: Vijay
                  Murali Vijay in Chennai, on Saturday                     
	Chennai: Shane Warne, the Rajasthan Royals captain, considers the Indian Premier League (IPL) as the toughest Twenty20 event in the world and said his side paid the price for lack of intensity in fielding and bowling against the Chennai Super Kings here Saturday.         
	His counterpart, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on the other hand credited Murali Vijay and Albie Morkel for the victory.         
	We batted brilliantly. Vijay and Morkel were special. Not much power, no stupid shots, but clean hitting. If you have 240-245 on the board, its very difficult for the chasing team.         
	The Royals batted really well, but (Doug) Bollinger bowled exceptionally and his catch was also special, Dhoni said.         
	Vijay, on his part, said he kept his plans pretty simple. Im very happy. Im not really tired and am enjoying it. I just thought of hitting straight and the ball came onto the bat nicely, he said.         
	Blaming his fielders, Warne said: We are playing in the IPL where the intensity is more than any other game in any part of the world. And, if your fielding is not good and catching poor, then you have to be blamed.         
	It is a flat wicket and a small ground. Our fielding was quite bad. We dropped a lot of catches, especially of Morkel. Bowling at the death was also a concern. I think the difference probably was up in fielding and catching. We missed catches at crucial times, he said.         
	He, however, praised his batsmen for a spirited run chase, especially Naman Ojha who made an unbeaten 55-ball 94.         
	It was hell of a chase, but our batsmen responded well enough. To chase 247 for a win and lose the match by 20 odd runs, wasnt that bad. Ojha did exceptionally well and more so as he has to keep the wicket. He showed tremendous stamina, said the Australian.         
	Warne said his side would have to improve their fielding and bowling woes if they want to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	We need to address our fielding and bowling. We do not want to get into a scenario where if you lose one match, you are forced to win all of the remaining for a semis berth, he said.         
	Warne praised Super Kings Vijay and pacer Bollinger for their performances on the day.         
	Vijay looks to be a talented and level-headed cricketer. His was a special innings and he played good cricketing shots too. Probably, credit should also go to Stephen Fleming for having coached a player like Vijay. He has obviously done his hard work.         
	Dougs spell of four overs was probably the best. While the others went for runs, Doug was rather economical giving only two or so per over, he said.         
	Bollinger, on his part, expressed happiness over the great start that he has made in the IPL.         
	Good fun. Good start for my debut IPL season. It wasnt tough adjusting to the conditions because Ive played for Australia on this ground. Every country is different and that is what makes cricket interesting. I would like to do this in every match, he said.         
	Praising his teammate Vijay, Bollinger said: He backed his talent and that was a great innings. Vijay changed the match and he was rightfully adjudged the Man of the Match.

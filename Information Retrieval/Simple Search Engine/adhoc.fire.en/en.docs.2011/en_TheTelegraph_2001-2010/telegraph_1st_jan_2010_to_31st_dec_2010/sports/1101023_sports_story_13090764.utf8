The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HI to field teams in Asian Games
                                                                                                                       7                                      HI to field teams in Asian Games
            OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Hockey India (HI) got the Supreme Courts permission to send mens and womens teams to compete in the Asian Games, in China. HI earlier represented India in the Commonwealth Games.         
	The apex court granted HI permission to field the teams, after it was told that the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) which K.P.S.Gill heads  was not recognised by the international hockey federation (FIH).         
	Recognition is a must to represent the country in any international sport under the international sporting rules.         
	Though the government had been pushing for Gills IHF to represent the country, the apex court, which has been adjudicating on a petition on which federation is the official federation, has favoured a joint team by HI and IOA, pending the case.         
	IHF and HI are engaged in a bitter battle for official recognition. The government initially de-recognised HI for not holding proper elections as per the rules. The body was accused of violating age and tenure norms.         
	But the government direction to the international hockey federation (FIH) to de-recognise HI fell on deaf ears. The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) was instead sought to be projected as the official federation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delegates blast the artificial turf
                                                                                                                       7                                      Delegates blast the artificial turf
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tokuaki Suzuki, the director of competitions and a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) inspection team, on Sunday, came down heavily on the turfs, especially the artificial one at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	According to the AFC delegates, the grasses have died down far too early reflecting a clear sign of lack of maintenance.         
	Grasses of artificial turfs are livelier and more often seem natural. But here, it looks to have died down completely. This should not have been the case with something installed just a year-and-half before. It only tells that theres not enough watering done, Suzuki said.         
	A report on the overall infrastructure will be presented on November 2. Suzukis observations will definitely put pressure on the IFA since the I-League is round the corner. If they delist the Salt Lake Stadium then we are in for trouble, an IFA official said.         
	Ever since the artificial turf was laid at the Salt Lake Stadium, there have been complaints about the turf.         
	There was an embarrassing moment at the Central Park when the delegation found a nursery match between Aryan and Friends of the Stadium going on without a referee.

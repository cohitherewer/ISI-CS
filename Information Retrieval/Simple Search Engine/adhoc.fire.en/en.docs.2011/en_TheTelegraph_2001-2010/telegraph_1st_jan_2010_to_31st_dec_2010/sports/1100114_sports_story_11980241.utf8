	Dhaka: Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman were left waiting for close to 45 minutes because of a delay in offloading their luggage, on arrival here Wednesday afternoon.         
	Though their flight from Mumbai arrived on time, some of the luggage of the two senior players took a long time in being offloaded from the aircraft.         
	The concerned players, along with their other teammates, were forced to stay put at the airport.         
	The other players who arrived on the same flight for the two-Test series are Rahul Dravid, Ishant Sharma, Murali Vijay and Pragyan Ojha.

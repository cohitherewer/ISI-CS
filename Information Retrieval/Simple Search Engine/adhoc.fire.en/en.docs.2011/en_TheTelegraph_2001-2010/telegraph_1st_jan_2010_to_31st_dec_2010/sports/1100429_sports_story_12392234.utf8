	Shillong/Mumbai: A late equaliser from Chirag United striker Edmilson Marques dashed Shillong Lajong FCs hopes of forcing a victory in their I-League encounter on Wednesday. Daniel Bidemi had put the home team ahead in the 38th minute.         
	The first half witnessed a dominant Lajong squandering several opportunities, especially in the first 30 minutes of the game. However, Bidemi gave the massive home crowd a reason to cheer when he got the ball past Chirag custodian Sandip Nandy.         
	 In the 84th minute, a free kick from Edmilson, just few yards away from the danger zone, ensured that Chirag gained at least a point from match. Edmilson volley evaded the human wall and caught the host custodian off guard.         
	In Mumbai, Mahindra Uniteds title hopes receded further after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Pune FC.         
	Steven Dias put the hosts ahead in the 38th minute Pune FC found the equaliser in the 58th minute when Arata Izumi pounced on the rebound after goalkeeper Subhodeep Mukherjee had blocked a full-blooded shot from Asim Hasan.

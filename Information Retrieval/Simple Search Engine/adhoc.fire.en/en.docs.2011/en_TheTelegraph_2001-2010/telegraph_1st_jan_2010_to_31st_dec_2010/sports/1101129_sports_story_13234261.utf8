                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI lowers base price
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who whipped up $1.5 million (approximately Rs 6 crore) in the first edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), has been tagged a base price of Rs 1.84 crore for the upcoming auction, ahead of the fourth edition of the T20 meet.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh, who had earlier earned 15 per cent more than the highest-paid player in their respective teams for the iconic status, are also in the same bracket as Dhoni.         
	Harbhajan Singh is the other player in the same category. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has named around 65 Indian players, in the first phase, who will go under the hammer in the auction, scheduled for January 8 and 9, next year.         
	The BCCI has split the group in five categories of base price  Rs 1.84 crore, Rs 1.38 crore, Rs 92 lakh, Rs 46 lakh and Rs 23 lakh respectively.         
	While the lowest base price for the inaugural IPL auction was Rs 45,73,000 ($100,000), the minimum for IPL-IV is Rs 23 lakh ($50, 295 approx).         
	Sourav Ganguly, who, too, earned more for being an icon player, have been kept in the third category of Rs 92 lakh ($201,180 approx) along with speedster Ishant Sharma.         
	However, according to BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, players can approach the IPL governing council in case they want to be placed in some category other than specified. A player can ask for another group within the five categories, Srinivasan told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	Wriddhiman Saha, Manoj Tiwary, Ashok Dinda, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajit Agarkar, who have represented the Kolkata Knight Riders, are some of the players in the fourth bracket (Rs 46 lakh).

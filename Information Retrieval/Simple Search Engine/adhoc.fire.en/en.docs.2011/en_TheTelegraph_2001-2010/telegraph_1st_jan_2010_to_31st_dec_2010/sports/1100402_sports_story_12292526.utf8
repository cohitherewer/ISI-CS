	Mohali: Kings XI Punjab skipper Kumar Sangakkara and Yuvraj Singh, on Thursday, dismissed reports of a rift between them and said too much should not be read into the sides rough patch in the ongoing Indian Premier League.         
	Stories are doing the rounds that Yuvraj, going through a prolonged bad patch in the Twenty20 tournament, is sulking after losing the captaincy to Sangakkara, who doesnt enjoy the full support of some players.         
	Sangakkara, who is back at the helm after serving a one-match ban for the teams repeated slow over-rate, however, begged to differ and said all negative stories stem from the outfits poor performance in IPL III.         
	These stories come out when a team is not doing well. There is no rift, Sangakkara said. Of course there is a lot of disappointment. The team is not winning and the key players are not putting up their best performance. But there is no anger, never any direct criticism of any particular player or any personnel.         
	Dismissing reports that he and Yuvraj were not on the best of terms and that it was affecting the team morale, he said, When you lose everyone opens themselves up to criticism, some fair and some unfair.         
	Yuvraj, meanwhile, sounded annoyed with the reports of a rift between him and Sangakkara. (PTI)

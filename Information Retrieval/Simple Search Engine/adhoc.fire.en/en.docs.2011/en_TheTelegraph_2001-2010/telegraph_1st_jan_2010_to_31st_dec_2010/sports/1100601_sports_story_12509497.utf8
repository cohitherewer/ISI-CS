The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Routine meeting, yet not routine
                                                                                                                       7                                        Routine meeting, yet not routine
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Howard                           
	London: Tuesdays meeting of the 2011 World Cups central organising committee, in Mumbai, is supposed to be a routine affair.         
	Yet, it cant be all that routine.         
	For, on its sidelines will be an opportunity for the three co-hosts  India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh  to review strategy on the John Howard issue.         
	Australias former Prime Minister, it may be recalled, is struggling to get his nomination as the next vice-president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) approved by its powerful Executive Board.         
	Howards nomination ought to have been okayed in April itself. Instead, he has been embarrassed no end.         
	Many of the key players are going to be around, most notably Sharad Pawar. Its unlikely that anybody will say anything publicly, but a lot could be said behind closed doors, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	Pawar, the ICC vice-president, is the committees chairman. His successor as vice-president will also succeed him as president, in 2012.         
	Going by the rotational policy, its going to be the turn of Australia-New Zealand.         
	Besides the three from Asia, South Africa and Zimbabwe arent (as of now) in favour of Howard. The West Indies is probably fence-sitting, with Australia, New Zealand and England backing him.         
	Its not confirmed, but Pakistan is for Howard, if only to keep a distance from India.         
	Asian unity, clearly, appears to be a thing of the past as many associated with cricket in Pakistan feel that India has done nothing to end its isolation internationally.         
	Meanwhile, an announcement on the online sale of tickets (5 per cent for every match) is expected after the meeting proper.

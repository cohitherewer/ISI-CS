The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: History doesnt come into the picture
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni: History doesnt come into the picture
    - I believe in staying calm, says India captain ahead of crucial match             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Bridgetown: With the business end of the World Twenty20 getting under way on Thursday, the focus is now wholly on the fancied teams and not the challengers or upstarts.         
	For Team India, the first Super Eight match, against Australia, is on Friday. If the mood at the idyllic Hilton here is an indication, then Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men arent taking too much pressure on themselves.         
	Just as well.         
	I believe in staying calm and, in recent weeks, the IPL has taught me to stay calmer, Dhoni told The Telegraph in a brief interaction.         
	Looking ahead, he said: The tougher stage of the tournament has started... All eight teams are good... We will have to consistently play to potential and Im confident that we will...         
	Asked about Australias modest record in T20, Dhoni replied: History doesnt come into the picture... Its all about how one plays over the 40 overs... Ive already pointed out that all the teams in this stage are good.         
	Captain when India won the inaugural World Twenty20, in September 2007, Dhoni has more than a fair idea of what it takes to succeed.         
	Both teams have made the cut  with even a Tiger Woods failing nowadays, its not exactly guaranteed  with an all-win record.         
	Australia, of course, beat Test nations Pakistan and Bangladesh, while India defeated big-stage debutants Afghanistan and South Africa.         
	Significantly, both teams have fitness-related worries. Indias Praveen Kumar has to go home; Mitchell Johnson is recovering from a sore elbow.         
	Praveen has emerged a key player in crickets shorter versions and his absence will be felt. According to a member of the team management, he suffered an abdominal tear in the match versus South Africa, on Sunday, and will take the long flights home in a couple of days.         
	Injuries happen and, unfortunately, Praveen has become a casualty... I hope somebody will step up and do the job. That way, then, we wont miss him, Dhoni commented.         
	Praveens replacement is little-known Umesh Yadav, the Vidarbha quick, who turns out in the Delhi DareDevils colours in the IPL.         
	Yadav has genuine pace, thats the big reason why weve picked him, one of the selectors maintained, when contacted back in India.         
	With vice-captain Gautam Gambhir and Zaheer Khan fit, two changes (at least) will again be made  Dinesh Karthik going back to the dugout and Zaheer taking Praveens place.         
	Should the new-ball attack have to be bolstered, then Ranganath Vinay Kumar will make his debut. Otherwise, leggie Piyush Chawla is going to keep his place in the XI.         
	Yuvraj Singh, meanwhile, was to see a doctor as he has developed rashes in parts of his body. Look, its nothing serious, informed the member of the team management.         
	Match starts: 7 pm (IST).

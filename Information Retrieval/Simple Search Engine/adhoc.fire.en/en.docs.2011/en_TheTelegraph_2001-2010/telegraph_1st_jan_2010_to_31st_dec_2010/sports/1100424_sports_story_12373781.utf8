The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United aim to end Tottenham streak
                                                                                                                       7                                        United aim to end Tottenham streak

	London: Tottenham Hotspur have given Manchester United a huge lift by beating Arsenal and Chelsea in their last two games but Alex Fergusons side will hope that a more historical formline prevails at Old Trafford on Saturday.         
	Thanks to Spurs 2-1 win over Chelsea and their own last-gasp win over Manchester City last week, United are now one point behind Carlo Ancelottis team, who host Stoke City on Sunday.         
	With games against Spurs, Sunderland and Stoke to come, United could finish with a flourish, pouring the pressure on a Chelsea side who still have to visit Liverpool before finishing off against Wigan Athletic, who beat the Londoners at home in September.         
	With three weekends of action remaining, the race for the Premier League title remains one of the closest and most exciting for years, though Arsenal, now six points off the pace after their defeat at Wigan, look out of the running even if they beat Manchester City at the Emirates on Saturday.         
	Tottenhams dream double has put them in pole position for fourth place but the odds of them making it three memorable, and hugely important wins in a row and knocking United off course, are long.         
	United, with the likes of Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand, would have hoped to have been in Champions League action this week but will instead turn up for Saturdays game on the back of a rare full weeks rest at this stage of the season, know that this game represents their toughest remaining hurdle as they seek an unprecedented fourth successive title.

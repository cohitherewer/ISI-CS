	Belgrade: France rallied from two sets down to stun hosts Serbia in the doubles match Saturday and take a 2-1 lead in their Davis Cup final.         
	Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra defeated Nenad Zimonjic and Viktor Troicki 3-6, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-5, 6-4.         
	Clement lost his serve in both sets that the French lost, but the 32-year-old veterans spectacular lob that landed on the baseline triggered a crucial break in the 11th game of the fourth set.         
	Zimonjic then lost his serve in the opening game of the fifth set, and the French wrapped up their comeback win after four hours, 34 minutes.         
	The key was the spirit we had on the court, said Clement, who played in his first Davis Cup final after missing out in 2001 and 2002.         
	With two sets down, it was very, very difficult, he added.         
	Third-ranked Novak Djokovic will have to beat Gael Monfils in the first reverse singles on Sunday to keep alive Serbias hope of winning its first Davis Cup title.         
	Frances Gilles Simon is scheduled to play Janko Tipsarevic in the final singles match, as the French try to capture their 10th title and first since 2001.         
	We are leading 2-1, but we still have a far way to go, France captain Guy Forget said.         
	Clement and Llodra improved their record in Davis Cup doubles to 8-2. They have seven ATP titles together, including the 2007 Wimbledon crown.         
	Djokovic beat Simon on Friday to draw Serbia level after Monfils cruised past Tipsarevic in straight sets in the opening singles match.                 (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Uruguay, Mexico keen to draw level
                                                                                                                       7                                      Uruguay, Mexico keen to draw level
                      
	Rustenburg: Both Mexico and Uruguay need a point each from their last Group A match on Tuesday to qualify for the next round of the World Cup.         
	In their bid to play safe, both teams may employ defensive tactics. Both teams have four points from two matches while South Africa and France have only been able to manage a single point. A draw will mean curtains for the hosts as well as the 1998 world champions.         
	Mexico employed attacking attacking tactics in their previous matches playing with a 4-3-3 formation.         
	Their strategy earned praise from pundits and other teams. Paraguay coach Gerardo Martino said that Mexico is the best team hes seen at the tournament so far.         
	Mexico coach Javier Aguirre will have to take a call as to who will be his three forwards during Tuesdays match at Royal Bafokeng Stadium.         
	Aguirre may choose to go with youngster Javier Hernandez over veteran Guillermo Franco, who started in Mexicos 1-1 draw against South Africa in the opening match and the 2-0 win over France.         
	But it was the 22-year-old Hernandez who made headlines when he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather - who scored in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland  by scoring the opening goal as a substitute against France.         
	Carlos Vela, who also started in the two previous matches, is not available because of a right leg injury, according to the Mexico football federation website. Aguirre may decide to go with Pablo Barrera, the forward who replaced Vela when he was injured late in the first half against France.         
	Barrera impressed against France and is a strong candidate to fill in.         
	Likely Teams         
	Uruguay (3-4-3): 1-Fernando Muslera, 2-Diego Lugano, 3-Diego Godin, 4-Jorge Fucile, 16-Maximiliano Pereira, 15-Diego Perez, 17-Egidio Arevalo, 7-Edinson Cavani, 11-Alvaro Pereira, 9-Luis Suarez, 10-Diego Forlan         
	Mexico (4-3-3): 1-Oscar Perez, 12-Paul Aguilar, 4-Rafael Marquez, 2-Francisco Rodriguez, 3-Carlos Salcido, 6-Gerardo Torrado, 7-Pablo Barrera, 5-Ricardo Osorio, 17-Giovani Dos Santos, 9-Guillermo Franco, 14-Javier Hernandez.         
	Referee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)           (AGENCIES)

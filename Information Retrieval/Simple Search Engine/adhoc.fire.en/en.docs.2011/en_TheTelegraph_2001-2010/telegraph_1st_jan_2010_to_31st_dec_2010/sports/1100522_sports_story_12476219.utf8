	Lauderhill: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has demanded equal opportunities in the playing of Test cricket, saying chances for his country to play the five-day game were being reduced.         
	Sangakkara said he would welcome a World Test Championship, an idea being discussed within official bodies to give greater context to series, but said any new structure needed to give each team the same chances to play internationally.         
	Its great to have a Test championship but I believe that all sides should have an equal opportunity to play Test matches, Sangakkara said, ahead of this weekends Twenty20 Internationals against New Zealand in Florida.         
	This year we are lucky that India wants to come and play Test matches but the opportunity for Sri Lankan players to fulfil their Test ambitions are getting more and more limited, he said.         
	Sri Lanka is perceived as an unappealing touring side due to lower box-office appeal at the gate and on television, even though the team has been a consistent force in the international game over the past 15 years.         
	Since a two-Test series in Australia in 2007, Sri Lankas opportunities for Test tour have been limited to their own continent  a two-Test series in Bangladesh followed by two in Pakistan. Sri Lanka will tour England in 2011 for the first time in five years and they have not played a Test in South Africa since 2002. Sides must be given the opportunity to play a minimum number of Test matches and the Future Tours Programme must be reorganised so some of the best sides tour more than just once in five years, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Closed door session for hockey players
                                                                                                                       7                                      Closed door session for hockey players
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian hockey teams first training session at the Major Dhyanchand Sports Complex turned into a circus on Wednesday with the ministry of sports issuing strict orders not to allow anyone inside the stadium.         
	While the stadium remained out of bounds for everyone, including the big media contingent that reached the venue early in the morning to cover the practice session, the ministry even asked national coach Jose Brasa not to talk about his teams prospects in the forthcoming World Cup.         
	The Spanish coach, known for being free and frank, refused to speak at the end of the practice session that lasted for two hours. I am sorry, but I cannot talk, said the coach, with folded hands.         
	While the ministry said it was forced to take some tough decisions because of security reasons, Hockey India (HI) sources alleged the government was only trying to cover up for its own wrong doings.         
	The ministry promised Brasa the moon in terms of training facilities, but in reality, they offered him very little, said the senior HI official. Since Brasa complained about those things, the ministry decided to bar him from talking.         
	The official, however, said the HI would soon be talking to the ministry and the Sports Authority of India (SAI) so that the national team receives enough media coverage before the World Cup.         
	SAI joint secretary, Pravir Krishan, however, said: Due to security and strategic reasons, the decision has been taken at the highest level not to allow media in training sessions. The restriction will not just be for the Indian team but for every visiting team.

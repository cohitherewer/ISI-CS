	London: England batting mainstay Kevin Pietersen is all set to return home midway through the World Twenty20 in the West Indies to be with his pregnant wife as the couple prepares for the birth of their first child.         
	After guiding England to a clinical 39-run win over South Africa with a match-winning 53 here on Saturday, Pietersen said that although he would be heading home within the next 24 hours, he expected to be back in the Caribbean should England qualify for the semi-finals.         
	Its my first child so its a hell of an exciting time for me. Ill be dashing across the Atlantic and hopefully dashing back, Pietersen was quoted as saying by a television station. Im flying back to London in the next 24 hours and hoping everything goes well and according to plan, theres no complications, he said.           (PTI)

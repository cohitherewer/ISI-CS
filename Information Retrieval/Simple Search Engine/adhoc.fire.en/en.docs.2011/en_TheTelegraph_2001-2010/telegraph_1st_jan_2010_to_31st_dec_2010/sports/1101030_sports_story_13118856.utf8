                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney to be out for long
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Wayne Rooney could miss the Manchester derby on Nov 10 after Sir Alex Ferguson revealed that the United striker could be out for longer than the three weeks first thought with an ankle injury.         
	Rooney, who signed a new five-year contract at Old Trafford last week, is currently away in Dubai to recuperate after suffering the injury in training last week.         
	When asked at a press conference today if three weeks was still the prognosis, Ferguson said: I think it may be longer.         
	The 25 year-old has yet to appear for United following his fresh deal with the club. Ferguson said: There is no recovery, it is just rest. Before he went away we did his remedial in terms of what we could do at the time. Thereafter, rest  were quite happy with that.         
	Rooney has struggled for form this season, scoring just once for United.

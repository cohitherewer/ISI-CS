The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fabiano admits to handling the ball
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fabiano admits to handling the ball
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: On Sunday, Brazil provided their fans with the win they were hoping for and qualified for the knock out stage of the World Cup but the controversy surrounding striker Luis Fabianos second goal left a sour taste in their mouth.         
	Apart from the Fabiano goal in the 50th minute when he used his left arm to put Brazil 2-0 lead, the five-time champions were simply flawless in their 3-1 victory over Ivory Coast. It was perhaps their best performance of the year.         
	But then, Luis Fabiano, whose double strike earned him the man of the match award, looked to have used his arm twice to control the ball when he scored his second goal.         
	In the 1986 World Cup, Argentina scored a 2-1 victory over England in the quarter final with captain Diego Maradona scoring the first goal with his hand. While the referee couldnt spot Maradona cheating on him, the Argentine star later jokingly called it the hand of God.         
	Unlike Maradona, Fabiano on Sunday confessed his wrongdoing. Its true, the ball really touched my hand and then my shoulder. But it was involuntary. It was one of the greatest goals Ive scored in my career, he added.         
	It was because my daughter celebrated her sixth birthday recently and the goal was a dedication to her. I will actually like to dedicate the two goals to my daughter, added Fabiano.         
	The two goals were very important for me as I hadnt scored for five games before this one, so things worked out well for me, thank God. But the most important thing is that we won the game and we are all to be congratulated. I will also like to dedicate this victory to the Brazilian team, said Fabiano.         
	On Monday in Pretoria, Maradona laughed when asked to comment on the Fabianos goal         
	This goal was with his arm, he brought it down with his arm, its very evident I think there was a double handball. Whats tragicomic is the referees smile afterwards. When I scored the goal against England, I didnt see the referee laugh. He had so many doubts, he looked at the linesmen, there was no fourth referee at that time. He looked at the crowd to see if they gave him a hand.         
	But yesterday (Sunday), the referee went back to the centre circle laughing and thats what shocked us all. So if you saw it why didnt you penalise it? the Argentina coach asked.         
	Ivory Coast coach Sven Goran Eriksson sounded sarcastic on Fabianos second goal. I heard Brazil complain a lot (about Kaka being sent off), but they shouldnt. I dont think they can complain. I think they should feel very lucky. That goal changed the complexion of the match, said the veteran Ivory Coast coach.

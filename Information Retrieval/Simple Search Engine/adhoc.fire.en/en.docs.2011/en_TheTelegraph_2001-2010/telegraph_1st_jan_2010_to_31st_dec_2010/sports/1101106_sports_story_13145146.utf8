            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: A tailender wielding the bat can be as delightful a sight as frustrating it can be for the opponent team. Harbhajan Singh played a cracker (69 off 97 balls) on Friday, but fell short of his dream of scoring a Test hundred.         
	Addressing the media after the second days play, the offie lauded skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for walking in to bat despite having fever and also rued about not sticking on for his maiden Test century.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his batting         
	I am happy I could contribute with the bat today. We have got the runs on the board. We have to make sure now that we bowl well tomorrow.         
	On missing an opportunity to score a Test hundred         
	I was little disappointed. But I am happy that, at least, I got some runs. In the last two innings against Australia, I got out in the first one or two balls. So, today I had planned that I will go in there and play at least 10 balls. And, luckily, I survived the first 10 balls scoring seven odd runs. That gave me the confidence and after that I was playing my shots.         
	If there were any instructions from the dressing room on how he should bat         
	There were no messages. The way I batted today is the only way I know to bat. If I try to be defensive, I think I will get out. My game is to play shots and I played my shots given the chances. I think Daniel (Vettori) bowled really well. He was bowling a lot of slower balls in the air, he was using the flight really well. It was really hard to pick which one was landing short and which was landing on the right spot. It was my day and I am happy I scored the runs. But my job is still undone. I have to bowl well and get those wickets. The runs were a bonus.         
	If anyone in particular has influenced his batting         
	A lot of my teammates keep saying that I am capable of getting a hundred in Test cricket. But, so far I have always disappointed them. But today, they were happy that I got the runs for the team at a very crucial stage. But some of the seniors just told me that today was a good chance to score my maiden Test hundred. I missed it again. Hopefully, Ill get it next time.         
	On Dhonis illness         
	Dhoni is okay. He was actually shivering before he went on to bat. I dont know exactly what happened. He had wrapped blankets around him during lunch and it was really inspiring to see him back on the field and lead us. Had he wanted, he could have avoided batting. He couldnt score many runs, but that he still batted with fever, is indeed inspiring. I think hes feeling better now. And by tomorrow he should be fit.         
	If the wicket has been helping spinners         
	The wicket is quite slow and is not turning a lot. Nothing much is happening for the bowlers and one really has to work hard to get a wicket here. Its not even bouncing that much so you just have to make sure that you bowl to set fielding. Its a kind of wicket where you have to be very patient and I am sure if we bowl to our plans tomorrow, we should be able to get those wickets.         
	On Sachin Tendulkar missing his 50th Test hundred         
	I dont know if everyone is disappointed or not, but surely Sachin will be disappointed. He was set for the score and it was a great chance for him.         
	On Jeetan Patel         
	I think he bowled well. In the given conditions, there was nothing much on this wicket on the first day. You must have seen my reaction after winning the toss. I was really happy that we didnt have to bowl first. Because I know what kind of wicket this is and it is very tough for the bowlers to bowl on the first day. A lot of credit goes to Daniel (Vettori) for bowling a lot of overs and keeping things under control.         
	Main threats in the New Zealand line-up         
	They (New Zealand) have some serious batting coming up. Their two main batters (Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor) are batting at the moment. Then they have Jesse Ryder. He did really well against us in New Zealand and Daniel Vettori is also capable of scoring runs. We cant take them lightly. They might have lost a series in Bangladesh, but it doesnt make them a bad team. They are still a very good side and for us to beat them, will require a special effort.

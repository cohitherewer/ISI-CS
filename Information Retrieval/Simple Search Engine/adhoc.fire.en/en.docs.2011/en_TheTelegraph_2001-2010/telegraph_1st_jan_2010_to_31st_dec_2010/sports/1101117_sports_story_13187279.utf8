                                                                                                                       7                                        Paul: Messi miles ahead
            A STAFF REPORTER            Paul Breitner in the city, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Germanys 1974 World Cup winner and a Bayern Munich legend Paul Breitner is in the city for the Bayern Munich All Stars XI versus East Bengal All Stars XI charity match scheduled for Wednesday. On Tuesday, at a news conference, the 59-year-old youngster spoke at length from soccer during his time to contemporary football; about his all-time favourite Gerd Mueller to present favourite Lionel Messi.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q You are one of the firsts in football who started as a defender and then moved up in the midfield and scored goals. From football of today, who comes closest to your style of play?         
	A Look, football has changed a lot since I left the game. Now, most of the lateral backs go up and help the attackers. Those days it wasnt like that. In modern football, I like Phillipe Lahm (Germany and Bayern Munich). He reminds me of my style of football. And also Dani Alves (FC Barcelona, Brazil) and Maicon (Inter Milan and Brazil).         
	How is the experience of being part of a World Cup winning team.         
	Oh! 1974 World Cup win. Its still like a dream to me. We were the champions and stopped the favourites Holland from winning the Cup. It was a real good experience.         
	Whats your take on this years World Cup winners, Spain?         
	Deserving winners. They played brilliant football throughout the tournament and rightly won the Cup.         
	The idea of packing players from a single club. Is this a Spanish invention?         
	Never. Even in the 1970s the German team had players from Bayern Munich. Then you have Holland where players from Ajax got the preference. When the Bayern players were playing for Germany it was not about how we will win the World Cup, it was about when we will win. This Spanish team also is similar. The last five years they were playing with the same bunch of players. They won the Euro 2008 and now the World Cup. Its a culmination of proper planning.         
	Who according to you is the best player of this generation?         
	Lionel Messi. Leo is miles ahead. You cant compare Messi with anyone else. He is the best in business. He still has age on his side. So, I think he has a very good chance of becoming a World Cup winner.         
	But he wasnt that successful in the 2010 World Cup         
	Yes, true. For him to be successful you need good players around him. Like in Barcelona. He has a Xavi or an Andreas Iniesta or a Dani Alves. But while playing for Argentina he hardly gets good players around him.         
	Your all time favourite player?         
	Gerd Mueller. I havent seen a talented footballer like him in the last 50 years. He was a real striker. Give him the ball inside a box and he used to do miracles.         
	Your take on Germanys new find Thomas Mueller?         
	Oh! He is a find of World Cup 2010. Undoubtedly. He came as an unknown player and five weeks later he was a superstar. What else do you want from a footballer?         
	How do you justify Bayern Munichs loss to Inter Milan in last seaons Champions League final? Is it because of Jose Mourinho?         
	Champions League is just a tournament. A matter of one match. Bayern Munich did not play that well in the final and lost the match. Its as simple as that. And I dont think a coach has any role to play. Outside the ground he matters, but once the game starts it depends on those 11 players. How well they execute the coachs idea.         
	Which is the toughest league in the world?         
	Bundesliga. There is no doubt about that. In England, you have four teams battling for the title; in Spain, you have two teams always hogging the limelight. But in Germany, there are at least six others who are giving Bayern Munich a run for their money.         
	Your take on Wednesdays charity match?         
	We are here to win the match. In the Bayern dictionary the word loss is not there. This is my visit to Calcutta and I want to make it memorable. I am told during Oliver Khans testimonial match, it was a packed house at the Salt Lake Stadium. I will like a similar thing on Wednesday.

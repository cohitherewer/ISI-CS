The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A French touch in English Games!
                                                                                                                       7                                      A French touch in English Games!
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	The London Olympics will be officially conducted in French with English as its second language, according to previously secret contracts seen by this newspaper.         
	As the first tongue of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), it must take precedence at medal-giving and all other Olympic ceremonies. Billboards and pageantry in French as well as English must be displayed throughout the capital.         
	The stipulation is among thousands of pages of detailed demands made by the IOC as a condition of hosting the games. Other legally-binding requirements include providing at least 40,000 hotel rooms for IOC members, foreign sports administrators and other official guests, and producing the Queen for a ceremony planned by the IOC just before the games open, at which its members can all meet her.         
	The Union flag must be flown fifth in precedence behind the Olympic flag, the London 2012 symbol, the United Nations flag and the flag of Greece at the stadium and fourth elsewhere in London for the duration.         
	A recommended 700 people connected to the IOC must be given a dedicated car and chauffeur and 400 more must have a pool car and driver.         
	London must require behaviour modification for residents, public and business communities as transport is disrupted. The documents are the so-called Olympic technical manuals described by the IOC as an integral part of the host city contract signed by London in 2005 when it won the Games.         
	They were obtained under freedom of information laws by a magazine and a website after a two-year battle.         
	As well as saying that Olympic ceremonies must be presented in English and French and that the English version should be read after the French, they demand draconian powers to protect sponsors such as Coca-Cola and McDonalds, from ambush marketing by rivals. London is required to prevent spectators from wearing clothes or accessories with commercial messages other than the manufacturers brand name. This would ban them from wearing football clubs replica strips, which usually carry the name of the clubs sponsor.         
	Games organisers must attempt to confiscate any infringing ambush material from spectators, although there are warnings against being overzealous. The city authorities must also obtain control of all billboard advertising, city transport advertising, airport advertising etc for the duration of the games and the month preceding. Olympic brand protection teams must confront violators and conduct surveillance across London. Police and customs officers must enforce sponsorship rules.         
	Britain has complied by passing an Act of Parliament which makes ambush marketing at the Games a criminal offence and gives officials power to enter homes and seize infringing material.         
	The documents stipulate that IOC meeting rooms must be provided with photocopy paper in various colours  white, pink, green, blue  according to the precise instructions of the IOC.         
	A spokesman for London 2012 said: This is information provided to cities to get them thinking about all the things they need to do... The ambush marketing provisions are targeted on mass ambushes, not people wearing their football shirts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA thwart the Mexican wave
                                                                                                                       7                                      SA thwart the Mexican wave
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  Giovani dos Santos jumps onto Rafael Marquez after the latter equalised for Mexico   in the opening match of the World Cup, versus South Africa, on Friday        
	Johannesburg: There was little to complain about the organising skills of the South Africans but, from the footballing point of view, the World Cup hosts clearly have some catching up to do.         
	After a spectacular opening ceremony, the World Cup kicked off to the excitable sound of vuvuzelas brought in by the near-capacity crowd at Soccer City but that couldnt ensure a home victory against Mexico in their Group A match on Friday. South Africa were definitely lucky to escape with a 1-1 draw as the Mexicans were the better team on the pitch.         
	Siphiwe Tshabalala provided the signal for the South Africa fans to unleash a celebratory chorus of vuvuzela blasts when he fired the hosts to a 1-0 lead early in the second half but Barcelonas Rafael Marquez played party pooper by getting Mexicos goal in the 79th minute.         
	Tshabalalas goal in the 55th minute, however, was a beauty. Playing his 50th match for Bafana Bafana, he cut in from the left to collect a superb cross and fire past custodian Oscar Perezs left hand for the opening goal of the tournament.         
	For the equaliser, Marquez received a pass in the box and then beat goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune with a quick shot in the top corner.         
	South Africa, however, came close to collecting three points in the closing stages when Katlego Mphela outpaced two defenders only to see his left footer hit the post.         
	Friday was just not South Africas day. First, the spirit was dampened by news that Nelson Mandela would not be attending the opening ceremony due to his great granddaughters death in an accident caused by a drunk driver.         
	Fans wept openly as five planes flew over the stadium and the iconic township of Soweto before 1,500 performers piled on to the pitch for a choreographed dance routine.         
	The match evoked great enthusiasm and there were huge traffic jams around Soccer City right from morning. Roads around the stadium were declared off limits for cars and bomb squads swept the venue before the gates opened.         
	Largely outplayed, Bafana Bafana seemed jittery from the start. Mexican striker Giovani dos Santos was causing the home side plenty of trouble. In the 37th minute, the Mexicans were denied a goal which looked legitimate.         
	A Dos Santos cross found Carlos Vela who had the ball in the net but was ruled offside. That led the cluster of Mexico fans chanting Meh-hi-ko! Meh-hi-ko! to erupt in a loud chorus of disapproval while Mexico coach Javier Aguirre looked extremely unhappy with the decision. He gesticulated at the supervisors but was quick to regain his composure.         
	Aguirre had Thursday said his team would love to play party poopers against the hosts. I dont think the team with more friends in the stadium will win the match, he said. We have come here to play football, not for sightseeing, he warned.         
	No doubt the coach who replaced Sven-Goran Eriksson has kept his word.

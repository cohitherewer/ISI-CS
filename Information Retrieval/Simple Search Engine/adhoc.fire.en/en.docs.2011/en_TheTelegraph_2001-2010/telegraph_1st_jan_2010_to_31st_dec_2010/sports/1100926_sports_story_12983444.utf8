The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB gets ready for battle with ECB
                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB gets ready for battle with ECB
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is readying itself for a legal battle with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which has demanded financial compensation for PCB chief Ijaz Butts accusation against the English players.         
	Sources in the cricket board here confirmed that the ECB, in its letter to the PCB, not only demanded an unconditional apology from the PCB for Butts remarks against English players but also wanted compensation.         
	Sources also said that the ECB wants to be financially compensated for Butts comments, which it claimed has damaged the image and reputation of the English players.         
	The letter states that the PCB must compensate the ECB for loss of image and revenues because of Butts remarks during the one-day series, a source said.         
	Butt, however, is in no mood to apologise or pay any compensation to the ECB and has told his legal team to respond accordingly. The PCB legal team believes that the ECB has no case, since Butt never made any direct accusations and they are responding to the ECB letter accordingly, the source added.         
	Everyone should listen carefully to what the chairman said in his interview. He never directly accused anyone of match-fixing, so there is no question of an apology, Nadeem Sarwar, PCBs media manager, said.

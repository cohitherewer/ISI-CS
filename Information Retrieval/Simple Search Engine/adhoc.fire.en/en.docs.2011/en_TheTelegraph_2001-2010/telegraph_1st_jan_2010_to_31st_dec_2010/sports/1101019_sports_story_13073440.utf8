The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Theron does it   for the Proteas
                                                                                                                       7                                      Theron does it   for the Proteas
                            
	Potchefstroom: Rusty Theron took five wickets and Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers hit centuries as South Africa crushed Zimbabwe by eight wickets in the second one-day International between the sides at Senwes Park, on Sunday.         
	Theron took five for 44 as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 268. Amla hit 110 and De Villiers 101 not out to propel South Africa to a series-clinching win with 11 overs to spare.         
	With two runs needed to win, De Villiers, on 95, danced down the pitch and hit Brendan Taylor for six over long-off to raise his century.         
	Tatenda Taibu made a polished 78 for Zimbabwe but none of his teammates was able to capitalise on reasonable starts on an easy-paced pitch. Theron used clever variations of pace and length as he claimed five for 44.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger will emerge stronger: Mother
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger will emerge stronger: Mother
                      
	Ponte Vedra Beach (US): Golf superstar Tiger Woods made his first public statement on Friday since taking an indefinite break from the game in December after admitting he cheated on his wife.         
	Here are some of the reactions to his remarks:         
	As a human being everyone has faults, makes mistakes and sins. We all do. But, we move on when we make a mistake and learn from it, said Woods mother Kultida. He will come out stronger, a better person.         
	We look forward to seeing Tiger back on the golf course when the time is right for him and his family, said one of his major sponsors, Electronic Arts Inc, adding that its relationship with Woods remains unchanged.         
	We look forward to him returning to golf, said Nike Inc, another major sponsor. Nike said it fully supports him and his family.         
	Trading was already quiet, but when Tiger came on everybody was looking at the TV screens, said Peter Adams, livestock trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.         
	They were mocking him, Adams said of the Chicago traders. Only rich guys go to therapy for sex addiction, everybody else gets hit in the head with a frying pan.         
	Its tough to get any man in America just to go to marriage counseling let alone go into a 45-day rehabilitation. Plus hes going back tomorrow (Saturday), and that tells me that hes trying to learn about the issues ... to learn about the thought processes that caused the actions, so that he can cut them off next time, said Notah Begay, PGA golfer and friend of Tigers from Stanford days.         
	Were supportive of whenever he comes back, whether its three weeks from now, or three months from now, thats less important than when he comes back, hes prepared to play to resume his career in a positive way so that hes there for the long haul. This public address is a good step, said PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem.         
	We wish Tiger well as he works through these private matters, said a spokesman for sponsor Gatorade, which is part of PepsiCo Inc.         
	Tiger spoke today and addressed the issues he felt were most important. His words stand on their own. We wish him and his family the best, said a spokesman for Procter amp; Gambles Gillette brand, adding that its sponsor relationship with Woods remained unchanged.

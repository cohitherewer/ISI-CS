	London: Tottenham Hotspur edged closer to a possible Champions League place after a 2-1 victory at Stoke City kept them clear of the pack in the race for fourth place in the Premier League on Saturday.         
	Goals from substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen and Niko Kranjcar earned Spurs the win against a Stoke side reduced to 10 men early in the second half when Dean Whitehead was dismissed. Victory took Spurs to 55 points from 30 matches.         
	Aston Villa, also in the race for fourth, stumbled in their lunchtime kick-off when they were held to a 2-2 draw by their relegation-threatened local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers.(REUTERS)

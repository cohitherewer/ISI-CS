The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Loews boys lick wounds, plot rise

  - Germany look to regroup after shock loss against Serbia
            JAYDEEP BASU            Lukas Podolski                           
	Erasmia: The normally sleepy village of Erasmia, on the outskirts of Tshwane, is buzzing with activity these days. Hundreds of cars are lined up on either side of the main road near the Velmore Hotel, currently the German base in South Africa. The hotel gates are heavily guarded and a number of police cars can be spotted patrolling the area in and around the village.         
	The mood inside the camp, however, is one of anguish and despair. After a 4-0 thrashing of Australia, the unexpected defeat against Serbia has upset all calculations. The three-time world champions are now faced with a must-win situation against Ghana in their last group league match in order to secure progress into the second round.         
	Media attention has been heavy but, at a practice session, cameras were focused almost entirely on Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, the two culprits from the match against Serbia. Coach Joachim Loew saved the duo and the rest from the glare by ordering everyone out after 20 minutes to turn it into a close-door practice session.         
	Back at the hotel, an hour-and-a-half later, the Germans suddenly came under tremendous fire when manager Oliver Bierhoff turned up for the official briefing. There were even demands for the coach and the manager to immediately resign should Germany lose to Ghana on Wednesday. But Bierhoff is not one to take things lying down.         
	I have been asked this question at least a thousand times, the former national team striker said. If there is really no round of 16 after the Ghana match, both of us will definitely sit across the table and decide on our future.         
	You must realise that things were not normal against Serbia. The post came in our way a couple of times; there was a missed penalty and a card happy referee.         
	I know it was a humbling experience for the German fans. We had long discussions with the players afterwards. The Ghana match will fetch us three points, he assured.         
	Bierhoffs argument couldnt convince many. In the Serbia match, it became clear that the Germans are not as strong as the Australia result suggested. While Loew has plenty of central defenders in his squad, he only has two full-backs  Philipp Lahm and Dennis Aogo.         
	Natural central defenders Jerome Boateng, Arne Friedrich and Holger Badstuber have all played on the flanks, but they lack the agility and pace required to defend against genuine wingers and offer very little in attack.         
	Moving up the pitch, the Germans have only Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger  both are a booking away from suspension  as defensive central midfield options. Aogo is capable of playing in such a role but is naturally far more suited to a full-back position.         
	Upfront, both Podolski and Klose are at the receiving end for a lacklustre show. Klose was dismissed from the pitch for a clumsy tackle and Podolski missed a handful of chances apart from also failing to convert a penalty.         
	Despite the pressure, the Germans are not sparing any effort in trying to make it look normal. On Saturday, the players were given a day off. Some of the players were allowed to meet their wives and girlfriends.         
	Even Michael Ballack may come over to encourage the team once we reach the second round, said the manager         
	Yet, Wednesdays match against Ghana would surely be the final before the final for the Germans. What is plan B should Germany lose against Ghana, Bierhoff was asked. In that case, we wont need a plan B, said the manager. You dont need a plan if you are out of the World Cup.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Win bigger than No. 1 spot: Rafa 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Rafael Nadal with his trophy at the Disneyland Resort in Marne-la-Vallee, outside Paris, on Monday. (Reuters)                           
	French Open champion Rafael Nadal has returned to No. 1 in the ATP rankings 11 months after relinquising it to Roger Federer, but the Spaniard insists winning his seventh Grand Slam means more to him.         
	Rafael Nadals fifth title at the French Open  a year after he was upset in the fourth round  gave him enough rankings points to move up from second place.         
	He was ranked No. 1 for 46 weeks previously, but was overtaken by Roger Federer in July 2009. Believe me, I am very happy about getting back to the top, Nadal said after beating Robin Soderling 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in Sundays final. But the 24-year-old Spaniard also made perfectly clear that he was more excited about winning his seventh Grand Slam title than his new ranking.         
	When I was crying after the match, he said, the last thing I was thinking (about was) No. 1.         
	Nadals promotion to the top spot brings an end to Federers campaign of tying Pete Sampras career record of 286 weeks at No 1  the Swiss player was just one week off the achievement.         
	Federer won last years French Open, but he lost to Soderling in the quarter finals last week. Soderlings second consecutive runner-up finish at Roland Garros  he also was the player who stunned Nadal in 2009  allowed him to rise one place to a career-high No 6.         
	This was very, very important for the rest of the season, to build a little bit of confidence and to be able to play better and better for every match, said Soderlings coach, Magnus Norman.         
	Because he was tense going in. The last couple of weeks before the French, he was talking a lot about how many (rankings) points he has to defend.         
	Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Nikolay Davydenko complete the top five.         
	The French Open also saw Andy Roddick climb one spot to seventh and reigning US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro slide two notches to eighth. He missed the French Open due to injury.         
	He was all smiles on Sunday but there were times earlier this year when Rafael Nadals uncle and coach Toni feared his nephew was struggling to recover from the darkest period of his career.         
	Toni Nadal, Rafaels uncle and coach, who has been with the Spaniard since he was a toddler, joined the celebrations. Last year was a very difficult one and I remember the final tournament (ATP World Tour Finals) in London was very tough, a sweating Toni told reporters in the players restaurant minutes after the victory.         
	Now we are here and we are very happy and for us its unbelievable. This makes up for last year. I did have some doubts though. I believed in the work we were doing but I started to think maybe it would not be enough. When we finished 2009, we finished with problems which wasnt good. Last year he had many problems and the problems with his knees.         
	Nadals defeat by Soderling in the fourth round of the French Open last year began a torrid few months for the Mallorcan. He missed his Wimbledon defence with knee problems and lost his top ranking while off court the divorce of his parents also weighed heavily on his shoulders.         
	Nadal failed to win a tournament during the second half of 2009 and at the ATP World Tour Finals he did not even manage to win a set. Toni said that it was not until the start of the claycourt season that things began to turn.         
	He was good in the first tournament in Doha but then he had problems again in Australia In the big moments I thought he wasnt so good with his mentality. He was making mistakes on break points and big points which was not like him, said Toni.

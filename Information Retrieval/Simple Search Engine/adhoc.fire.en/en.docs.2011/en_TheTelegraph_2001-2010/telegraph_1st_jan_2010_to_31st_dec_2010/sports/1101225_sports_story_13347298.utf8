            OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES            Salman Butt                           
	Calcutta/Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC), on Friday, rubbished a report that stated Pakistans suspended Test captain Salman Butt may face a seven-year ban while his teammates, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, could escape with two year bans respectively.         
	A report said Friday that Butt is likely to be banned and slapped with a heavy financial penalty. But ICC spokesperson, Sami-ul-Hasan, clarified that the report is completely untrue and speculative.         
	He said: The decision on the trio will be made by the anti-corruption tribunal, which is hearing in Doha between January 6 and 11. No such decision as has been made yet. What has been reported is far from true.         
	The report said that the ICC ACU have prepared a long list of evidence against him based on the fact that he was captain and responsible for the conduct of the team. It added that the fact that Butt was captain would entail the longest ban on him.         
	As far as Asif and Aamer are concerned, they are likely to escape with shorter bans of around two years each for their role in the spot-fixing allegations, the report said.         
	These two pacers are in a position to plead that they were ordered by their captain to do what they did it said.         
	It is reported that the ICC had been given plenty of evidence and video footage of interviews with Pakistani bookmaker Mazhar Majeed by the News of the World. There is a chance that the decision might be announced on Jan. 11 evening, Hasan said.

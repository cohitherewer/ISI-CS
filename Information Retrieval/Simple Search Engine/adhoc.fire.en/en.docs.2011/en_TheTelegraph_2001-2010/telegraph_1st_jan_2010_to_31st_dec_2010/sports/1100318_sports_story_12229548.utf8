            A STAFF REPORTER            Chris Gayle                           
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders will be bolstered by the presence of West Indies skipper Chris Gayle who is all set to play against the Rajasthan Royals in the franchises fourth Indian Premier League outing in Ahmedabad on Sunday.         
	Gayle who led his side to 4-1 ODI series victory over Zimbabwe at home reached Mumbai on Wednesday. He will be flying straight to Ahmedabad, where he will be joined by his teammates. The Knight Riders squad will be flying to Ahmedabad on Wednesday morning.         
	The reassuring factor for skipper Sourav Ganguly will be Gayles form. He topped the batting chart with 273 runs, which included three half-centuries and a highest score of 88.         
	The Knight Riders first team players didnt turn up for training as it was an optional session for the players. The reserves, however, trained for a couple of hours under coach Dav Whatmore.         
	According to sources, Gayle will be replacing Owais Shah in the first XI. With Shane Bond and Angelo Mathews being automatic choices in the first XI, Brad Hodge is certainly a favourite to retain his spot in the side as he can bowl useful off-breaks. It is also learnt that Rohan Gavaskar is likely to be kept out of the XV for the Ahmedabad match. A few names like Harpreet Singh, Chirag Pathak and Ganapathi Vignesh are doing the rounds.         
	Meanwhile, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi will be meeting chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti to discuss about the Super Hospitality Structure which has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, PWD secretary Ajit Bardhan, sports secretary Raghavendra Jha are also expected to be present at the meeting to be held at Writers Buildings.

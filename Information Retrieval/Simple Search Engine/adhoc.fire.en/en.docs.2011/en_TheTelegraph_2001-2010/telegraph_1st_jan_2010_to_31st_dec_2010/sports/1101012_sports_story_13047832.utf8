                                                                                                                       7                                        The future of women's tennis   is bleak, says Sania Mirza

	New Delhi: Commonwealth Games silver medallist Sania Mirza agrees that the future of womens tennis is very bleak in India.         
	Poojashree (Venkatesh) is a young prospect now. Its an open secret that Nirupama Sanjeev had to come out of retirement to play for India at the CWG, said Sania at a media conference on Monday, a day after partnering Rushmi Chakravarthy to win the bronze in an all-Indian playoff tie. For the record, Sania and Rushmi won 6-4, 6-2 defeating Nirupama and Poojashree.         
	In 2005, I came out of the blue and it caught many people by surprise. But, Leander (Paes), Mahesh (Bhupathi), and I cant continue to play forever. After the infrastructure and facilities the CWG has provided us with, I hope young girls take to the sport.         
	At the moment, Indian mens tennis is looking much brighter than the womens.         
	Tennis had five gold medals in the offing and it was expected that India would win at least two in doubles, as opposed to singles. Tennis is not a sport where one can make assumptions. One can never definitely say that well win.         
	Sure, Leander and Mahesh were the favourites to win the mens doubles. Since Leander and I had won the mixed gold in the Doha Asian Games, we were expected to repeat the performance.         
	But, lets celebrate what we achieved and not cry over what we couldnt, said Sania sportingly. India won one gold, one silver and two bronze medals.         
	However, she did add that the moths and insects that had infested the courts during the floodlight matches were distracting.         
	Ive never seen anything like it in Delhi. There were so many different kinds of moths and insects. Of course its very distracting, especially when they get in your mouth and nose. But, I tried to block it out while playing, she said.         
	Im looking forward to the Asian Games. My body and wrists are injury-free (touchwoods). If one is injury-free, then everything falls into place.         
	Here, there were complaints about the scheduling but thats no excuse. As professionals, we have to play tough matches every week, claimed the world No. 137.         
	She congratulated her favourite cricketer Sachin Tendulkar on scoring his 49th Test century in the on-going Test at Bangalore against Australia, and also wished Gagan Narang, who is aiming for his sixth CWG gold, the best.         
	Tennis has been scrapped from the Glasgow Games in 2014.         
	Personally, Im glad that I won a medal in front of my home crowd. Our game always goes up a notch higher when we represent India, said the 23-year-old.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rude welcome for Indian shooters 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rude welcome for Indian shooters 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            A Trinidad and Tobago athlete in New Delhi,   on Sunday                                 
	New Delhi: The members of Indian shooting squad could be the biggest medal winners in the Commonwealth Games, but the organising committee (OC) seems oblivious of their credentials.         
	On Sunday, when the star-studded shooting team reached the Karni Singh range for their daily practice, the rifle and pistol shooters were forced to train with pellets of inferior quality.         
	For the competition, we are using Eley Tenex cartridges, said a shooter, who did not wish to be named.         
	When we asked for the specified ammunition, we were told that it would be available only next week.         
	The shooters are particularly unhappy with the fact that with just seven days left for the Games to begin, they were made to train with pellets, which will not be used during the event.         
	Our day was wasted, said another shooter, though chief coach Sunny Thomas said the specified bullets would be available from Monday.         
	Shooters pointed out that the OC should have been aware that they were training for an event as big as the Games and made adequate arrangements for the same.         
	This is not the first time that the shooters have felt wronged. They were made to wait for six hours to get into the Games Village after landing from Pune.         
	After waiting at the airport well past the midnight because of non-availability of the team bus, the shooting team went to the Karni Singh range to deposit their guns.         
	Finally, when they reached the Village at three in the morning, it took volunteers an hour to find the flats allocated for the Indian team.         
	While Sunny Thomas described the situation chaotic, Village sources said that only 429 of the 1,138 rooms have been furnished so far.         
	It is bound to happen with many teams, an official said.

	Southampton: Michael Clarke struck an unbeaten 87 to guide Australia to a challenging total of 267/7 against England in the one-day International at The Rose Bowl Tuesday.         
	Clarkes 97-ball innings included seven fours, while opener Shane Watson (32) and James Hopes (34) also weighed in with decent knocks for the tourist. (Agencies)

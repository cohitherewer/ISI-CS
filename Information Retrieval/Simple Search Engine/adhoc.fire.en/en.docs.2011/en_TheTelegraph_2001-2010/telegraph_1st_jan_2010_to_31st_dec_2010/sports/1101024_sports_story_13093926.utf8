The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Look at larger picture, not the mixed signals
                                                                                                                       7                                        Look at larger picture, not the mixed signals
    - IPL governing council member on the recent events           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Out in the cold: Shilpa and Preity                                         
	Calcutta: A fortnight after two Indian Premier League (IPL) franchisees were shown the door, and another franchise directed to quickly get its house in order, a member of the all-powerful governing council has admitted that the actions have actually sent mixed signals.         
	I accept the signals havent all been positive, that theyve been mixed somewhat... The remaining seven owners have reason to be a bit wary, but all should focus on the larger picture, the council member told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, the council member added: The larger picture says it all... Its good that the clean up started after three years and not, perhaps, five. This exercise may not have been possible then, with the situation getting out of hand... Whatever has happened is for the best...         
	You could argue that we were quiet on Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab for three years, but the (old) governing council wasnt privy to everything which went on... (Former chairman and commissioner Lalit Kumar) Modi alone knew it all... Henceforth no one man will be able to run the IPL as his private property...         
	One learns from mistakes and the Modi-experience has definitely been an eye-opener... For anybody to pretend otherwise would be very wrong.         
	The council member reiterated what Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Shashank Manohar said on October 10  that the move against the Royals and the Kings XI was wholly in accordance with legal opinion.         
	An open and shut case... Its a coincidence that Modis relatives are part of the two franchisees, the council member insisted. Nobody, of course, believes that the Modi connection didnt play any part at all.         
	But, then, the BCCI would only like the larger picture to be seen.         
	According to the governing council member, the Kochi matter is going to be handled entirely by him and his colleagues. Look, today, anything is possible...         
	The governing council member, though, emphasised that the Kochi franchise owners hadnt breached a single provision laid out in the tender process. The issue is their organisational structure... We cant deal with different faces and surely cant listen to different voices.         
	Chairman Chirayu Amin, one learns, is to convene an emergent meeting of the governing council in the next few days.         
	Kochi and Pune (owned by Sahara) are the new franchises, both having made it in March. Kochi, in fact, has figured in one controversy or the other from the very beginning with a Union minister  Shashi Tharoor  even losing his job.         
	Manohar, Amin, BCCI secretary (also the president-elect) Narayanswamy Srinivasan, joint-secretary Sanjay Jagdale and treasurer Mohinder Pandove apart, the governing councils members are: Arun Jaitley, Rajeev Shukla, Ajay Shirke, Ranjib Biswal, Anurag Thakur, Ravi Shastri and Mohinder Amarnath.         
	Shirke, Biswal, Thakur and Amarnath werent on the governing council which functioned during the Modi era.

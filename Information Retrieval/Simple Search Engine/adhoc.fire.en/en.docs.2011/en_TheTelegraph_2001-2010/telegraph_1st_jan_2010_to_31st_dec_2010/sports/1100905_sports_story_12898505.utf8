                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan trio quizzed about calls and texts
    - Salman Butts role in the sordid episode is under closest scrutiny             Richard Edwards                                                        (From top) Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif amp; Mohammed Aamer       
	Tainted Pakistan trio Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, linked to alleged spot-fixing controversy, have been questioned by detectives over text messages, phone calls and secret bank accounts.         
	Aamer, the teenage pacer, seen as one of the games most exciting talents, spent almost five hours on Friday being interviewed under caution.         
	He was asked about a message he allegedly sent to Mazhar Majeed  the agent arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers  last Friday, saying Shall I do it or not?         
	Hours later, it is claimed, he deliberately bowled a no-ball in the fourth Test at Lords. Captain Butt and Asif were also questioned. They were asked about secret accounts in Swiss and British banks, which, according to the News of the World investigation, Majeed said he had set up in their names.         
	Sources said that the role of Butt, interviewed last by the Scotland Yard detectives, was under closest scrutiny.         
	It has already been reported that 50,000 was found in his room by the police. Butt said that the money, some in foreign currency, was for paying a dowry for his sister. Police are investigating whether the notes were those handed over by an undercover reporter.         
	It is believed that Asif has also told investigators that it was Butt who first introduced the players to Majeed, his agent, several years ago.         
	Sir Ronnie Flanagan, head of the International Cricket Councils anti-corruption unit, said that, having seen the evidence, all the players have a really arguable case to answer in our disciplinary arena.         
	Further revelations this weekend are expected to focus on four more Pakistan cricketers, and claims that the team would deliberately lose two coming one-day matches.         
	The scandal is being investigated worldwide by five agencies, including federal authorities in Pakistan and Britains Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca).         
	It emerged on Friday evening that Her Majestys Revenue and Customs started looking into Majeeds tax affairs months ago and tapped his phone. They were apparently suspicious of phone calls abroad talking about cricket matches, and tipped off officials.         
	The disclosure will lead to questions about how long police and cricket authorities knew about the allegations. As part of the Metropolitan police inquiry into the Lords incident, Aamer was questioned at Kilburn police station in north London, on Friday.         
	The 18 year-old was questioned in the presence of his solicitor over an alleged phone call from Majeed the night before the Lords match, about bowling no balls.         
	According to the News of the World, Majeed also said that, before play on the second day, Aamer texted him to ask: Shall I do it or not? He then allegedly bowled a no ball in the third ball of the third over, as ordered by Majeed, according to the paper.         
	Asif was questioned next, for two hours. Detectives deliberately left Butt to last. All three players protested their innocence. None was arrested and they were released without charge.         
	Majeed, 35, was arrested and bailed earlier this week pending further inquiries by Scotland Yard. He is said to have denied all the allegations. Scotland Yard sources said they were still in the early days of a long and complex inquiry.         
	Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistans High Commissioner, has said the players will remain as long as is required to clear their names.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Following is an extract from the transcript of the conversation between The News of the World reporter and bookie Mazhar Majeed.         
	Reporter: If theres two or three that are on for the other side, the betting side, then good luck  theyll be really happy.         
	Bookie: Theres more than two or three. Believe me. Its already set up. Thats already there. Im very wary speaking about this simply because I dont know you guys. Ive been dealing with these guys for seven years, okay? Who we deal with and how we deal with it is very, very important. This is the main thing. Im only dealing with certain people. How we do it and what we do is very, very crucial.         
	Reporter: Youre already dealing with another party on this matter? Give us some tips as well if youve got any. Happy to cut us in?         
	Bookie: Yeah Ill give you tips.         
	Reporter: If theres anything we need to know in the forthcoming match let me know. Happy to pay.         
	Bookie: I do feel that I can speak to you about this, okay? Now, yes... there is very big money in it.         
	Reporter: Theres still? I know there was, but they clamped down on match fixing I heard.         
	Bookie: Theyve toned down match-fixing a lot, yeah. Theyve made it very, very difficult. These guys wont deal with just anybody. The only reason theyll deal with me is because they know Im a professional, theyve known me for years. Ive been doing it with them, the Pakistani team, for about 2 and half years. And weve made masses and masses of money.         
	The bookie now, reveals solid details of the three no-balls hed planned for the Lords Test         
	Bookie: Theres no risk, theres no signal... these three are definitely happening. Theyve all been organised, okay? So, the first ball of the third over of the innings, yeah. Asif and Amir are going to be bowling. Amir is to bowl the first over (meaning he will also bowl the third), yeah? Okay? Then the 10th, the last ball... sixth ball of the 10th over.         
	Reporter: The 10th over. Whos bowling it?         
	Bookie: Asif will be bowling it.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Changes worked for us: Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Zealand clinched a thriller against Pakistan in Bridgetown as they beat the defending champions by 1 run.         
	Daniel Vettori, the Black Caps captain, praised his bowlers, at the post-match presentation ceremony, for holding their nerves during the final overs. Vettori is also hopeful that his team will make it to the semi-finals of the World Twenty20.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Vettori: Its a good feeling that we have now put ourselves in a position where we can qualify for the semi-finals. We made a couple of changes in Kyle Mills and Ian Butler and it worked wonderfully for us. Both have pace and are wicket-taking bowlers. It wasnt a big total to defend, but our bowlers did a splendid job to defend the total. We definitely backed our bowlers. While batting, it was always difficult to negotiate the top quality Pakistan spinners. We should have definitely got another 25-30 odd runs. Our bowlers needed to put that extra effort and our bowling changes also worked.         
	Shahid Afridi: It was a good game and we enjoyed being a part of an exciting match. Salman Butt (who scored an unbeaten 67) played a very matured knock. But I must give credit to the New Zealand bowlers for the manner in which they kept things tight during the first six overs. I can now only hope that we display the same positive attitude and play with pride.         
	Ian Butler: I was trying to get a hang of things during the end overs. It was a very close match. I always wanted to bowl the last over But just when couple of overs were left, I wasnt very sure of what I wanted to do. But we just hung in there and, thankfully, it worked in our favour. Its definitely the biggest game I have played for New Zealand.

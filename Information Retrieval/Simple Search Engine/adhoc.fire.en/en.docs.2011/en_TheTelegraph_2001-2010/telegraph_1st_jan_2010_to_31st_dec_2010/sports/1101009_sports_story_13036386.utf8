The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alkas food for thought
                                                                                                                       7                                      Alkas food for thought
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The chief coach of the Indian womens wrestling team, P.R. Sondhi had an interesting tale to tell after Alka Tomar and Anita added two more gold to Indias medal tally, in the Commonwealth Games, on Friday.         
	With a huge crowd at the Indira Gandhi Stadium wildly cheering the Indian girls for their historic achievements, Sondhi said the girls had done wonders in the last few months.         
	Our results in the Asian championships early this year were truly disappointing. I strongly felt our girls were physically weaker than the rivals, despite being technically good.         
	So, I suggested the girls should start taking non-vegetarian food. Almost all the girls in the team are strict vegetarians and it is difficult to drive home the idea. But thankfully, some of them listened to me and at least started eating eggs.         
	The coach claimed that the change in food habit did play a role in making the girls stronger. I think it helped. All said and done, the girls have done a superb job in this championship.         
	Alka, considered the most experienced wrestler in the Indian team said: Yes, I am eating eggs these days but couldnt muster enough courage to take other non-vegetarian food. But I was also practising very hard for the Commonwealth Games. However, today (Friday) morning I just had a soft drink before coming for the bouts.         
	The girl from Meerut was a treat to watch in the 59kg freestyle final against Canadian wrestler Tonya Verbeek, an Olympic medal winner. Pitted against the formidable opponent, Alka employed her best technique and finally won with a 3-2 verdict. The bronze went to Nigerian Tega Tosin Richard, who defeated Englands Louisa Bernadette Salmon 5-0.         
	Indian woman wrestler Anita won the gold in the freestyle 67kg category. She defeated Canadian M. Buydens 4-1 to take Indias tally of gold medals in womens wrestling to three.         
	In the 51kg category, Babita Kumari, the younger sister of Thursdays gold winner Geeta, lost to Nigerian Ifeoma Christiana Nwoye 4-7 in the final, to win the silver.

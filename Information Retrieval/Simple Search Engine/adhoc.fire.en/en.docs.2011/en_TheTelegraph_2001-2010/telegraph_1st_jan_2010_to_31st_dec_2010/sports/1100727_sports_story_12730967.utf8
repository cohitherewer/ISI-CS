The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need more than 550: Dilshan 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Need more than 550: Dilshan 
  - India were on the backfoot right from the start, says opener       A CORRESPONDENT            Tillekaratne Dilshan in Colombo, on Monday. (AP)                                 
	Tillekaratne Dilshan, along with Tharanga Paranavitana, provided Sri Lanka with the start that helped them to amass 312 for two at the end of the first days play of the second Test, against India, in Colombo, on Monday.         
	Dilshan, however, said at the media conference that he regretted throwing away his wicket and not going on to play a longer innings. He also said that Lanka would try to put up a score in excess of 550.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Lankas batting on the day         
	When we started, they (India) were on the backfoot. Then Tharanga (Paranavitana) and Sangakkara batted without taking any risks. I dont think there was any problem for the batsmen today (Monday). Mahela is also batting well. With him and Sanga in the middle, theres lot of confidence.         
	If getting runs towards the end of the day was difficult         
	They were bowling to one side of the wicket and had set the field that way. Thats why we ended up making 77 runs in the last session. But 312 is a good score at end of day one.         
	Paranavitanas innings         
	Hes a good opener. Hes done well in domestic tournaments. He struggled to get the first hundred. The first hundred is always difficult in Test cricket. Once you get that away, it gets easier. Today he was more confident. If there was a loose ball, he went after it and hes more confident. He has matured now and so hes getting more hundreds. He also rotates the strike often and I can attack the loose balls ten. In a partnership, thats vital. We have a good understanding and thats working. We have found a good opener in Tests.         
	If he regrets not getting a big score         
	I wanted to get a single. But the ball was little short and I tried to hit over (VVS) Laxmans head, but unfortunately, it went straight to him. The wicket is great and I regret getting out. When I returned to the dressing room, I realised that I could have played a big innings. The wicket is helping the batsmen After the first three-four overs, you feel easy to bat. Its not very easy to bowl fast on this wicket.         
	If he needs to change his batting style         
	I dont want to change a lot. I have scored 11 hundreds playing this way and this is my seventh Test as an opener. While opening, I have managed an average of 63. Sometimes, I tend to think, like today, that had I remained at the wicket, I could have gone on for a big score. There are certain ways to which I have got used to and I dont want to change them.         
	Whether he prefers opening the innings         
	I like to open the innings.         
	On Dr Eliyantha White, who helped him recover from injury         
	I went and met him and took some medicine after fracturing my finger. That really helped me to recover quickly. Hes a magic doctor and I went to see him twice And on both occasions he helped me to recover quickly. He prescribes a liquid medicine and that helps to heal quickly.         
	Lankas bowling attack         
	We wanted to give (Chanaka) Welegedara a rest, so Dammika came in. Lasith is struggling with his knees and so Dilhara came in. We have confidence on the two spinners, debutant Suraj (Randiv) and Ajantha Mendis, that they are good enough to take wickets.         
	The ideal score         
	If we score over 550, we can put lot of pressure on them. Thats a good total.         
	If the SSC pitch will produce a result         
	Traditionally at SSC, the second day is very good for batting. If we bat well and score over 550, by the third and fourth day our spinners can make a mark. Apart from them, Dhammika (Prasad) and Dilhara (Fernando) have extra pace, bowling over 140kmph. Not having Lasith (Malinga) though is a blow. In the last match, he did well. But there are opportunities for the guys who have come into the team and I hope they will make a mark. Tomorrow (Tuesday) will be very good for batting. However, there will be a lot of bounce for spinners on day three and four.         
	India not playing five bowlers         
	We also play with four bowlers, plus, luckily, we have Angelo (Mathews). Had they gone with an additional bowler, they would have been forced to drop a batsman. I think they are going with the right combination here.         
	On the chance of becoming the No. 1 in Tests         
	If we win the seires 2-0 well be No. 1. Thats in our mind and itll be good if we can get that.

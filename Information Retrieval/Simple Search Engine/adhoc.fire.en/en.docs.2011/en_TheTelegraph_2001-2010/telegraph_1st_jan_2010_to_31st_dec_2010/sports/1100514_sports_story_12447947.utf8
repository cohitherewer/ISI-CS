            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Fabio Capello attempted to lay down the law to his World Cup squad on Wednesday by instructing them not to enter into transfer negotiations during the tournament.         
	Capello has already taken the preventative step of banning agents from the team hotel, but felt it necessary to reinforce his message that even discussing club matters with advisers on the phone will be frowned upon.

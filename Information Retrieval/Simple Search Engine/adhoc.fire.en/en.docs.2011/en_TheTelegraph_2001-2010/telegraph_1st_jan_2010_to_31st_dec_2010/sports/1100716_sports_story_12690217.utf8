The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina a step from summit 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina a step from summit 
                  Saina Nehwal                     
	New Delhi: Shuttler Saina Nehwal is just a step away from realising her goal of becoming the worlds numero uno player as she rose one place to a career-best second in the latest international badminton rankings.         
	I am very happy to achieve the world No.2 so early in my career. The last three wins have really helped me.         
	It is a great feeling but I feel my priority would still be to win more tournaments for India rather than focusing on rankings, Saina said.         
	It will be difficult to hold onto the (No.2) ranking, but I hope to continue my hard work and win more titles and become the No.1 player soon, said the shuttler from Hyderabad who is currently down with fever and cold.         
	The 20-year-old Saina has enjoyed a meteoric rise following a hattrick of title triumphs beginning with the India Open Grand Prix. Then came the Singapore Open Super Series victory, which saw her rise to the third spot last month.         
	And, after Saina defended her Indonesian Open Super Series crown, it was just a matter of time before she jumped to second.         
	By virtue of her consecutive title wins, Saina now has 64791.2637 points and is just behind Chinas Yihan Wang, while Xin Wang of China is No.3.         
	Sainas father, Harvir Singh, also expressed happiness and hoped her daughter continues with the good work.         
	God has been kind. It is a marvellous achievement. I hope she can continue to work hard and win more laurels for the country, Singh said.         
	In March, Saina had risen to the fifth position after becoming the first Indian woman to reach the semi-finals of the prestigious All England Super Series Championships.         
	However, she dropped to No.6 in the subsequent weeks. Sainas next engagement will be the World Badminton Championship in Paris next month, before she joins the field for the Commonwealth and Asian Games. The Hyderabad girl was confident about her chances at these events.         
	It is a very big ranking for me. There will be pressure on me being the No.2 but I dont want to think about it. It will be a tough tournament and, in a way, its good I achieved the ranking before the World Championship, she said. I am confident I can do well there. My strategy would be to work hard, train harder, stay fit and give my best, Saina added.         
	Saina will be carrying Indian hopes in the Commonwealth Games and she revealed that she would work on her fitness and strokes to be in peak form for the October 3-14 event.         
	I am happy with my fitness, but for the Commonwealth Games I will have to push my fitness further and work on my strokes. There is still time and all players have to be really fit to do well in the tournament, she said.         
	Fitness is a key element in Sainas preparation and the shuttler has time and again stressed the importance of physically being at a peak for good results.         
	I only pray that I stay injury free now to focus on the World Championships, the Delhi Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games in China, Saina said a few days back.         
	After winning three tournaments in a row, my confidence level has gone up, Saina said. For me, it is important to stay focused and keep working hard and play selective tournaments so that I can stay injury free and play well.         
	In mens ranking, the Indian trio of Chetan Anand, P. Kashyap and Arvind Bhatt were at the 15th, 25th and 27th spots respectively. The mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V. Diju were static at No.7.           (AGENCIES)

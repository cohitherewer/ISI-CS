The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB makes a marginal gain
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB makes a marginal gain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) failed to make significant profits from the two international matches that were held at the Eden in November and February. The India versus Sri Lanka ODI was held in December 24 last year, while the Test match against South Africa was held from February 14-18.         
	The CAB finance committee met on Tuesday to discuss the expenses incurred during the two international matches organised in the last three months.         
	The profit from the ODI has been approximately Rs 2 lakh while the gains from the Test is approximately Rs 12 lakh.         
	There were no public sale of tickets during the ODI due to renovation of galleries. Thats why the profit margin is very low. Whatever profits we have made is due to the advertisement on the tickets and revenue generated through the ground panel advertisements, a senior CAB official said on Tuesday.         
	For the Test, it was better since some tickets were up for public sale apart from the advertisement revenues.         
	The finance committee also discussed the budget for organising the seven KKR home matches. The committee reached a conclusion that our expenses wont exceed Rs 2.5 crore (the amount they will receive from the KKR) unlike IPL I. Besides, Rs 1 crore will be directly paid by the KKR to the police and CMC authorities, the official remarked.

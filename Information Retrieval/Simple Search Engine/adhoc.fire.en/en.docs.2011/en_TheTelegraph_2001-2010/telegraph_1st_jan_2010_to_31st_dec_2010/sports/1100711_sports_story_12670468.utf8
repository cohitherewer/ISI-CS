	London: Spains hopes of a hattrick of Davis Cup triumphs ended when they fell 0-3 to France in Clermont-Ferrand after losing Saturdays doubles rubber.         
	The French pair, Michael Llodra and Julien Benneteau, beat Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez in four sets to give the hosts an unassailable lead in their quarter final tie.         
	Llodra and Benneteau delighted the enthusiastic home crowd with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-7, 7-6 win to earn France a first Davis Cup victory over Spain since 1923 and send captain Guy Forgets team into the semi-finals.         
	Even without world No. 1 Rafael Nadal, who is resting his knees after his French Open and Wimbledon triumphs, Spain fielded a powerful team but the writing was on the wall when they lost both of Fridays singles.         
	Gael Monfils beat David Ferrer in five sets before Llodra saw off Verdasco in four.         
	France will face the winners of the quarter final between Russia and Argentina which the south Americans were leading 2-1 after Horacio Zeballos and Eduardo Schwank won Saturdays doubles in Moscow against Nikolay Davydenko and Igor Kunitsyn.         
	Serbia edged 2-1 ahead of Croatia in Split. (Agencies)

	Mysore: In a rare incident of a kind, the Poonawalla Mysore Derby, on Sunday, was declared null and void after a false start. The 5-4 favourite Sun Kingdom, and Bucethalis, unseat their respective jockeys  B. Prakash and Vinod Shinde  right at the gates, and thus the decision by the clubs stewards. They may re-frame the race after three weeks.

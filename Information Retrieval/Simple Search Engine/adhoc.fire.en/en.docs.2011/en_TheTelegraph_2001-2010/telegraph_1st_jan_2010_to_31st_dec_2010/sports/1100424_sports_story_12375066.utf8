	Margao: A late goal by Ndubuisi Opara helped Air India to rally from behind and hold Salgaocar to a 1-1 draw in a 22nd round of the I-League, played at Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, here Friday. Salgaocar, who held territorial advantage in the first half, scored through Ekene Ikenwa. Air India who put up a better performance in the second found the equaliser in the injury through Ndubuisi Opara.         
	Salgaocar who are on 12th position take their tally to 24 points while Air India collected 25 points to remain 10th.         
	The match was devoid of any thrills as both the teams failed to dish out entertaining performance. Salgaocar, who held territorial advantage in the first half, failed to penetrate the rival defence. Beevan DMello played as withdrawn striker failed to give much support to Ikenwa as a result their attack lacked the bit in the absence of Keita.         
	After a brief midfield battle, Salgaocar went ahead in the 29th minute. Francis Fernandes from the right played a square pass to DMello who quickly released a through for Ikenwa who got the better of rival onrushing keeper Arnab Das Sharma and slammed the ball into the empty net with an angular drive.

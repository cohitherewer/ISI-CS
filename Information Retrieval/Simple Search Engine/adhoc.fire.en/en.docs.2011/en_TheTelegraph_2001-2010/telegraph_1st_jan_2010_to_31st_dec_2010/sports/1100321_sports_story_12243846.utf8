  - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Shane Bond on his stint with the police and much more         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Shane Bond        
	Ahmedabad: Shane Bond, the hottest signing of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) this season, spoke to The Telegraph at The Courtyard Marriott on Friday afternoon.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	QYou like making an impact... While you didnt get a wicket on your KKR debut, on Tuesday, you did hit Mahendra Singh Dhoni...         
	A (Laughs) As I told you the other day, I dont like hitting batsmen... Yeah, I did enjoy my first match, but wouldve liked to take a couple of wickets.         
	Was just a day-and-a-half of preparation enough for the match against Chennai Super Kings (CSK)?         
	I took things easy... Id just come off five ODIs (against Australia) in 11 days and Id bowled well in that series, so that helped... Id also played the two T20 Internationals before the ODIs...         
	The Edens capacity has been reduced, but the ground can still take in a massive crowd. What were your thoughts when you stepped on to the turf?         
	At my first warm-up, I thought my legs felt a bit heavy... But I settled down quickly and the momentum of the occasion took over... The noise was a new experience, but I was pretty relaxed... Id made a conscious effort to enjoy myself on my KKR debut.         
	You were much sought after at the auction in January. Did you expect a bidding war between KKR and the Deccan Chargers to break out?         
	The way the auction unfolded was fascinating... It was exciting... Stephen Flemings the Chennai coach, Daniel Vettori plays for Delhi (DareDevils) and Brendon McCullum for KKR... Any of the three franchises would have made me comfortable... As it turned out, Im with KKR... Im very happy being in Shah Rukh Khans team.         
	What did Shah Rukh tell you during your first meeting with him?         
	We spoke briefly (in Calcutta)...         
	Youve quit Test cricket to focus on ODIs and T20. Was it an easy decision?         
	Look, all my injuries happened while playing the four and five-day games... Im approaching 35 and, really, I didnt want to finish my career with another injury... That way, it wasnt a difficult decision... In eight years, because of the fractures and other injuries, I could only play 18 Tests.         
	In the early part of your career, why werent you able to manage your body better?         
	At the development stage, between 17 to 21, I was very lazy... I also didnt get enough overs under my belt when I made my first-class debut... I got into trouble trying to consistently bowl at 150 kmph without the experience of a huge number of overs... Obviously, some deal with bowling quick better, some dont.         
	Just 18 Tests in eight years must be terribly disappointing...         
	It is... But, within me, I know that I trained hard... Worked hard... I didnt try and take short cuts... I did try and get the best out of myself, its just that my body couldnt cope.         
	New Zealands iconic bowler, Sir Richard Hadlee, was more a master of swing than an outright fast bowler. Who inspired you?         
	Not sure why I took to bowling quick... Growing up, though, Id be fast for my age... But when I made my first-class debut (in 1996-97 for Canterbury), I was actually medium-fast, like the rest of the crowd... I took a couple of years off to join the police force, for I didnt believe Id get to play for New Zealand... Its when I returned to first-class cricket, that I found myself bowling quicker than before... I began to enjoy my cricket.         
	What made you become a policeman?         
	At that point, I was looking for security in my life and that job gave me what Id been looking for. The security also brought about a change in attitude.         
	In what way?         
	Because Id begun to enjoy the game, I began to bowl faster and felt fitter, too... My job as a policeman, indeed, did change everything... Had I been injured, without a job to fall back on, then I would have been in trouble... The security of a job made the difference... Id then got engaged (to Tracey), as well, and found my life had the right balance.         
	Did you patrol the streets?         
	Did everything.         
	When did you quit the police force?         
	Around six years ago...         
	What attracted you to the police force?         
	I had two ambitions... Play for New Zealand and be a policeman... Dont know why, but thats how things were. I could do both, so life has been kind.         
	Your role model...         
	Oh, Hadlee.         
	For a while, Wasim Akram and you were competing for the same space. Now, hes the KKR consultant-cum-mentor. What is it like working with him?         
	Look, a lot of the guys Ive played with always said that Akram was the toughest to face... Hes brilliant... Just to hear him talk about fast bowling, about his experiences, is great... Im sure there will be things to learn.         
	You arent very demonstrative. Is it necessary for fast bowlers to actually make an exhibition of their aggression?         
	(Grins) Depends on the individuals... Some may need to say words and be outwardly aggressive... I dont say much... My style isnt to chirp. But, yes, I always like the batsmen to feel that Im coming hard at them...         
	What are the dos and donts for the young fast bowlers?         
	Bowling quick is definitely rewarding, but youve got to train hard... Its an extremely tough job and what works for others may not work for you... Its important, therefore, to know what works for you. Youre free to listen to others, but at the end of the day, youre the one who has to do the training and youre the one who has to deliver... Speed isnt everything, you need accuracy, too.         
	Youve quit Test cricket, but the time that you were available for all forms, what was the bigger challenge  getting wickets or staying fit?         
	Staying fit, definitely. Even when I wasnt bowling particularly well, I had the ability to take wickets... The challenge, clearly, was to stay fit.         
	After joining the rebel ICL, did you, frankly, expect to again play for New Zealand?         
	No... Id thought my career would end with the ICL.         
	Did you miss playing for New Zealand?         
	I did, most definitely... In fact, thats the time I realised what it meant for me to turn out for the Black Caps.         
	T20 has caught on in a big way. Isnt it detrimental to the development of bowlers?         
	I dont think so... Its about how situations are handled... Being hit can affect the confidence of some bowlers, thats when the handling bit comes in... Actually, thinking under pressure may well help in the development of bowlers.         
	How have you been handling pressure?         
	Im driven by my own expectations, not the expectations of others... I wanted to be the worlds No.1 fast bowler and worked towards that goal... I know that if I bowl to my standards, then the results will take care of themselves... Ive never focused too much on people saying I need to do this or need to do that...         
	Usually, whats on your mind when youve marked your run up for the first time?         
	I want to get the first ball out of the way... Want to land it in the right spot. Of course, the skills are involved, but its also a mental thing.         
	You didnt play against India in India. Is that a regret?         
	Its a disappointment, yes... We havent toured that much in recent times and, then, I had injuries... Ive missed the feel of Test cricket in India. It would have been nice to have a crack at the India line-up in Indian conditions.         
	Why is New Zealand never really a force in international cricket?         
	We dont do well enough on the big occasions... We need to change that... Weve got some good players, but they need to be consistent... One of the challenges is to keep them fit.         
	Who do you expect to take your legacy forward?         
	Tim Southee...         
	Is there a batsman you hated bowling to?         
	Quite a few... Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting... Would depend on how they were batting.         
	As a captain, Fleming scored highly. Having played most of your international cricket under him, what do you think set him apart?         
	Fleming always had confidence in me and, because such an iconic figure had so much faith, my own confidence got lifted... I had the license to just go out and do my job... Fleming had the knack of stimulating the team... Had ideas and was great to listen to.         
	Your first impressions of Sourav Ganguly, the KKR captain?         
	He trusted me (on debut)... Kept moving the field around... He came across as a busy captain... Was quite innovative with the field settings against CSK.         
	Cricket apart, what takes up your time?         
	A lot of cricketers are into golf, but Im quite poor at it... Im a baseball fan and follow that sport closely... Basically, Im a family man and love spending time with our three little children (Katie, Hayley and Ryan)...         
	How do you unwind after a tough day?         
	At times, its not a bad idea to have a lemonade with a teammate for company... On other occasions, I could just switch on the TV... Its important to take your mind away from the game.         
	The final one... Youve done coaching courses. At some point, then, could we see you as a full-fledged coach?         
	(Laughs) Yeah, its possible... Right now, where playing for New Zealand is concerned, Im taking it series by series... Id like to finish off still bowling like a quick, not at 130-135 kmph...

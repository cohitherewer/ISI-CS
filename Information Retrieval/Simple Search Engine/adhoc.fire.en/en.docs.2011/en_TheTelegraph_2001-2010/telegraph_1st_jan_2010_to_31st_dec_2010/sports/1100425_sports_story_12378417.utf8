            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Kevin Pietersen en route to his unbeaten 29 as Adam Gilchrist looks on, in Navi Mumbai, on Saturday. (PTI)                       
	Mumbai: Deccan Chargers skipper Adam Gilchrist Saturday conceded that his team had saved the worst for the last after losing the third-place play-off match to the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	It (the teams performance) was pathetic. It was a disappointing way to finish the tournament. We saved our worst for the last, the Australian said after the teams nine-wicket defeat.         
	Gilchrist said there was no specific reason for the teams spineless show. I dont know why. Anybody who knows the game would understand that once you lose the energy and the enthusiasm, it becomes difficult when you need to fight, he said. We just lost steam. We were physically fatigued and were not able to switch on. It was unfortunate. I wouldnt go about beating the players for that.         
	Gilchrist, however, maintained that this season was the sides best campaign in the IPL.         
	We did well to reach the semi-finals but then conked out, he said. Weve let our owners down, out fans down and, above all, ourselves down.         
	Gilchrist, whose three-year contract with the Chargers ends this season, said he would like to continue playing in the IPL. Obviously, the franchise needs to work that out. We also need to find out from IPL about player retention, which I think is the last thing on their mind at the moment, he said. But I am fit, agile and keen (to play).         
	Gilchrist refused to comment on the controversy surrounding the IPL. Until we know what happened, it is difficult to comment. Until we see what comes through in the wash, it would not be appropriate (to comment). But it does not look good at the moment from what is being speculated, he said.         
	Royal Challengers captain Anil Kumble was happy to have salvaged something from the tournament after missing out on the trophy.         
	Its always nice to finish on a happy note and we can have another crack at the Champions League T20, he said.         
	But the skipper admitted that the team had failed in terms of consistency.

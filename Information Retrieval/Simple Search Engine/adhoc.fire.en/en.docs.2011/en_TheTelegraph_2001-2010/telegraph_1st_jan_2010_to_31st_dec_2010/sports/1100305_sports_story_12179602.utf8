The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto dig at Subrata
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barreto dig at Subrata
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto took a dig at Subrata Bhattacharya, the Chirag United coach, who had made some provocative comments about the Mohun Bagan players on the eve of the match.         
	It hurts when a coach (Subrata) says that Mohun Bagan can only win with the help of referees.         
	Thats belittling the quality of the players. Maybe he didnt know that we had good players. We were motivated today to prove a point. Im glad we did, said Barreto, launching a counter attack.         
	Barreto, who scored his second hat-trick of the I-League (the first was against Air-India), feels it was an important victory considering that opponents were from the city.         
	The match was important in every sense of the term. A local opponent, a huge build up to the match, the players had to do well.         
	Look at Chidi. Any other player with his kind of injury would have decided to skip the match, Barreto told reporters.         
	Bagan coach Satyajit Chatterjee said that it was an unbelievable start to the return leg for his team.         
	I am indebted to my boys. This is something amazing. I had never dreamt of such a start to the return leg. Chirag are a good side but our boys played outstanding football, Satyajit said.         
	Meanwhile, the Chirag management has barred their coach Subrata from talking to the media as his comments have been creating controversies.

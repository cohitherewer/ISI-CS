	Mysore: Defending champions Mumbai pulled off a thrilling six-run win over a fighting Karnataka to clinch the coveted Ranji Trophy title for the 39th time here Thursday, dismissing the hosts for 331.         
	Mumbais 39th title looked unlikely when Manish Pandey and Ganesh Sathish were at the crease as Karnataka chased a mammoth 338-run target.         
	The duo, who had come together when Karnataka were in dire straits at 46 for three Wednesday, batted with gusto, assurance and caution to take the fight into the enemy camp, raising 209 runs for the fourth wicket.         
	As long as Pandey, who made a magnificent 144 (18 fours, one six) in trying circumstances, was in the middle, Karnataka were in the reckoning for winning their seventh Ranji title. But once he departed, caught at slip by Mumbai captain Wasim Jaffer off left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla minutes before lunch, Mumbai slowly but assuredly started taking control of the game.         
	While Pandey, who has amassed a whopping 882 runs this season, carted the cherry around the park with impunity, Sathish batted with caution. He laboured hard for 318 minutes, made 75 before being adjudged leg before wicket to Dhawal Kulkarni.         
	Stuart Binny (17), Sunil Joshi (16) and R. Vinay Kumar (15) batted with resolve to take Karnataka closer to the target. But quick strikes by Kulkarni and Ajit Agarkar (5/81) ensured that Mumbai emerged triumphant in the end.         
	This closely contested final would be remembered for the outstanding performances of Vinayak Samant, Avishkar Salvi, Dhawal Kulkarni, Ajit Agarkar, Manish Pandey, Abhimanyu Mithun and R. Vinay Kumar.         
	The wicket was prepared by a tennis court curator of Mysore.           (PTI)

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Pesi Shroff will saddle two of the best youngsters  Xisca and Alice Springs  in the six-horse line-up, and he is expected to call the shots in the Ladies Derby, the 2,400m Poonawalla Stud Calcutta Oaks, Sundays main attraction in the nine-event race card. Alice Springs has already collected three classics, including the Monsoon Derby but the scoresheet of Xisca is still better. The China Visit-Altimara daughter is the winner of the 2000 Guineas, having bagged the Deccan Derby, earlier. It only goes on to suggest that Xisca has crossed swords against a superior opposition, compared to Alice Springs. Therefore, Xisca, ridden by B. Prakash, seems to have a definite edge over Alice Springs.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

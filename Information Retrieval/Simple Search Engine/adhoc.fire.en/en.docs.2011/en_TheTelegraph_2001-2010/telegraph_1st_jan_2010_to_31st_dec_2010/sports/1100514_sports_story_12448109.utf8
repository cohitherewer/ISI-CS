The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lankans fail English test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lankans fail English test

	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Englands unstoppable advance to the final of the World Twenty20 was completed on Thursday with a performance by a team that bears all the hallmarks of a champion side.         
	Just 40 overs now stand between England and their first ever World Cup title after Sri Lanka were swept aside in a semi-final which was so one-sided that at the halfway stage Paul Collingwoods players could already start requesting their favourite rooms at the Barbados Hilton.         
	Kevin Pietersen will no doubt have a penthouse suite booked. He showed no signs of jetlag making an unbeaten 40 that included a six and four combination which took England over the line with 24 balls to spare.         
	They now return to the Kensington Oval, a place that has become a little piece of home over the past three weeks. It was in Barbados where they first started to gather momentum in the Super Eights following a miserable few days of Duckworth-Lewis dodging in Guyana.         
	It now seems almost unbelievable to think that at one stage England were one short sunny spell away from facing possible elimination by Ireland.         
	Now they can dream of a possible final against Australia, which while it may not attract the billion eyeballs of India that the organisers crave, it would at least add an historical tone to the showpiece event of the games newest format.         
	The drum beat never died at the Beausejour Stadiumand while the ground may have been half empty, it witnessed a full on performance by England. First their concoction of slower ball bouncers and spin confounded Sri Lankas dashers. Then Englands batsmen dealt with the threat of Sri Lankas mystery spinners with the skill of ace codebreakers.         
	Twenty20s powerplay overs are the most forensically studied aspect of cricket and England break them down into almost a ball-by-ball gameplan.         
	The stattos will have told Collingwood that Sri Lankas powerplay average in this tournament has been 46, so a total of 38 for three at the end of the sixth over was just the start they wanted.         
	Eighteen of those first 36 balls were dots. Three overs of blanks was a tidy bonus for Swann and Yardy to build on as it meant risk taking was not an option for Sri Lankas strokemakers. What was of more value though were the three wickets, particularly the dismissal of Mahela Jayawardene, the tournaments top performer.         
	Sri Lankas batting has been built around one man and the frailties in form of his colleagues were again exposed by Englands seamers.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya started the tournament batting at eight. He ended it at number two but the elevation has only served to highlight the fact his time in international cricket is up. A tentative prod at a lifter from Sidebottom was edged to second slip and the man who changed the face of one-day batsmanship was gone with a whimper.         
	With Tillekeratne Dilshan pulling a short ball from Bresnan to a diving Luke Wright at deep midwicket, Sri Lanka had to rely on their two best players, Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara to dig them out of trouble.         
	Sangakarra drove his first ball for four but Broads knack of performing in the high profile matches reappeared. A ball outside off stump moved away just enough to take Jayawardenes outside edge and Sri Lanka were 26 for three.         
	There can be no more contrasting couple in cricket than Yardy and Swann.         
	Their bowling mirrors their personalities. Swann is the chirpy tweeter with an online following of thousands, Yardy the county stalwart of few words.         
	Swanns flight and guile was key feature of his four overs that cost only 21 while Yardy is clearly a man who sticks rather than twists  he never once gambled on tossing the ball up and the result was eight overs of spin that cost only 42 runs against some of the worlds best players of slow bowling.         
	As the dots mounted the pressure grew on Sangakkara and he eventually chopped a drive to long on. That left Angelo Mathews and Chamara Kapugedera to reprise their six hitting exploits that eliminated India. They failed.         
	Englands use of the slower ball bouncer frustrated both and even the poor performance of Tim Bresnan, who completely lost his line, was covered up by the efforts of others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant ruled out of opener
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ishant ruled out of opener
  - India must beat New Zealand today to stay second in rankings       OUR BUREAU AGENCIES            Suresh Raina: The man in form                                 
	Calcutta/Dambulla: Missing key players and just done with an exhausting drawn Test series, India swiftly shift to the ODI mode as they take on an equally-depleted New Zealand in the opening match of the tri-series starting here on Tuesday.         
	Also featuring Sri Lanka, the series starts just two days after India drew 1-1 with the hosts in an engrossing Test series. India will be without in-form batting veteran Sachin Tendulkar and spin spearhead Harbhajan Singh, both of whom have been rested, and injured opener Gautam Gambhir.         
	Pace spearhead Zaheer Khan remains sidelined with a shoulder injury, while Ishant Sharma will miss Tuesdays match a miss due to an ankle injury.         
	Ishant is not available for tomorrow (Tuesday)s match because of an ankle problem, India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said at the pre-match press conference.         
	Ashish Nehra will take over the responsibility of leading the attack and on current form, the lanky pacer would be expected to add some zing to the not-so-impressive pace department, which struggled in the Test series. India will have to beat New Zealand Tuesday if they are to keep their second spot in the ICC ODI rankings intact.         
	If India lose, they will be dislodged by the Black Caps from the second spot, but New Zealand will have to beat Sri Lanka in their next match to cling on to the position on the table.         
	India, who have 118 points, can strengthen their second position if they win all their matches which will put them on 125 ratings points.         
	However, Indias failure to win a single ODI in Dambulla will mean that they will drop to sixth position on 111 ratings points.         
	Sri Lanka can also rise to second position but for this to happen, they need to win all their four league matches and hope New Zealand win in either of the two ODIs against India.         
	Among the batsmen, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (807) leads the field but is only two points clear of South Africas AB de Villiers.         
	The series is a chance for Yuvraj Singh  who is placed 16th in the rankings with Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli  to get over the disappointment of the Test series, in which he flopped in the opening match, missed the second due to flu, and was dropped for the third after his replacement Suresh Raina scored a century on debut.         
	Sehwag will once again shoulder the responsibility of providing the sort of cracking starts that India have come to expect of him and Gambhirs absence, Dinesh Karthik will give him company in the opening slot.         
	A rather volatile mix of batsmen occupy the middle-order in Kohli, Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma, who can be destructive while they are on song but their unpredictability can also cost the team dearly.         
	Young and eager to make a mark, the new-look Indian middle-order has often let the team down with extravagant shots in crunch situations.         
	The New Zealanders, on the other hand, are in their familiar dark-horses role, more so in the absence of inspirational skipper Daniel Vettori, who has skipped the series to be with his wife for the birth of his second child.         
	Also missing from the Kiwi line-up is the explosive duo of Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum.         
	While McCullum has been granted some time off with family by New Zealand Cricket, the temperamental Ryder is nursing an elbow injury.         
	Sans the three proven match-winners, the Kiwis will have to come up with a superlative effort to make an impact in the series against the sub-continental giants.         
	Destructive batsman Ross Taylor has been handed the leadership role for the series and it would take a lot for him to inspire an inexperienced squad.         
	He has started well with morale-boosting wins in the couple of practice matches the team played after landing in the island nation.         
	But against the Indians, the Kiwis would be looking forward to experienced all-rounder Jacob Oram, vice-captain Kyle Mills and Scott Styris for inspiration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cup crisis takes another twist
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cup crisis takes another twist
            Richard Bright                      
	The World Cup votes for hire crisis took another twist on Saturday with new allegations emerging against Michel Zen-Ruffinen, the former Fifa general secretary.         
	He was filmed allegedly offering himself as a fixer available for hire for 210,000.         
	With England seemingly leading the way in the race to win the rights to stage the 2018 World Cup finals, Zen-Ruffinen, 51, is alleged to have told undercover reporters what he claims it would take to win the backing of some of the members of the Fifa executive committee who will vote on the issue in Zurich on December 2.         
	Fifa has already agreed to investigate the issue of vote buying after similar allegations last week. These new claims will heap further pressure on Sepp Blatter. In May he will again run for Fifa president, at the age of 74. As it stands, he will run unopposed.         
	This lends a political delicacy to the Fifa ethics committees investigation into alleged corruption by two of its executive committee members, Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, four other officials and, in a parallel investigation, alleged collusion between bidding nations on vote-swapping for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.         
	Blatter cannot afford to go soft on corruption for fear that another candidate might use it as a platform to run against him in May. Yet neither can he take the risk of being too severe on those who have been inside the Fifa oligarchy.         
	Aside from investigating Adamu and Temarii for allegedly offering to take money in exchange for their vote  the classic corruption paradigm  Fifa is also looking into what it is ludicrously calling rumours (you dont investigate a rumour) of collusion between bids on voting.         
	It is forbidden for bids to co-operate with each other and horse-trade votes (i.e. if you vote for us for 2018, well vote for you for 2022) just as it is forbidden for one bid to criticise another. Yeah, and Blatter is a tall, handsome man. The procedure itself is manifestly open to abuse, exacerbated once it became clear that a deal had been cut to ensure one of the European bids was going to get 2018.         
	At that point, the bidders hived off into two groups. In these circumstances could a bid afford not to gain an ally in the other camp? Fifa is looking at Spain and Portugals relationship with Qatar but it would be naive to assume it stops there.         
	Asian Football Confederation president and Fifa executive committee member Mohammed bin Hammam has even publicly said that it is not surprising that this sort of thing is taking place.         
	Why did Fifa put itself in such a vulnerable position? Simply greed. The decision to award two World Cups at the same time was because it would enable Fifa to cut more lucrative television and marketing deals. And of course, being wooed by twice as many suitors doubtless has its advantages.         
	The voting itself takes place behind closed doors in Zurich and is anonymous. Until there is transparency, Fifas ethics committee (who said oxymoron?) will be kept busy.         
	A US study estimated the World Cup to be worth $5billion to a host nation. Five billion dollars; 24 votes. Exactly.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

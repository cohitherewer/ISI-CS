The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettel takes pole
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettel takes pole
                      
	Silverstone: Germanys Sebastian Vettel roared to pole position ahead of team-mate Mark Webber on an all-Red Bull front row at the British Grand Prix on Saturday. Vettel, who won from the top slot at Silverstone last year, has now taken five poles from the 10 Grands Prix so far this season.         
	I hope we can repeat last years story, said the 23-year-old German after his second pole in a row.         
	Ferraris Fernando Alonso qualified third for Sundays race with McLarens championship leader Lewis Hamilton fourth in his home race at a classic circuit that has been lengthened and reconfigured since last year.         
	World champion Jenson Button, second overall and six points behind teammate Hamilton, saw his Silverstone jinx continue with 14th place on the grid.         
	Adrian Sutil will start 11th on the grid, four places ahead of teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi as none of the Force India drivers could make it to the third qualifying session (Q3) here Saturday.         
	Things looked quite promising for Sutil who qualified fourth for the second qualifying session (Q2), while Liuzzi too crawled into the second segment. (agencies)

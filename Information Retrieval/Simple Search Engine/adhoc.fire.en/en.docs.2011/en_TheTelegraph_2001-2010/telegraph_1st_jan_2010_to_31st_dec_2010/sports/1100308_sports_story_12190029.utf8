The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India bow out
                                                                                                                       7                                        India bow out
                  Rohan Bopanna in Moscow during the Davis Cup tie against Russia                     
	Moscow: India were Sunday ousted from the elite World Group of the Davis Cup following Somdev Dev Varmans crushing defeat to Mikhail Youzhny as the visitors lost the first round tie 2-3 to Russia here.         
	Russia progressed to the quarter finals while India would yet again strive in the play-offs to re-enter the 16-team World Group. India were playing in the World Group for the first time since 1998.         
	For India, everything depended on Somdevs first reverse singles but the gritty Indian was no match to the sheer class of world No. 13 Youzhny.         
	In a must win situation, Somdev was outclassed 2-6, 1-6, 3-6, which ended Indias hopes. Rohan Bopanna, however, recorded a consolation 7-6(5), 6-4 win over Teimuraz Gabashvili in the dead rubber.         
	In complete contrast to Indias play-off tie against South Africa where they had won all their singles matches, India lost three here.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi saved India a whitewash by winning the doubles rubber against Igor Kunitsyn and Gabashvili on Saturday.         
	Russia have levelled the head-to-head scores 2-2 between the two nations. It was first meeting between Somdev and Youzhny and the class difference between the two players was glaring. The Russian conceded just six games in the lop-sided match that lasted one hour and 55 minutes.         
	Youzhny showed why he is top-15 player as he never let Somdev play his style of game from the baseline. Somdev had no answer to Youzhnys solid groundstrokes and smart drop volleys.         
	The Russian attacked Somdevs weak second serve and set up and took points at will, executing a perfect gameplan.         
	In no time Somdev was down by two breaks  third and fifth games  and the Russian comfortably placed with a 5-2 lead. Youzhny served out the first set with a drop volley in just 31 minutes. Somdevs misery grew all the more in second set as he could not get on the board till the fifth game.         
	It did look like a contest in the third set and the fourth game saw the most fierce fight for points. Bopanna, who has earned the nickname Bofors for his booming serve, played well in the second reverse singles against a player who is ranked as high as 106.         
	Bopanna served well, volleyed brilliantly and was good at the net in the one hour 20 minutes contest.         
	He squandered a set point in the opening set before sealing it in the tie-breaker, where he was trailing 0-3 at one stage.         
	He put up a much better show in the second set and broke Gabashvili in the fifth game to take decisive lead.         
	Davis Cup captain SP Misra advised Somdev to add some more weapons to his game, saying that mere a baseline approach would not win him matches against top players.         
	Playing just from the baseline may not help at this level. Somdev has to come to net more often and volley more, Misra said. (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Sallys joy changes to tears
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Australian sprinter Sally Pearsons historic triumph in the womens 100 metres race ended in tears as she was disqualified by the jury for a false start.         
	Australia appealed against the decision but it was rejected by the jury, late in the night.         
	Sally became the first Australian to win the womens 100m gold in Commonwealth Games with a seasons best time of 11.28 seconds in a race which saw Laura Turner of England getting a red card for a false start. The English girl, who then ran under protest, finished last.         
	However, Sallys joy was short lived as England lodged a protest alleging it was the Aussie girl who prompted the false start. From the replays, it appeared that it was Sally who headed out for the final run after a false start.         
	Englands protest was upheld and the referee disqualified Sally and re-issued results in which the gold medal went to Nigerias Osayemi Oludamola with a timing of 11.32 seconds. St Vincent and Grenadines Natasha Mayers got the silver with a timing of 11.37s. The bronze went to Englands Katherine Endacott (11.44s).         
	Its a disaster for me, said a tearful Sally after learning the decision of the jury. I still say that I did nothing wrong. I was the legitimate winner of the race.         
	In other events, Jamaican Leron Clarke became the fastest man of the Games, clocking the second quickest time of 10.12s on Indian soil. This was the third slowest time in Games history after 10.38s and 10.2s, both by Don Qurrie of Jamaica.         
	Englishman Mark Lewis Francis was second with a timing of 10.2s while Trinidad and Tobagos Aaron Armstrong was third with 10.24s.         
	On Thursday, police banned the recall gun and technical officials threatened to go on strike. For the second day running, the security cordon stopped officials passing through with the recall gun used to inform athletes of a false start. It was again replaced by a dated version that does not fire blanks.         
	In shot put, Canadian Dylan Armstrong won easily with a throw of 21.02m.         
	In womens hammer throw finals, Canadian Sultana Friziel won the gold with a Games record effort of 68.57m.         
	In swimming, Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington recovered from her stomach upset to win the 800-metre freestyle gold medal Alicia Coutts of Australia won her third individual gold of the Games, adding the 100 butterfly title to her kitty.

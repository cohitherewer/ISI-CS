	Durban: After entering the Champions League Twenty20 final, Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Saturday praised Suresh Raina for his breezy, unbeaten 48-ball 94 against Royal Challengers Bangalore in the semi-final.         
	Rainas batting made it look so easy. Bangalore got a blow when they lost (Dale) Steyn. Raw pace would have made a difference  Raina cashed in and got good support from (Murali) Vijay and (Michael) Hussey, Dhoni said .         
	Meanwhile, his RCB counterpart Anil Kumble was quite disappointed. Too many runs on the board, then Steyn got injured, and then Virat (Kohli) also got injured. Things did not go our way, he said.           (PTI)

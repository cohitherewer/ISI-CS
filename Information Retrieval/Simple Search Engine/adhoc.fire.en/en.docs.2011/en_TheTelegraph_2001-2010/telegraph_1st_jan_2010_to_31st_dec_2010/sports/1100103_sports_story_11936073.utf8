The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shivika included
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shivika included
                      
	New Delhi: Calcutta girl Shivika Burman has made it to the squad, led by Sania Mirza, that will take part in the Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Zone group II competition in Kuala Lumpur.         
	The All India Tennis Association selection committee, led by Anil Dhupar, met here Saturday and dropped Ankita Bhambri while keeping veteran Rushmi Chakravarthy and Sanna Bhambri.         
	Shivika, who recently won the national grasscourt doubles title with Treta Bhattacharyya in Calcutta, has been rewarded for her good show. However it seems unlikely that she will get a game in the tournament.         
	Recent national grasscourt champion, 16-year-old Ankita Raina, is also a new inclusion. Rohit Rajpal was appointed as nonplaying captain while Enrico Piperno will be the coach.         
	India Squad         
	Sania Mirza, Poojashree Venkatesh, Sanaa Bhambri, Rushmi Chakravarthy, Ankita Raina and Shivika Burman.

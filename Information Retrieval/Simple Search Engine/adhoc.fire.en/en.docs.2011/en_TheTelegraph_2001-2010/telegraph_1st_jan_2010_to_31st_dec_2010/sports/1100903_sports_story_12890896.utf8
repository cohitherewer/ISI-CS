The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi will be under pressure: Akram
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi will be under pressure: Akram
                      
	Shahid Afridi will be under tremendous pressure as it is a difficult time for him to take charge of the one-day and T20 sides in the wake of the spot-fixing scandal, feels former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram.         
	Other former Pakistan captains backed the decision of the tainted trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer to pull themselves out of the rest of the England tour .               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically):         
	Zaheer Abbas: It was the appropriate thing to do because only time will prove if they are guilty or innocent and until this is clear you cant have players under a fixing cloud playing for the country. The board can say look we took the right decision and we played our role in having a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption in cricket. The boards credibility will be enhanced.         
	Akram: Afridi will be under massive pressure to ensure the team plays good cricket. The situation is not ideal for him to take over as ODI skipper. But more than anything, Afridi will first have to ensure that he commands the respect of his teammates. It is imperative that a leader shows character and spreads goodwill. Having left the team in the lurch at critical times, Afridi has to win the trust of his mates first. Only then performance will follow A losing team needs a motivator. After the horrible Test defeat against England, I cant find the person who will lift the morale of the current Pakistani team.         
	Sourav Ganguly: The guilty should be heavily punished. These are all allegations, there is no proof yet. We should not make any comments.ICC is not a police station, it has some set of laws. If at all they are violated, they will take action. Nothing is foolproof. It boils down to the players, it is their as well as the captains responsibility. They are playing as individuals, they should take responsibility. In my stint as the India captain, I had never been approached by any bookie. Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble too were never approached and such a situation was beyond their imagination.         
	Aamer Sohail: The trio should have pulled themselves out earlier because the PCBs credibility is at stake as well. Having these three in the team at the moment would also have disturbed the morale of the rest of the team there is a big question mark over them. Pakistan cricket is presently facing a big challenge. This is a really serious matter. The first thing to do was to sideline these players. Now at least this would allow the rest of the team to concentrate on the coming series.

	Kuala Lumpur: A jet-lagged Arjun Atwal scrambled to a three-under 68 for a share of the 16th spot after the opening round of the inaugural Asian and PGA Tour co-sanctioned CIMB Asia Pacific Classic golf tournament here today.         
	The Orlando-based golfer, who is the lone Indian in fray here, shot five birdies against two bogeys  both in the back nine  in the first ever co-sanctioned tournament by the Asian Tour and PGA Tour which has a purse of $6 million.         
	Ive played well here before, said Atwal. I always enjoy it in Malaysia. Today (Thursday) I didnt enjoy as much. But its just the first round. My body is not reacting as it normally does because of the jet lag but I should be okay tomorrow (Friday).         
	The 37-year-old Atwal said the Wyndham triumph has given him the comfort to pick the tournaments he wants to compete in.         
	The scheduling has become easier. I dont have to think about which places Im going to play. My life is still the same. I can plan to play in tournaments that I like. I like to support India definitely. And also the Asian Tour as this was where I learned to play and make the cuts and stuff like that, he said. Atwal believes he can produce multiple victories on the PGA Tour and even win a Major.         
	American Ricky Barnes grabbed the lead with a blemishfree eight-under 63. (PTI)

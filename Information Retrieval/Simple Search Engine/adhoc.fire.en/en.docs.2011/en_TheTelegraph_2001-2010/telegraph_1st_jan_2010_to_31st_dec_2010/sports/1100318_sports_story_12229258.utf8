            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Caravaggio, the 14-10 favourite from trainer Bharath Singhs stable, scored an easy victory in the 1,600m Moon Fairy Cup, on Wednesday. Jockey C. Alford rode a well-judged waiting race on the four-year-old horse after Burst Of Speed tried to pull off another win from the start.          
	The afternoon was otherwise ruled by less fancied winners with trainer H.S. Bath scoring a priced double through Moment Of Love and Raging Bull.

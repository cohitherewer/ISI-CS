The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IOA refuses to provide official kits
                                                                                                                       7                                      IOA refuses to provide official kits
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian Olympic Association (IOA)s refusal to provide the official team kits for the Asian Games has left the Indian football team stranded in China.         
	According to sources, the IOA, at the last moment, has decided not to give the kits to sportspersons and officials going to the Asian Games in Guangzhao.         
	The IOA has even asked the respective sports federations to get it done on their own.         
	All federations have been promised a budget of Rs.3,500 for each sportsperson and official to make the playing kits.         
	The IOA move has landed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in deep trouble, as it has already sent their team to Guangzhou to play the qualifying matches. The team and officials have been left in the lurch.         
	The IOAs decision was conveyed to the AIFF well after the team left for China last week, sources said.         
	Since the IOA had earlier asked for the measurements of all the players, the AIFF thought the kits will be delivered in China, the sources added.         
	Team officials in Guangzhou said the team are in no position to play the first match against Kuwait on November 7 unless the kits arrive on time.         
	We do not even have the jerseys required for Asian Games matches. The normal AIFF jerseys bear the logo of the sponsors, which is not allowed in Asian Games and Olympics, said a team official.         
	The IOA decision, which some suspect could be a ploy to help some sportswear companies, is also going to cost the AIFF a lot.         
	Now that we have to get the kits done in China, we have to pay for it in foreign exchange, said an AIFF official.         
	The cost will be much more than what the IOA will reimburse, he added.

	Jeju Island (Korea): Gaganjeet Bhullar could not even start his second round, while Jyoti Randhawa and C. Muniyappa are set to make an early exit from the weather-hit Ballantines Championship golf tournament after returning identical two-over 74 Friday.         
	Bhullar, who had opened his account with a strong four-under 68, remained indoor as inclement weather hit the $2.9 million showpiece event, sanctioned by the Asian Tour, European Tour and the Korea PGA.         
	In fact, the opening round fog disruption, where almost six hours of play was lost, left officials with no choice but to reduce the tournament to three rounds so as to ensure a Sunday finish.         
	Among other Indians in fray, Delhi golfer Shiv Kapur (143) followed his opening round 70 with a one-over 73 to lie provisional 44th. It is, however, going to be end of all roads for the Indian quartet of Randhawa (146), C Muniyappa (147), Himmat Rai (158) and Anirban Lahiri (162) who are set to fall outside the cut-line which would be set at 144.         
	Thailands Thongchai Jaidee kept up his title defence by carding five-under 67 to take a share of the clubhouse lead.(PTI)

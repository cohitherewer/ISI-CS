                                                                                                                       7                                      Murali Vijay   gets a reprimand
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: India opener Murali Vijay has received an official reprimand for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct and regulations governing clothing and equipment during the second Test, against Australia, in Bangalore, on Sunday.         
	Match Referee Chris Broad issued the reprimand after Vijay was found to be displaying too many advertising logos on his batting pads. Section G (i) of the ICC Clothing and Equipment Rules and Regulations states clearly how many and what size manufacturers logos players can display on their batting pads. A contravention of these regulations constitutes a breach of Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct.         
	Vijay pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction of an official reprimand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arijit inclusion raises eyebrows
                                                                                                                       7                                        Arijit inclusion raises eyebrows
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: In a weird move the junior selection committee of the East Zone, which met in Guwahati on Monday to select U-19 and U-16 players for Zonal Cricket Academy (ZCA) camp conducted by the National Cricket Academy (NCA), have inducted Bengal colts pacer Arijit Banerjee.         
	Interestingly, Arijits name figures prominently in the list of bowlers with suspect action and he was called for chucking during Bengals Cooch Behar Trophy group league match against Haryana at Deshbandhu Park last December.         
	He was called after bowling 12.3 overs in the Haryana first innings and was not allowed to bowl any further in the match. It was learnt that Arijit hasnt taken any corrective measures in these one and half months, and has yet been made a part of the ZCA camp for the next season.         
	Chairman of junior Bengal selection committee Barun Burmans logic about Arijits inclusion didnt have much merit although he admitted that Arijit was a chucker. Yes, there is a problem with his action and that was discussed with chairman of the East Zone selection committee (Rajesh Bora of Assam). However since, the BCCI hasnt provided any directive about not including bowlers with suspect action, we decided to include him, Burman said from Guwahati.         
	Even former Bengal captain and U-19 coach Gopal Bose termed the selection as pretty unusual. I am not sure what are the parameters for selection but it is unusual. But we may try and look at it in a different perspective. May be the ZCA coaches will then track his action and send him to NCA for corrective measures, Bose said.         
	Apart from Arijit, the others from Bengal in the U-19 camp are Abhishek Das, Sudip Chatterjee, Tuhin Banerjee, Harish Pandey and Soumik Roy. The ones included in the U-16 camp are Abhishek Raman, Himadri Chakraborty, Vivek Singh, Mithilesh Das, Ravi Kant Singh and Abhimanyu Easwaran.

	Chandigarh: Australias T20 specialist David Hussey joined the Kolkata Knight Riders squad, on Thursday morning, and is set to take the field against the Kings XI Punjab, on Saturday.         
	Indications are that in the overseas players category, only Chris Gayle is assured of a place in the XI. For Hussey to play, one from among Shane Bond, Angelo Mathews and Owais Shah will have to sit out.         
	According to the IPL rules, no more than four overseas players can be fielded in the XI.         
	The Knights began IPL III with two wins on the trot but have since lost three in a row. Coach Dav Whatmore, though, insisted that the morale hadnt taken a beating.         
	Look, the morale isnt down... Its my job to ensure that doesnt happen... Ive been doing what I need to, Whatmore told The Telegraph.                     
	Incidentally, principal owner Shah Rukh Khans best buddy, New Delhi-based Vivek Khushalani, was present at a team meeting on Thursday afternoon.         
	I wasnt asked to convey any message (by Shah Rukh)... From my side, however, I did tell those present that all hasnt been lost and that there was no need for anybodys shoulders to droop, Khushalani said, on being contacted at the Mount View Hotel.         
	With just one win, the Kings XI are actually worse off.         
	The Knights consultant-mentor Wasim Akram, meanwhile, is expected to rejoin the squad before the match gets under way. Akram went home, to be with his sons, on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unadkat owes it to Akram
                                                                                                                       7                                      Unadkat owes it to Akram
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Wasim Akram recently said that Jaydev Unadkat, the Kolkata Knight Riders left-arm seamer, is a bowler one should watch out for in near future. The 18-year-old from Porbandar, who was the Man of the Match for his three for 26 against the Rajasthan Royals on Saturday, feels that its the legendary pacer whose advice has turned him into an improved bowler in a month.         
	I am a totally different bowler now than what I was prior to the start of the Indian Premier League (IPL). All credit to Wasimbhai. If I know how to control my swing, its because of him. When he first saw me, he told me that I had good height and good action. I need to check my wrist position and make some minor adjustments in my run-up, Jaydev told The Telegraph at the team hotel on Sunday.         
	I have a natural out-swinger but earlier, whenever I tried to bowl the incoming deliveries, I would lose control and spray it all over the place. I learnt to control my swing following Wasimbhais tips. Another person who helped me was Saurashtra coach Debu Mitra, who gave me advice about varying the pace on placid wickets when I was struggling after the twin tour of South Africa and New Zealand (for the India under-19 team), Unadkat said.         
	He is also indebted to skipper Sourav Ganguly, who showed faith in him after he was hit for 32 runs in 2.2 overs against the Kings XI Punjab. He has been of great support when I was under pressure. He gave me a lot of confidence, said the 18-year-old who topped his school in 12th standard exams (commerce) with 86 per cent marks.         
	My father being a lecturer (civil engineering), he has always stressed about doing well in academics. I got 91 per cent in my 10th standard state board exams and topped in the Porbandar district. However, studies have taken a backseat now. But my parents arent complaining, the youngster signed off with a smile.

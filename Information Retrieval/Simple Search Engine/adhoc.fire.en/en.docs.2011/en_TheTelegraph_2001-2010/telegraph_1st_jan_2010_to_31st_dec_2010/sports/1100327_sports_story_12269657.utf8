    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Leggie shares his thoughts on Team India recall             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Piyush Chawla      
	Chandigarh: Leggie Piyush Chawla, back in Team India after 20 months, spoke to The Telegraph at the Mount View Hotel, on Friday afternoon, half-an-hour after getting the good news.         
	Chawla, who is just 21, has the potential to serve the country for long.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether hed been hopeful of getting picked         
	(Laughs) To be honest, Id given myself a 50-50 chance...         
	On who gave him the news         
	Actually, Id been talking to my mother (Poonam, in Moradabad) on one cell, while the other kept ringing... After a couple of missed calls, I told her Id phone her back as there could be some good news... I answered the next call on the other cell and, from someone in New Delhi, learnt that Id been recalled... Bahut khushi huyi.         
	The first call made by him         
	To my mother... I wanted to talk to my father (Pramod) as well, but he was in office... Ill speak to him after this interview.         
	Thoughts...         
	Feel very happy... Id been working hard and its nice to be rewarded... I think Ive improved as a bowler and, hopefully, can make a difference whenever I get the opportunities.         
	Having last played for India in the June-July 2008 Asia Cup, in Pakistan         
	Its tough when one gets dropped... However, I decided to work harder and was determined to make a comeback... Ab mushkil samay nikal gaya hai.         
	Top lesson learnt in the past 20 months         
	That nothing comes easy and, to get anywhere in life, one needs to work very hard... Maine mehnat kari...         
	Whether his Test debut, against England in March 2006 (in neighbouring Mohali) came too early         
	I was only 17 then... No, I wouldnt say it happened early... Its just that woh time theek nahin tha... Thats it.         
	More pressure now...         
	(Grins) Pressure is always there... But, then, Im not only a better bowler now, but Im mentally stronger... Should hold me in good stead.         
	The googly being his No.1 weapon         
	It has been my strength, yes, but Ive also worked on the leg-breaks... I guess Im a more complete bowler today.         
	Idol         
	Anilbhai (Anil Kumble).         
	Exposure with Sussex last year         
	It was great, bowling in such different conditions... I played some four-day games and a couple of T20 matches... I was happy with the way I bowled.         
	On getting the short-term contract         
	I was approached by an agent during IPL II in South Africa... The County then spoke to (Kings XI Punjab coach) Tom Moody. Things were then taken forward.         
	The attention hes giving to his batting         
	Of course, Im not neglecting it... Im aware that even specialist bowlers need to bat.         
	Celebrations on being recalled         
	Most of my teammates came to my room after the practice session... Everyone is happy for me.         
	Having been a member of the inaugural World T20-winning squad         
	Beating Pakistan in the final was a great moment... For me, the team... For the entire country.         
	Finally, thankful to...         
	(Emotionally) Everybody who kept supporting me over the past 20 months, when I wasnt with Team India... Im also thankful to the selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co.) and the captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni)... I need to repay the faith theyve shown in me...

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Priced tickets likely for Test vs Proteas
                                                                                                                       7                                      Priced tickets likely for Test vs Proteas
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is mulling releasing a limited number of daily tickets for public during the second Test match between India and South Africa at the Eden from February 14-18.         
	In all likelihood, a decision will be taken at the emergent working committee meeting on Saturday.         
	During the recent one-day international between India and Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens last month, the CAB didnt keep any priced tickets as number of seats were curtailed due to the ongoing renovation work for the 2011 World Cup.         
	Apart from handing over the allotted complimentary tickets to its life, annual, associate and honorary members, the CAB kept a quota of 60 and 40 complimentary tickets for the first and second division clubs. The districts and universities were given 25 complimentary tickets while Office Sports Federation got 90.         
	However, this time, members feel that CABs affiliated units will have to procure priced tickets which has been the norm during Test matches.         
	We will be fulfilling our commitment we have towards our life, annual, associate and honorary members. We have taken a decision that apart from the compulsory complimentary season ticket for CAB members, the affiliated units will have to procure priced tickets, a very senior official informed on Wednesday.         
	Obviously the quota allotted for the units will be much lesser than what we have when the stadium is of full capacity.         
	There is a proposal that the number of tickets that was complimentary for the units during the last ODI may be converted into the priced tickets. Therefore first division clubs will be entitled 60 priced season tickets, second division 40 and so on, he added.         
	During earlier Test matches, the first and second division clubs were entitled for 300 and 200 priced tickets respectively.         
	The CAB thinks since the clubs may not be able to buy their full quota of season tickets, the remaining (very limited number) will be for the public.

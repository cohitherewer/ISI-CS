The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bulpins boys ready for big stage 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bulpins boys ready for big stage 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Desmond Bulpins approach to I-League, in his assignment as coach of the AIFF XI team, contains marked pragmatism. The Englishman, who has been roped in on national coach Bob Houghtons suggestion, sees AIFF XIs graduation into league football as a baby step into the professional set-up.         
	The AIFF XI, formed this year, will be the youngest club to play in the countrys most elite football tournament, and according to Bulpin, it is more of an endeavour to gain experience than immediately weighing the win-loss ratio of a team grooming players for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.         
	We have a holistic approach to make them (the team members) better people, better players so that, hopefully, they play for India and they become good professional footballers and models to other young players, Bulpin said on the eve of their first I-League match against city club Chirag United on Friday.         
	A SWOT analysis between the two sides will leave AIFF XI behind, but the unknown factor will be an advantage for Bulpins boys. With an average age of 19 in their ranks, the players are agile and can match Chirags speed, something that has been worrying Subrata Bhattacharya. The AIFF XI players will run a lot and I have told my boys that they have to match them, Bhattacharya warned his team.         
	Chirag United, who are Durand Cup winners this year, have performed brilliantly against the big teams in the Calcutta Football League (CFL) this season, but their game has surprisingly dropped against the weaker sides.         
	Players like Abhijit Mondal, Chika Wali and Elijah Junior are returning from injury lay-offs and it will be important for the city outfit to garner maximum points before others gain full strength with the national players joining back in the second half of the I-League.         
	Denson Devadas and K Asif will form the Chirag powerhouse in the mid-field and the combination of Subhash Chakraborty and Jerry Zirsanga on the flanks can create trouble for any side on their day.         
	But Bulpin, for whom the I-league would be his second major tryst with professional football in India (first was Federation Cup), seemed to have done his homework properly. I know theyve got good players in the mid-field. But I think were prepared for the game, he said.         
	Joshimar and Mohammad Rafique gave Bulpin a pause for thought. Ive heard theyre good. But all were concerned about now is our boys development. I want the boys to play fairly, to play properly and, hopefully, we win the games.         
	From AIFF XI, Jeje Lalpekhlua will be one to watch out for. The Manipuri striker was the architect of the 2009 SAFF Cup victory and also scored a hat-trick against Pakistan while leading the under-19 team in the South Asian Games.         
	Winger Jibon Singh is another youngster known for his never-say-die attitude. His speed on the left flank and pinpoint crosses can put any team under trouble. Tata Football Academy-product Jagroop Singh will be the man under the bar in Gurpreet Singh Sandhus absence.         
	AIFF XI will miss Jewel Raja and Subodh Kumar, Manandeep Singh and Vimal Kumar through injuries.         
	On paper, Chirag will begin favourites with experience and foreigners in their ranks. But dont be surprised if Bulpins boys pull off an upset on I-League debut.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We should have played Buchi Babu, says Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      We should have played Buchi Babu, says Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly took a dig at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Tuesday and said that Bengal should have played the Buchi Babu tournament.         
	Buchi Babu being a three-day format meet would have helped Bengal to prepare well for the Ranji Trophy. However, we should now play in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Trophy and the JP Atray meet, Sourav said on the sidelines of a promotional, in Behala.         
	The Buchi Babu organisers did not send an invitation this time to the CAB since they were not sending any team for the last three years. Despite not being invited, the CAB still could have sent the side, but the association brass decided not to as they felt the team was not ready enough.         
	Sourav also said that he would prepare for the 2011 Indian Premier League (IPL) once he returns from the Champions League T20 meet, to be held in South Africa, where he will be donning the role of a commentator. I will be part of the commentary team for seven days. I am looking forward to it.         
	For those interested in facts, Souravs first brush with the microphone came during an ODI against Australia in Kochi in 1998.         
	Now, a free cricketer in the IPL after his three-year contract with the Kolkata Knight Riders ended with the 2010 season, Ganguly said he was unsure about which team he would turn out for in IPL IV. I am not sure I dont exactly know the rules.         
	On the recent Commonwealth Games controversy, Sourav said that everything would be okay once the event starts on October 3.         
	I am too far away from the real scene and I dont exactly know what is going around. I just read it in the newspapers.

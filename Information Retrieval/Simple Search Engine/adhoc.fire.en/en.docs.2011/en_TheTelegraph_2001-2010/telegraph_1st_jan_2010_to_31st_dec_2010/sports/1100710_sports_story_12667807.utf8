The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Klose call for Germans
                                                                                                                       7                                        Klose call for Germans
  - Veteran striker is a doubtful starter vs Uruguay for 3rd place playoff       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Diego Forlan during practice on Friday                                 
	Germany striker Miroslav Klose may have to settle for second place in the World Cup all-time top scorers list with a back injury threatening to rule him out of the third place play-off match against Uruguay. Klose trails current leader Ronaldo by a single goal and at the age of 32, Saturdays consolation match against Uruguay is likely to be his final opportunity to rewrite the record books having already scored four in South Africa.         
	He was hurt in an aerial duel, and we are hoping that he will be OK, stated Germany assistant coach Hansi Flick.         
	The Polish born striker has 14 goals from three World Cup finals putting him level with Germany legend Gerd Muller and ahead of a host of players widely considered to be among the games greatest including Just Fontaine (13), Pele (12) and Eusebio (9).         
	The prospect of Klose surpassing Ronaldos record has drawn gasps from football romantics who consider the Bayern Munich players prolific goal poaching to be inferior to the more swashbuckling travails of his illustrious rivals.         
	But, as the only player to score five goals in successive tournaments and the 2006 Golden Boot winner, Klose has an admirer in national team coach Joachim Loew. Hes truly impressive. Hes such a wonderful and successful player. He is absolutely outstanding. Ive never had any doubts  in 2002, 2006 and 2010  that he would perform, he said.         
	Hes very self-critical, but his performances are at the top level. Hes got 14 World Cup goals. There are very few who could hold a candle to him. Thats down there in the history books. Hes a player with enormous quality and we cant praise him enough. Hes also scored one every two games. Thats truly impressive at this high level. Klose has recovered very well, even after bad patches. He doesnt get too down.         
	You might think hes dithering or self-critical but he knows himself very well as a player and where he stands. He can handle things in a modest way and hes still incredibly hungry.         
	Loew was forced to skip training and stay in bed on Friday, a day before his teams third place playoff against Uruguay, after coming down with a flu virus.         
	There are also injury concerns ahead of the game against Uruguay for midfielder Sami Khedira and captain Philipp Lahm who has shrugged off doubts about his availability, saying: It would astonish me if I wasnt ready.         
	I have time to rest and the body can absorb the pain during a day off. Four years ago, we thought it was fantastic to play for third place, he added. Before, like a lot of people, I didnt even want to watch this match on television. But now I believe that winning this match is important.         
	History will not favour their opponents Uruguay in this match after twice finishing on the losing side  beaten by Austria in 1954 third place play-off match and against West Germany in 1970. Germany have finished third on three occasions and lost the playoff only once in 1958, to France.         
	Meanwhile, Uruguay striker Diego Forlan is hoping a right thigh injury will not stop him from playing in the place playoff match. Forlan, who has four goals in the tournament, one fewer than leading scorers Netherlands playmaker Wesley Sneijder and Spain striker David Villa. Forlan was replaced in the 84th minute of their 2-3 semifinal loss against the Netherlands on Tuesday due to the injury.         
	Im hoping to be there on Saturday, said Forlan, who said he was hurt in the first few minutes of the semi-final match. Forlan has a total of five goals across two World Cups. He also scored at the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan when Uruguay failed to reach the second round.         
	The Atletico Madrid striker has scored 28 times for his country, three fewer than Hector Scarones all-time Uruguay record. At club level, the 31-year-old Forlan has also twice won Europes Golden Boot award as the continents top scorer. Luis Suarez will return from suspension for Uruguay on Saturday. The striker missed the Dutch match after receiving a red card for a handball that stopped Ghana scoring a last-minute winner in the quarterfinals.         
	Now whats left is to play to the death for third place, Suarez said. Because we know weve had a great World Cup, we dont want to just make do with being among the top four. For this squad, the World Cup is not over yet. The World Cup goes on and, just as we wanted to go as far as possible before, now we want to make sure we are among the top three.         
	Likely Teams         
	Germany (4-5-1): 1-Manuel Neuer, 3-Arne Friedrich, 17-Per Mertesacker, 20-Jerome Boateng, 16-Philipp Lahm, 6-Sami Khedira, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 8-Mesut Ozil, 13-Thomas Mueller, 10-Lukas Podolski, 11-Miroslav Klose         
	Uruguay (4-3-3): 1-Fernando Muslera, 22-Martin Caceres, 6-Mauricio Victorino, 3-Diego Godin, 16-Maximiliano Pereira, 15-Diego Perez, 17-Egidio Arevalo, 7-Edinson Cavani, 20-Alvaro Fernandez, 9-Luis Suarez, 10-Diego Forlan,         
	Referee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)  
	After 28 days...  
	 Dutchman lets fly  No one thought Giovanni van Bronckhorst had it in him to pull the trigger. The Uruguayan defence would have needed something like the Star Wars programme to deal with that rocket from 35-40 yards out. Although Forlan replied by firing off a missile of his own, it was going to be the Netherlands all the way in the first semi-final.  
	Octopussy  The question on Facebook was could Paul be the next Nostradamus? Signs are he might well be. The creature has had an awe-inspiring success rate with German results and predicted a Spanish victory in the semi-final. Although the Argentines have threatened to eat it in an act of revenge, his keepers say Paul knows best.  
	Second hand of God   If the Hand of God can rise to punish it can also sweep to save. The latter fact demonstrated by Luis Suarez, whose heroic stand on Ghanaian Adiyiah rsquo;s shot has been hailed by Ajax teammate and finalist Maarten Stekelenburg as the best save of the World Cup. If there rsquo;s sky blue in your shirt, you will give an arm and a leg when the World Cup is at stake seems to be the message.

	Melbourne: Retired from Test cricket but desperate to save his ODI and Twenty20 career, injury-plagued Australian speedster Brett Lee says he plans to test his fitness and pace in the upcoming Indian Premier League.         
	There are many things I want to achieve in the shorter form of the game. One, the Twenty20 World Cup for Australia; and two, the 50-over World Cup in India. I want to be a part of that, Lee, who recently retired from Tests, said.

	Hyderabad: Indonesias Dionysius Hayom Rumbaka downed Suppanyu Avihingsanon of Thailand 14-21, 21-15, 21-12 to win the mens singles title of the Indian Open Grand Prix, here, on Sunday.         
	The womens title was lifted by Chinas Zhou Hui with a 21-13, 21-17 victory over Fransiska Ratnasari of Indonesia.         
	Top seed Rumbaka, who was the finalist in the last edition of the tournament, found the it tough in the beginning because he was fighting flu and breathlessness.         
	However, in the second game, when the Indonesian found a slender lead of 12-10, everything changed. His smashes began to work superbly and the unseeded Thai seemed all lost.         
	With superb smashes, he soon went up 20-13 and levelled the match with another aggressive smash.         
	In the decider, the Indonesian didnt allow his opponent to stage any sort of comeback. He opened up a 6-4 lead and very soon that became 13-16. Proving to be one of the most destructive players of the tournament, Rumbaka triumphed.         
	Its nice to win after losing the final last year, Rumbaka said.         
	The womens final seemed like a lop-sided affair. Zhou overpowered her Indonesian opponent completely. It was a difficult match. I had beaten her (Ratnasari) at the Korean GP three weeks back I know her game, Zhou said.         
	In the mens doubles final, Mohammed Ahsan and Bona Septani of Indonesia defeated the Malaysian duo of Teik Chai Gan and Bin Shen Tan 19-21, 21-15, 21-14.         
	The womens doubles crown went to the Chinese pair Xia Huan and Jinhua Tant. They drubbed Hui Ern Ng and Hui Lin Ng of Malaysia 21-8, 21-19.         
	The Chinese also triumphed in the mixed doubles event. Peixuan and Jinhua Tan emerged victorious with a 21-17, 21-17 win over Teik Chai Gan and Hui Lin Ng of Malaysia.

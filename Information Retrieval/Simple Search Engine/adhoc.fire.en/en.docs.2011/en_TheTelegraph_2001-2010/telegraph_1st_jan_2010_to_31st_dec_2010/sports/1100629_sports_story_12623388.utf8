The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Perfect game yet to come,   says Robben 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Perfect game yet to come,   says Robben 
                            
	Durban: Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder scored in each half Monday to give the Netherlands a 2-1 win over Slovakia and a spot in the World Cup quarter finals.         
	It was only a month ago when Robben and Sneijder were on opposite sides in the Champions League final  Robben with Bayern Munich and Sneijder with winner Inter Milan.         
	That was nice today (Monday). If youre at the World Cup it should be fun. We didnt play our best match today but the important thing is that we advanced, Robben said. Probably the perfect game has still to come.         
	The most important thing for me is to play my first match. Its only three weeks after the injury. Thats not a lot of time. Today I felt good, maybe not 100 per cent but I felt good.         
	Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg preserved the win with two key saves in the 67th, and the Dutch extended their team-record unbeaten streak to 23 games.         
	At a crucial stage Maarten Stekelenburg saved us, Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk said.         
	In between the goals from Robben and Sneijder, the Dutch wasted numerous chances.         
	We had a good first half hour. And we started well in the second half, Van Marwijk said. We should have scored 2-0, 3-0, maybe 4-0 there.         
	I think weve got to improve for the quarter finals. Well have to play better than today, added Robben, who missed the first two matches of the campaign with injury.

	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan continued their winning run as they thrashed Calcutta Port Trust 3-0 at home, in a Calcutta Football League Premier Division tie, on Friday.         
	Though the match witnessed miss passes and some missed chances, Bagan managed to give the fans something to cheer about with three goals and full points to their name.         
	Jose Ramirez Barreto drew the first blood just at the stroke of half-time. Receiving a pass from Man of the Match Kingshuk Debnath, the Brazilian flicked the ball into the net with his outstretched left leg. The Brazilians brilliance left the Port Trust defence totally clueless.         
	Then came Kingshuks turn to step it up. In the 75th minute, he headed in Bagans second goal from Satish Kumars corner kick and the crowd erupted in joy.         
	Not to be outdone, Subair Murithala Ali scored his 16th CFL goal 15 minutes later.         
	Receiving a pass from substitute Souvik Chakraborty, the Nigerian forward quickly turned and slotted the ball home past a hapless Port Trust keeper Sukdeb Ghosh.         
	Port Trust could have managed to score one in the first half but Ashim Das was unable to convert, despite having only an out of position Shilton Paul to beat. The ball hit the post and rebounded to the Bagan keeper, who had, by then, managed to get back to his position.         
	Though we missed a few chances, the boys played well and we got three points which was the aim, said Bagan coach Stanley Rozario.         
	With the derby in a weeks time, Rozario hoped to have Ishfaq Ahmed back. Sagram Mandi has a sprain and Im expecting him to play in the I-League now. Sheikh Azim too, will be back for the I-League. But, for the derby, I think Ishfaq will be available. Barring them, my other boys are fit and raring to go, he added.         
	A dejected Port Trust coach, Shabbir Ali, said: We were without two of our foreigners. Also, we conceded two goals which we shouldnt have. However, against Bagans star-studded side, my boys played well.

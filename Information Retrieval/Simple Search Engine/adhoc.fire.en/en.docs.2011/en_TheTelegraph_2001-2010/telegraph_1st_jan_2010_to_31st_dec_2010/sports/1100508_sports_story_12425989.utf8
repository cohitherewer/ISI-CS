            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gaganjeet Bhullar                                       
	Mumbai: In track and field parlance, it was the final kick. Golfer Gaganjeet Bhullar, lagging behind on the leaderboard at the end of third days play, Friday produced a perfect fourth round card of four-under 66 to clinch the Rs 30 lakh PGTI Players Championship title.         
	Having carded two triple bogeys on Thursday, Bhullar was four strokes behind overnight leader Shamim Khan when he teed off at the Bombay Presidencey Golf Club course.         
	Four birdies on the front nine saw the Kapurthala lad cut Khans lead down to two strokes. Bhullar then showed some more of that fighting spirit in recovering from a double bogey on the 15th to make a 25-foot putt for birdie on the next.         
	Khan, on the other hand, choked with victory in sight. The Delhi player dropped shots on three holes in a row  on 15th, 16th and 17th  to hand a one-stroke lead to his rival.         
	Bhullar sealed the title with a birdie on the final 18th with Khan needing an eagle to take the game into a play-off. Thursdays leader could only manage a birdie. It happens. You miss six-seven cuts and then win a major in the next, Bhullar said.         
	It was hot. Although it was windy, humidity made it difficult for all. And the pins were also tucked in the corner (of the greens), so you had to play safe and then attack, he said.         
	It was the eighth career-title and the second of the season for Bhullar who picked up a cheque for Rs 4.85 lakh.

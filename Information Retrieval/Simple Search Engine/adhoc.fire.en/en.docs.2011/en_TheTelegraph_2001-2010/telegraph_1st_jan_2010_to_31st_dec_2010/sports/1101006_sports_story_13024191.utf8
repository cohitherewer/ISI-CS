	New Delhi: The Golden moment for India at the Commonwealth Games came on Tuesday, as the shooters and wrestlers lived up to their billing.         
	While the Indian marksmen came out all guns blazing to bag two gold medals, the Greco-Roman grapplers finally emerged from the shadow of their freestyle counterparts to clinch all the three gold medals at stake, at the Indira Gandhi Stadium.         
	With five gold medals in their kitty, India are now placed second in the medals tally, behind mighty Australia.         
	In the morning, at the Karni Singh shooting range, out of the four gold medals of the event, the home team bagged two and settled for silver in the 50 metres pistol pairs event and 50 metres 3-positions rifle.         
	The day began with the two star shooters  Gagan Narang and Abhinav Bindra  dishing out a world class performance in the 10 metres air rifle pairs, to win the first gold medal for the home nation in the 19th edition of the Games. Minutes after this, Anisha Saied and Rahi Sarnobat earned the second gold for India in the 25 metres pairs pistol.         
	In wrestling, cheered by a big crowd, the Indians were all over, winning all the three gold in the span of one hour. While Ravinder Singh started the gold rush in the 60kg category, Sanjay (74kg) and Anil Kumar (96kg) kept up the good work to make it a clean sweep.         
	Introduced for the first time in the Commonwealth Games, Greco-Roman wrestlers never had enough opportunities to display their talent on bigger stage. But this time, with four more gold medals up for grab on Wednesday, the Greco-Roman boys are likely to make it big.         
	While Ravinder Singh, who defeated Englands Christopher Terence Bosson 7-2 bagged the first gold, Sanjay earned the second in the 74 kg defeating South Africas Brian Richard Addinall, a pre-Games favourite to win the title.         
	The bout involving Anil Kumar left a bad taste in the mouth as his Australian rival Hassene Fkiri was repeatedly warned for head butting the Indian, and misbehaving with the referee. Anil, however, won the bout easily with a 6-0 verdict.         
	The story, however, was different at the shooting range. Having won 16 gold medals in the previous Games, the Indians were expected to deliver the goods from the Day One. So high were the expectations that for the past few days, the Indian shooters had clearly tried to avoid the media attention.         
	So much so, Narang, who refused to be dragged into any discussion on the competition, posted a message on his website saying: To my friends in the media...thank you for your understandingpressure of expectations is the last thing we need at the moment.         
	But when it came to the actual event on Tuesday, both Narang and Bindra looked absolutely relaxed. In a performance that reduced the contest to a truly one-sided affair, the duo shot a Games record 1193 in mens 10metres air rifle pairs event, breaking their own mark set four years ago in Melbourne, where they had notched up 1189. England (1174) and Bangladesh (1173) pairs took the second and the third spots.         
	While Narang shot a spectacular sequence of 99, 100, 100, 99, 100, 100 to total a grand 598, Bindras series read 100, 98, 99, 100, 99, 99 for a total of 595 in the first shooting event of the 2010 Games.         
	It was not a personal achievement for me or Gagan, said Bindra.         
	Our victory only shows how well shooting is progressing in India. I am sure more and more people will now come to watch this game, he said.         
	Asked whether people will be more interested about knowing the scores of the India versus Australia Test match or the Commonwealth Games, Bindra said: Commonwealth Games, of course.

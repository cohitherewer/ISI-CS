The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger wants a victory

	Shanghai: No longer No. 1 in the world, Tiger Woods said Wednesday that it hasnt changed how he sees himself or what hes trying to do at the HSBC Champions.         
	I come to the event to win the event, Woods said. I havent won an event in about a year. Ive gone through periods like this before in the past. In order to become No. 1 in the world, Ive won golf tournaments. Its something I havent done, and its a matter of going out there and competing and winning.         
	The HSBC Champions, which starts Thursday at Sheshan International, is the only World Golf Championship he hasnt won.         
	Woods will be facing a strong field, which features the new No. 1, Lee Westwood. Also playing is defending champion Phil Mickelson and PGA champion Martin Kaymer, who has won three of his last four tournaments. All four of them have a chance to go to No. 1 in the world this week, as the top of the ranking is more crowded than ever.         
	For Woods, a victory would be especially meaningful now.         
	He has won a PGA Tour event in each of his 14 seasons, and the HSBC Champions is his last chance for 2010. It would count as an official victory if won by a PGA Tour member. The tour record for consecutive seasons with at least one victory is 17, held by Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.         
	Woods has not come particularly close to winning all year. He had a tie for fourth in Masters, his first tournament since a sex scandal kept him out of golf for nearly five months, and he tied for fourth at the US Open.         
	For Woods to look back to April when he returned to golf, he said there has been only one surprise.         
	I never would have foreseen when I returned to the game at the Masters that I would have a new coach and I would be here, he said. So the game is certainly much different than it was in April.         
	Woods began working with Sean Foley at the PGA Championship in August, and he said they worked throughout October after the Ryder Cup on trying to nail down a new technique.         
	Woods has played the HSBC Champions, which only became a WGC event last year, three times. He was runner-up twice, and a year ago tied for sixth.         
	I look at myself as a much better person than what I was, he said. All that I have gone through has certainly made me a better person and has enabled me and forced me to take a look at myself. Unfortunately, I had to go through it to get to this point. But Im looking forward to working each and every day at trying to become the best parent I possibly can.

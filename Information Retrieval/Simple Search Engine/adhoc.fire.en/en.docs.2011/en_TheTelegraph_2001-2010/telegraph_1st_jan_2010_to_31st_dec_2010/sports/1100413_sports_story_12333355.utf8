	Nagpur: Rohit Sharma struck a vital half century and shared 82 runs for the fourth-wicket with Mohnish Mishra (41) as defending champions Deccan Chargers beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 13 runs to stay afloat for a semi-final spot in the Indian Premier League here on Monday.         
	Rohit (51 off 46 balls) and Mohnish Mishra (41 off 30 balls) resurrected the Deccan innings with their partnership to guide the defending champions to 151 for six. This was after Dale Steyn (3/18)s fiery spell that saw Deccan tottering at 14 for three when Rohit and Mohnish came together.         
	Defending a modest total, Chargers bowlers rose to the occasion with RP Singh (2/21), Pragyan Ojha (2/22), Harmeet Singh (2/24) and Ryan Harris (2/34) sharing eight wickets among themselves to bowl out the Royal Challengers for 138 in 19.4 overs.         
	The Bangalore outfit however maintained their second position in the table. However Chargers victory meant bad news for Kolkata Knight Riders who now slumped to seventh position in the eight-team table while the defending champions are now fifth with 12 points. The KKR will now have to not only win their three matches but also have to ensure a significant improvement in the net run-rate.                     
	For Bangalore side, Rahul Dravid top-scored with a classical 49 while Robin Uthappa made a breezy 34 off 20 balls. The Royal Challengers did not have the perfect start as Ryan Harris struck in his and innings first delivery for Deccan.         
	The Australian pacer found Manish Pandey fishing at a moving delivery, only to get a thick edge which was gobbled up by skipper Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps.         
	In came Rahul Dravid looking in great touch. He started off with a copy book drive off Harris and then welcomed Andrew Symonds with two boundaries in his first over.         
	Harmeet also faced the brunt of Dravids aggression as he hit the medium pacer for back-to-back boundaries.         
	However, Dravids 35-ball innings, which was studded with eight fours, was halted by Symonds just one run before the half century as the right-hander hit one straight to B. Sumanth at the long-off boundary.           (PTI)

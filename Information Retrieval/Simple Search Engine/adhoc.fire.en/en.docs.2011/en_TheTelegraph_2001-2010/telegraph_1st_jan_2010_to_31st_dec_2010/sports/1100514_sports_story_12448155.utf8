The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to review IPL schedule: Pataudi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Need to review IPL schedule: Pataudi
                      
	New Delhi: Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi has said the IPL governing council, of which he is a member, could consider reviewing the number of matches for the league next season.         
	Indias poor performance in the World Twenty20 this year has led to criticism suggesting their exit from the tournament was a consequence of a hectic IPL schedule. The IPL is set to stage 94 games in 2011, with the addition to two new teams, as opposed to 60 this year.         
	Pataudi, while acknowledging that the increasing volume of cricket was proving stressful, said players would have to be mentally and physically tougher to adapt to the games growing demands.         
	We can look at this and say how do we reduce the matches I think there is a need perhaps to review that, Pataudi told a news channel. But it will be very difficult now to reduce the number of teams.         
	Pataudi said the decision to include two new teams and increase the number of games next season did meet opposition even within the governing council. I cant exactly tell you what happened at the council meeting but it wasnt exactly a unanimous decision I assure you... A lot of people said there is too much cricket going on, but it was carried. It will be a long summer for cricket. Cricket is going to become more and more stressful as we continue, and people will have to be fitter and tougher mentally as well as physically.         
	On Mahendra Singh Dhonis comment, in the aftermath of the exit from the World Twenty20, that the travelling and the after-match parties during the IPL had contributed to tiredness among players, Pataudi said: I think Dhoni is not right about the IPL nights as much as he is right about the travelling. Thats what really puts you under strain Cricket is very strenuous nowadays.         
	Players have to be absolutely single-minded about the game. They have to think about and focus on nothing but cricket and just forget everything else.           (AGENCIES)

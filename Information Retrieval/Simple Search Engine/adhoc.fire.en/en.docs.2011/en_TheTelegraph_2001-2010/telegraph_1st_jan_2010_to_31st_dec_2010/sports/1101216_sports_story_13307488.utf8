The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bracing for No. 1 battle
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bracing for No. 1 battle
                      
	Centurion: The pre-series verbal war has set the stage for an electrifying battle as India gear up to face a hostile South Africa in the first of the three-Test series, starting here, Thursday. The mission is not only to prove themselves as the worthy No. 1s, but also improve their record in South Africa.         
	Described as the final frontier by coach Gary Kirsten, world No. 2 South Africa will challenge Indias No. 1 status like no other side has in more than a year when the series kicks off at the Super Sport Park.         
	Graeme Smiths men will look to exploit the Indian batsmens susceptibility to the rising deliveries on bouncy tracks and the hosts have the firepower to do that  the most potent of their weapons being Dale Steyn, the No. 1 bowler in the world.         
	The Indians go into the series well aware that they have won just one out of the 12 Tests they have played in the rainbow nation. Even if they didnt, the Proteas have not missed an opportunity to remind the visitors of the unflattering record ever since their arrival.         
	In fact, the pre-series verbal sparring has added to the drama, which would make the contest even more interesting.         
	When South African coach Corrie van Zyl stated that record books dont lie in an apparent reference to Indias poor record in South Africa, India coach Gary Kirsten was quick to retort that things have changed in the past couple of years.         
	The pace and bounce of South Africa would not be as easy to adapt considering the visitors go into the series without playing a single warm-up match. Add to this the injury worry that the Indians have.         
	The conditions, in fact, would prove to be Indias biggest challenge against a quality opposition but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his side is ready, with a blend of youth and experience, to record their first Test series win in South Africa.         
	In comparison, the South African batting may not be as experienced but it is no less dangerous with Smith being the fulcrum. The only spoilsport could be the weather with the forecast of rain here this week.         
	Scheduled start: 2pm (IST)           (AGENCIES)

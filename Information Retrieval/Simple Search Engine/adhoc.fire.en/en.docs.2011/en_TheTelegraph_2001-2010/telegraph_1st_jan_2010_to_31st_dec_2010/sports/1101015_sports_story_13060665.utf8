            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                
	New Delhi: Indian paddlers put up an impressive show on the final day of the Commonwealth Games, Thursday. They ensured a total of five medals from their sport.         
	After winning the mens doubles gold partnering Subhajit Saha Wednesday, Sharath Kamal played his heart out against friend and compatriot Soumyadeep Roy in the bronze medal playoff tie. The Melbourne gold medallist had to be content with a bronze this time round when he defeated the Bengal paddler 11-8, 11-5, 12-10, 11-9 at the Yamuna Sports Complex. With this win, Sharath also won the 100th medal for India in the Games.         
	There were more smiles from the Indian camp. Reigning national champion Poulami Ghatak, with partner Mouma Das, clinched a bronze, beating Australians Vivian Tan Z and Peri Campbell-Innes in the womens doubles third-place playoff.                     Poulami Ghatak and Mouma Das with their doubles gold, on Thursday         
	Poulami and Mouma were determined to make up for Wednesdays semi-final loss. They began on an attacking note and won 11-4, 11-7 and 11-1.         
	It looked easy but we had to fight hard in the match. I would say our hardwork paid off. This win was special because Mouma and I are childhood friends, Weve been playing together for a very long time, said Poulami said after the match.         
	Its a dream come true for us to win in front of a home crowd, she added.         
	Both coaches (Bhawani Mukherjee and Massimo Constantini) have played very important roles in our success, said Mouma.         
	The Indians had lost to Singaporeans Sun Beibei and Li Jiawei 0-3 in the semis. Beibei and Jiaweei claimed the gold defeating compatriots Tianwei Feng and Wang Yuegu 3-2 in the final.         
	Paddlers ultimately gave India a gold, a silver and three bronze medals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden will host 2nd Test vs SA
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eden will host 2nd Test vs SA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Test cricket will make a comeback to Eden Gardens after more than two years as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced Sunday that the city will host the second Test between India and South Africa.         
	The Eden had last hosted a Test on November 2007, against Pakistan.         
	Though the BCCI is yet to announce a detailed fixture, sources claimed that the second Test is set for a February 14 start. The first of the two-Test series will be held in Nagpur from February 6.         
	After a meeting of the tour, programme and fixtures committee in Mumbai on Sunday, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan also said in a statement that Kanpur, Jaipur and Ahmedabad will host the one-day Internationals.         
	The two-match series was included in the itinerary after Team India attained the No.1 position in the ICC Test rankings.         
	Though a favourite till recently, recent controversies at the Eden during the India-Sri Lanka ODI on December 24 had clouded the citys chances of hosting the Test.         
	However, Cricket Association of Bengal joint secretary Biswarup Dey, who is also a member of the tour, programme and fixtures committee and attended Sundays meeting, said that he was able to appease the Board about these problems.         
	Eden getting to host a Test in the India-South Africa series was a logical decision. Kanpurs wish to host a Test was not right since they had a Test in the India-Sri Lanka series. Hence, going by the rules, they are now eligible for an ODI. So, Nagpur and Calcutta were the obvious choices, Dey said from Mumbai.         
	He also argued: Since 2007, 13 Tests have been played and Eden hasnt hosted a single one. So we deserved to host this match.

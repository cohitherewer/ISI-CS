	New Delhi: Hispania Racing F1 Teams Karun Chandhok Friday said he never thought his Formula One debut would prove to be so tough.         
	It was nearly a miracle that Hispania, grappling with a cash crunch, managed to get two cars on the grid in the season opener in Bahrain without prior testing.         
	Karun was unveiled as one of Hispanias drivers just days before the race and the Indian, with hardly any mileage under his belt, saw his debut cut short in the second lap .         
	I knew my F1 debut was going to be tough but never realised it would be so tough, Karun said on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony here. This was definitely not how I imagined my F1 debut would be but unfortunately that is how it was, he said.         
	The Chennai driver, however, is thrilled by the experience and said the feeling had yet to sink in.         
	It was surreal. The paddock was very welcoming. Most of the drivers welcomed me, saying welcome to the gang.         
	The best moment has been the drivers parade when all 24 drivers made a circle of the circuit. My mother later pointed out that only 24 people in the entire world were part of that little group and it felt great, Karun said.         
	Looking ahead, the driver said, The season is going to be tough and I need all the support I can have. (PTI)

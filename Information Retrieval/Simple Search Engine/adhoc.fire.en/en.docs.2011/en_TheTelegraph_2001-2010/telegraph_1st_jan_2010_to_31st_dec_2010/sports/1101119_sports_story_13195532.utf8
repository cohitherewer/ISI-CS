            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla at the Eden, on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Calcutta: The Bengal duo of Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Wriddhiman Saha ran riot on Day Two of their Ranji Trophy Super League tie, against Assam, on Thursday. And both of them were happy with their performance.         
	It is a great feeling very special for me. It is a 250 and that, too, in my 100th first-class match. I am happy because the team needed it and I delivered when it mattered most, the right-handed batsman said after the days play.         
	Despite playing such a long innings Shukla said he would be able to bowl as the fifth bowler. Of course, I will be available, if required. It is challenging both physically and mentally to carry on. But, I am up for it, he insisted         
	Asked if there was any particular plan ahead of the day, Shukla said: We pretty much had this score as a plan. We needed to stay put and bring the runs on. Thats what we did. I did not play under any pressure.         
	He also felt the knock would silence his critics. This is an answer to the critics. They will keep their mouth shut now, he said.         
	Shukla didnt forget remind the role of Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman behind his success. I am grateful to my coach (. Raman). I am honoured that he kept faith in me and stood by me. He helped me with keeping my mental composure and patience, he said.         
	Shukla also praised Wriddhimans knock but refused to comment on the team managements decision to declare when Saha could have got his double. Its a decision of the team management.         
	Wriddhiman also said he was not disappointed. It does not affect me at all. The team is always the priority.         
	The diminutive wicket-keeper said he was not under any pressure. There wasnt any pressure. There was a need for a big total, and I am happy we could do it.         
	Asked if the upcoming World Cup was on his mind, Saha said that he was concentrating on one match at a time and was not thinking about the mega event. I am taking one match at a time. World Cup is a far away matter and I am not even thinking about it, he added.         
	Assam skipper Amol Muzumdar heaped praises on the duo for their commendable job. They did a commendable job. Keeping in mind that they came together when Bengal were 126 for five, its not a joke. They really put their heads together and pulled it off.

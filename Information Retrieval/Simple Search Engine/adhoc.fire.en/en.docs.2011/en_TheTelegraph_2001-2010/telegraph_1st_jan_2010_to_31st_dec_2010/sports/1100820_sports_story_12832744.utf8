The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IWF seeking ministry aid
                                                                                                                       7                                      IWF seeking ministry aid
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Faced with the prospect of being barred from the Commonwealth Games because of non-payment of fine, the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) seems to have found a way out to avoid the embarrassment.         
	The IWF was slapped with a fine of $500, 000 by the international federation in September last year after six Indian lifters failed dope tests. Though IWF has already paid $1, 25,000, the Indian lifters will not be allowed to participate in any international event if the rest of the amount is not paid by August 31.         
	Desperate to raise the money before the deadline, the IWF president B.P. Baishya, on Thursday, has written to the sports ministry stating that the federation is seriously planning to follow the government guidelines on age and tenure.         
	Yes, we have informed the ministry that the guidelines issue will be taken up in the next meeting of the federation, said an IWF official, who did not wish to be named. We hope the ministry will now help us arrange the rest of the fine amount. After all, our lifters can contribute at least 15 medals to Indias tally in the Commonwealth Games, he added.         
	The IWF had earlier approached both the ministry and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) for help but did not receive any assurance.         
	At that time, the minister of state of sports, Pratik Prakashbapu said the IWF had already informed the government that it was in no position to pay the balance amount of penalty and was depending on the ministry and IOA for financial assistance.         
	Ministry has asked the IOA to resolve the matter at the earliest in consultation with International Weightlifting Federation so as to ensure participation of Indian weightlifting team in the Commonwealth Games, the minister was quoted saying.         
	Indian weightlifters have a history of doping. India were first banned in 2004 and then in 2006. The team was barred from Asian Games in Doha after four lifters tested positive within a period of 12 months. In 2008, Indias Egyptian trainer Magad Salama resigned as national coach citing doping.         
	IWF is the second federation to fall in line, after All India Tennis Association (AITA) announced last week that it was ready to follow the government guidelines that prevent the principal office bearers of all sports federations to continue beyond two terms.         
	However, Hockey India (HI) and Badminton Association of India (BAI) have openly defied the directives saying they would run without accepting any grant from government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barbs spurred me on: Barreto
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barbs spurred me on: Barreto
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans favourite son Jose Ramirez Barreto was visibly happy on Sunday. After all, he got his name in the scoresheet against arch-rivals East Bengal. Yeah, I am happy to contribute to the teams cause. I am expected to score in big matches. Sometimes I live up to the fans expectations, sometimes I dont. But all the while I keep on trying.         
	Barreto said he was not bothered by the criticism he faced this season. Those barbs actually spurred me on. I am a professional footballer and know how to handle these things. I never let that creep into my mind. I kept my focus and today I think I managed to make a point, he said.         
	The Brazilian said that the 2-1 win would give the green and maroon brigade the impetus to retain the Calcutta Football League title. Barreto, however, rued that Bagan once again failed to win the I-League.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder said Bagan were the deserving winners. They were much more compact and disciplined on the day. We made mistakes and paid for that, he said.

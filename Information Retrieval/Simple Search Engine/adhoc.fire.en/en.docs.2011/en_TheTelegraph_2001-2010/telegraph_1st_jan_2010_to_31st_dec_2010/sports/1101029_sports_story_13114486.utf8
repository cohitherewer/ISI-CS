The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wozniacki to end the year as No. 1

	Doha: Caroline Wozniacki secured the year-end No. 1 ranking after rallying to beat Francesca Schiavone of Italy 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 at the WTA Championships, Thursday.         
	The 20-year-old Dane becomes the 10th woman to end the season on top of the rankings and the youngest since Martina Hingis in 1997.         
	French Open champion Schiavone started strongly against Wozniacki, who continued the erratic play that saw her upset by Samantha Stosur, on Wednesday.         
	Schiavone closed out the set with the help of three aces in the final game, but Wozniacki, with the help of some on-court coaching from her father, began to dictate play from the second set onwards.         
	Stosur earlier booked her place in the semi-finals, despite a defeat by Elena Dementieva, but Wozniacki looks set to have to wait for the final match of the group between Schiavone and Dementieva.         
	 Dementieva of Russia rallied to beat Stosur 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) for her first group-stage win.         
	Stosur earned a place in the semi finals despite the loss, having won her first two singles matches in the Maroon Group at the tournament. Dementieva has a 1-1 record after losing to No. 1-ranked Caroline Wozniacki in her first round-robin match.         
	Dementieva took a 3-1 lead in the second set before levelling the match with a blistering backhand down the line. Dementieva saved both break points she faced in the third, which went with serve until the tiebreaker.         
	The top two players from each round-robin group will go through to the semi finals on Saturday.         
	Dementieva still has a chance to advance if Wozniacki loses later Thursday against Francesca Schiavone. Wozniacki would be knocked out with a loss, while Dementieva and Schiavone would play for the semi final spot Friday.         
	Wozniacki with the win would ensure she keeps her top ranking for the year. Should she lose, it would give No. 2-ranked Vera Zvonareva a chance to replace her should she reach the finals. Zvonareva has won her first two matches in the White Group and is guaranteed a spot in the semi finals if Kim Clijsters beats Victoria Azarenka.         
	Stosur, the French Open runner-up who upset Wozniacki Wednesday, started out strong, but just as she looked in control after the first set, things began to unravel.         
	She committed more than 34 errors during the 2 hour and 42 minute match and only managed to win a third of her break points.         
	She ceded the momentum to the quicker Dementieva in the second set, who repeatedly rushed the net and managed to unnerve Stosur with a mix of successful drop shots, backhands and a powerful forehand.         
	Dementieva also proved a fighter, repeatedly coming back in the final set, closing out the match with a strong serve that Stosur returned long.         
	I was trying to improve my game coming in this match, Dementieva said afterward. Playing someone who had a great win last night, I was trying to fight for every point and it feels great to win 7-6 in the third.         
	On Wednesday, Stosur upset Wozniacki 6-4, 6-3. Stosur, a runner-up at the French Open, played some of her most inspired tennis this year. She used a powerful forehand and strong serve to rattle the normally consistent Wozniacki.         
	A closely-fought first set was decided by a forehand winner from Stosur. Stosur turned up the heat in the second, racing to a 5-2 lead. But Wozniacki scratched a game back and nerves seemed to get the best of Stosur as she twice double-faulted before closing out the final game when Wozniacki returned her serve long.

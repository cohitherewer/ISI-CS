The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were sorry, say Cup organisers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Were sorry, say Cup organisers
                      
	New Delhi/London: Bowing to pressure, the organisers of the ISSF World Cup in Dorset (UK) on Sunday apologised to the Indian shooters who were harassed by their transport staff.         
	The organisers have apologised for the incident, National Rifles Association of India (NRAI) secretary Rajib Bhatia said.         
	A meeting was held between our representatives and the organisers where they apologised. I have spoken to our team manager T Padmanabhan, who was at the meeting. We have asked for a written apology from them and are currently waiting for the letter, Bhatia said.         
	Padmanabhan on Saturday wrote to the Indian High Commission in London, complaining that the shooters were insulted by the transport staff.         
	The Indian High Commission soon got in touch with the organisers while back home, sports minister MS Gill convened a meeting of the ministry officials, asking them to get in touch with NRAI and the High Commission for details of the incident.         
	The issue threatened to spill into diplomatic domain as minister of state for external affairs Preneet Kaur also took strong view of the incident, calling it unfortunate.         
	Commonwealth Games gold medallist Manavjit Singh Sandhu, part of the Indian team in the event, dismissed the allegation and said the Indian shooters have never been accused of misbehaving ever.         
	Indian shooters are respected in the international circuit. Indians are among the prominent title contenders and their behaviour is always exemplary. This charge is really very disappointing, he said. (PTI)

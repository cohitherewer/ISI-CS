The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have to score 400-plus in first innings, says Kirsten
                                                                                                                       7                                        Have to score 400-plus in first innings, says Kirsten
                  While Sachin Tendulkar is busy preparing for the Durban Test, the demand for the maestro being conferred with the Bharat Ratna is getting stronger back home. Sportspersons from various disciplines, including Gagan Narang and Vijender Singh, on Friday, felt the countrys highest civilian honour should go to Sachin. (Getty Images)                     
	Durban: India coach Gary Kirsten expects his batsmen to back themselves after the first Test disappointment and score 400 in the first innings if they want to beat South Africa in the second Test, starting here on Sunday.         
	We know that if one of our top six is getting a decent score, a big hundred, we are going to get a score in excess of 400. We probably let ourselves down a bit in the first Test, Kirsten said.         
	We have got to assess the situation and get the best we can get out of the surface as a batting unit. I felt we were 100 runs short in the last Test, and we have got to apply ourselves, he added.         
	The former South African opening batsman said that his bowlers are capable of picking up 20 wickets and the return of pace spearhead Zaheer Khan will boost the Indian attack.         
	Bottom line is, we need to get 20 Test wickets. I think we have shown in the last three years that we have the ability to get 20 Test wickets in any conditions. Its up to us to prove to every one that we can do that here, said Kirsten.         
	Obviously nice to have Zaheer back. We look forward to whatever conditions are given to us, and we have the quality in our bowling line-up as well, he said. Asked about the Kingsmead pitch, Kirsten said, Looks a similar colour to the outfield. Lets see what comes up in two days time.         
	Meanwhile, Mahendra Singh Dhoni felt Sachin Tendulkars ability to adapt to the pressures of modern day cricket makes him better than Australian legend Don Bradman         
	Dhoni also said that he doesnt like any comparisons to be drawn between the two.         
	There is no doubt that both are brilliant batsmen. But Sachin has been around for two decades, the best in the world and had moreover throughout his career could adapt even with the demands of one-day cricket and more recently the Twenty20 version, the skipper said.         
	I do not like comparisons between Sachin and Don because they played in different eras, said Dhoni. Dhoni said Sachins presence is still an incentive for each of his teammates. Hes the kind of guy who get the best out of whoever he bats, said Dhoni.         
	Dhonis South African counterpart Graeme Smith has lost his valuable Test cap, which he wore in every match since his debut against Australia way back in 2002 in Cape Town.         
	Smith revealed in his Twitter account that the cap, which he lost during his travel from Centurion to Durban, was irreplaceable for him.         
	Realise this is a long shot, but had my Test cap that Ive used since my 1st test for proteas stolen on travel up to durbs!cant be replaced, he wrote in his Twitter page.         
	Cap means a lot to me so if you know anything pls give me a shout......thx.         
	Smith, however, is delighted that the Kingsmead track, known for its bounce and carry, is the best he had seen for some years.         
	Smith said from what he had seen, the pitch is expected to live up to its reputation of the past.         
	The pitch has been a bit patchy over the last few Tests. It has spun a bit more, taken more reverse swing and gone very flat in the middle period of matches. From what Ive seen today (Friday), I can only hope it will get back to what it was when I first started playing here, Smith said.

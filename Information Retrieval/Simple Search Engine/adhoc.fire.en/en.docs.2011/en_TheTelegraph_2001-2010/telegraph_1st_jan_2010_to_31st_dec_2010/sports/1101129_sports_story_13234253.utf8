The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Berbatov is happy to regain form
                                                                                                                       7                                        Berbatov is happy to regain form
            Ed Ballard            Dimitar Berbatov                           
	Dimitar Berbatov expressed his relief to regain his scoring form on Saturday after his 11-game barren run came to an end with a five-goal haul against Blackburn.         
	The Manchester United forward admitted that his barren run had started to cause him sleepless nights, so he was delighted to help United put pressure on title rivals Chelsea with five goals in their 7-1 win over Blackburn.         
	I dont think anybody could have guessed the scoreline, said Berbatov.         
	In the end Im pleased with the performance and the goals I scored, personally I was very impressed with myself.         
	Ive scored five before but it was a long time ago back home. To do it in the Premier League when only four other players have done it, to stand next to Shearer and Andy Cole is a great honour.         
	Berbatovs five-goal haul sends him to the top of the Premier League scorers charts, but what looks like a superb statistic for a striker  11 goals in 13 league appearances  masks the peaks and troughs of his autumn.         
	The Bulgarian began the season in the form of his Manchester United career, scoring six goals in five games culminating in a hattrick against Liverpool. The brilliant overhead kick he executed for his second was the kind of audacious effort that only seems to come off for a player flush with confidence.         
	But that performance was followed by a slump in which Berbatov failed to score in 11 games. In the seven league outings following his heroics against Liverpool he managed just five shots on target. Eventually he was ignominiously dropped  not even picked for the bench  by Alex Ferguson for Uniteds game against Wigan last weekend.         
	So it is hardly surprising that Berbatov was, as he admitted after picking up the match-ball on Saturday, a little bit worried. When you are a striker people tend to only look at the goals you score.         
	For me, it is more about how I play, the assists I give, how I link with other players, Berbatov said.         
	The suggestion that Berbatov was performing a pivotal role in the team in recent weeks would come as a surprise to anyone who watched some of his performances. His touch seemed to have deserted him and he was out of synch with his teammates. As for the assists, he supplied just one in 11 games.         
	Alex Ferguson acknowledged that Berbatovs travails had been caused by lost confidence, while suggesting that Berbatovs performances will improve now that he is playing alongside Wayne Rooney once more.         
	When strikers are not scoring they dont think they are doing their job right, quot; the Manchester United manager said.         
	That has always been the case. Today it came back.         
	It was a fantastic achievement by Berbatov and in my time Ive only seen Andy Cole achieve that here. It was important he got off the mark early because he hadnt scored in 10 games. He combined with Wayne well and they interchanged brilliantly.         
	Ferguson will be hoping that Rooneys return to first-team action will benefit the Bulgarian, who has only scored one goal this season  against Everton in September  when Rooney was not playing.

            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: Gagan Narang may be the only Indian to have won four gold medals in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games, but two pistol shooters  Omkar Singh and Vijay Kumar  are going to be richer in cash awards than the ace rifle shooter.         
	While Narangs gold medals will entitle him to Rs.70 lakh as prize money from the sports ministry, both Omkar and Vijay will receive more than Rs.one crore for also being the employees of Indian Army. The duo have won three gold and one silver medal each, in the individual and pairs events.         
	As per the announcement made by the sports ministry, every individual gold winner, in the Games will be given a cash award of Rs.20 lakh, while the silver and bronze medal winners will receive Rs.15 and Rs.seven lakh each, respectively. The gold winners in pairs and team events will receive Rs.15 lakh each. The entire project will cost the ministry more than Rs.17 crore.         
	Narang, who bagged two individual gold medals and two in pairs events, will get Rs.70 lakh from the ministry, while Omkar and Vijay will receive Rs.60 and Rs.55 lakh each.         
	However, both Omkar and Vijay will end up winning more than Rs.one crore for their superb achievements because of added rewards from two other ministries defence and petroleum.         
	While the ministry of defence will only felicitate their 25 sportspersons, who excelled in the Games, petroleum ministry has announced cash rewards for all 101 medal winners.         
	The defence minister A.K.Anthony has already declared cash awards of Rs.12 lakh each for gold winners, Rs.seven lakh and Rs.five lakh for silver and bronze winners. By adding this to their kitty, Omkar and Vijay should get Rs.1.05 crore each.         
	Narang, however, would not fall far behind as the petroleum ministry has promised a total cash award of Rs.nine crore for Indian medal winners. The gold winners will receive Rs.10 lakh each and the awards for silver and bronze winners are Rs.7.5 lakh and Rs.five lakh, respectively.         
	There is more to come, said a senior Indian Olympic Association (IOA) official. Several state governments like Jharkhand and Haryana have already announced cash awards for sportspersons from their own state. A few more state governments are likely to follow, he said.         
	Shooters are not the only ones to benefit from these windfalls, after India won a record 101 medals in the CWG. Athletes like archer Deepika Kumari, shuttler Saina Nehwal and tennis star Sania Mirza, who won more than one medal in the individual and team events, are also going to get substantial cash awards.

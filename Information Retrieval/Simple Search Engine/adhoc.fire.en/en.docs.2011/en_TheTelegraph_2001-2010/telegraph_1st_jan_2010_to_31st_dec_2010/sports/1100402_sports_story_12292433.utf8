The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kim, Justine enter semis
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kim, Justine enter semis
                      
	Miami: Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin of Belgium will meet in the semi-finals of the Miami Open.         
	Henin is only four tournaments into her return from a 20-month retirement, yet theres scant evidence of rust. She earned a berth in the semi-finals by overtaking No. 2-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark on Wednesday, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4.         
	Clijsters followed her into the final four by beating No. 9 Samantha Stosur of Australia 6-3, 7-5. Three-time champion Venus Williams will play No. 13-seeded Marion Bartoli of France in the other semi-final.         
	Once roommates on school tennis trips, Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin became Grand Slam champions, claimed the No. 1 ranking and played each other nearly two dozen times before calling it a career.         
	It has always been special, and it will always be special, Henin said. Because Kim and I grew up together; we arrived on the tour almost at the same time; we played good at the same time; we retired at the same time; and we came back at the same time.         
	Henin leads her rivalry with Clijsters 12-11. Theyve met only once since 2006  at Brisbane in January, which marked Henins return to the tour. Clijsters saved two match points and won.         
	Its always a special match between the two of us, Henin said. I hope we can give something good to the crowd.         
	On the mens side, Spains Rafael Nadal will face American Andy Roddick in the semi-finals after the pair enjoyed convincing victories on Wednesday.         
	Roddick cruised with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Spains Nicolas Almagro while Nadal was in blistering form in front of a packed crowd as he crushed Frances Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 6-2.

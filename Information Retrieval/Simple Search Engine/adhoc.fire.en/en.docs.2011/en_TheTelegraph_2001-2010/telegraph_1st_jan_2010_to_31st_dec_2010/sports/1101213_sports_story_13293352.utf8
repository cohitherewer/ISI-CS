	I am a right-handed batsman. I fail to negotiate the leg break. Please help.         
	(Tarun Kanti Das, 15, South 24 Parganas)         
	For starters, watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand. Also work on your footwork.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. I fail to keep the ball down when the ball bounces straight in front of the face. Please help.         
	(Sonam Tobgay, 14, Darjeeling)         
	Again, keep your eyes on the ball all the time. Also, you dont have to play the ball. You can sway out of the way or duck under it.         
	I am a pacer with a height of 5 feet 10 inches. Because of the uneven outfield, the ball loses shine very early. How does one maintain the shine?         
	(Ayush Agarwal, 16, Calcutta-91)         
	It will have to be a team effort. You cannot do it on your own.         
	I am a right arm mediumpacer and often change my action to suit my needs. Can it pose problems to my bowling?         
	(Siddharth Ghosh, 16, Bally)         
	Yes it can Constant change is not good. Once in a while, for variations sake, its fine.         
	I am a middle-order batsman. I am not too comfortable against pacers. Should I practice on concrete wickets to improve my abilities?         
	(Sushanta Tarafdar, 19, Calcutta)         
	Yes, that can help. Also, work on your back-foot play.         
	I have a bottom-hand grip. Is it an impediment when playing against spinners on a turning wicket?         
	(Rohit Chowdhury, 24, Calcutta-17)         
	Not at all as long as you are comfortable.         
	I am a mediumpacer. How does one study a batsmans strength?         
	(Sayan Gupta, 19, Calcutta)         
	Watch how his feet move. Also, look at his grip.         
	I am an off-spinner. What length should I bowl to when trying to get leg before decisions against a left-hander?         
	(Samir Saha, 23, Calcutta)         
	Your best chance is from around the wicket, where you pitch the ball in line and make it straighten.         
	I field at first slip. Often I lose concentration when standing there for a long period. How do I improve?         
	(Nilesh Saha, 17, Calcutta)         
	If thats the case, ask your captain to give you a break and go and stand in the outfield for a bit.         
	I am 13 and have just started the game. I am using a light bat and am comfortable. Is it okay?         
	(Arya Sengupta, Siliguri)         
	Yes, you are on the right track. Use whatever you are comfortable with.

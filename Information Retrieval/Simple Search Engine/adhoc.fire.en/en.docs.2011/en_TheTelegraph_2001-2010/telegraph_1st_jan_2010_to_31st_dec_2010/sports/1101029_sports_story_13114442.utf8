The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirstens the best, says Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kirstens the best, says Gambhir
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Gautam Gambhir      
	New Delhi: India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should renew coach Gary Kirstens contract when it expires after the 2011 World Cup.         
	According to Gambhir, who was named brand ambassador for Beverly Hills Polo Club, here, on Thursday, the South African was the best coach for the Indian team. Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, was also present at the promotional.         
	Gary is certainly the best coach we have seen for the Indian team. All the players have been saying regularly that India needs Gary as the coach. I dont need to speak much about him...         
	His fabulous record speaks for itself. He has been a great man-manager. So, I believe that he should be retained after the World Cup also, Gambhir said.         
	The opener also supported Kirstens idea of sending the top-order batsmen to South Africa, a week in advance, so that they can get themselves acclimatised to the pace and bounce of the wickets there.         
	Of late, we havent played much cricket in South Africa. So, it will be a great idea if we go there a bit early to get used to the conditions. If such a thing happens, it may just work in our favour, he said.         
	The left-handed batsman expressed satisfaction with his fitness and hoped to continue doing well in the Test series against New Zealand.         
	Gambhir missed the second Test, against Australia, in Bangalore, because of a knee injury. He, however, has been named in the side against the Black Caps in the three-Test series starting November 4, in Ahmedabad.         
	The Delhi DareDevils captain also informed that he was spending more time in the nets to get back into rhythm.         
	I have increased my batting time at the nets and am happy with my fitness, he said. I missed being a part of the team in the second Test, against Australia I am eager to be out there in the middle.         
	Gambhir, however, was quick to add that ups and downs are part of a cricketers career and one should not be expected to score heavily every time he picks up the bat.         
	Right now I am coming back from an injury. Its always a difficult thing when you come back from injury... Only when you spend considerable time out there in the middle, you get to know how its shaping up for you, he added.         
	On the forthcoming series against New Zealand, Gambhir said that it would be wrong to take the visitors lightly just because they lost 0-4 against Bangladesh recently.         
	You can never take any international side lightly. Just because Bangladesh beat them 4-0 doesnt mean that we can take it easy against the New Zealanders. Their team consists of some proven match-winners So, we need to be very careful and cant take things for granted, Gambhir said.

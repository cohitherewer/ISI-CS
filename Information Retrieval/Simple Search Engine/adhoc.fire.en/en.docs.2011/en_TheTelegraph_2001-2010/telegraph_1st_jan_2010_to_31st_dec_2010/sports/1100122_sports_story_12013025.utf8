The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dasgupta pulls out
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dasgupta pulls out
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta wrote a letter to Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Thursday, requesting the parent body not to consider him for Bengals team selection for the Vijay Hazare trophy (East Zone leg). Selectors are scheduled to meet next Thursday.         
	Deep dropped in at the Eden Gardens to submit the letter, citing personal reasons behind his decision.         
	I have submitted a letter to the president and a copy to the secretary (Biswarup Dey), who is the convenor of the senior selection committee. All that I can say is that I have some personal reasons, Deep told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Although Deep did not say it, some in the CAB firmly believe that the veteran is yet to forget the manner in which he was first promised captaincy in absence of Laxmi Ratan Shukla (against Karnataka in Mysore) and then denied.

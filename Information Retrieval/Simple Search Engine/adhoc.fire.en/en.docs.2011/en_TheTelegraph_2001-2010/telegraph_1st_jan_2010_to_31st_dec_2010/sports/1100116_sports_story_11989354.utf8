The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alonso is bullish despite crash
                                                                                                                       7                                        Alonso is bullish despite crash
            Tom Cary            Fernando Alonso                           
	Madonna di Campiglio: Fernando Alonso suffered his first high-speed crash as a Ferrari driver this week. The Spaniard slid 40 metres down a black run on his backside, skis and poles exploding all around him.         
	The episode had a delicious irony in that the slope was named after the man whose ski boots he has been brought in to fill; a man he thought he had seen off when he beat him to the 2005 and 2006 world titles; a man who has returned, like the ghost of Christmas past, to drive for Mercedes this season: Michael Schumacher.         
	Alonso, though, emerged from the crash smiling. Far from cowed by the spectre of Schumacher, he told us the 41 year-olds comeback was motivating him. When Michael left it was not the same beating the others, he said.         
	Besides, after a poisonous season with McLaren and two horrendous years back at Renault, which ended under a Flavio Briatore-sized cloud, Alonso is the one dressed in red now. It suits him.         
	He has been in relaxed form, joking with his new teammates, showing off his fluent Italian and joining in enthusiastically with all the activities at Ferraris annual pre-season shindig in the Italian Dolomites.         
	He spoke warmly of the Ferrari family and repeated his intention to see out his career with the Scuderia. Having tasted the good life, who can blame him?         
	Even mention of Lewis Hamiltons recent claim that he blew away the Spaniard when the pair were teammates in 2007  they finished the season level on points  failed to upset Alonsos happy disposition. If I have to answer to all that he says I would use up too much time, he shrugged. McLaren, though, are a good team and when I went there it was a nice moment for me.         
	Not, you suspect, quite like this. Alonsos beef with McLaren stemmed chiefly from Ron Dennis and his cold management style, so it is safe to assume that he is more comfortable with this Latin love-in where drivers are free to risk life and limb speeding down black pistes.         
	Alonso is widely regarded as the most complete driver on the grid; as fast as Hamilton and less prone to error. Ferrari are the best backed, most prestigious marque in F1. Ergo, it would appear a match made in heaven.         
	But there are those who believe the relationship may sour prematurely. In Woking, Alonso is viewed as petulant and divisive. He is also followed by a whiff of controversy; like Schumacher, someone prepared to win at all costs.         
	He has been variously accused of blackmailing Ron Dennis, deliberately ruining Hamiltons qualifying session in Budapest in 2007 and having prior knowledge of teammate Nelson Piquet Jrs intention to crash his car in Singapore in 2008.         
	He is also tainted by his relationship with Briatore, the man who allegedly ordered that crash and who may or may not still manage Alonso. Our relationship is very personal, Alonso cryptically said when asked about it. I prefer not to say.         
	Whatever happens in the Ferrari-Alonso love affair, it has certainly got off on the right foot. You almost believed him when he said he didnt mind equal treatment with Felipe Massa. I just dont want to be No.2, which happened for sure (at McLaren) in 2007, Alonso smiled.         
	With that he returned to the slopes and another crack at the Schumacher Streif, adding that he wished now he had taken lessons when he started learning three years ago.

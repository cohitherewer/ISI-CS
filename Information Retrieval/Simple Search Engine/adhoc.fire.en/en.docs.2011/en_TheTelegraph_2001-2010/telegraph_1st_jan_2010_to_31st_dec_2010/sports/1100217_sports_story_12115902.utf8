            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council pitch consultant Andy Atkinson said that it was going to be a challenge to get the Wankhede ground ready in time for the 2011 World Cup but was confident of accomplishing the task.         
	Its going to be a bit of a challenge We have a lot to do in a short time, Atkinson, who was at the Wankhede on Tuesday, on a stock-taking visit, said.         
	The Wankhede, which is to host the final of the 2011 World Cup, is undergoing renovation.         
	With construction work still going on and cranes still standing in the middle of the ground, it would be a race against time for Atkinson and Co. to get the ground ready for the quadrennial event. The ground staff would be handed over the centre square at the end of February, following which preparation of the pitch would begin. The work on the outfield would commence after the monsoon.         
	The whole process has to be completed by October 31, the cut-off date for all hosting centres, so that theres enough time for the authorities to test the suitability of the track hosting at least two one-day Internationals.         
	Atkinson said 12 months were enough to get a new pitch ready but was wary about the south-west monsoon. We are going to prepare two pitches  And we are looking for a September finish, he said.         
	We have seen grounds being built a lot quicker My concern is how wet the monsoon is going to be. We have to plant the seeds before the monsoon and let the monsoon help it grow. But we have 18 weeks after the end of the monsoon. Thats more than enough time.

	Chennai: Commonwealth Games medal prospect, young Tamil Nadu swimmer M.B.Balakrishnan was Sunday severely injured when some unidentified persons attacked him here.         
	The incident also put a question mark on the promising swimmers participation in the October 3 to 14 Commonwealth Games to be held in Delhi.         
	The 21-year-old, a backstroke specialist, was on his way to the swimming pool for a morning practice session when he was intercepted by four unidentified men and attacked with logs and sharp objects, police said.         
	The assailants fled when the local people started rushing to the spot. A severely wounded Balakrishnan was then rushed to a private hospital, police added.         
	A gold medallist in the 11th South Asian Games in Dhaka earlier this year, Balakrishnan is a student of the Guindy Engineering College. He had also bettered 50m and 100m backstroke records in the 64th Senior National Aquatic Championship held in Jaipur last month.         
	A case has been registered and police has initiated investigation.         
	Balakrishnans coach Chandrasekar rued that the swimmer might not be able to participate in the Commonwealth Games since only 28 days are left for the event.

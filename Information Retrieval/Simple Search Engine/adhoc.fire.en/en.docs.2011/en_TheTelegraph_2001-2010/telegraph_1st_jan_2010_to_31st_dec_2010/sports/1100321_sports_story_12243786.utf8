            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	The Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly admitted that not bowling well in the first 10 overs was a key factor for their second loss on the trot in the third edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	The Knights lost by 34 runs to the Rajasthan Royals, for whom it was the first victory in four matches in this edition of the Twenty20 tournament.         
	The first 10 overs werent the best. We didnt bowl in the right areas Probably the first time we didnt bowl well in that period. It was difficult to grip the ball It was very hot out there. But overall, we didnt play well, the former India captain said.         
	Sourav, who scored a 29-ball 33 in a losing cause, added that to be successful in this format, his team would require to handle pressure better. We just have to win, have to play well... Just got to deal with the pressure. The moment you step out on to the field, till the last ball, its all about pressure, said the left-handed batsman.         
	We have the potential... We just have to put it together. We need to bowl well and need to show more intensity on the field, Sourav added.

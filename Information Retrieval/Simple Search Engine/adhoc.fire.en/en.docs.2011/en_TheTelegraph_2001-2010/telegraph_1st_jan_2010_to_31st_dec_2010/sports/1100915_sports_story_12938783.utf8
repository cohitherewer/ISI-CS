            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Yet another BCCI disciplinary committee hearing into suspended IPL commissioner Lalit Modis alleged financial irregularities yielded precious little on Tuesday.         
	However, the three-member panel comprising Arun Jaitley, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Chirayu Amin said Wednesdays hearing would be the last chance for Modis lawyers to cross examine the witnesses.         
	It is made clear that this is the last opportunity to Mr. Modi for cross examination of these witnesses, the disciplinary committee said in a statement. The hearing will resume at 2 pm on Wednesday.         
	Three of the witnesses are from England, while IPL CEO Sundar Raman has also arrived from South Africa, where the Champions League is on.         
	Earlier, Modis lawyers objected to the panel meeting at Scindias residence, a decision taken after the minister was laid low by high fever . They felt convening the meeting there amounted to prejudicing Modis defence and present a fait accompli.         
	Denying the allegation, the BCCI said it was not even aware of the situation until Scindia himself called up Jaitley. It was committees suggestion that the venue may be shifted to Scindias residence (in view of his running high fever) which is centrally located in Delhi         
	The statement also said: Modis advocate Shailesh Mendon appeared before the panel along with two of his colleague advocates and requested that the matter be taken up tomorrow (Wednesday).         
	Menon contends that the hearing before the Bombay High Court has been concluded and the writ petition is fixed for orders September 15 morning. There are four witnesses present. Three of them have come from England and one from South Africa.         
	While considering the request of Mendon, we suggested that we can resume the hearing at 9.00 a.m. so that the witnesses who have come from England could be examined expeditiously and these witnesses do not have to come back again, the statement added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy we got Bond: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      Happy we got Bond: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly believes that New Zealand speedster Shane Bond will have a lot to contribute during the upcoming third edition of Indian Premier League.         
	The former Indian captain also feels that Bonds price of $750,000 is totally justified.         
	When we went to the auction, we had a clear idea about what kind of player we wanted. Our priority was a pacer, someone who can frighten the batsmen with sheer pace. As you never know how the bidding turns out to be, we had three choices  Shane Bond, Kemar Roach and Wayne Parnell. We are very happy that we have got Bond, Ganguly told the reporters on Wednesday.         
	The skipper is hopeful that Bond will forge a successful partnership with Ishant Sharma.

                                                                                                                       7                                      3-0 victory augurs well, says Smith
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa finished the ODI series against Zimbabwe on a confident note with a 272-run victory at Sahara Willowmoore Park on Friday, as briefly reported in Saturdays CM edition.         
	From a perspective of the series starting against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates next week the Proteas could not have asked for a better performance as they clinched a 3-0 series win.         
	The target of 400 was always likely to be beyond the reach of Zimbabwe but Graeme Smith nevertheless expressed his satisfaction with the bowling and fielding departments.         
	It is easy to relax when you set that sort of target but the bowlers and fielders set their own standards and that augurs well, he said.

	Abu Dhabi: Abdul Razzaq gave Pakistan a welcome on-field respite with a stunning, unbeaten century to set up a dramatic one-wicket victory over South Africa in the second one-day International, on Sunday.         
	The ICC earlier confirmed suspensions on three Pakistan players over spot-fixing allegations and the team looked to be struggling as they chased a formidable target of 287.         
	But Razzaq launched an astonishing assault to smash an unbeaten 109 from just 72 balls and seal the victory with one ball to spare.         
	Razzaq struck seven fours and 10 sixes to rescue Pakistan from 228 for seven, adding 32 for the final wicket with Shoaib Akhtar who faced just a single delivery.         
	South Africas huge total of 286 for eight was built around a second century by 25-year-old left-hander Colin Ingram in just his fifth match and featured brisk half-centuries from opener Hashim Amla and middle-order batsman JP Duminy.         
	Ingram started slowly on an awkward pitch, and was given a life at 54 when Zulqarnain Haider missed a straightforward stumping chance. The southpaw, however, grew in confidence to reach exactly 100 from 119 deliveries, with 10 fours and a six.         
	Pakistan seemed certain to pay the price for a pedestrian start during which they crawled to 135 for five in the 30th over, before Razzaq rewrote the script and blasted 14 runs from the final over to square the series at 1-1.

	New Delhi: It has been a wretched year so far for Daniel Chopra but having recovered from an elbow injury and worked out the shortcomings in his game, the Indo-Swede Wednesday said his excitement is fairly high as he prepares to tee off at the Hero Honda Indian Open, here, Thursday.         
	I am trying to keep the expectations low but my excitement is fairly high, said the 36-year-old, who reached New Delhi only this morning after having problems in securing his visa.         
	Nothing other than winning the Indian Open would salvage the year for me. If I dont win here then I hope it would be a stepping stone to something better, he added.         
	On the course conditions, Chopra said, I have grown up playing here. So, I know the course and its excellent.           (PTI)

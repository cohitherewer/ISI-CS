                                                                                                                       7                                      Wawrinka gets a wild card
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Last years finalist Stanislas Wawrinka has received a wild card entry, for the 2011 Aircel Chennai Open, according to a media release.         
	The Swiss world No. 21, who had earlier decided to take the first week of the year off, thought otherwise and was thus awarded one of the three wild cards on offer.         
	Confirming his participation, Wawrinka said, I am looking forward to the meet. I have great memories of the tournament I hope to be in the final again and am looking forward to competing in front of the Chennai crowd         
	The other two wild card entries will be decided soon. Normally, two wild cards are given to Indian players, and Sanam Singh is one of the strong contenders this year.

 - Hockey India wants new coach to have a four-year term                  Dhanraj Pillay                           
	New Delhi: Harendra Singh might have stepped down as the national hockey coach after Indias unexpected loss in the Asian Games semi-finals but he, along with former captain Dhanraj Pillay, has applied for the top job of the national team.         
	The newly-formed development committee of Hockey India, headed by former India captain Pargat Singh, met here Wednesday for the first time and discussed at length, the various aspects related to the game, including prospective candidates for the post of the national teams coach. The post has been lying vacant after Spaniard Jose Brasas contract expired last month.         
	According to a highly placed source in Hockey India, the development committee has so far received 10 applications from within the country for the vacant position and has also approached the International Hockey Federation (FIH) to suggest some foreign candidates name.         
	The development committee met for the first time discussed in length all issues, including that of coaches. The committee will meet here again January 5, the source said.         
	The committee has so far received 10 applications for the coachs post. Among Indians, Pillay, Harendra and Clarence Lobo are the notable names who have applied. They are discussing every angle and have also approached the FIH for more suggestions, especially on foreign candidates, he added.         
	The source also said that the committee was of the view that giving the next coach a long tenure will enable him to build a team for the future.         
	The committee members have discussed to give ample time to the new coach. They want at least a four-year term for him, he said.         
	He also added the entire selection process of the national team coach would be finished by January next year. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kevin: I set   myself high standards
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kevin: I set   myself high standards
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	Kevin Pietersen said he had endured tough times over the past 18 months and the relief when he reached his century and double hundred Sunday was there for all to see.         
	Pietersens unbeaten 213 was his first three figure score in Test cricket for England for 19 months, a lean period which led to him being dropped from the one-day team at the end of last summer.         
	England will be hoping this is a career defining innings for Pietersen and finally puts to bed a dismal period which began with his dismissal as captain nearly two years ago.         
	It has not been the best time, he said. You go through your career and have good stuff and bad stuff. I have had a lot of good stuff fortunately but a little bit of bad stuff. Fortunately that has gone now and I look forward.         
	I love the big occasion and challenging myself against the best players in the world. It has been pretty tough over the last 18 months and this is a challenge for me to really look forward to and I love the fact it is going so well out here. I set myself high standards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheers devastating spell destroys Bangla
                                                                                                                       7                                        Zaheers devastating spell destroys Bangla

	Dhaka: Zaheer Khan produced a devastating spell to decimate Bangladesh with a career-best seven for 87 as India crushed the hosts by 10 wickets in the second Test, and clinch the two-match series 2-0 here Wednesday.         
	After putting up stiff resistance Tuesday, Bangladesh succumbed to a spectacular batting collapse in Wednesdays first session, with Zaheer wreaking havoc with reverse swing.         
	Resuming on 228 for three, there was no hint of the hosts impending doom as they saw through the first 19 overs without any hiccup.         
	Harbhajan Singh earned the breakthrough for India, removing overnight batsman Shahadat Hossain, but it was Zaheer who broke the back of Bangaldesh batting, claiming three wickets in fours balls in the penultimate over before lunch as the home side collapsed for 312.         
	It was a dramatic collapse by the home side, which lost their final seven wickets for just 22 runs. Needing just two runs to complete the formality for a facile win, neither Virender Sehwag not Gautam Gambhir could open their account as Bangladesh conceded two bye runs to lose the Test with more than four sessions to spare.         
	Zaheer, who was adjudged both Man of the Match and Man of the Series, became only the fourth Indian pacer to take 10 wickets in an away Test. With three wickets in Bangladeshs first innings, Zaheer ended the match with career-best figures of 10 for 149, eclipsing his nine for 134 that came against England, in Nottingham, in 2007.         
	Harbhajan drew first blood after the drinks break in the first session, when Amit Mishra made amends for his earlier lapse and caught Shahadat (40). Mishra had dropped the batsman when he was on 33.         
	Nine balls after Shahadats departure, Mohammed Ashraful (25) followed. Pragyan Ojha, who till then looked pedestrian, got the ball to bounce and turn, and the batsman offered an outside edge which nestled into Mahendra Singh Dhonis gloves.         
	Two overs later, captain Shakib-al Hasan holed out to Gautam Gambhir at square leg while trying to clear the boundary off Ojha.         
	This was followed by a six-over lull before Zaheer sent back three batsmen in four balls to leave Bangladesh in tatters. Zaheer first had Raqibul Hasan for five.

            HONKY DORY                            
	The Indian Derby winner Jacqueline is going to have another showdown with Becket, who is hoping to avenge his Derby defeat, on Sunday, in the 2,400m Vandrevalla Foundation Indian Turf Invitation Cup. Battlelines have been drawn as the nine-horse field faces the starter for the biggest honour on the turf  the champion of champions crown.           
	Jaquelines connections are, however, quite sanguine about the fillys ability who has always managed to produce a little extra effort in crunch situations. Trainer S. Padmanabhan, on the other hand, feels Becket has improved since his Derby defeat and a different strategy may help the horse achieve the goal. Suraj Narredu partners the horse on this occasion. Yet, it may pay to follow Jacqueline (R. Hughes-up) who has not tasted defeat in her last six starts. Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaiser says it looks bleak for Germany
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kaiser says it looks bleak for Germany
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                  Beckenbauer      
	German legend Franz Beckenbauer believes his country do not have what it takes to win the World Cup.         
	Germanys preparations have been hit by the injuries to captain Michael Ballack, goalkeeper Rene Adler, defender Heiko Westermann and midfielders Simon Rolfes and Christian Traesch.         
	Without Michael Ballack, it will be difficult. Our team is weakened, he told a German newspaper. Well have to work hard just to reach the semi-finals.         
	Were never been artists on the pitch like the Brazilians, added Beckenbauer, who led his country to World Cup glory as captain in 1974 and then coach in 1990.         
	Despite the absentees, coach Joachim Loews re-organised side hit back from a goal down to beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 3-1 in a warm-up match in Frankfurt on Thursday.         
	We still have some time before our opening game against Australia (June 13) and I am not thinking yet of the starting eleven, Loew said.         
	Despite hard training in the past two weeks we were able to step up the pace in our last practice match and I am pleased with that.         
	And, the new German captain Philipp Lahm is urging the new generation to make a grand entrance as they begin their World Cup assault.         
	Loew is taking the youngest German squad to a World Cup for 76 years, with an average age of just under 25.         
	But boosted by the experience of Bastian Schweinsteiger, striker Miroslav Klose and defenders Arne Friedrich and Per Mertesacker, Lahm believes the next crop of Germany stars are capable of stepping up.         
	Our generation is now ready, said Lahm, who has been handed the captains armband after Ballacks ankle injury last month ruled him out.         
	I had a good feeling before the 2006 World Cup finals, but I have an even better feeling now.         
	Lahm scored the equaliser in the 3-1 win against Bosnia-Herzegovina while his deputy Schweinsteiger also netted two penalties.         
	We produced good performances. We created many chances but unfortunately we didnt use them all, Lahm said. We are going to South Africa with a very good feeling.

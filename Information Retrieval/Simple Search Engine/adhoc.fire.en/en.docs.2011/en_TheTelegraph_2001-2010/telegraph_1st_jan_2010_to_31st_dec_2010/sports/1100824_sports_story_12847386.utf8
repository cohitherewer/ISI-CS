  - We are sad that our marriage is over, say the couple in a statement             Tiger and Elin: During happier times                           
	Miami: Tiger Woods, the worlds No. 1 golfer, and his Swedish wife Elin Nordegren said on Monday they had divorced following the sex scandal that embroiled the golfing star late last year.         
	We are sad that our marriage is over and we wish each other the very best for the future, the joint statement said.         
	The divorce was granted in Bay County Circuit Court in Panama City, Florida, about 375 miles away from their Isleworth home outside Orlando.         
	The couple had married in October 2004 in Barbados and have a 3-year-old daughter, Sam, and a 19-month-old son, Charlie.         
	While we are no longer married, we are the parents of two wonderful children and their happiness has been, and will always be, of paramount importance to both of us.         
	Once we came to the decision that our marriage was at an end, the primary focus of our amicable discussions has been to ensure their future well-being, it said.         
	The weeks and months ahead will not be easy for them as we adjust to a new family situation, which is why our privacy must be a principal concern.         
	Nordegrens lawyer said no information about the terms of their settlement would be released amid reports that Elin, 30 could receive anywhere between $100million and 500million in assets.         
	A magazine said the couple had agreed to share custody of their two children.         
	A November 27 car crash near Woodss home touched off a global scandal, leading to his admission of adultery and putting his golf career on hold while he fought his own personal demons.         
	He took a break from the game for several months and received therapy at a sex clinic before returning in March for the first Major of the year, the US Masters at the Augusta National Golf Club .         
	Woods didnt win but came in fourth as he returned in a comfortable setting where he has captured four titles, his first in 1997 being the first major crown won by a black golfer.         
	Since then, however, a string of performances ranging from mediocre to poor have seen many question whether the 14-time Major winner will ever return to his old, dominating form.         
	Woods is to play this week at The Barclays, where he needs a good performance to extend his PGA Tour season and try to show he is worth picking for the Ryder Cup.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 18-game ban for Anelka 
                                                                                                                       7                                      18-game ban for Anelka 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Nicolas Anelka has been banned for 18 games by the French Football Federation (FFF) for his role in the player revolt which ruined Frances World Cup campaign.         
	The ban, which will effectively end Anelkas international career, was followed by further punishments for World Cup captain Patrice Evra (five games), Franck Ribery (three games) and Jeremy Toulalan (one game). Eric Abidal, who was also involved in the FFFs disciplinary hearing, escaped without sanction. Ribery and Anelka were not present at the hearing.         
	France were eliminated at the group stage in South Africa following a bitter row which followed a half-time clash between Anelka and coach Raymond Domenech during the 2-0 defeat against Mexico.         
	Anelka was eventually sent home, which prompted the remainder of Frances squad to boycott a training session at the tournament in protest. Their actions horrified the French public and drew condemnation from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other political leaders.         
	That Anelka did not attend Tuesdays hearing also suggests that the striker who has only 14 goals for France, never really living up to expectations, has accepted that his international days are over.         
	We wanted Anelkas sanction to set an example, disciplinary commission president Jean Mazzella said.         
	The players have already been punished financially, with the federation withholding their World Cup bonuses. But hardliners like Lilian Thuram, a former international and a member of the FFF council, said Evra should never play for France again.         
	The players seemed sincerely sorry for what happened, said former France team director Jean-Louis Valentin, who resigned when the players refused to take part in a training session and, instead, sat in the team bus under the eye of cameras from around the world. I felt they were very affected by that event. Its obvious that if they had to do it again, they wouldnt do it, Valentin said.         
	Domenech was among those who attended the hearing, along with then-FFF president Jean-Pierre Escalettes and assistant coach Alain Boghossian.         
	Valentin, who attended the hearing as a witness and was the only one to comment later, expressed a clear measure of sympathy for what he thought were chastened players. As far as he is concerned, he said, everybody has the right to a second chance.         
	He said that dialogue within the group called to testify was excellent and that Domenech was dignified.         
	We talked again about the events. In some ways, there was a very good dialogue that was, at times, moving, Valentin said. Everybody was aware that there was a collective mess-up, and now we have to turn the page and move on.

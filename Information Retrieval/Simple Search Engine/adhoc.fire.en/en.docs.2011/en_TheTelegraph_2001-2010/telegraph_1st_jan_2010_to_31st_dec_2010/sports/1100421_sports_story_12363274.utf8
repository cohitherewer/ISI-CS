The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pressure on MI: Kumble
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pressure on MI: Kumble
 Royal Challengers Bangalore hope to get Sachin Tendulkar out early            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid in Mumbai, on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble on Tuesday said at a media conference though his side had lost the home advantage, the pressure would be on the Mumbai Indians.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Being in the business end of the IPL         
	Semifinal means a lot. Not just for the youngsters but for all of us. In this IPL, our goal was to get to the semis and we have achieved that. From here on, whoever does well on the particular day wins. Its two games from here and we want to do well.         
	Stopping the in-form Mumbai Indians         
	Mumbai are playing at home, they didnt probably expect it. They have had a good run, so the pressure is on them. Its a must-win game for all of us. We would like to take advantage of that. We will take confidence from having played here (in the first leg of the league stage) and also of having played in the semifinals before. But we want to concentrate on our game rather than worry about how Mumbai has come into the semis.         
	Plans for Sachin         
	Sachin is a big player. Whether it is India or Mumbai or Mumbai Indians, as an opposition you look to get him out early. Hopefully we can do that. We have seen through the tournament his ability as not just a captain but also a player and batsman. We are aware of that. Its important to execute the plans and look to dominate the full 40 overs instead of worrying about the individual.         
	The pitch         
	The wicket is fresh because only two matches have been played here. It looks like a sporting wicket. It will be a good game of cricket. Hopefully we can execute what we had prepared.         
	Making bowling changes in T20         
	You need to think on your feet. You have to execute your plans, no matter what you think off the field. One batsman or bowler can change the game on a given situation. Thats the beauty of T20. As a captain you have to go with your gut feeling at that particular time.         
	On match-fixing allegations...         
	Dont think I cant answer much. What concerns is what happens on the pitch. As players we need to ensure we play to our potential.         
	Playing the match against Mumbai Indians on Saturday after bomb blasts         
	I didnt have to persuade anyone.         
	On losing home advantage...         
	Its not in our control. Home crowd would have been great for us. But I am sure, fans of Bangalore and Royal Challengers would be rooting for us.         
	Experience of having played in semis         
	Dont know. Its not easy to be consistent over a period of six weeks. To qualify we had to win seven games. This time seven games but (usually) at least eight games you have to win. We want to go out and express ourselves. Its a short tournament from here on. Its two games and you win the tournament.

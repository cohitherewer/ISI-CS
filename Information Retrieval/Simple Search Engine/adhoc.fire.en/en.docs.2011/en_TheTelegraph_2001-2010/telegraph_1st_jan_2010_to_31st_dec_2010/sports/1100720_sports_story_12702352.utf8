  - Australians flock to buy Ashes tickets       Derek Pringle            Ricky Ponting                                 
	Ashes tickets for the winter series in Australia are selling well, with many of the best seats and corporate packages already snapped up even before the tickets have been offered for general sale.         
	The same thing happened four years ago, only for England not to turn up apart from at Adelaide. Surprisingly, demand this time seems driven not by collective amnesia, or even the likelihood that England might be better equipped to win at the Waca or SCG.         
	No, the expectation of a close and exciting series is because Ricky Pontings side look the most vulnerable since the one beaten by Mike Gattings tourists in 1986-87, the last time Australia lost an Ashes series at home.         
	That might seem a bold statement given Pontings side have just beaten Pakistan  a team, if not an unity, of talents  a record 13 successive times with power to add to that when the teams meet again in Headingley this week.         
	Yet there are clues that all is not as it once was, after their latest win against them came largely through the back door, following the bowling feats of Marcus North and Shane Watson, who shared 11 wickets in the match.         
	Australia needed their pair of bit-part bowlers to perform largely because the frontline ones did not, something that never happened in the glorious decade prior to 2005.         
	Perhaps it was just Lords, with its unique slope, that undermined the left-arm pacer, Mitchell Johnson and Doug Bollinger, but they looked distinctly anaemic, and that against a Pakistan batting line-up forever hovering, like Dr Strangelove, on the brink of pressing the self-destruct button.         
	Ben Hilfenhaus, who injured his left shoulder diving in the field at Lords, was reliable but hardly frightening, unlike Shaun Tait, a man drafted in for the one-day series but who remains tantalisingly unavailable for Tests.         
	If Hilfenhaus is the best Australia can offer  and he might be if Johnson goes missing again and Peter Siddle is slow to recover from the stress fracture in his back  Englands batsmen need not lose too much sleep.         
	The main threat to Andrew Strauss and his top order could come from spin with Steve Smith and Nathan Hauritz  though surely not North  supplying the revs.         
	Australia have rarely played two frontline spinners since Tim May retired in the mid-1990s and ironically, North probably stands in the way of that now. Until his six for 55 at Lords, Norths place was under challenge from Smith, an ebullient talent whose batting is actually better than his leg-spin, though that is not too bad for someone with experience of just 15 first-class matches.         
	When Australia were the pre-eminent side in Test cricket they attacked with the bat and nagged away with the ball. With a reliable and talented middle order populated by the likes of Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist, their early batting could afford to be aggressive, and was.         
	As an opener, Shane Watson tries to uphold the menace of Matthew Hayden but is not as gifted, while Ponting has struggled to counter-attack as he once did, averaging 38 (his overall Test average is 54) since his hundred in the opening Ashes Test at Cardiff last year.         
	Ponting became the second highest run-scorer in Test cricket at Lords, passing Brian Laras 11,953 to sit in Sachin Tendulkars slipstream. But if his batting appears to be on the slide, his captaincy has been invigorated by the challenge of having to dismiss teams with a combination of speculation and strategy, and not just tossing the ball to Shane Warne or Glenn McGrath.         
	The Ashes are just four months away and Salman Butt, Pakistans newly anointed captain, can do England a favour by staunching his teams run of defeats when the second neutral Test between them gets under way in Leeds on Wednesday.         
	Nothing convinces a team so much as victory and since losing the Ashes at the Oval, Australia have won eight of their nine Tests.         
	Butts first move as captain has been to call on the selectors to stick with the youngsters here on tour, after rumours began to circulate of a recall for former captains Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan.         
	The average age of the side is under 25 so to have this potential is important, Butt said after his appointment as captain was confirmed.         
	We have to be patient because experience does not have any short cuts. If we play this unit for the next eight to 10 months, you will see a different team.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

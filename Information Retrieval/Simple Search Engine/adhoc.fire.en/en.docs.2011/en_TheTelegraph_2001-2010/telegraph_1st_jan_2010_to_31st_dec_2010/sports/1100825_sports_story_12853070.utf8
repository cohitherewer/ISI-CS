	Mumbai: The Indian squad will have a short camp before the start of their two-Test series against Australia from October 1, according to reliable sources in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The players will undergo a short camp, may be for 2-3 days. The venue and other details will be finalised soon, the source said.         
	The official virtually dismissed reports which suggested that Dharamsala will be the likely venue.         
	For logistic difficulties, we cannot hold the camp there, they said.         
	The Aussies are scheduled to arrive 10 days prior to the commencement of the series, indicating how serious they are in confronting the hosts who are still the top-ranked Test team according to ICC rankings.         
	Ricky Ponting and his men are slated to reach Delhi on September 21.         
	They would have a four-day practice session that would be followed by a three-day warm-up tie in Chandigarh from September 25-27.         
	After three more days of rest and practice, the Aussies would plunge into the Test series starting from October 1 in Mohali. The second Test will be held in Bangalore from October 9-13.

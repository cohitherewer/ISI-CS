The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salgaocar go past Chirag 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Salgaocar go past Chirag 
                      
	Margao: Salgaocar Sports Club got the better of a fighting Chirag United 4-3 to score their second straight win in the second round of the I-League here.         
	 Salgaocar, who led 2-0 at half time, scored through Gilbert Oliveira (two goals), Ryuji Sueoka and Anthony Barbosa at the match played at Nehru Stadium in Fatorda here.         
	Chirag United scored through Joshimar, Denson Devadas and Junior Elijah.         
	Salgaocar, who posted an easy win over Viva Kerala in their opening encounter a few days ago, played a fast-paced game and took lead in the first minute through Oliveira.         
	They increased the lead in the 13th minute via Sueoka. Chirag reduced the margin in the stoppage time through Martins.         
	 The second half was more lively and saw a lot of goal bound moves. Salgaocar scored again in the 49th minute through Oliveira.         
	 Chirag came back strongly to score in the 62nd minute via Devdas. Just when Chirag were trying to consolidate, Barbosa dealt them a blow when his shot found the net.         
	Oliveira was declared the Man of the Match.         
	In Gurgaon, Churchill Brothers rode on Okolie Odafes 65th minute strike to salvage a 1-1 draw against JCT in their second round I-League match at the Tao Devi Lal Stadium here Tuesday.         
	JCT, after the shocking defeat against HAL in their opening fixture, looked on course to register their first win after Balwant Singh put them in lead with a 37th minute strike.         
	Odafe, however, had other ideas and struck the equaliser 19 minutes into the second half.         
	The Punjab outfit looked positive from the word go and the aggressive approach paid off when Balwant headed in Amandeeep Singhs assist from the right. It was Saran Singh who did the spadework and gave the ball to Amandeep.         
	Odafe, who helped his team come from behind in their opening fixture against defending champions Dempo, did a repeat when he headed in a corner.           (AGENCIES)

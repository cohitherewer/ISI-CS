	Milan: Inter Milan manager Rafael Benitez could be in danger of losing his job if the struggling European champions dont beat Dutch side FC Twente on Wednesday.         
	Hit by a series of injuries to key players, Inter have fallen nine points behind city rivals and AC Milan in Serie A and trail Tottenham on head-to-head goal difference in their Champions League group.         
	Inter suffered a humiliating 2-1 loss to Chievo Verona on Sunday, extending their winless streak in the Italian league to four matches. The manager and the squad need to understand that the Champions League match is very important, and that a great match is required, Inter president Massimo Moratti said. Whether theyre tired or not they need to play with a lot of anger because if not we cant go on like this.         
	Samuel Eto was handed a three-match ban in the Italian league for head-butting a Chievo Verona opponent at the weekend, but he is free to play in Europe.           (AGENCIES)

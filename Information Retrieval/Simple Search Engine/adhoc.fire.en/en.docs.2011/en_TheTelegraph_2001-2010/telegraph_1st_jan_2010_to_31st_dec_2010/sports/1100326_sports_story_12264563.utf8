The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir and Nehra put the selectors in a fix
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gambhir and Nehra put the selectors in a fix
    - Manish Pandey in the running; Vinay Kumar dark horse           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gautam Gambhir                                 
	Chandigarh: The national selectors arent exactly clear how to go about their job of picking the Team India XV for the World T20s third edition.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) will be meeting in Mumbai on Friday afternoon.         
	That Gautam Gambhir and Ashish Nehra didnt play for the Delhi DareDevils today (Thursday) either, has confused things... The selectors are in the dark... Its an unusual situation, for both would otherwise be certainties, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Clearly, even the ayurvedic treatment in Sri Lanka doesnt seem to have had the desired effect. Gambhir suffered a hamstring problem; Nehra a rib injury.         
	Should Gambhir and Nehra have to be left out of the April 30-May 16 tournament, then Manish Pandey will surely be assured of a place and, possibly, Ranganath Vinay Kumar.                 Ashish Nehra   
	Both are uncapped and have been making an impact in the ongoing IPL.         
	The good news, of course, is that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has recovered. His problem was limited to the right arm.         
	If Gambhir and Nehra do get picked, as the World T20 is more than a month away, then the squad may include the following 13 more: Virender Sehwag (vice-captain), Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli/Pandey; Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja; Dhoni (captain), Dinesh Karthik; Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar, Munaf Patel/Ishant Sharma.         
	Rookie Kumar will then be the dark horse.         
	The tournaments inaugural edition, in 2007, was won by India. Edition No.2, held last summer, was pocketed by Pakistan.

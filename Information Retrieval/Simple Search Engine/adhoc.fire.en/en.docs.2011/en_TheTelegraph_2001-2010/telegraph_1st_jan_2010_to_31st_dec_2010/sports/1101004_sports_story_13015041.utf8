The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Foreign contenders to heat up Games 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Foreign contenders to heat up Games

	New Delhi: Though competition in several Commonwealth Games events has seriously been diminished by the no-show of some leading lights, there would still be enough big foreign names involved when some 4,700 athletes from 71 nations finally get down to business for 272 gold medals at stake.         
	Beginning Monday, the toughest battles could be witnessed in swimming. Unlike athletics, where the list of withdrawal has steadily grown ever since Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell decided to skip the Games, swimmers from Australia, England, South Africa and Canada are likely to make it a top class affair at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee aquatic complex.         
	Australia have topped the medals table at 10 of the previous 18 Games, including on home soil in Melbourne, four years ago, when their swimmers contributed 53 of their 222 medals.         
	Aussie challenge will be led by three-time Olympic champion Leisel Jones, who hopes to add to her haul of seven Commonwealth Games titles, but expects a stronger challenge from rival nations this time around.         
	It is certainly not going to be as easy this year as it has been in the past, she said after reaching the capital. The Commonwealth Games this year is actually very strong.         
	In the history of the Commonwealth Games, no athlete has won two events thrice on the trot. Jones, who at both the 2002 Manchester Games and 2006 Melbourne Games had won the 100 metres and 200 metres breaststroke titles besides the 400 metres medley relay, will certainly try to create this mark.         
	The Australian squad also has former 50 metres butterfly world champion Geoff Huegill, who has come out of wilderness to compete at Delhi for his third Commonwealth Games after retiring, following the 2004 Athens Olympics.         
	The 31-year-old won bronze in the 100 metres butterfly at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and won five golds in total at Kuala Lumpur and Manchester.         
	Aussies biggest rivals at the pool will be England, who finished second in the medals table in Melbourne and are hoping to use the Games as a springboard to British Olympic success at London 2012. Beijing Olympic freestyle champion Rebecca Adlington is the most famous name in the England team. Also there is Liam Tancock, the winner of world short course 100 m gold in 2008 and the long course 50 m world title in record time.         
	Athletics has suffered more than most sports from the absence of the big names, with South African Olympic long jump silver medallist Khotso Mokoena being the last one refusing to board a plane last Thursday.         
	In the absence of Mokoena and 800 m world champion Caster Semenya, South Africa will now be looking to Commonwealth champions Elizna Naude (discus), Sunette Viljoen (javelin) and LJ van Zyl (400m hurdles).         
	Australia, who won 16 gold, 12 silver and 13 bronze medals in track and field at Melbourne in 2006, have a 57-strong team, spearheaded by Commonwealth, Olympic and world pole vault champion Steve Hooker.         
	The Australian mens and womens 4x400m relay teams will also defend their titles, while Tamsyn Lewis (4x400m relay) has been picked for her fifth Commonwealth squad.         
	From Kenya, the biggest stars will be Olympic and world 3,000 metres steeplechase champion Brimin Kipruto and Olympic womens 1500m champion Nancy Jebet Lagat.         
	Competition will also be world class in hockey in which Australia are expected to bag their third successive gold medal with India hoping to open the account for the first time. With England and Pakistan also in the fray, no wonder the Dhyan Chand Stadium is expected to go full for most part of the competition.         
	Rugby sevens is one event with a truly top class field and a New Zealand team boasting four All Blacks will need to be at their best to retain the title.

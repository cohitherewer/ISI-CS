The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kochi all set to make it
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kochi all set to make it
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Calcutta/Mumbai: With well-placed sources of The Telegraph indicating that Kochis papers are in order, it appears only a formality that the franchise will get the green signal from the IPL governing council when it meets, in Mumbai, on Sunday.         
	We are very positive about the outcome, Satyajit Gaikwad, chief executive officer of Rendezvous Sports World Pvt Ltd, promoters of the franchise, said on Saturday.         
	The consortium, led by RSWPL, made a dramatic comeback last week, when after months of speculation about their termination due to internal squabbling, they submitted to the BCCI a revised shareholding structure and the formation of a joint-venture company to run the team as required in the Franchise Agreement.         
	Accordingly, RSWPL, bowing to the demands of the investors, agreed to reduce its stakes in the new JV, to be called Kochi IPL Cricket Ltd., to 10 per cent from the earlier 25 per cent free equity.         
	RSWPLs controlling stakes had been a source of discontent to the other investors  Anchor Earth, Parinee Developers, Film Wave Combine, and Shyam Estates  which prevented them from forming a JV despite two showcause notices from the BCCI.         
	The new agreement was submitted in time before a 30-day termination notice expired on November 27. Subsequently, the IPL governing council that met the following day, deferred the final decision on the matter by a week.         
	The meeting would also discuss the ramifications of the stay on the termination of Rajasthan Royals given by a Bombay high court-appointed arbitrator. It remains to be seen whether the Council decides to postpone the January 8-9 fresh players .

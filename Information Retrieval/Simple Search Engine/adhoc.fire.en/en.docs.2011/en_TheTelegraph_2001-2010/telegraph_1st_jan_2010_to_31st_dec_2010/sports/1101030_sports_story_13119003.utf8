The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Life will be flat without dreams, says Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        Life will be flat without dreams, says Sachin
  - Batting maestro yearns for the next level
                    Sachin Tendulkar                
	London: Sachin Tendulkar has been hailed as one of the most accomplished players in world cricket but the maestro still yearns to reach the next level as a batsman.         
	Sachin, who made history earlier this month by becoming the first batsman to score 14,000 runs in Test cricket, says his desire to improve remains as intense as it has ever been.         
	Im really focusing now on how I can get to the next level as a batsman. How can I get even more competitive? How can I get even more consistent? How can I get better? Sachin said, according to the extract of an interview to a British newspaper to be published on Saturday.         
	Instead of struggling for form with advancing age, the 37-year-old has had the most prolific year of his Test career in 2010 and he insists rather than considering retirement he has many more goals to fulfil.         
	Life will be flat without dreams. I think its really important to dream  and then to chase those dreams. I really believe in this because its this dreaming that makes me work so hard. I want to continue doing that because Ive worked very hard the last couple of years on my batting, he said.         
	(Coach) Gary Kirsten has been instrumental in this. Together weve worked hard in the last couple of years to improve my batting. Hes given me the freedom to express myself, and to pace my innings as I see fit. I can slow down occasionally. Gary has helped me do this and its because hes more a friend than a coach, said Sachin who is just one short of hitting 50 Test centuries.         
	He described 2010 as his sweetest year as he won his first ICCs Player of the Year Award and returned to the top of the world batting rankings for the first time since 2002.         
	In February, Sachin scored centuries in successive Tests against South Africa before becoming the first man to reach 200 in an ODI against the same opponents.         
	Sachin was the highest run scorer in IPL and also made a Test double-hundred against Sri Lanka before his remarkable performances against Australia which saw him reach the 14,000 landmark in the second Test at Bangalore while scoring 214 and an unbeaten 53 to complete Indias 2-0 series victory.         
	The iconic but down to earth batsman conceded that his form subsided a few years ago, prompting critics like Australias Ian Chappell to call for his retirement.         
	There was a little dip, around 2005 and 2006. But I had a lot of injuries then. I had finger and elbow injuries, and then a back injury. All these upper-body injuries may have altered my back-swing a little. But, fortunately, all that is behind me now and Ive been able to put in the hours of practice that I need, he said.         
	Sachin had earlier expressed his desire to win the 20111 World Cup and he said the cricket-mad Indian fans would be demanding to win the prestigious tournament at home.         
	Its going to be massive. Everyone in India is already looking forward to hosting a mega tournament and although people havent started talking yet about 1983 (when India won the World Cup) it will happen soon.         
	Meanwhile, during a promotional in New Delhi on Friday, Sachin said he would like to focus on one series at a time. My immediate focus is on the upcoming New Zealand series and only when that is over, I will start talking about South Africa, he said.

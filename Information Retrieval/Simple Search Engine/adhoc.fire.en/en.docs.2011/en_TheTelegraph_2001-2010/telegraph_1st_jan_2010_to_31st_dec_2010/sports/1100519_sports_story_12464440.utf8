                                                                                                                       7                                      Mercedes not to appeal
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                Schumacher    
	Mercedes have performed a u-turn by deciding not to appeal against Michael Schumachers 20-second penalty in Sundays Monaco Grand Prix, which relegated the seven-time world champion from sixth place to 12th and out of the points.         
	One of the stewards responsible for the decision, 1996 world champion Damon Hill, was bombarded by stinging emails from angry Schumacher fans following the ruling.         
	Mercedes said they were content that this apparent grey area would be discussed at the next meeting of the Sporting Working Group think-tank, adding they had no problem with Schumachers old adversary, Hill, on the stewards panel.         
	(Mercedes) are completely satisfied that the Monaco Grand Prix stewards acted professionally, impartially and properly in this matter, the team said in a statement.

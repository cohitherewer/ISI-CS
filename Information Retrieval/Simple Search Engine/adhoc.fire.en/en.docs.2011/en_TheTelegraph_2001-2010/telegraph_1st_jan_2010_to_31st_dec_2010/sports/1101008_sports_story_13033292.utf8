            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India face an uphill task in a bid to get back to winning ways when they take on higher ranked Vietnam in an international football friendly, in Pune, on Friday.         
	The solitary goal loss to Hong Kong in the match played earlier this week, despite creating chances, has raised questions about Indias ability to finish.         
	Against Vietnam, ranked eight places higher than Hong Kong at 125, India continue their battle with fitness of key players who make up their core composition ahead of their summit, the Asian Cup in January.         
	There is no point risking players in friendly matches, if they have not completely recovered, as it will only be more of a hindrance to our preparations, India coach Bob Houghton said.         
	India are expected to hand midfielder Baldeep Singh his first senior international match. Houghton is hoping to field medios NP Pradeep and Steven Dias for a minimum of 20 minutes during the match, since they are recovering and need to get match fit.         
	Upfront there is no change with Sunil Chetri and Abhishek Yadav being first choice, along with Sushil Kumar Singh. Likewise, the back four  Surkumar Singh, Anwar, Gourmangi Singh, Rahim Nabi  will remain unchanged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kotla pitch is unfit for T20s: Gambhir 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kotla pitch is unfit for T20s: Gambhir 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Kings XI Punjab rsquo;s Yuvraj Singh and Piyush Chawla celebrate the fall of a  Delhi DareDevils wicket as Adrian Barath looks on, in New Delhi, on Sunday.   Picture by Prem Singh      
	New Delhi: A week after Anil Kumble slammed the Kotla pitch as unfit to host T20 matches, it was Gautam Gambhirs turn on Sunday to air similar views about his own home ground.         
	Minutes after the Delhi DareDevils went down to Kings XI Punjab by seven wickets in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match, captain Gambhir dropped a bombshell saying he would prefer playing outside Delhi.         
	I would prefer to play away matches, said Gambhir when asked to comment on the Kotla pitch. The dashing opener was obviously irked by the slow nature of the wicket and said the pitch was totally unfit for hosting T20 matches.         
	You have seen the wicket, it wasnt easy to bat. T20 is a kind of game which is mainly played with fours and sixes. This is a wicket where you need to graft, said Gambhir. He, however, was quick to point out that his team still should have scored in the region of 150 to 170 runs.         
	Pitches are slow here, but we didnt play well at all.         
	We won an important toss and even though we lost wickets, we should have reached around 150-170, especially when we have so many batsmen in our side. Our performance was pretty below par, Gambhir admitted.         
	Asked what really prevented his batsmen from playing their strokes, Gambhir said: Its difficult to play shots and score runs here. You dont get value for your shots; thats the problem.         
	Last Sunday, Anil Kumble, the Royal Challengers Bangalore captain, described the Kotla pitch as the typical Kotla wicket not ideal for playing T20 cricket. His comments earned the wrath of the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) officials and its sports secretary Sunil Dev immediately issued a statement saying Kotla was the most sporting pitch in the IPL.         
	It may be recalled that the Kotla pitch came under scrutiny last December after the fifth and the final one-day International between India and Sri Lanka was abandoned in the 24th over due to dangerous pitch conditions, after the Match Referee Alan Hurst found the surface unfit. Kotla is also serving a one-year ban from hosting international matches.         
	Gambhir also said that his team should go all-out in their remaining matches. We gave up the momentum after losing to the Kolkata Knight Riders and we hate to be in a situation where we have to win two out of three matches. We will have to give everything that we have in the next matches, he said.         
	Piyush Chawla, the Kings XI Punjab bowler, called the victory a highly satisfactory result.         
	DareDevils are one of the top two teams in the tournament. We had earlier beaten Mumbai Indians and now we have won against the DareDevils. Its a great moment.         
	At the moment we are playing for pride and not thinking about the result. Lets hope we win the next two matches also.         
	Kings XI captain Kumar Sangakkara said that he was happy that his team were finally doing justice to their potential.         
	We realised were a good side and we shouldnt be in the position we put ourselves in.         
	We just want to go forward and build on this. Chawlas given a masterclass in leg-spin bowling in this game Irfan (Pathan) and Juan Theron bowled well as well. Ramesh Powar, too, did an excellent job in the Powerplay, the Sri Lankan said.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Md. Sp. hold EB goalless
            A STAFF REPORTER            Alvito DCunha and Eduardo in a scuffle, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Soccer definitely is a body contact game. But on Saturday, a bunch of players at the Salt Lake Stadium redefined the contact bit and added a new dimension to its traditional definition.         
	The CFL Premier division match between East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting ended goalless, but not before a high-voltage action thriller was enacted on the pitch.         
	Till the 83rd minute, the match, best described, was an average show with both sides managing a chance here and a chance there.         
	But then, a chirpy Eduardo, who it seemed had a complain about everything in the universe, chose saliva instead of words as, during a heated argument resulting from a foul, he spat at East Bengals Uga Okpara. And that triggered off hell.         
	East Bengals Alvito DCunha jumped at Eduardo and both exchanged generous bouts of punches and kicks.         
	Few others, too, decided to join the party on the Holi eve.         
	The result: four red cards  Alvito, Okpara, Eduardo and Dipankar Roy  and 10 minutes of stoppage in the play.         
	However, Dipankars red was a dubious decision as it wasnt clear what exactly was his fault.         
	Coming back to the match proper, a well-conceived move in the 44th minute saw Eduardo unleash a fine left foot grounder which beat Abhra Mondal but hit the vertical on its way.         
	East Bengal came close to scoring twice. First, when a Mehtab Hossain back-volley was thwarted by the horizontal.         
	And then in the 63rd minute, when a brilliantly taken free-kick by Alvito was parried by an equally brilliant Manas Barua.         
	Referee Biplab Poddar, by the way, might have been a man in a hurry, trying to escape the madness on the pitch as he blew the whistle with three minutes still left on the clock.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal misses the cut
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arjun Atwal misses the cut
                      
	Singapore: Ace Indian golfer Arjun Atwal missed the cut, which was set at three-under 139, in the second round of Barclays Singapore, on Friday.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh fired a scintillating seven-under 64 to lie tied seventh before darkness led to suspension of play. The 2008 Singapore Open winner sank as many as eight birdies against a lone bogey to take his two-day total to eight-under 134 at the Tanjong course with 28 golfers yet to complete their round.         
	Rahil Gangjee also surged ahead to tied 26 after bringing home an improved card of four-under 67, while Digvijay Singh carded a successive two-under 69 to share the tied 40th spot with Gaganjeet Bhullar, who scored three-under 68. Shiv Kapur turned in an identical 68 to lie tied 55.         
	Jeev said the Serapong course is more challenging and it would be a tough task to score there for the next two days. Im glad I managed to hole a few putts out there today. I hit the ball pretty well in Tanjong and in fact I hit it pretty well at the Serapong too, he said.         
	It has worked for me. I went out there on the Tanjong and it was a scoring course. 64 on any day, on any golf course is great and Ill take that anytime.         
	Mukesh Kumar, who was at the 12th hole with a total of three-over, was stranded along with 28 other golfers for the day and is likely to miss the cut as well.         
	At the top, Adam Scott of Australia put himself in a strong position of securing an unprecedented third Singapore Open title with a brilliant six-under 65 for a 12-under 130.         
	He had won the tournament in 2005 and 2006.         
	Two strokes behind him was title holder Ian Poulter of England with a sizzling eight-under 63.

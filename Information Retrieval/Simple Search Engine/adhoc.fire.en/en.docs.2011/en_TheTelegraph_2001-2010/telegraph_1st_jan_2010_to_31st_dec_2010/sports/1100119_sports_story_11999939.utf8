                                                                                                                       7                                      Record win for Aussies
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Nathan Hauritz rounded off an outstanding summer by bowling Australia to a Test victory for the third successive occasion as the home side completed a record-equalling 12th successive win against Pakistan at Bellerive Oval on Monday.         
	Australia needed until only an hour after lunch to bowl Pakistan out for 206 as they never threatened to get anywhere near their record victory taget of 438 and lost by 231 runs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF charts friendly route to Doha
                                                                                                                       7                                      AIFF charts friendly route to Doha
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has managed to line up a series of international friendlies in Delhi and Pune as part of the senior national teams preparations for Januarys Asian Cup in Doha.         
	The matches, to be played against teams like Turkmenistan and Namibia or Gambia, however, will be held subject to approval from chief national coach Bob Houghton, AIFF sources said.         
	India are definitely playing three matches altogether against Thailand (On September 4 in Bangkok and on September 8 in Delhi) and North Korea (September 14 in Delhi), said an official.         
	The AIFF, however, is not yet sure whether the other three matches in Delhi, against Namibia or Gambia (September 18) and Turkmenistan (September 22 and 25), will be ultimately played. It all depends on the national coach, the official added.         
	According to sources in the Indian team, currently away on a training tour in Portugal, the coach is reluctant to play against African teams like Namibia or Gambia although they are placed above India  respectively, No.115 and No.103  in the Fifa rankings. Gambia recently shocked mighty Tunisia 2-1 in a friendly.         
	Houghton, it is believed, is neither in favour of playing Turkmenistan, a team India have already beaten in the Nehru Cup.         
	The British coach, who has led India to their first Asian Cup finals in 25 years, has asked the AIFF to arrange friendlies against Asian teams that are placed above India in the rankings. India are 24th in the current Asian Football Confederation (AFC) rankings.         
	The AIFF, however, is finding it difficult to meet that demand as at least nine top Asian teams are going to be busy in West Asian championships in September. Among the remaining big names, there are many not keen on playing India.         
	The AIFF officials feel that things could be better in October when the matches are to be held in Pune. Efforts are on to rope in teams like Jordan, Yemen and Uzbekistan but their participation is not certain.

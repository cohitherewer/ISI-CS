The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal whips Berrer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nadal whips Berrer
                      
	Monte Carlo: World No. 3 Rafael Nadal continued his destruction business at the Monte Carlo Masters with a 6-0, 6-1 demolition of German Michael Berrer to reach the quarter finals on Thursday.         
	He will next face fellow-Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero, who had the upper hand against Frances Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, prevailing 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 in an entertaining third-round contest on centre court.         
	The muscular Spaniard dropped only one game in his second-round match against Dutch qualifier Thiemo De Bakker and it long looked like world No. 51 Berrer would taste an even heavier defeat.         
	Berrer won only five points in the opening set. By the fourth game of the second set, Berrer had doubled his tally, eventually bagging 18 points and triggering wild cheers when he clinched his only game.         
	A forehand winner down the line ended Berrers ordeal in a match lasting just 54 minutes and Spanish players enjoyed a fine day on their favourite surface.         
	David Ferrer ruthlessly brought Ivan Ljubicic down to earth with a 6-0 7-6 victory and his compatriots Albert Montanes and Fernando Verdasco also reached the quarter finals.         
	Ferrer will face Philipp Kohlschreiber, who advanced after beating fellow German Philipp Petzschner 6-3 6-4, with a possible match up against claycourt machine Nadal looming.         
	Montanes beat Croatian fourth seed Marin Cilic 6-4 6-4 while Verdasco, seeded sixth, recovered from a shaky start to see off Czech Tomas Berdych 5-7 6-3 6-2.         
	Argentine David Nalbandian wasted no time in a 6-3 6-4 defeat of Spaniard Tommy Robredo. (Reuters)

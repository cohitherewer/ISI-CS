The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar: Chennai 100 my best
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tendulkar: Chennai 100 my best
                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar, on Thursday, rated the century he scored in Chennai against England that helped India chase 387 runs in the fourth innings soon after the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai as the best of his career.         
	It was not about the Test match but about something which happened two weeks before that. Something that had happened in Mumbai. It was difficult to prepare for a Test (under those circumstances). It was gracious of England to come here, Sachin, who alongwith wife Anjali, hosted a fund-raising dinner for the Crusade against Cancer Foundation here.         
	Dr P Jagannath of the Foundation said the overall donations received had crossed over Rs 1.30 crore. Jagannath said a simple message from Sachin on his Twitter page was enough to raise the money in two weeks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan level series
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan level series
                      
	London: Pakistan recovered from a terrible start to their day to complete a spirited victory in the fourth one-day International against England at Lords on Monday.         
	Their 38-run win with 3.5 overs to spare under the floodlights in the day-night match squared the series at 2-2 with the final match scheduled for Southampton on Wednesday.         
	Pakistan reached 265 for seven due primarily to Abdul Razzaq, who hit 44 not out from 20 balls including 40 off the last 10. The Pakistanis scored 83 from the final 10 overs.         
	Strauss put his concerns to one side with 68 from 72 deliveries, cutting and carving the ball through the off-side with familiar assurance on his home ground in an opening partnership of 113 with Steve Davis (49).         
	Pakistan fought back with the wickets of Trott (4), Paul Collingwood (4) and Ian Bell (27). Bell, who missed the Test series with an ankle injury, replaced Ravi Bopara.         
	Akhtar, now 35, responded to the situation and the increasingly vocal support of the Pakistan fans with a mixture of express deliveries and clever changes of pace to finish with three for 59 from his 10 overs.         
	Umar Gul, Pakistans hero at the Oval, bowled with equal fervour for figures off four for 32 from 8.1 overs. Englands last five wickets fell for 30 runs off as many deliveries.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed Monday confirmed that England batsman Jonathan Trott and Pakistan bowler Wahab Riaz were involved in a confrontation before the fourth one-day International at Lords.

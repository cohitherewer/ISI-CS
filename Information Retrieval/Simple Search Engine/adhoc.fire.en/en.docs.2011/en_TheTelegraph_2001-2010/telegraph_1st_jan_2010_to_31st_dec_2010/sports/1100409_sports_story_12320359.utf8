	Calcutta: Team India will be making two trips to Sri Lanka, for three engagements, in a couple of months from now.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources in Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), the Indians will first feature in the June 15-25 Asia Cup, followed by a triangular, with New Zealand being team No.3, and a three-Test series thereafter.         
	As the lights at the Premadasa Stadium (Colombo) are being overhauled for the 2011 World Cup, all the Asia Cup matches will be held in Dambulla. That wont be the case with the tri-series, one of the SLC sources pointed out.         
	The triangular may be held between July 9-23, with the Tests taking place during the July 28-August 18 window.         
	While Galle is expected to host the first Test, the next two will be in Colombo  at the SSC and the P.Sara Oval.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. resume international commitments with the World T20, in the West Indies, from April 30-May 16. After that will be the tri-series in Zimbabwe, with Sri Lanka being the third team there.         
	Nobody has said anything, not as yet, but it wont surprise if some of the big names decide to make themselves unavailable for one or both of the triangulars.

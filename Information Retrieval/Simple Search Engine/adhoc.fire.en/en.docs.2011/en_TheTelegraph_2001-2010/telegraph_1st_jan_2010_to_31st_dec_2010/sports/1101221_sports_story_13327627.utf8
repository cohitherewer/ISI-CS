	Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya had an hour-long discussion on the Ranji Trophy flop-show, on Monday. Raman, according to sources, felt poor performances against Railways and Assam led to the debacle.       
	He will be leaving for Chennai on Tuesday and send a detailed report to Dalmiya some time later. He will be coming back on January 21 and the Bengal players will undergo a two-week preparatory camp for the Vijay Hazare Trophy from January 23. Later, speaking to the reporters, Raman reiterated that two days  the day Bengal bowled poorly against Assam at the Eden Gardens and the day their batting crumbled against Railways in New Delhi  ruined the teams chances. I think against Railways the team was under pressure to perform, he said.      
	Raman also said that lack of quality spinners is a bane. But I think thats a problem everywhere in the country. If you ask the chairman of national selection committee, even he would not be able to name five promising spinners.          
	Madhya Pradesh laboured to 277 for three on the third day of the four-day Cooch Behar Trophy elite group B league match, against Bengal at the Kalyani Stadium on Monday, according to information received here. Chasing Bengals 438, Madhya Pradesh added 189 runs to their overnight 88 for one, losing only two wickets. They need 162 runs on Tuesday to take the first innings lead and retain their place in the elite division.       
	Brief scores: Bengal 438; Madhya Pradesh 277/3 in 127 ovs (SR Tripathi 98, AV Singh 63, AJ Dhaliwal 50 batting; Ravikant Singh 2/64)

	Joseph Lapira, who is in the city for a trial with East Bengal, had his first practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium, Monday. The 24-year old Irish-American was employed as a striker and attacking midfielder by coach Trevor Morgan during practice. Its his first day. So it will not be possible to form a judgement, Morgan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies six wickets from clean sweep
                                                                                                                       7                                        Aussies six wickets from clean sweep
                  Shane Watson picked up two wickets                     
	Hobart: On Sunday, Australia moved within six wickets of completing a clean sweep against a disappointing Pakistan. Simon Katich scored his first century of the summer, Ricky Ponting recorded his highest aggregate in a Test and Pakistans top order looked shaky.         
	Since Pakistans capitulation in Sydney, it seemed inevitable that they would struggle to lift themselves for the dead rubber at Bellerive Oval. At the start of the fourth day, the most likely scenario was for Australia to add quickly to their overnight score and bat until after lunch, and Pakistans batsmen to struggle and rain to play a part as the afternoon wore on. And so it unfolded.         
	Pakistan entered this Test with only two men averaging more than 40 for the series and until Salman Butts first-innings century, the best score by any of their players was his 71 at the SCG. Australia fancied their chances against the Pakistan order despite the forecast showers, and gave them a victory target of 438 from just under five sessions.         
	A win for Australia would be their 12th consecutive triumph against Pakistan, equalling the record for any team over any other Test side, which is currently held by Sri Lanka over Bangladesh. They came closer when Pakistan lost both openers within the first 10 overs, then the captain and best batsman Mohammed Yousuf with the score on 61, and young star Umar Akmal, with the total reading four for 83.         
	When the rain came an hour before the scheduled close, Pakistan were four for 103, needing an extremely unlikely 335 more for victory.           (AGENCIES)

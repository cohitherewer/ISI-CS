The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big Brother is made to sweat by New Zealand
                                                                                                                       7                                      Big Brother is made to sweat by New Zealand

	Calcutta: The impasse over who will be the next vice-president of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and its president for two years from the summer of 2012, once Sharad Pawars term ends, continues.         
	Its the turn of Australia-New Zealand to jointly make a recommendation, but the two Boards have reached no agreement.         
	There has been no announcement as such, but Cricket Australia (CA) is lobbying for former Prime Minister John Howard. As for New Zealand Cricket (NZC), its pushing for ex-chairman Sir John Anderson.         
	Both, incidentally, have already been interviewed by the seven-member panel entrusted with the task of identifying the candidate. The panel has three members each from CA and NZC, with former British Airways CEO Sir Roderick Eddington as facilitator.         
	A robust process has been put in place and the two Boards will, by the end of this month, make a joint recommendation... Theres no other comment to offer, CA spokesman Peter Young told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Young confirmed that ex-cricketers were on the panel, but declined to name anybody. Everything is confidential, he said.         
	Its because of the differences between the Boards that the ICC had to extend the December 31, 2009, deadline for receiving the recommendation.         
	The vice-presidents post will fall vacant in June, when incumbent Pawar succeeds David Morgan as president.         
	Nobody wants to go on record, but quite a few in the ICC arent comfortable at the thought of having to possibly deal with two politicians in a row  Pawar, followed by Howard.         
	Sir John, on the other hand, has served on the ICCs board and is familiar with its functioning.         
	New Zealand has, so far, not conceded ground to the Big Brother as Australias Malcolm Gray had been the ICCs president only recently (for three years from 2000).         
	Clearly, NZC has strong grounds to press for Sir John.

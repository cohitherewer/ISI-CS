The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting guru to work with Knights
                                                                                                                       7                                      Batting guru to work with Knights
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Owen Mottau, who has had sessions with (among others) Rahul Dravid, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, will be working with the development squad of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) during its forthcoming tour of Sri Lanka.         
	The 14-member squad will leave on July 25 and be in the island-nation till August 5.         
	According to Dav Whatmore, the Sri Lanka-born KKR coach, three 50-over matches and two T20 games have been scheduled in that period.         
	Well be playing at two venues, Colombo and Kandy The focus will be on sharpening skills and I expect the players to gain enormously from Mottaus presence, Whatmore told The Telegraph.         
	Like Whatmore, Mottau is Sri Lanka-born, but settled in Australia. Hes seen as a batting guru of sorts.         
	Speaking from Mumbai on Wednesday afternoon, Whatmore (who has coached Sri Lanka twice, helping the Arjuna Ranatungas win the 1996 World Cup in his first innings) added: Mottau has spent time with Dravid, Sangakkara and Jayawardene and has a reputation         
	Dravid worked with Mottau at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, last year, when Whatmore was its director.         
	Mottau, incidentally, has coached the Sri Lanka U-19s and was the first head of Sri Lanka Crickets Academy at the Premadasa, in Colombo.         
	The development squad has four players from Bengal  Debabrata Das, Sayan Sekhar Mondal, Syed Eklakh Ahmed and Vivek Singh.         
	 Also in the 14 is 29-year-old Arlen Konwar, an off-spinner from Assam, who has a suspect action.         
	Given the nature of the squad, it has only two players (Mandeep Singh, Harpreet Singh) who wore the KKR colours in the 2009-10 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	For the franchise, this is an investment In time to come, we hope to get rich dividends, Whatmore, who came on board late last year, explained.         
	The first three seasons of the IPL have, of course, been very disappointing for KKR.

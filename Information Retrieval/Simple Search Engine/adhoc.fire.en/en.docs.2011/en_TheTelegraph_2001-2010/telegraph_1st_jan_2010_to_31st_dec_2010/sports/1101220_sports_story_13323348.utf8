                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachins the God of cricket: Krish 
                      
	New Delhi: The cricket fraternity, both past and present, were effusive in their praise for Sachin Tendulkar, who reached another milestone in his illustrious career when he notched up his 50th Test hundred in Tests, on Sunday.               
	The following is what some of them had to say         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth (Sachins first India captain): He is the God of cricket and its a super human effort. He has dedicated 21 years in International cricket and thats amazing.         
	Chandu Borde (Sachins first India manager); This was expected This is one of the finest achievements in cricket history. It is a fantastic performance by Sachin . Records do not matter to him He will keep playing and records will follow him.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar (Sachins first Mumbai captain): It was an absolutely outstanding innings, an outstanding milestone in history of cricket. It has never happened in the history of cricket and I dont think anybody would ever reach such a milestone . Its been 21 years but he has retained the same enthusiasm, which I saw in 1988. He is so focussed, so passionate and disciplined Every time he occupies the crease, there is a record.         
	Gundappa Viswanath (former India captain and chief selector): The innings showed his keenness and calibre I was very impressed by the way he ran between the wickets. Its a monumental effort and a great achievement Its an unbelievable performance and no cricketer can come close to this mark, leave alone erasing it.         
	Syed Kirmani (Former India wicket-keeper and chief selector): He has reached the pinnacle of his cricketing career and I am sure his hunger for runs is still there. He has been achieving milestones, one after another, and it is beyond any cricketers calibre to match Sachins feat.         
	Madan Lal (former India all-rounder, selector and manager): Earlier, Indian batting entirely revolved around Tendulkar. But with the emergence of Dravid, Laxman, Sehwag and Gambhir, there is less pressure on Tendulkar. And when you are under less pressure, you start enjoying and playing more freely.         
	Yuvraj Singh (Sachins India teammate): Its the greatest achievement by a batsman ever.         
	Abdul Qadir (who was spanked by Sachin in his debut series, in Pakistan): At that time, Waqar Younis was at his quickest. But the kind of technique and temperament Sachin showed during his first innings in international cricket was worth remembering Suddenly you could feel that this was a special talent.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka captain): I think it is just the way he has changed his game He is now competing mostly against himself, like most great cricketers do.         
	Note: The Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, has congratulated Sachin. It is an amazing achievement to play for the country for over two decades and still continue to be the teams anchor. Sachin makes all of us so very proud, he said.         
	Congratulations have also poured in from ICC president Sharad Pawar, former union minister Shashi Tharoor, legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar and Indian tennis stars Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna.

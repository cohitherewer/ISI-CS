  - Morne Morkel picks up four; Amla scores hundred             Hashim Amla after his century, in Dubai, on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Dubai: Opener Hashim Amla hit a fighting unbeaten hundred to rescue South Africa against an aggressive Pakistan bowling to guide them to 228 for nine in the third one-day International (ODI), here on Tuesday.                     
	South Africa beat Pakistan by two runs on Tuesday. In reply to 228 for nine, Pakistan managed 226 for nine in 50 overs. Morne Morkel picked up four wickets for 47 runs.                     
	The 27-year-old right-hander batted without fuss to notch 119 for his sixth one-day hundred  his fifth this year  after Pakistan won the toss and put South Africa into bat on a tricky Dubai Stadium pitch.         
	Amla put on a valuable 59-run fourth wicket stand with Jean-Paul Duminy (26) after Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar put them on the back foot by dismissing Jacques Kallis (0) in the third over and in-form Colin Ingram (4) in the fifth.Amla, who has so far scored 986 runs in 13 one-day matches this year, held one end during his 126-ball knock, hitting nine boundaries to carry his bat through the innings.         
	Pakistan spinners  Shahid Afridi and Mohammed Hafeez  also benefited from the slow turn as they captured four wickets between them and never allowed the South African batsmen any room for free strokeplay.         
	Afridi (2/53) dismissed the dangerous-looking AB de Villiers and Albie Morkel, while Hafeez (2/34) accounted for Duminy and David Miller (6).         
	Amla added another valuable 38 with Johan Botha (15) before Akhtar dismissed Botha to finish with three for 39.         
	South Africa were without their captain Graeme Smith for the second match in a row after he hurt his left hand in the first match at Abu Dhabi, which his team won by eight wickets.

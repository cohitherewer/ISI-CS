    - Ballack to decide on his germany future after the cup           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Germany coach Joachim Loew with Jerome Boateng, Kevin-Princes half-brother, during a training session in Sicily, on Tuesday. Kevin-Prince will be representing Ghana in this World Cup. (Reuters)                                 
	Munich: Germanys new public enemy number one Kevin-Prince Boateng apologised on Tuesday for dashing Germany captain Michael Ballacks World Cup hopes with a hard tackle that ruled him out of the tournament.         
	I am sorry. It was not intentional. I just came in too late and made full contact. It looks pretty stupid. I apologised twice on the field and now for the third time. I am sorry. It was not intentional, Boateng told a website.         
	The apology coming three days after the foul during the FA Cup final between Portsmouth and Ballacks Chelsea did little to dampen German anger directed at Boateng.         
	The 33-year-old Chelsea midfielder was injured in the first half of Saturdays match against Portsmouth, limping off during his teams 1-0 win after a late tackle by Boateng.         
	Meanwhile, the German national team have reacted with fury at what they regard as the brutal challenge.         
	Ballack flew to Sicily on Monday and on Tuesday he said there was no need for bad blood. Of course I am very angry and disappointed but in football one should let it go, he said.         
	Ballack said he would decide on his national team future after the World Cup. Speaking to a German news agency at the national teams training camp, Ballack also said he expects to extend his contract with Chelsea, which expires this summer.         
	I want to play football again as soon as possible, Ballack said Tuesday. I assume that I will be fit for the start of the new season, Ballack said.         
	Ballack said whether he returns to the national team for the 2012 European Championship was one of the questions he would have to consider during his summer break.         
	I have to think about some things and sort them out. That had been in the pipeline anyway, Ballack said.         
	Its the best for me. Its an important step to be with the team and give them support now, said Ballack.         
	Ballacks lawyer and agent Michael Becker said he was considering legal steps against Boateng for what he said was a premeditated foul with intent to injure.         
	There appears to have been history between the players, with Boatengs father, Prince, describing an incident involving Ballack and his son in 2006. Kevins the whipping boy once again, he told a German newspaper.         
	[In 2006] Kevin has just scored his first goal for Hertha. Then they played against Bayern Munich. He had an argument with Ballack. Ballack said, Youve scored one goal and you think you are the best. Kevin has never forgotten that.         
	Unfortunately Kevin isnt very diplomatic. But Im sure he didnt mean to injure him.         
	The incident has caused huge controversy in Germany, particularly as Boateng opted to play football for Ghana while his half-brother, Jerome Boateng, is in the Germany World Cup squad.         
	To make matter worse, Ghana are in Germanys Group D, and play each other on June 23 in Johannesburg.         
	Fans also vented their anger on dozens of websites, calling him public enemy number one and setting up chatrooms called 82 million against Boateng or Anti-Boateng Group.

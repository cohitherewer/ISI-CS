            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Pakistan volleyball team will be arriving in the city on Thursday morning to participate in the 3rd Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship (Central Zone), a day before the tournament starts.         
	They were supposed to reach here on Wednesday but later they decided to stay in Delhi for a day and then take the morning flight to Calcutta. They are will be leaving Lahore for Delhi by bus on Wednesday morning, Rathin Roy Chaudhury, joint secretary organising committee, said. This means the team will be present during the inaugural ceremony scheduled for Thursday evening.         
	An agency report from Islamabad said that after initially turning down visa requests, the Indian High Commission cleared the way for Pakistans participation.         
	The Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) secretary Muhammad Afzal was quoted as saying that after initial reluctance, the Indian High Commission granted visas. They didnt issue the visas initially although we asked for a reason why we had been refused visas, Afzal said.         
	But later today (Tuesday) we were informed by the embassy officials that our team had got the clearance and they would be issuing visas, he said.         
	Afzal said PVF was thankful to the Indian High Commission for reviewing its case quickly as the championship was a part of Pakistan teams preparation for the Asian Games.

	Calcutta: Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood was Saturday ruled out of next months Test series against India due to a back injury, prompting the selectors to bring in Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson as stand-by players.         
	Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out of Australias Test squad for the VB Tour of India after confirmation he has developed the early stages of a low back bone stress injury, Cricket Australia said in a statement.         
	The National Selection Panel announced Hazlewoods Blues teammate Mitchell Starc and Victorian James Pattinson will act as standby players for Hazlewood, it added.         
	Pattinson is currently with the Victorian squad playing in the Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa and will remain with the Bushrangers until their finals chances are determined.         
	During the past week, Josh Hazlewood developed low back pain while bowling in preparation for the upcoming VB Tour of India Test series, Australian physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said.         
	His symptoms were consistent with a low back bone stress injury and scans have confirmed the early stages of a low back stress fracture, he added.

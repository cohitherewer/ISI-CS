            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa will be attempting to make it 10 wins in a row when they face Pakistan in the first of five match one-day International, in Abu Dhabi, on Friday.         
	The Proteas winning run began with a victory in the final match of the ODI series in India and have since had clean sweep series wins against both the West Indies and Zimbabwe.         
	It represents a good turnaround in their fortunes after their disappointing early exit from last years ICC Champions Trophy as well as the ODI series defeat against England.         
	It is unlikely that the Proteas will be at full strength until midway through the Pakistan series as Jacques Kallis and Dale Steyn return to fitness following injury breaks.         
	Rusty Therons recent form that has seen him take 11 wickets in his first three ODIs, including a five-wicket haul, and has been included in the ODI squad for the series.         
	The summers other new cap, Colin Ingram, has made just as spectacular a start to his career. Against Zimbabwe, he became the first South African and the sixth player of all time to make a century on ODI debut.         
	Graeme Smith, who handed Twenty20 captaincy to Johan Botha last month to prolong his career, said development of the side is key ahead of the 2011 World Cup. It will be the first taste of the sub-continent conditions before the World Cup, Smith said of the series here. South Africa are keen on the development of the side before the World Cup and are excited to be here.         
	South Africa will also play two Tests in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in a series shifted to the United Arab Emirates due to security fears in Pakistan.         
	Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi admitted that his team will miss the three suspended players  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer.         
	There is no doubt that they are our key players and we are going to miss them, but we have plenty of talent and we will try our best to overcome that loss because the World Cup is coming up, said Afridi.

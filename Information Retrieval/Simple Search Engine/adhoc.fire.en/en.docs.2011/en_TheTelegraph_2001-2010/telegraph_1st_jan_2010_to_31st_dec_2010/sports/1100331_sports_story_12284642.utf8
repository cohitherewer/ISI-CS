The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for excuses is over, says SRK
                                                                                                                       7                                        Time for excuses is over, says SRK
    - Hope the team introspects and comes back strong           A STAFF REPORTER            A pensive KKR coach Dav Whatmore at the city airport, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner Shah Rukh Khans scathing comments, posted on his Twitter account on Tuesday, has made a lot of members in the team sit up and take notice. Shah Rukh has made no bones about the fact that he is sick and tired of the excuses being offered for losing matches.         
	The post can be taken as a veiled warning to Sourav Ganguly and Co. who may have to face the owners wrath if things dont change radically. The actor has even asked his players to do some serious introspection.         
	This loss was about toss The last hitch because of the pitch... Time for excuses is over. Either we play better or keep being deserving losers I am disappointed and will try and sleep this disappointment off. Hope the team introspects and comes back strong. Professionals can do that, he tweeted.         
	It was not very difficult to gauge the sarcasm in Shah Rukhs comments. In a way it was also a veiled criticism of captain Souravs post match comments on Monday that the toss became a crucial factor.         
	However, there is no denying the fact that the players and support staff have all been taken aback by such a strong reaction from the man who has always publicly supported the team during its roller coaster ride.         
	Not all of us have read what he (Shah Rukh) has posted in Twitter. But some of them do follow Twitter and are aware about what has been written. Its not the time to react when the team is not doing well. Lets hope we can bounce back strongly and play well against the Deccan Chargers on Thursday, a team member told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	SRKs comments can have two diametrically opposite reactions in the coming matches. If the players and team management put things into perspective and feel that this kind of comment is hurting their ego, it may just spur them to bring out their best. However, if they take it in a negative sense, it might just invite unwanted pressure on the team  something they wouldnt want at this juncture.         
	On a different note, there has been a simmering tension in the team ranks about the constant chopping and changing in the playing XI in every match.         
	The general notion among the younger members of the squad is that no player is feeling mentally comfortable as no one knows whether he will be in the playing XI in the next match.         
	Many feel that these frequent changes have hurt the balance of the team.         
	Also the logic behind fielding a rookie like Mandeep Singh, who is still not ready for this level or a stonewaller like Cheteshwar Pujara, is being questioned.         
	The Deccan Chargers team had a two-hour session in the evening at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Having lost back-to-back matches against Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians, Adam Gilchrists boys will be itching to get back to winning ways.         
	Former ICL player Mohnish Mishra who has played couple of matches without much success (only 14 runs from two matches) said that the boys are confident that they will bounce back.         
	All eyes will be on the team composition of the Chargers. It will be interesting to find out whether the Chargers bring back veteran VVS Laxman, who hasnt yet set the stage on fire having garnered only 54 runs from four innings with an average of 18.         
	His highest score in the tournament is 22. Laxman looked confident during his brief stint at the nets.

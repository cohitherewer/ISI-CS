	London: The season-ending championship title eluded Mahesh Bhupathi yet again as the Indian and his partner Max Mirnyi lost the summit clash of the World Tour Finals to Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic here, Sunday.                     
	Roger Federer defeated world No.1 Rafael Nadal 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 to win the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals on Sunday. Federer, ranked No. 2 in the world, took victory on his second championship point with a forehand that landed just inside the baseline at the O2 Arena.                     
	The third seeds, Bhupathi and Mirnyi lost the close championship match 6-7 (6), 4-6 to the second-seeded Canadian-Serbian combination in an hour and 21 minutes.         
	Bhupathi and Mirnyi, who came into the prestigious tournament after winning the Paris Masters, had reached the final for the first time together.         
	Bhupathi had earlier ended runners-up at the Tour Finals in 1997, 1999 and 2000 with Leander Paes.         
	He had qualified for the elite eight-team competition with Mirnyi in 2003 and 2004 but could never cross the group stage.         
	Bhupathi and Mirnyi would have liked to end their partnership with the year-end championship victory.         
	Bhupathi has announced he will yet again team up with Paes for the initial part of the 2011 season while the man from Belarus will pair up with Nestor. Zimonjic is expected to play with Michael Llodra of France.         
	They had reunited for the 2010 season for the first time since 2004. They reached five finals, including four ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events and won the lone title in Paris.

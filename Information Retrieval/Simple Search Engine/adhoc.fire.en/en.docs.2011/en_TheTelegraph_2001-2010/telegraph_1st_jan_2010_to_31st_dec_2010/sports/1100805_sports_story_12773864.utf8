The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flower: Kevin on the mend
                                                                                                                       7                                      Flower: Kevin on the mend
                      
	Nottingham: England coach Andy Flower believes Kevin Pietersens latest Test without a hundred should not be used as a stick with which to beat the star batsman.         
	England thrashed Pakistan by 354 runs in the first of a four-Test series at Trent Bridge last week, although the overcast skies above the Nottingham ground were a boon to swing bowlers on both sides. Pietersen scratched his way to nine in the first innings and was out for 22 when brilliantly caught off the inside edge by diving Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal.         
	His cause has not been helped by an Achilles injury that forced him to miss most of Englands Ashes series win in 2009. More recently, he has been troubled thigh injury due to which he arrived at Trent Bridge, not having played a match since July 3.         
	But none of the top four batsman on either side at Trent Bridge made a half century and Flower said: Most batsmen looked a little iffy against that swinging ball but it wasnt only swinging  there was a little movement off the pitch as well.         
	Kevin did look better towards the end of the second innings, and that time in the middle is very important for any batsman  so I am glad he spent as long as he did at the crease both for his own good and the good of the team. He was one of those who made a contribution up the order, he added.         
	The Pakistan bowling has been able to fire on all cylinders and do what is expected of them. It is the visitors batting fortunes that have dipped to an alarming low.         
	To try and change that, Mohammed Yousuf arrives in England on Thursday. Yousuf has been granted a visa and will be considered for selection for the second Test at Edgbaston on Friday, the team said.

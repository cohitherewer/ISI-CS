The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha tied 43rd 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev Milkha tied 43rd 
                      
	Palm Beach Gardens: A sub-par card eluded Jeev Milkha Singh who teed off his campaign in the Honda Classic with a nervy one-over 71 to lie tied 43rd after the opening round of the $ 5.6 million event here.         
	Playing his back nine first, the top Indian golfer did not have a great start at the Champion Course of the PGA National Resort and Spa where the 12th hole bogey left him one-over at the turn.         
	Thing worsened when he dropped another stroke on the par-four second hole to go two over before Jeev hauled himself back on track with birdies on the third and fifth holes.         
	 The very next hole, however, cost Jeev a shot and the Indian parred the remaining three to sign off with an over-par card. (PTI)

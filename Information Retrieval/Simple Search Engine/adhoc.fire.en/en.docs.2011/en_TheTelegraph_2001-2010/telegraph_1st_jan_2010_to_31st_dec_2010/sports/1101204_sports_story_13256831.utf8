	Pune: Pune Football Club (PFC) ensured a point from their opening match against Mohun Bagan in the I-League at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports complex, Balewadi, on Friday evening. The hosts did well to restore parity in the second half after trailing 0-1 in the first.         
	Pune FCs Paresh Shivalkar on the left flank created some fine moves and nearly scored in the 18th minute. Ten minutes later, Bagan defender Harpreet Singhs header landed in Balajis hands and a minute later PFCs Selwyn Fernandes brought down Barreto just outside the box. Midfielder Snehasish Chakra-borty exceuted a gem of a freekick that curled in at the extreme post.         
	PFCs Edmar Figueira was the main stalwart while Izumi Arata did some fine work on the right flank.         
	In the second half Figueira appeared all charged up and in the 58th minute dribbled past a couple of defenders in the box but then a third one was too much to handle and the opportunity went by.         
	In the 75th minute PFCs Gurjinder Singh took a flag kick from the left corner and in the melee at the goalmouth Arata tapped the ball in for the equaliser. (agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Europe nose ahead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Europe nose ahead
                      
	Chonburi: Twice-winners Europe raced back into contention in the Royal Trophy after dominating Saturdays fourballs matches to snatch a one point lead over defending champions Asia.         
	Rebounding after a sluggish start on the opening day, the Europeans, led by Ryder Cup stalwart Colin Montgomerie, soared ahead with wins in three of their four matches to seize the initiative and take a one-point cushion into Sundays singles.         
	The revival was led by Montgomerie and Simon Dyson and Robert Karlsson and Alexander Noren, who overpowered their opponents to put Europe in command and put a dent in Asias hopes of retaining the title.         
	It was very important, we had to get ahead, Montgomerie told a news conference.         
	It was vital we had the points yesterday (Friday) and we took the momentum forward. To go in one point ahead gives us that advantage, but our job is only half done. Its a big day and we knew it was going to be close.         
	The Scot combined with Dyson to take an early lead on the third hole, which they held throughout to finish 4 amp;3 over Indian pair Jeev Milkha Singh and Gaganjeet Bhullar, who were winless for a second successive day.         
	Jeev and Bhullar opened the day for the defending champions in the first fourballs and just couldnt match the individual brilliance of Dyson, who sank four birdies in all.         
	I chipped in twice, and my short game has been very good.         
	We played really well good golf and put them under pressure right from hole one, Dyson said.         
	The Indian pair, on the other hand, couldnt manage a single birdie on the front nine and picked up only a couple of shots on their way back.

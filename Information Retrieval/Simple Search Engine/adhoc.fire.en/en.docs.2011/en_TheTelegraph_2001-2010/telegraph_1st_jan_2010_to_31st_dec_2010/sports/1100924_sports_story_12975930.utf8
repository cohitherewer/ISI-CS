The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi: Sachin is above awards
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvi: Sachin is above awards
                      
	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkars greatness cannot be measured by the number of awards he has won in his career, feels Yuvraj Singh. Recently, Yuvraj was dropped from the India squad for the two-Test series against Australian, beginning October 1 in Mohali, on grounds of form and fitness.         
	Despite scaling almost every cricketing record, Tendulkar has never won any International Cricket Council (ICC) award, but Yuvraj said, It doesnt make any difference because he is Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Whether he has won any ICC award or not, it doesnt matter. Sachin Tendulkar is Sachin Tendulkar, and there is no comparison, the dashing left-hander added.         
	The iconic 37-year-old year has been short-listed for the ICC Cricketer of the Year award and will be hoping to break the jinx on October 6, at the ICC awards night in Bangalore.         
	Tendulkar is also in the running for the Test and ODI Player of the Year awards.           (PTI)

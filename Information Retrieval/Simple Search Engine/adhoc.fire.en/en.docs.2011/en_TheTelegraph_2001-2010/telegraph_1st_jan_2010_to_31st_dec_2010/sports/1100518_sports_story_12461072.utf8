The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAS rejects Ribery appeal 
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAS rejects Ribery appeal 
                      
	Munich: Bayern Munich midfielder Franck Ribery will miss Saturdays Champions League final against Inter Milan after the German club failed in their last attempt to overturn a ban on Monday.         
	Bayerns appeal against a three-match suspension imposed on the Frenchman for a bad tackle in the semi-finals against Olympique Lyon was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).         
	It means Bayern will be without one of their two most creative players as they take on one of Europes best defences but coach Louis van Gaal was prepared to shrug off the loss.We do not depend on (Arjen) Robben or Ribery, Van Gaal told reporters on Monday before CAS announced the decision.         
	You (reporters) have said we depend on them but we have said it often that we do not depend on them.         
	Ribery, who has already served one match of the ban, was dismissed for a high, late challenge on Lisandro Lopez.         
	Ribery was replaced by Hamit Altintop for the second leg against Lyon with the Turkish player winning praise for his performance.         
	Hamit is in very good form, Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger told reporters. (Reuters)

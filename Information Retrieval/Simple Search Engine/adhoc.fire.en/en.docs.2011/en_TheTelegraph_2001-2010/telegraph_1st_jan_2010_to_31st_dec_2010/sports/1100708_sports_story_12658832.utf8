	The Spanish armada chugs on and how! After making a horrible start to the World Cup, Vicente del Bosques boys are in the final of the World Cup, thanks to Carles Puyols header in the 73rd minute.         
	So was I surprised to see the Germans bowing out after such a promising show in the second round and in the quarter finals? The first 15 minutes actually told me that the Germans were not up for it. They were surprisingly subdued and rightly outplayed by this brilliantly talented Spanish team.         
	Thomas Muellers absence in the attacking third also did not help the German cause. With no Mueller, Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose looked like mere passengers. They could not play their usual one-twos to create the space that created havoc in the England and Argentina defence. They were too much into their own half and the Germans were not being able to go fast on the counterattack.         
	Muellers substitute, Piotr Trchowski, and Bastian Schweinsteiger were completely missing in action. Rightly at the hour mark, Trchowski was substituted and Toni Kroos came in but that hardly made a difference.         
	Why would a team, which scored four goals each against England and Argentina, be playing so deep in their half? I feel let down by the German strategy. Was the fact that they lost to Spain in the Euro 2008 final working at the back of their minds? Was it the fact that there were seven players from the Barcelona team in Spains starting eleven? Your guess is as good as mine.         
	Spain played a very tactical game with intricate passing and never gave up the ball.         
	With seven players from Camp Nou, I sometimes thought that Catalunya were playing in Spain colours!         
	Xavi once again was the key to the Spanish attack and his delightful passing was a treat to watch. He looked so calm and composed picking out David Villa, Pedro or Joan Capdevilla. And with his club-mate Anreas Iniesta also in rousing form the German midfield just did not have any answer.         
	Such was the Spanish domination that the goal was a matter of time and it came in the 73rd minute. It was Xavis corner and up went Puyol and Gerard Pique. Sami Khedira was beaten and Puyols powerful header crashed into the net.         
	Barca were doing it for Spain. Never have I seen the stamp of a club so glaring on a national team. It would not have been surprising if Spain had won by three or more goals. Yeah, Wednesday was Spains. Will Sunday be theirs too?

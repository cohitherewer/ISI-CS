	Netherlands  
	The Oranje have set lofty aims for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Since the retirement of pioneering coach Rinus Michels, a multitude of players have followed in the footsteps of the Johan Cruyff generation without ever advancing as far as the final hurdle, which the Dutch did twice in the 70s. Often seen as spectacular but mentally fragile, the Netherlands hope to banish that image under Bert van Marwijk.   
	Road to South Africa            
	 It was a full house as the Dutch picked up eight wins from eight games in the qualifiers.   
	Star player  
	 Leading from the front in terms of both goals and commitment is Manchester United forward Rooney who has matured into a fine team player and a deadly striker.  
	Coach  
	 Van Marwijk will depend a lot on Arjen Robben's left foot. Known for his speed , the flank god is a world class winger. Remains to be seen whether he stays fit.  
	Record  
	 The Netherlands have appeared at eight previous editions. They reached the final on two occasions mdash; 1974 and 1978. In 1974, under the tutelege of the legendary Rinus Michels, the Johan Cruyffs played breathtakingly beautiful soccer. They lost in the final to West Germany and, although they made the final four years later in Argentina, the Dutch found their luck un changed from the last edition.

	Denmark  
	Remember that famous ldquo;We are red, we are white, we are Danish Dynamites rdquo; chant in 1986? Well, they are back in South Africa after failing to qualify for the rsquo;06 World Cup. In Mexico rsquo;86, they progressed to the last 16 and it was the core of that team went on to register the nation rsquo;s greatest footballing triumph with the 1992 European Championship crown in neighbouring Sweden.  
	Road to South Africa             
	The Danes saw off big-name rivals Portugal and Sweden in European qualifying Group 1 to top the group with just one defeat in their ten matches.   
	Star player  
	 Jon Dahl Tomasson, Denmark's most prolific scorer after the legendary Poul Nielsen, this Feyenoord striker is the man to watch out for.  
	Coach  
	 Morten Olsen will complete a decade as head coach during this World Cup. He took the helm in 2000, guiding Danish Dynamite to the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.   
	Record  
	 The Danes have qualified for the World Cup four times. They made it to the Round of 16 in 1986 and 2002 . And quarter finals in 1998. In 1986 they caught the eye with a very attacking brand of soccer but lost to Spain in the knock-out round. They won the 1992 European Championships in a dramatic fashion coming in very late after Yugolsavia were banned. In 1995, they took home the Confederations Cup.

  First Int rsquo;l: Vs Croata   in 1997  
	Japan  
	Boasting one of the strongest squads in Asian football, Japan, winners of three of the last five editions of the Asian Cup, have high hopes for this World Cup . First on the agenda is an improvement on the disappointing showing four years back, when they exited at the first hurdle after a 3-1 reverse against Australia, a 0-0 draw with Croatia and a resounding 4-1 defeat by Brazil.   
	Road to South Africa             
	Comfortably reached the fourth and final stage of Asian Zone qualifying for South Africa 2010.   
	Star player  
	 Shunsuke Nakamura is Japan's most famous player having for Celtic and Espanyol. His dead ball expertise is world class with some putting him ahead of even David   Beckham.  
	Coach  
	 National supremo Takeshi Okada is widely considered to be one of the finest Japanese strategists around. He was at the helm during the Samurai Blues' first World Cup appearance in 1998.  
	Record  
	 2010 will be Japan's fourth World Cup finals. Their best finish came as co-hosts in 2002, when they topped Group H ahead of Belgium, Russia and Tunisia to advance to the knockout stages for the first and so far only time. Once in the Round of 16 they put in a brave fight only to go down 1-0 against eventual third-place finishers Turkey.

	Cameroon  
	Although their light may have faded somewhat since they brightened up the world stage at the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon are not a side to underestimate in South Africa. The top African nation in Fifa's rankings, they also bring Africa rsquo;s richest pedigree to the finals. They may have failed to shine in their next appearances, the fans are hoping for a good show this time around.  
	Road to South Africa             
	Though the 2-0 victory in Morocco that clinched their qualification was straightforward enough, Cameroon had in fact completed an impressive turnaround in a campaign that started with just a draw from their first two matches.  
	Star player  
	 Three-time Arican Footballer of the Year and skipper Samuel Eto'o is the star of the team. He already had a verbal duel with Roger Milla and will defintely like to make the legend eat humble pie with a fantastic performance.  
	Coach  
	 The reversal of fortunes for Cameroon coincided with the arrival of no-nonsense 45-year-old coach, Frenchman Paul Le Guen. Le Guen has previously coached Lyon, Rangers and Paris St. Germain, and brought a sea change in attitude and professionalism.   
	Record  
	 Cameroon were eliminated at the group stage of Spain 1982 despite not suffering a defeat. They lost out to Italy for second in the table on the goals scored ti-ebreaker after three draws. Cameroon have played in 17 World Cup matches, the most of any national team from Africa.

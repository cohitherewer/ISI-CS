            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Senior pro Yuvraj Singh has denied having disregarded security norms at the team hotel, Mount View, on Tuesday night.         
	I do inform the security personnel and do go out with security... I didnt breach anything on Tuesday night, Yuvraj told The Telegraph, on Thursday.         
	Yuvraj, who led the Kings XI Punjab in the first two editions of the IPL, was reacting to a charge by the local police.         
	Chandigarh is, of course, Yuvrajs hometown.         
	According to the police, complaints have been lodged with the Kings XI management as also the IPL brass.         
	The polices contention is that Yuvraj, clearly the most colourful among todays generation of cricketers, had disregarded security norms once before as well.         
	Yuvraj, though, has a very different take on all that.

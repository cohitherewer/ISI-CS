The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No mercy for Pak trio, says Kapil 
                                                                                                                       7                                      No mercy for Pak trio, says Kapil 
                      
	Mumbai: Kapil Dev said on Thursday there should be no mercy for the three Pakistani cricketers embroiled in a spot-fixing scandal if they are found guilty.         
	Kapil said betting in sport is well-known but it is incomprehensible how law enforcement agencies do not know anything about the shady happenings.         
	Everybody knows that betting is rampant in the game...how is it possible that the government or the police do not know about it? the legend, who led India to the 1983 World Cup triumph, said.         
	He said the International Cricket Council (ICC) should act against those guilty in the betting scandal allegedly involving the Pakistani team in the strictest way and promptly.         
	I am feeling sad for the people of Pakistan, not for the three players who let their country down. I am feeling bad that because of the three, Pakistan is being looked at in this way, he said referring to the trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer.         
	Kapil criticised other players for overlooking such activities in the dressing room and said the only solution to the malaise is quick reporting to authorities as soon as a player or any individual gets a whiff of it.           (PTI)

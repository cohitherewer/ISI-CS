The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajjis salute to the Eden men 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhajjis salute to the Eden men 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Harbhajan                           
	Calcutta: A week, clearly, is a long time in cricket.         
	Seven days ago, the India cricketers had very strong reservations over the then greenish look of the Eden wicket. They werent exactly pleased with the local personnel either.         
	But it was all quite different on the morning after the Test series-levelling victory over South Africa.         
	Indeed, before leaving for the national capital en route to hometown Jalandhar (for sister Sandeep Kaurs wedding), on Friday, Harbhajan Singh told The Telegraph: If I have to dedicate our win to anybody, it would be to those who work so hard to make Eden Gardens such a great venue... This one is for them...         
	Curator Prabir Mukherjee and his men, the silent workers, can take a bow.         
	Harbhajan, the second most successful off-spinner in Test cricket, had another rich outing at the Eden  an initiative-wresting spell on the first afternoon and a match-sealing one on the fifth day, Thursday.         
	Had Hashim Amla not registered a hundred in each innings, Harbhajans eight-wicket haul wouldve made him a front-runner for the MoM award at the venue where he got a hattrick nine years ago.         
	For Harbhajan, though, theres no regret. Task No.1, after all (ensuring India stayed at the pinnacle in Tests), got accomplished here.         
	That done, Harbhajan is focused on his sisters wedding, to Sahebjit Singh, on Saturday.         
	Earlier this season, opener Gautam Gambhirs sister, Ekta, got married. He missed the final Test against Sri Lanka.         
	As for Harbhajan, he wont be seen in action in the first two ODIs against South Africa.

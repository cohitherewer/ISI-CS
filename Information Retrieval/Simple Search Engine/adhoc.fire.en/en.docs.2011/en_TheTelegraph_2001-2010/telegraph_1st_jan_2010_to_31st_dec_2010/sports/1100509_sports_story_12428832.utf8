The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IMG denies any role
                                                                                                                       7                                      IMG denies any role
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	Event management company IMG has denied charges that it was involved in planning a rebel Twenty20 league in England in conjunction with suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi.         
	IMG reacted furiously on Friday and issued its own statement. IMG has a 50-year record of integrity and probity in the business of sports and at all time respects the authority and sovereignty of federations and governing bodies. This is a record IMG is proud of and will take any necessary steps to defend, it said.         
	IMG has not been involved in any plans in the quotes attributed to Giles Clarke Any suggestion otherwise is baseless, untrue and defamatory, the statement added.         
	Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, is thus facing possible legal action from the sports marketing giant.         
	This newspaper has obtained a letter sent to Modi on April 13 and signed by the nine chairmen of Test match grounds, who are lobbying for a change to Englands Twenty20 structure.         
	The letter states clearly that talks with Modi would proceed only with the full knowledge of the ECB and that a meeting with Clarke would take place on April 28. It said: Clearly it is important that we bring the ECB with us rather than create conflict which would only result in delays and unrest.         
	But the letter also reveals the dissatisfaction among the most powerful counties in English cricket with the way the ECB has handled Twenty20 cricket. There exists a unanimous strength of feeling between all clubs and MCC and a desire to create a new model for the long term future of the game in this country.         
	International cricket is dominating the landscape in England and Wales and domestic cricket is not being given the strategic focus required to capitalise on emerging opportunities.

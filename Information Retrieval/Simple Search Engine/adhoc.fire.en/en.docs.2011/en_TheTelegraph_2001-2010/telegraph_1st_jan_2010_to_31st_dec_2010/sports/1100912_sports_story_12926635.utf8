	Centurion: Anil Kumbles Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will be the only Indian Premier League (IPL) side in action in the Champions League Twenty20 on Sunday when they clash against West Indian underdogs Guyana.         
	Kumbles RCB, which made the Champions League after winning the third-place playoff of the IPL, will be the favourites against Ramnaresh Sarwans Guyana.         
	In fact, Sarwan is the only big name in Guyana, which replaces last years runners-up Trinidad and Tobago as the Caribbean flavour in the two-week tournament.         
	Well aware of the enormity of the task ahead of him, Sarwan has said that the team is banking on talented youngsters such as pacer Devendra Bishoo and all-rounder Jonathan Foo to give Guyana an opportunity to surprise their rivals.         
	Guyanas passage to CLT20 wasnt the easiest of affairs. Playing in the semi-final of the Caribbean T20 2010, they beat Trinidad and Tobago, the defending champions, in a closely contested match and then snatched victory after very nearly courting defeat against Barbados in the final.         
	In contrast, Kumbles side have established names such as Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis, Ross Taylor and Robin Uthappa in their batting line-up.         
	On the bowling front, they have the pace of Dale Steyn and Praveen Kumar while Kumble himself leads the slower bowling department. All-rounder Cameron White adds variety to the team.         
	In the other match of the day, South African domestic champions Highveld Lions, who sprung a major surprise by beating IPL runners-up Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener, will take on South Australian Redbacks.         
	Led by Alviro Petersen, the Lions will once again seek inspiration from their home crowd to inflict another upset.         
	Although not as star-studded as Sachin Tendulkars Mumbai Indians, the Redbacks have some in-form players such as Callum Ferguson, Daniel Harris and skipper Michael Klinger.         
	Pacer Shaun Tait leads their bowling attack which also leg-spinner Cullen Bailey.         
	For the Lions, Jonathan Vandiar was their top-performer with the bat against the Mumbai Indians making 71 against fine a bowling attack that included established stars like Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga and Harbhajan Singh.

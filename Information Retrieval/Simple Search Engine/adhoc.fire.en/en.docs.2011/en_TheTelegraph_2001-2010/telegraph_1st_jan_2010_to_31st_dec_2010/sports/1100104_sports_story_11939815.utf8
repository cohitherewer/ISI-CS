The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A deserving win, says Shabbir
                                                                                                                       7                                      A deserving win, says Shabbir
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: If one considers the build-up to the Federation Cup, even a die-hard red and gold brigade fan wouldnt have hoped that East Bengal would lift the trophy.         
	A disastrous kick-off to the season, a host of controversies to handle, misfiring with the selection of foreign recruits and to top it all, a change of coach in the middle of the season  East Bengal had seen it all.         
	But Phillippe de Ridder, the man who took over a depleted and demoralised East Bengal from previous coach Subhas Bhowmick, did a fantastic job to rejuvenate the Calcutta club as they lifted the coveted Federation Cup title outclassing Lajong FC 3-0 via tie-breakers.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa, whose side were handed a 0-2 defeat by De Ridders men in the semi-finals, turned out to be a poor loser as he refused to comment when contacted by The Telegraph Sunday seeking his reaction arch-rivals victory.         
	I have no comment at all about the Federation Cup final, said Bencharifa for whom it was a hattrick of failures as Bagan had earlier missed out in the IFA Shield and the Durand Cup.         
	His Mohammedan Sporting counterpart, Shabbir Ali, however, was a perfect gentleman as he expressed happiness that the trophy remained with a Bengal team.         
	Its good that a team from Calcutta has won the trophy. Its a deserving win for East Bengal. But Lajong also played a well, especially as they were missing their key players.

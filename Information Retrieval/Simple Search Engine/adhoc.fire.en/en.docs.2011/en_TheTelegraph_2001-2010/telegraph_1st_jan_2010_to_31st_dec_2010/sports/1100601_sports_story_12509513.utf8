	Bulawayo: Flying high after the upset win over India, minnows Zimbabwe will look to spring another surprise when they take on Sri Lanka in the third ODI of the cricket tri-series here Tuesday.         
	Both the sides have played a match each  against India  and have contrasting results to show going into Tuesdays game. While Zimbabwe stunned India with a six-wicket triumph, the Lankans suffered a seven-wicket loss on Sunday.         
	The contrast is evident in the batting line-ups of both the sides as well. While Sri Lankas batting, barring skipper Tillekaratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews, was largely lacklustre against India, the Zimbabweans chased down a rather stiff target with consummate ease.         
	Without regular stars like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lankas bating looked brittle against India and three run-outs didnt help their cause either.         
	And if the Lankans have to avoid the embarrassment that India endured, their batting would be crucial and the likes of Thilan Samaraweera and Upul Tharanga will have to strike form.

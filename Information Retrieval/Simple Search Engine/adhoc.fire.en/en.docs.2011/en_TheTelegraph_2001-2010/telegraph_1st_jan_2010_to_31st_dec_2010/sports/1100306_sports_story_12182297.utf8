                                                                                                                       7                                        Windies falter vs Zimbabwe
                  Chris Gayles 57 went in vain                     
	London: Debutant Shingirai Masakadza took two wickets in the final over to help Zimbabwe to a two-run victory over the West Indies in the first one-day International in Guyana on Thursday.         
	West Indies, chasing 255 for victory, needed 15 off the final over with three wickets in hand but Masakadza bowled Dwayne Smith (4) and Sulieman Benn was caught at mid-wicket on the next ball.         
	With the hosts requiring four off the final ball, Masakadza bowled a yorker to Kemar Roach who could only pick up a single to give Zimbabwe a 1-0 lead in the five-match series,         
	The West Indies chase got off to a good start with captain Chris Gayle (57) and Adrian Barath (50) starring in a 99-run opening partnership before four wickets fell for 66 runs.         
	Shivnarine Chanderpaul steadied the Windies and put them in sight of victory with a quick-fire 70 before being caught off the bowling of Masakadza, younger brother of Zimbabwe opener Hamilton.         
	For the visitors, Vusi Sibanda fell five runs short of his century in a 162-ball innings that included five fours and a six as the Zimbabweans reached 254 for five in 50 overs. The second ODI is in Guyana on Saturday.           (REUTERS)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Archery Association of India (AAI) on Monday, left out Mangal Singh Champia from the mens recurve team that will take part in the Commonwealth Games. The three-member squad comprises of Tarundeep Rai, Jayanta Talukdar and Rahul Banerjee. The womens team comprises Dola Banerjee, L. Bombayla Devi and Deepika Kumari.         
	In the compound category, C. Srither, C.H. Jignas and Ritul Chatterjee will represent India men while Jhanu Hansda, Gagandeep Kaur and Bheigyabati Chanu are part of the womens squad.         
	Champias exclusion raised a few eyebrows, but national coach Limba Ram explained: Things became a tad difficult for Mangal once he changed his bows.         
	Champia, however, finds a place in the Asian Games which will be held in China, later this year. Tarundeep, Jayanta and Rahul form the rest of the team. Dola, Bombayla and Rimil Burily will lead the womens challenge.         
	The AAI secretary Paresh Nath Mukherjee is hopeful that Indian archers will win at least 16 medals.

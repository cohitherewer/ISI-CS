The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Momentum is with KKR 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Momentum is with KKR 
    - Big names add to the might of the royal challengers           A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain Sourav Ganguly couldnt have dreamt of a better start. Winning the inaugural match of the third edition of Indian Premier League (IPL), and that too against the defending champions Deccan Chargers, was exactly what the doctor ordered.         
	As the Knights take on the Anil Kumble-led Royal Challengers Bangalore, in their second match at the Eden Gardens on Sunday, Sourav would like to ensure that his band of breavehearts keep the same intensity and thrust in front of a capacity crowd who will back them to the hilt. After beating the champions, a victory over last years runners-up would be the icing on the cake.         
	With their principal owner Shah Rukh Khan expected to cheer them from the stands, the stage is set for the Knights to turn it into a Super Sunday for the Calcuttans.         
	Its a long tournament and winning one match certainly isnt an indicator as to how the tournament will gradually unfold for Shah Rukhs men who ended as wooden spooners during the last edition in South Africa.         
	But the most heartening aspect during the Knights victory on Friday night was the manner in which they came back against Adam Gilchrists men. Last year, there were a lot of matches where the KKR lost at the death.         
	The performance of the KKR bowlers during the last 10 overs on Friday was praiseworthy. Equally creditable was the performance of Angelo Mathews and Owais Shah who ensured that the Knights put up a fighting total.         
	However, there are certain areas that coach Dav Whatmore and skipper Sourav need to address.         
	First is the failure of the top-order in the first match. Sourav, who has never been a great advocator of chopping and changing, may continue with the same XI for Sundays game. But Cheteshwar Pujaras quadriceps strain will be a worrying factor for the team.         
	Pujara didnt field during the Deccan Chargers innings. Instead, it was India colts player Mandeep Singh who took the field. Although Whatmore didnt want to divulge his final XI, if Pujara is not fit for the match, Mandeep may just be drafted into the squad.         
	Bengal vice-captain Manoj Tiwary, who had a disappointing opener, may get another chance at the top of the order (if Mandeep is chosen for the middle-order). It will be interesting to see whether Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, known for his big-hitting prowess, will be promoted up the order. Shukla, who has played a lot of cricket at this ground, knows it like the back of his hand.         
	The pitch where the match will be played promises to be a belter. Its the same wicket where the India versus South Africa Test was played last month. As curator Prabir Mukherjee pointed out: Dont expect any major lateral movement. It will be a firm, even bounce wicket where stroke players will feel comfortable as the ball would come on really well.         
	KKRs opponents bear a formidable look but will definitely miss New Zealander Ross Taylor, who is busy representing his country against Australia at home.         
	But with a side that boasts of big names like Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher, Kumble will definitely fancy his chances. And not to forget the fast and furious Dale Steyn, who can really unsettle the batsmen with his raw pace.         
	 Also, the likes Manish Pandey, Virat Kohli, Robin Uthappa and Praveen Kumar would be there to pile on the pressure.         
	The emphasis for the Knights will be on korbo and lorbo. The jitbo bit, then, will surely fall in place.         
	Match starts: 4pm

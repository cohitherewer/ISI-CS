              Harbhajan Singh                                 
	Chennai: Star spinner Harbhajan Singh was denied entry into the Anna International Airport here for not having a ticket and had to wait for about 45 minutes outside the entry area before finally getting in.         
	The off-spinner arrived at the domestic airport from Mumbai and was taken to International airport from where the Indian squad was scheduled to leave for Sri Lanka. Most of the team members had already arrived in the city, on Thursday.         
	Instead of joining teammates at a city hotel, Harbhajan preferred to go straight to the International airport and wait for the team. A hotel representative accompanied Harbhajan and took him from domestic to international airport.         
	On arrival at the international airport, the security personnel asked the spinner to show his ticket but the cricketer did not have any as the team travels on a group ticket. The hotel representative then pleaded the spinners case with the Airport manager but he also reasoned that they can not let anyone in without a travel ticket and suggested the spinner to buy a visitor pass and wait in the lounge. Harbhajan though preferred to wait outside the entry area. A xerox copy of the ticket was arranged quickly and only then Harbhajan could get inside the airport.         
	Sans newly-wed captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the others left on the day. Dhoni, who married Sakshi Rawat, received an honorary membership by Madras Cricket Club on Friday evening and will fly to the Island Nation on Saturday. The function has been organised to acknowledge and appreciate Chennai Super Kings title triumph in IPL-III under Dhonis leadership.         
	Reserve wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha and pacer Abhimanyu Mithun, who were doing duty with India A team will join the squad directly from London. India are without their pace mainstay Zaheer Khan, who is nursing a shoulder injury.

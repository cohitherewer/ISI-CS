	The cricket fraternity Wednesday hailed Sachin Tendulkar for becoming the first batsman in the history of ODIs to score a double century, describing the feat as an incredible achievement.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)               
	INTIKHAB ALAM: The way he is going I feel sorry for the bowlers. He will be a terror for bowlers in the 2011 World Cup.         
	SUNIL GAVASKAR: He is the greatest batsman the game has ever seen. There is just no question about that. See his record! Who else has got 90-plus centuries, 17000-plus runs in ODIs and 13000-plus runs in Test cricket? He is comfortably the greatest batsman ever. He should aim for more. I think he should go for a triple century in Test cricket. This is something he doesnt have but is very capable of. This is well within his reach and he should go for it. He should, may be, look for a Test innings of 450 or an ODI knock of 250. And then he himself wants to win next years World Cup. There is a little boy in Tendulkar who wants to keep playing. That spirit keeps him going. Its absolutely incredible how he keeps playng. A lot of others with his record would have had said enough, but I guess there is no word called enough in Tendulkars dictionary.         
	SHOAIB MALIK: For any cricketer, he is the role model. A great thing about him is that he has been outstanding in both Tests and ODIs. As a Pakistani player, I know how much value we always put on his wicket.         
	JAVED MIANDAD: He is my favourite player. I had said that one day he would go on to break all batting records. Whatever he is achieving today is because of his top physical and mental condition.         
	RAMIZ RAJA: The way he is still scoring runs and breaking records is awesome, and a lesson for the cricketing world. The unique thing is his passion for the game. He is still like a 10-year old, and that is very important to keep on going at the top level. This latest record is not surprising at all. I loved watching him bat and I think he still has a lot more to give India and cricket.         
	DILIP VENGSARKAR: Its an amazing feat to get 200 in a day and that, too, off only 147 balls. It shows his mental and physical toughness. Hes a player who does not throw away his wicket once hes set. He always places a huge price on his wicket.         
	AJIT WADEKAR: This is out of the world! Sachin doesnt go for records, the records follow him. I have watched him from close, his involvement has remained the same from the time he started as a 15-year-old. The way he is going, the 2011 World Cup is almost assured!         
	SHANE WARNE (on his Twitter page): Yes, yes, yes! Well done Sachin, my friend. Congrats and well done! (Its) awesome.

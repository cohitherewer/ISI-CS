The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 7 stay opposed to Howard, in no mood for a presentation   John Howard
                                                                                                                       7                                      7 stay opposed to Howard, in no mood for a presentation   John Howard
 - Ex-Australia Prime Minister adds to the drama by arriving in Singapore            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                John Howard      
	Calcutta: Battling massive odds, John Howard landed in Singapore on Tuesday evening, hours after the row over his nomination as the next vice-president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) marred proceedings on the opening day of the Executive Boards meeting there.         
	It was, by all accounts, high-voltage stuff at the Raffles City Convention Centre, where the annual conference week is being held.         
	According to top sources of The Telegraph, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the West Indies made it clear to the three backers (Australia, New Zealand, England) of Australias former Prime Minister that his nomination wasnt acceptable.         
	Going by the mood, its unlikely that those opposed to Howard will review their position.         
	The person who succeeds Sharad Pawar, on Thursday, will also take over from him as the ICC president, in 2012.         
	Howard has been jointly nominated by Australia and New Zealand, as its their turn to do so according to the rotational policy agreed upon by the ICC a few years ago.         
	For a nomination/proposal to be accepted or rejected, seven of the 10 Test-playing nations must either vote for or against. Should Howards nomination be put to vote, on Wednesday (concluding day of the Executive Boards meeting), its bound to be defeated.         
	Such an outcome would be more than just embarrassing for the 70-year-old.         
	Howard, one learns, made the trip to Singapore on the suggestion of David Morgan, the outgoing president of the ICC. Apparently, he wants Howard to make a presentation before the Executive Board, but the seven against his nomination have threatened a walkout.         
	As one of the top sources put it: Theres no precedent for somebody, an outsider at that, making a presentation... Its time Australia-New Zealand got the message and began working towards making a fresh nomination... Howard has no links with cricket and hes not acceptable.         
	He added: Lest it be misunderstood, theres nothing personal where Howard is concerned He wouldve been welcome had he, for example, been closely associated with Cricket Australia The person holding crickets No.1 position cant be somebody from outside the game. Were firm on that.         
	Meanwhile, Kenyas Samir Inamdar has failed in his bid to retain one of the three seats, on the Executive Board, earmarked for the Associate Members.         
	Its understood that Scotlands Keith Oliver got more votes than Inamdar, on Monday. Singapores Imran Khwaja and Bermudas Neil Speight retained their seats. Khwaja is, of course, a seasoned administrator.         
	An official announcement is unlikely to be made before Thursday.

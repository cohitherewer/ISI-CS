The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win will remain special: Anand
                                                                                                                       7                                      Win will remain special: Anand
                                  Viswanathan Anand in Chennai, on Monday        
	Chennai: Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand feels that after winning his fourth World Championship, he has proved his critics wrong about his lack of killer instinct in crunch situations.         
	Anand said the triumph was a special one. Generally people accuse me of lack of nerves or killer instinct. My nerves worked better. I defended the third title in a row and that is very special, he told reporters here.         
	Anand said the contest against Topalov was the toughest of the World Championship matches that he had played and his Bulgarian opponent was an incredibly tenacious fighter.         
	It was the toughest that I played. Every game was intense and hard fought. We almost never finished a game under four hours. It was exceptionally tense and nerve wracking, he said.         
	I knew that any way he was not going to offer draw (12th game). For the first time, we did not speak to each other during the match. Only at the end of the game, he spoke.         
	I generally had the edge over him (Topalov). Even there the dominance was not clear at all. That perhaps makes the joys of pulling it off in the end even greater, he added.         
	Comparing his latest world title with the earlier three, Anand said, It was tough on the chess board and off it. In general, I guess this is how the match is supposed to be. It was just that in the earlier championships, I suddenly built up a huge lead. But this match went the whole length. In that sense this championship was the sternest test that I ever faced.         
	There were many firsts en-route to Anands World Championship title.         
	It was the first time he travelled by bus to the Championship because of the volcanic ash emanated from Ireland. It was the first match between non-Soviets since 1921. It was the first time a player defended his title after losing the first game.         
	This is incidentally the first World Championship match that I played full length. Every other match finished actually ahead of schedule, Anand said.         
	As for the support he received from Gary Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik during the Championships, Anand said it gave him a boost.         
	It is difficult to say very precisely. There were many difficult moments in the match, a lot of tense moments, suddenly you get a phone call from Gary or Kramnik, and it definitely cheered me up a lot. This is the first time that I received this kind of help, he said.         
	Asked which of the matches in the Championship were tough, Anand pointed out four games. I should have drawn the eighth game. At the end of a long defence I mixed up and forgot a move that I had seen earlier. I am not trying to take credit away but if you press your opponent all the time, mistake will happen. But still, that is the tough way to lose a game. (PTI)

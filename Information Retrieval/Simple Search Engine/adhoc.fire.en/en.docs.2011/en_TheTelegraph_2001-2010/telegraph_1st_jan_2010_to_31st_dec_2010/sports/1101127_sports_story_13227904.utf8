	Chennai: City police Friday said that they were awaiting some crucial documents from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for taking their investigation to the next level in the Rs 470 crore misappropriation case against suspended Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi.         
	We have asked for two-three more crucial documents. They (BCCI) have promised to give it in three or four days. Once we receive these documents, we will go through it and take the investigation to the next level, police commissioner T Rajendran told reporters here. Asked whether Modi would be summoned, Rajendran said: He (Modi) is out of the country. Lets go through the documents first Because the entire complaint is in three parts and various people are involved in it. We will prioritise and see who can be summoned first.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amazed Kalmadi still at helm
                                                                                                                       7                                        Amazed Kalmadi still at helm
                    STICKWORK      GURBUX SINGH                    Bayern Munich players, in traditional Bavarian outfits, during a photo shoot, in Munich, on Monday. (Reuters)                                 
	It is now no longer a question of what Suresh Kalmadi and Company will take to leave Indian hockey because it seems that by the time they do, there would be nothing left to salvage. The damage done is unthinkable and has endangered Indias status as a hockeyplaying nation, putting a question mark over the teams participation at international events.         
	However, even this hasnt been the wakeup call I thought it would be and, very dangerously, things have now reached a limbo where there is no clear authority and complete anarchy. What is more disturbing is that some people are so aligned that they stand to gain from the continuation of this state of affairs.         
	But what can be said against Kalmadi that hasnt already been said? No accusation, no charge seems strong enough to force him to step down or retreat. Moreover, he cares little for reconciliation and cooperation. I would like to point out that the hockey people went to great lengths to get the IOA president to come to some kind of agreement/understanding that would allow the sport to run smoothly.         
	Indeed, he was offered uncontested the chair at Hockey India on the request that free and fair elections be allowed on the remaining posts. But the man who wanted everything would stop short at nothing to make sure his was the ultimate power. The kind that corrupts!         
	To that end and with the purpose of legitimising his stranglehold over Hockey India, elections to the board were held in the capital on August 5.         
	Manipulation and subversion reigned here too and the cartel that had fielded an overage Vidya Stokes as their candidate for president also made sure the votes came to them by directing state associations to send designated representatives to the polls.         
	There were eight clear cases of associations having sent members belonging to their state Olympic bodies who in turn voted for candidates owing allegiance to Kalmadi.         
	Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra had two votes each, just like the others, but the people casting those votes had nothing to do with hockey.         
	Had those 16 votes been cast impartially, then who knows, Pargat Singh might have won the elections. Really, that would have solved all problems. But, at the moment, confusion seems to be the fate of Indian hockey.         
	Pargat met the ministry of sports every stipulation and hence would have secured support in the government.         
	But Stokes, who is 85 years old now, meets none of the ministry guidelines and only had her way after threatening to challenge the sports ministrys decree in court. That, of course, would have meant another stay order.

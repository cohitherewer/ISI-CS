The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Westwood and Molinari set for the final battle
                                                                                                                       7                                        Westwood and Molinari set for the final battle
  - Atwal tied 38th after Round III; Woods fails to gain form       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES              Lee Westwood during the third round of the HSBC Champions,   in Shanghai, on Saturday. (Reuters)                                  
	One by one they fell away. Masters champion Phil Mickelson went first, followed by Martin Kaymer, winner of the US PGA, and finally Tiger Woods; all three inverting the Saturday tradition known as moving day, leaving the path clear for Herculean Englishman Lee Westwood to strengthen his hold on the world No. 1 ranking.         
	In play and bearing, Westwood looks increasingly, like those 19th century fairground strongmen, who paraded around the shires pumping iron in leopard skin loin cloths. Westwood made a puppy out of the monster Sheshan course in Shanghai, equalling the lowest score of the day, 67, in a round without blemish.         
	Absence from competitive golf appears to have no bearing on his ball striking or his psyche. Its like having an end of season break mid season, so much so that I am a lot fresher mentally than anybody else, he said. While most of the other golfers are starting to switch off, its like I am just switching on.         
	Westwood estimates that he is 85 per cent fit, which amounts to the health bulletin from hell for those in pursuit. He finished day three on 13 under par, one behind leader Francesco Molinari, who demonstrated what a player he might be were his work on the greens routinely in sync with his touch elsewhere.         
	Molinari is building his profile. Westwood is in a different place entirely, grinding inexorably towards golfs major prizes. Hope has no place in the champions schema. What is hope if not an investment in fate?         
	Westwood has not acquired the forearms of Popeye to sit back and hope the ball bounces his way.         
	When I play a golf tournament I look at the leaderboard but I dont see any other names. I see my name and the scores, and right now Im one behind the leader, which wont win the tournament. So Ive got to get above, he said.         
	And so in this state of glorious belligerence Westwood goes about his business, his driver a precision hammer off the tee, his irons fairway scalpels that open up the greens. Of his round yesterday, Westwood said:         
	All roads lead to the majors for Westwood, who reels off next years tournament schedule through to the US Open in June as if reading from a menu. Thats how dialled in he is to smashing the final barrier standing between him and immortality.         
	I know that I havent won a major championship. But I do know Ive probably played the most consistent golf in the world over the past two years, and that reflects in my world ranking. Its not a complicated system. Its a good system and a fair system. You dont hear the players moaning about it.         
	Indias Arjun Atwals fortunes kept fluctuating in a card of one-over 73 but he still managed to gain a couple of spots to be tied 38th.         
	His overall total stood at one-over 217 after he managed seven birdies, four bogeys and a double bogey.         
	Woods remains a work in progress. When I have to hit certain shots or I dont feel comfortable I kind of revert back to my old stuff and therein lies the problem. Im caught right in between. I just need to be patient.

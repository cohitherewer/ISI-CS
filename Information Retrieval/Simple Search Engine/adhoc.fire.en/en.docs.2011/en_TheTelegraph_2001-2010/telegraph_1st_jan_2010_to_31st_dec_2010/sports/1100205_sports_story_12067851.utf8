            A STAFF REPORTER                Karim Bencharifa (above) and Satyajit Chatterjee, at the Mohun Bagan tent, on Thursday. Telegraph pictures                             
	Calcutta: Change for the sake of change. Thats how Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra justified Karim Bencharifas ouster as coach.         
	In a packed news conference at the club tent, while Mitra was announcing the amicable parting of ways, Bencharifa was trying hard to keep his emotions in check.         
	We had many ups and a few downs. I wish the new coach and the team all the success, the Moroccan read from the statement he was handed over, in a choked voice.         
	Well, 30 minutes later, Mitra and his Man Friday Debashish Datta, were once again in front of the waiting newspersons. This time with a smiling Satyajit Chatterjee. He will be our new head coach till the end of this season, Mitra said.         
	Interestingly, Chatterjee was Karims deputy in 2008-09 and left in a huff just at the beginning of the current season.         
	I am honoured to be the coach of a club with whom I had a 15-year playing career. Never in my life have I thought of anything other than Mohun Bagan. This is my home, Chatterjee said.         
	I request support from all of you and will try my best to live up to the expectations, said the man who was praised by Bencharifa in June 2008 for a fantastic pre-season training. At that time, Chatterjee was preparing Branco Cardozos and Rakesh Masihs for the Bayern Munich match.         
	So, the Moroccan leaves an year and eight months into his job at Bagan in what the club wants us to believe was in an amicable manner. Or was it really amicable?         
	The way everything panned out in Goa, it seemed the club had decided to give him the boot. It was just a question of when? Just two losses, with 13 more matches left in the I-League, would not have prompted them to sack the coach.         
	It had been coming all right. It could have come after the October 25 match but Bagan banged five goals past East Bengal. Or after the Federation Cup semi-final loss to the red and gold brigade.         
	But they chose the Goa leg because the month-long break will give the new coach the time to settle down.         
	But on the face of it, Mitra said: We are a peoples club and we have to react when the pressure grows on the coach. Constant media scrutiny was taking a toll on him. In the current situation we (Bagan and Bencharifa) thought a change of guard would be the best option.         
	Mitra, however, was not convincing when asked why Bencharifa had to leave. His last years success made the fans asking for more. And in a club like Mohun Bagan a runner-up is as good as relegation.         
	Funny isnt? For this Bagan, till Bencharifa took over, were fighting for relegation and were spending crores on some ageing and misfiring strikers and slow defenders.         
	In the news conference, the club gave a clean chit to Bencharifa on the allegations that he met Salgaocar officials on the sly and had shattered a bus window in rage. Those were baseless allegations, Datta said         
	Neither did the senior players loss of faith help Bencharifas cause. His detractors say he was too foul-mouthed inside the dressing room although the players never said that it was ever an issue.         
	And then Jose Ramirez Barreto openly criticised the coach for his strategy after the Dempo loss. That was the last nail in the coffin, an official said.         
	For the record, Chatterjee attends his first practice session on Friday morning. Barreto, Marcos wont be there to welcome him as both are vacationing in Goa. Bagan will play their first match under Chatterjee on Monday in a CFL Premier Division match.

	Suraj Randivs deliberate no ball on Monday that left Virender Sehwag stranded on 99 wasnt the only incident that went against the spirit of the game. The following are some of the other instances:         
	 Ind vs WI Test (Bombay, Feb. 1948-49)         
	India needed 361 runs to win in 395 minutes. The West Indian fielders resorted to extreme time-wasting tactics and, as a result, India fell short by 6 runs.         
	 Aus vs Eng ODI (Melbourne, Feb. 1979)         
	England captain Mike Brearley placed all fielders, including the wicket-keeper, on the boundary line to prevent the Australians from hitting the four runs needed for a win off the last ball of the match. The 30-yard circle rule was framed after this incident.         
	 Aus vs Pak Test (Perth, March 1979)         
	Andrew Hilditch was given out for handling the ball to become the only non-striker to be dismissed thus. Hilditch had picked up a wayward throw that had rolled onto the pitch and handed the ball back to Sarfraz Nawaz, who appealed, whereupon the umpire had to give the Aussie batsman out.         
	 Aus vs NZ ODI (Melbourne, Feb. 1981)         
	In order to prevent New Zealand from scoring the six they needed to tie the game, Australia captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother, Trevor, to deliver the last ball underarm, along the ground. This action was technically legal, but was seen as being unsporting.         
	 Zim vs NZ Test (Bulawayo, Aug. 2005)         
	After a single, Christopher Mpofu ran down the pitch to congratulate Blessing Mahwire for reaching his fifty but was run out by Brendon McCullum. A few months prior to this New Zealand had won the ICC Spirit of Cricket award.         
	 NZ vs SL Test (Christchurch, Dec. 2006)         
	Muttiah Muralidharan was dismissed run out by keeper Brendon McCullum as he went to congratulate centurion Kumar Sangakkara upon reaching a century.         
	MOHANDAS MENON

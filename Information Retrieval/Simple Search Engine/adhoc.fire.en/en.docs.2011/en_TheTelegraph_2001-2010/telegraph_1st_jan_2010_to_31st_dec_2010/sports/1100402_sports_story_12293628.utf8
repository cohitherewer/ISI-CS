                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag manage a point vs Viva
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United paid the price for Edmilsons profligacy as they managed only a 1-1 draw against Viva Kerala in a 19th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium, here on Thursday.         
	Chirag could have walked away with full points had Edmilson converted those sitters in the second half. The match was a repeat of Chirags last game against Mahindra United where they lost after enjoying ball possession for the better part of the match.         
	The visiting team took the lead in the 28th minute when Sabeeth slipped in a through for Sirajuddin C. With the Chirag back-four stranded, Sirajuddin coolly slotted it past a surging Sandeep Nandy.         
	Within a minute, Chirag came close to scoring but Edmilsons shot was saved by K Sharath.         
	The equaliser came in the 37th minute, when the Brazilian was brought down just outside the box.         
	Rather than going for a booming pile driver, Edmilson went for a deft grounder. The ball hit the post and Ashim Biswas, who was lurking nearby, stabbed home the rebound.         
	Within another couple of minutes Edmilson dodged past one of the defenders and instead of passing the ball to Joshimar, who was standing unmarked, took a crack which was saved by Sharath.         
	In the second session, Edmilson missed the easiest chance of the day.         
	Joshimar turned the provider, but Edmilson, with only Sharath at his mercy, took a feeble left footer.         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Sandeep Nandy, Sukhen Dey, Kingshuk Dey, Eduardo Chacon, R. Dhanarajan, Gouranga Dutta (Gouranga Biswas, 73rd), Jayanta Sen, Denson Devadas, Ashim Biswas (Shankar Oraon 83rd), Joshimar, Edmilson

	MoM: Sirajuddin C

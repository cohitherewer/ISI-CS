	New Delhi: It was party time at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium as India beat Malaysia 3-2 in their Commonwealth Games (CWG) hockey opener here on Tuesday.         
	Backed by a wonderful crowd support, India ensured they made a winning start to their CWG campaign.         
	Though it will be too early to predict the teams future, Tuesdays win will be a shot in the arm for the Indian team. India next face Australia and Pakistan on October 7 and 10 respectively, and, only a victory in both matches will take them to the semi-finals.         
	Though the hosts dominated the match on Tuesday, they often seemed to run out of ideas once deep inside the Malaysian half. The visitors took lead in the 15th minute when Mohammed Jalil entered the Indian circle from the left and passed it to Rahim whose reverse hit eluded Bharat Chetri to find the Indian cage.         
	It looked a freak goal since Bharat was in perfect position to thwart it. India, however, equalised in the 27th minute off a penalty corner. Mahadik Dhananjays rasping hit found Roslan frozen on the goal line.         
	Malaysia soon nosed ahead. Rahim, on the break, played it to Misron Azlan, who scored in the 34th minute. The equaliser came a minute later when Sandeep Singhs penalty corner found the Malaysian net.         
	India dominated the match in phases but their defence wasnt exactly watertight. There were some nervous moments, thanks to Prabodh Tirkeys lack of sense, but the Malaysians failed to capitalise. India almost came close to scoring a self-goal till Gurbaj Singhs timely intervention saved the blushes.         
	In the second half, India made some early forays but failed to penetrate the Malaysian defence.         
	Finally, in the 29th minute, Bharat Chikar scored the winner when Tushar Khandkars shot was deflected off a Malaysian defender.         
	Chetri was brilliant under the bar, as he saved a couple of penalty corners that looked threatening.         
	Indian hockey coach Jose Brasa looked pleased with the victory. It was a good win. We had a few nervous moments, but finally managed to log full points. The crowd was tremendous, and, I want more of them when we take on Australia and Pakistan, Brasa said after the match.         
	We were nervous in the beginning, but as the match wore on we got into the groove. The second half, I think, was brilliant, he added.

	India: Bharat Chetri, Danish Mujtaba, Sandeep Singh, Arjun Halappa, Prabodh Tirkey, Mahadik Dhananjay, Sardar Singh, Dharam Vir Singh, Ravi Pal Singh, Sarwanjit Singh, Shivendra Singh, Gurbaj Singh, Tushar Khandkar, Raj Pal Singh, Vikram Pillay

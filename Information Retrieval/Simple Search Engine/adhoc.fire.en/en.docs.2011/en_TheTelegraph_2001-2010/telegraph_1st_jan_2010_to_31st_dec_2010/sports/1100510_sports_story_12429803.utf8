	Ipoh: Defending champions India quelled a late Korean surge to eke out a narrow 3-2 victory and stretch their unbeaten run in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here Sunday.         
	The Indian scorers were Arjun Halappa (10th minute), Tushar Khandker (45th) and Shivendra Singh (60th), while Korea scored through two penalty corner strikes by Nam Hyun Woo in the 12th and 70th minutes.         
	India began aggressively, mounting onslaughts with central midfielders Arjun Halappa and Vikas Pillay setting up wingers Mandip Antil and Tushar Khandker, who penetrated and split the Korean defence. They earned the first penalty corner in the fifth minute after Halappa found the foot of Korean captain and sweeper Lee Nam Yong.         
	India, who started with a 1-1 draw against China before beating Pakistan 4-2, have seven points from three matches, while Korea have three points. India will next challenge world champions Australia Monday. (PTI)

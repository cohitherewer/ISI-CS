The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When life is   a ball
                                                                                                                       7                                      When life is a ball
            ANSHUMAN ROY                            
	Calcutta: Many years later, one of the challengers, say the 14-year-old Souvik Ghosh, might croon those were the best days of my life.         
	And why not?         
	Having spent some surreal days with Brazil legend Romario and after being coached by his compatriot and World Cup-winner Branco, the Challengers XI, as the organisers would like us to call them, had an once-in-a-lifetime chance of getting up, close and personal with Diego Forlan.         
	Surely, Saturdays will never be the same again for these players.         
	The morning began with some useful tips from the Golden Ball winner at the Salt Lake Stadium. The man of the moment took some shots at the goal and the players, obviously in awe of him, just gaped.         
	It was just amazing, a player gushed. I cant believe I am spending time with Diego Forlan. I will treasure those snaps where he has posed with me.         
	In fact, the star-struck kids surprised Forlan with their knowledge about the Uruguayan. They were able to tell him that his paralysed sister (Alejandra) heads a charity run by him. He was really moved and surprised, an organiser said.         
	Forlan told the players not to think too much about Mohun Bagan, their opponents on Sunday.         
	Its not just the Challengers who were totally bowled over by the Atletico Madrid star.         
	In the evening, not a single scribe was complaining about the hour-and-a-half delay. After all, its a chance to see and interact with the 2010 World Cups best player.         
	And, when the man entered the ballroom, wearing a black tee and denim pants, even Branco seemed to pale in comparison.         
	There was the usual jostling and shoving for a vantage point, the usual yelling to tell you to move aside for that perfect frame, while all around there were craned necks desperate to catch a glimpse of the superstar. Professionalism be damned and happily so.         
	After all, its Forlan, isnt it?         
	When sanity returned, Forlan first uttered a mundane its nice to be in this city.         
	And, when the news conference started, an overzealous emcee wanted him to talk only about Sundays match.         
	But the presenter was ignored  Forlan was at his articulate best.         
	Also, one also cant help but feel jealous of Dipendu Biswas. The former India international had an opportunity of getting close to Diego Maradona on that December evening in 2008.         
	Now, he has Diegos autograph laminated on his drawing room wall and still treasures the pen which Maradona used during an auction.On Sunday, when he leads the Challengers, Forlan will be there with a helping hand. I think my life is made, Dipendu told The Telegraph.         
	Saturday was not forlorn in any way. Neither for the media, nor for the challengers!

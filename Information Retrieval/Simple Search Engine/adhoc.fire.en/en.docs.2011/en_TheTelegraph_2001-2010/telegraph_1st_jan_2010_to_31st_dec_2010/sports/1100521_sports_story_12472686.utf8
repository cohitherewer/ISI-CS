The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tug of loyalties for quartet
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tug of loyalties for quartet
    - Worried Chirag coach mulls moving squad out of town before title decider           A STAFF REPORTER                              Ashim Biswas (from top), Gauranga Biswas, Kingshuk Debnath and R. Dhanarajan                                 
	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya doesnt want to take any chances. With history beckoning Chirag  they need a point against Mohun Bagan on Tuesday to become the first team outside of the Big Three, since Eastern Railway in 1958, to win the CFL title  Bhattacharya wants to take his players to a residential camp in Kalyani.         
	The reason? Four of the Chirag players  Ashim Biswas, Gauranga Biswas, Kingshuk Debnath and R. Dhanarajan  have decided to join the green and maroon brigade for the next season and the likelihood of divided loyalties is not being ruled out.         
	Dhanarajan, Gouranga and Ashim are first-team regulars while central defender Kingshuk has had his share of starts this season.         
	Till the other day, the issue of divided loyalties was being spoken of in hushed tones. But, now, it has come out in the open.         
	What happens if Dhanarajan slips with Ishfaq Ahmed sprinting down the left? And what if Ashim misses with an open net and the Bagan goalkeeper at his mercy? How about Gouranga Biswass incisive runs down the left being absent on the particular day? A footballer can have an off day but the stakes are so high for Chirag, even the smallest of slip-ups can set the conspiracy theorists tongues wagging.         
	Yes, I am worried. I am fully aware that these players will be switching to Bagan next season. I dont know whether they have already accepted advance payments or not. If they have, they have done something ethically wrong. In any case, it is wrong for a club to disturb opposition players before the season is over, Bhattacharya didnt mince his words while speaking to The Telegraph, on Thursday evening.         
	Think about someone like Kingshuk. He was getting around Rs 4 lakh from Chirag. Ive heard he has got a hike of close to 400 per cent. For a youngster like him, this can be very disturbing, he added.         
	So whats the way out? Look, there is no option but to believe them. I hope they will give their 200 hundred per cent on Tuesday, Bhattacharya said. Thats why I am thinking of taking the whole squad down to Kalyani so that the players are not disturbed by unwanted elements. I can say from experience that the younger players have always been soft targets before crunch matches.         
	Bhattarcharya, once the darling of the green and maroon supporters, does not share a very good relationship with the present regime at Bagan. And, for him, victory on Tuesday would be akin to finding himself in seventh heaven.         
	Top Chirag official Alokesh Kundu and Bagan general secretary Anjan Mitra, however, tried to down play the issue.         
	We shouldnt question their integrity. Lets hope they give their best, said Kundu. Mitra, when contacted, shot back: The season is still not over. So, we shouldnt question their commitment.         
	The last time when the two played, in the I-League, Chirag surprisingly succumbed to a 5-0 defeat and the cynics did come up with outlandish theories.         
	If something like that happens on Tuesday, the Chirag players should be ready for a similar reaction.

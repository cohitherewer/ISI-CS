	Adelaide: It is a new brand of English bowling that Andrew Strauss team have pioneered in Australia, faute de mieux. Faute de mieux is a French phrase which means: in the absence of a really quick bowler or wrist-spinner.         
	In England a cricket ball is almost always moving around, or nibbling: all good Frenchmen know about that sort of thing, especially President Sarkozy. But in other, hotter climes, English bowlers of the conventional kind have always been at a bit of a loose end because the pitches are truer and the ball seldom deviates  until now, when there is nothing loose about them at all.         
	Englands players will say their bowlers put the ball in the right areas or bowled good lines and lengths. In other, more old-fashioned, words: Englands bowlers have become really accurate, perhaps more so than ever before, because the Big Four of a few years back  Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones  were so penetrative that they did not have to be supremely accurate.         
	So it was that Englands new-ball bowlers began accurately in the second Test and reduced Australia to the astonishing depths of two runs for three wickets. Then collectively the four of them bowled so accurately that even in intense heat and batting-friendly conditions, Australia could score only 245 runs.         
	The crowds were still queuing to get through security  eventually 38,000 entered the Adelaide Oval  as England first struck. Brains scramble when a big appeal is made for leg-before-wicket; batsmen panic like burglars caught in the act; they want to hasten away from the scene.         
	Such was Shane Watsons haste that his partner Simon Katich did not even try to dive for the sanctuary of the strikers crease as Jonathan Trott, running towards square-leg, bulls-eyed. The right height too  the base of the stumps  as well as pin-point accurate.         
	James Andersons first ball to Ricky Ponting was a beautiful outswinger. Going hard at it, Ponting edged to second slip. Michael Clarke is in no position at present to offer a vice-captains advice to Ponting, being all at sea. He simply did what his captain had done.         
	The one England bowler who was not supremely accurate was, naturally enough, Steve Finn, who is a 21 year-old in his first year of Test cricket: Shane Watson drove Finn whenever he deviated from the party line of just outside off stump. Mike Hussey played tip and run, and Australia reached lunch rather shaken by Englands assault, but with only three wickets down.         
	Thereafter, all of Englands bowlers were superb in their accuracy and, therefore, their application of pressure. In the afternoon, under a cloudless sky, they kept Australia down to 63 runs from 30 overs. And even though the pitch did slightly more off the surface than normal, this is still one of the worlds featherbeds.         
	The only trick that England missed was their field-setting for Hussey when he came in. Strauss field would have been ideal if Australia had been 150 for three. But they were two for three wickets, and Anderson was swinging the ball as much as it ever does under an Adelaide sun. Square-leg should have been in at bat-pad.         
	Graeme Swann, from the outset, bowled as nervelessly as he had nervously in Brisbane. No ball sat up and asked for punishment by Hussey, as quite a few had done at the Gabba. Before Tea Swann bowled 20 overs for 40 runs, to be rewarded by the prize wicket of Hussey when he edged a drive to slip.         
	Haddin played some fine shots but, once Hussey had gone at 207, he was left with as long a tail as Australia can have mustered for many a year: there was no Shane Warne, no Brett Lee, to cause trouble to a tired attack.         
	If these England bowlers do tire, that is, so fit have they become in their pursuit of accuracy and excellence. They seem as indefatigable by day as Berlusconi himself by night.         
	It was a crushing day for Australia and for Ponting, who had no hesitation about batting first. Englands bowling  and their fielding too  was, simply, magnifique.

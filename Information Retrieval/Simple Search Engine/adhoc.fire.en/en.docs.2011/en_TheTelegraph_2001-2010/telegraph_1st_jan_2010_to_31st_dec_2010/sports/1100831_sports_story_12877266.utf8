The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bookie   gets bail without charge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bookie   gets bail without charge
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                            
	The man at the centre of match-fixing allegations involving the Pakistan cricket team was Sunday night bailed without charge, police said.         
	Mazhar Majeed, 35, was arrested Saturday as officers investigated claims that reporters paid a middleman 150,000 in return for exact details relating to play during the Lords Test match.         
	The shocking fixing scandal, involving the Pakistan team, turned out to be a money spinner for the bookies with reports suggesting that the fixers may have raked in at least 20m from Pakistans matches in England this summer.         
	According to a report in a British tabloid, match-fixing crooks have so far earned at least 20m from Pakistans tour to England, which also involved a Test series against Australia.         
	The cut to players involved in the alleged scam could be around 6m, a police source told the tabloid.         
	There are huge amounts of money involved. A well-organised gang could easily have bagged tens of millions in a world-wide gambling operation, the tabloid quoted an expert as saying.While allegations hang around the Pakistan team, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is taking measures.         
	Apparently to tackle any legal issue which might crop up in the spot-fixing allegations, PCB Monday asked its legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi to stay put in London. I had come to London for some other work but now I have been instructed to look into this case as well, Rizvi said.         
	Rizvi said so far the Scotland Yard has filed no charges against any Pakistan player but they had been subjected to a lengthy questioning session.         
	The players remain innocent until proven guilty and right now we are just talking about allegations. The credibility of the person making such serious accusations has also to be taken into consideration, Rizvi said.         
	Meanwhile, a former legal advisor of the Board, Ali Waseem Sajjad said from what he has been hearing it seemed London police have some evidence on basis of which they have questioned the players in England.         
	It is very difficult to prove match-fixing has taken place but this time I think the police have some evidence on basis of which they have questioned our players in England.         
	That is why they have preferred to let the issue come out in the media so openly, said Sajjad.         
	A source in the team has informed that Pakistan could release any players under investigation.

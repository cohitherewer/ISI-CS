The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The man who holds the key
                                                                                                                       7                                        The man who holds the key
            ANSHUMAN ROY      PLAYER OF THE WEEK              Xavi                      
	Theres nothing new in what Xavi Hernandez is doing for the last one month in South Africa. For the last 10 years, the midfielder has been doing it time and again for Barcelona and Spain. Winning the ball in his own half, playing a precise pass to the man upfront.         
	Whether its Patrick Kluivert, Ronaldinho or Lionel Messi in Barcelona or Raul or David Villa in Spain, its Xavi who holds the key. The key, which unlocks even the meanest of defences in the world.         
	As Diego Maradona was quoted as saying in the build-up to the World Cup: One player, I would like to have in my team is Xavi. Every time I see Xavi, he lays down the law on the football field.         
	Xavis laidback style of playing belies the fierce competitor in him. He gives an impression as if it will be very easy to stifle him down. But ask Sami Khedira or Bastian Schweinsteiger, they will tell how difficult it is to pin down this 30-year-old midfielder.         
	On Wednesday, Xavi was just all over the German team. Leading the five-man midfield, Xavi dictated terms with pinpoint passing at times the Germans looked so exasperated. Its not just the Germans, the Paraguayans were at the receiving end in the quarterfinals, looking lost every time the ball was at his feet.         
	Actually, Xavi is new millenniums Pep Guardiola, his Barca coach and idol. And when Guardiola saw this man for the first time some 12 years back, he had famously told that star-struck youngster: You will force me to retire early.         
	Like Guradiola, Xavis cerebral and celestial style of football tells us that one day he will follow his idols footstep. That is to sit on the Camp Nou dug-out and giving instructions to the new breed of Barca stars.         
	A product of La Masia  Barcelona famous academy which gave the world the likes Guardiola, Carles Puyol, Andreas Iniesta and Lionel Messi  Xavi was taught from a tender age never to lose the ball.         
	Whatever the end result never lose possession. And when you lose, win it back.         
	And Xavi has followed that till now. He just doesnt like to lose the ball. Barcelonas success in recent years is much because of Xavi than Ronaldinho or Messi. He is the key, Franck Rijkaard, a die-hard Xavi fan, wasnt exaggerating.         
	Xavi came to this World Cup with a reputation. But his calf muscle injury threatened to spoil Spains progress.         
	 Till now he has managed to play with the three centimetre tear just above his calf, and how he is managing that is something his fans will like to know.         
	Probably the kick of being a World Cup winner driving him on. We won the Euro, and I want to win the World Cup, he had said recently.         
	Indeed. Spain and his millions of fans are waiting to see him and his mates on the podium on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag waits   to bat at No. 4
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sehwag waits   to bat at No. 4
    - Operner wait quit after 100th test                 Virender Sehwag                                 
	Jaipur: Virender Sehwags success as an opener notwithstanding, the swashbuckling batsman Friday said he still wants to bat in the middle-order and would have no qualms quitting the longer version after he has played his 100th Test match.         
	I have been successful as an opener but who knows, may be I would have been more successful in the middle order, said Sehwag, who Friday became the No.1 Test batsman.         
	I still would like to bat in the middle-order. Its difficult to field one-and-half days and then come out to bat in 10 minutes. When you bat at No. 6 like (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni, it allows you some rest said the cricketer at an awards function.         
	Sehwag, however, ideally would love to bat at No. 4 in Test matches and is ready to wait till Sachin Tendulkar, who has made the slot his own, retires.         
	I would love to bat at No. 4. I know I would not get that till Sachin retires, he quipped. But I can wait, he added.         
	Talking about the longer version, Sehwag said he would have no regret to quit once he has played his 100th Test. I want to play 100 Test matches and once I have done that, I may retire from Test cricket, said the 76-Test veteran.         
	Looking ahead, Sehwag felt his prime would last another 3-4 years at least.         
	Im 31 and I think Im playing well. And I would get only better in the next three-four years, he said.         
	Giving an inside into his batting philosophy, the explosive opener said aggression is his strength and any conscious effort to try and become a defensive batsman would only boomerang.         
	People say I take too many risks. But the fact is, there is risk involved in every shot. You can get out trying to defend a ball as well. At times, people tell me to leave ball outside the off-stump. But some of them can jag back and get you out if you dont play shots. I think if you think so much, you simply cannot bat, he said.         
	In my case, it would become risky if I try to become defensive, since my technique is not that good, he explained, much to the amusement of his audience.         
	I think in a different way. When I grew up, I tried to score off every ball, be it a 10-over-match, a 20-over or even a Test match. If I stay at the wicket for say about 30 minutes, I want to make the most of it and score maximum runs possible. You never know when you get out, try to score as much possible before that, he said.         
	Sehwag startled again when asked how he prepared before a particular Test match. I have never seen a pitch before a Test match in my life. Not even when I lead the side. If you see a track and find it a seaming one, you start thinking that your technique has to be correct, your feet movement has to be spot on. These are all rubbish...my philosophy is, see the ball and hit the ball, he said.

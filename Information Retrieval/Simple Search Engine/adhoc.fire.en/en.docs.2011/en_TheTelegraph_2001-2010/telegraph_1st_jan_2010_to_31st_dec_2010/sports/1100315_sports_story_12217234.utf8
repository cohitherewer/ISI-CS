                                                                                                                       7                                      King Khan gets his pedestal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner Shah Rukh Khan sat with his entourage in the specially constructed super hospitality structure on Sunday evening.         
	This was possible after a last-minute NOC from the public works department with the KKR authorities giving a written undertaking that they would be held responsible for any untoward incident.         
	It was learnt that the Mumbai-based construction company which worked on the super hospitality structure has given a written guarantee that they would take full responsibility were anything to happen to it.         
	When the letter was submitted to the chief secretary of the PWD, he gave the No Objection Certificate.         
	It is not a fit certificate that is mandatory. It is a NOC given to the KKR authorities after the written undertaking, informed a CAB official.         
	However, it has been learnt that CAB, which is the facilitator, neither has a copy of the undertaking nor of the NOC issued by the PWD.         
	On Saturday, the director of fire services, Gopal Bhattacharjee, had said that his department was not happy with the arrangements in the temporary structure and was not issuing the mandatory NOC.

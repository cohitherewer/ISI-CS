                                                                                                                       7                                      CSA mulls legal action
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa is exploring legal action against Herschelle Gibbs following the series of revelations in his controversial autobiography, released earlier this week. I have not read the book and cannot comment on what is reported in the press, said CEO Gerald Majola in a statement.         
	CSA has tasked its legal counsel to look into the matter and to advise us accordingly. Everybody concerned (including players) needs to wait for the outcome of CSAs processes which will be announced as soon as the Board has taken a view or a decision on the matter, he added.         
	Meanwhile, Mickey Arthur has described Gibbs as somewhat of a loner.         
	Hersch was a little bit of a loner, he sort of hung by himself, he never really mixed too freely with the rest of the group, said Arthur. He certainly didnt mix with Graeme at all.

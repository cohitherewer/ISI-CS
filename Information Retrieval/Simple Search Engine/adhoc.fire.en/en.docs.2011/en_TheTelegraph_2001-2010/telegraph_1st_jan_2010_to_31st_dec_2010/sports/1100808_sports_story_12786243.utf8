	Birmingham: Pakistan limped to 19 for 1 against England at stumps on Day II of the second Test on Saturday, needing another 161 to avoid an innings defeat at Edgbaston.         
	Imran Farhat was unbeaten on 10, while Azhar Ali was 5 not out, after James Anderson (1 for 1) had Pakistan captain Salman Butt caught for 0 by his England counterpart Andrew Strauss.         
	Earlier, Pakistan bowled England out for 251, restricting the hosts to a first-innings lead of 179 in a rain-interrupted session.         
	Pakistan was all out for 72 on Friday.         
	Saeed Ajmal took 5 for 82, including a spell of 4 for 2 as Englands last seven wickets fell for 46 runs, but Umar Gul tore a hamstring and will not bowl again in the match.         
	The record books will show Kevin Pietersen made Englands top score with 80 from 147 balls and 12 fours, but this was arguably the luckiest innings of his career.         
	Having twice been put down on Friday and seen another shot fly through the slips, Pietersen was dropped for a third time in the morning session and caught off a dead ball, before he was finally caught and bowled by Ajmal.         
	Jonathan Trott was Englands next highest scorer with 55, from 125 balls with seven fours.         
	At the end of Day 2, Ali and Farhat survived to stumps, when bad light halted play with 4.5 overs left.           (AGENCIES)

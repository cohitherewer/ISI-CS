The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hassan: Unfair on Shivendra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hassan: Unfair on Shivendra
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Former Pakistan star Hassan Sardar on Thursday came out in support of Shivendra Singh saying the two-match suspension handed out to the Indian striker by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) was a harsh decision.         
	It was injustice to Shivendra. He did not do it intentionally. The suspension should not have been there. Had the umpires knew it and shown a green card for example, it would have been a different matter, the Pakistan legend said.         
	Pakistan forward Rehan Butt also had a few kind words for the suspended Indian forward. You have seen the way an England player hit our Mohammed Irfan today (Thursday). For the same offence, Shivendra was suspended for two matches. I hope the tournament director have a look at the video and take similar action, Butt said.         
	Sardar, however, said he was disappointed by Pakistans performance. Asked why Sohail Abbas could not score from the penalty corners, he said: Sohail was brought here to convert the penalty corners. Unfortunately, he could not do so.

	Calcutta: Indias No. 1 squash player Saurav Ghosal is a disappointed that squash hasnt been included for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.         
	I was really disappointed when squash failed to make it for the Rio Games. I sincerely hope that the squash fraternity can collectively work to ensure that it is a part of the 2020 Olympics. I may not be around then but it will be a different high for players, said Ghosal at the inauguration of the PSA Indian Challenger and WISPA Indian Challenger .         
	The event is being organised by the Calcutta Racket Club, in association with The Telegraph, under the aegis of Squash Racket Federation of India (SRFI).         
	Ghosal who is currently world No 29 will take on Aaron Frankcomb in the opening round.         
	Its a challenging draw. I have beaten Frankcomb in our last meeting. But in a tournament like this anyone can beat anyone, the 23-year-old, who trains under Malcolm Willstrop in Leeds, stated.         
	Both Ghosal and womens No 1 Joshna Chinappa maintained that Comonwealth Games in New Delhi will be tougher than the Asian Games in Guangzhou.         
	In the Commonwealth Games, the Australian and British players will be there taking apart from the Malaysians. That makes the competition that much tougher, both said.         
	Ghosal, however, feels that if a country wants to groom young talent in this arena, they should follow the Egypt model.         
	Egypt is like a minefield of talented squash players. Their youth development system is phenomenal. If we can follow that certainly, we will find a lot more champions, he said.

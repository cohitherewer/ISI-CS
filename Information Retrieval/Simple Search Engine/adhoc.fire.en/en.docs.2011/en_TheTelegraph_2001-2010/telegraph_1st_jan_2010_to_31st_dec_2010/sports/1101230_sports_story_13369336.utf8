The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Battered Carlo gets a boost
                                                                                                                       7                                      Battered Carlo gets a boost
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Roman Abramovich is preparing to demonstrate his faith in Carlo Ancelotti by giving his under-pressure manager money to spend during next months transfer window. The Russian has told board members that he will not rush to dismiss Ancelotti despite a dismal run in which his Chelsea side have failed to win any of their past six matches and slumped to fifth in the Premier League table.         
	Abramovichs message was relayed to Ancelotti after training Tuesday, which came as a relief to the Italian.         
	Abramovich spent almost two years attempting to prize Ancelotti away from AC Milan and is not planning to give up on him at the first sign of trouble, particularly as he accepts that he has not benefited from the same level of investment as his predecessors at Stamford Bridge.         
	Abramovich dismissed Luiz Felipe Scolari suddenly in February last year because of fears that Chelsea would not qualify for the Champions League, but although the present side find themselves in a worse position in a far more competitive Premier League, the owner sees the situation differently and is refusing to panic.         
	Unlike Scolari, Ancelotti has a proven track record of success in England as a result of last seasons double, enjoys the full support of his players and has longer to turn things around as it is earlier in the season.         
	Abramovich is also aware that Ancelotti has had to work with a small squad as a result of economies undertaken last summer, a limitation he is planning to address next month as long as Chelsea do not lose their two home matches this week, against Bolton and Aston Villa.         
	Ancelotti has requested a centre back to provide cover for the injured Alex, with Gary Cahill, of Bolton, the most likely target on a shortlist that also features David Luiz, of Benfica, and Diego Godin, of Atletico Madrid.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettel sets the pace at practice
                      
	Budapest: Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel had the best times during both the 90-minute practice sessions for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Friday.         
	In the morning session, Vettel outpaced teammate Mark Webber, while in the afternoon laps the German driver repeated his dominant performance and was quicker than Ferraris Fernando Alonso by 0.49 seconds.         
	Red Bull and Ferrari alternated the other top places in the afternoon, with Webber third, ahead of Ferraris Felipe Massa  back at the scene where he suffered near-fatal skull fractures in a qualifying crash last year.         
	It was just normal to go back on the track, Massa said. It was nice to be back after what happened last year but I didnt think about it when I was in the car.         
	Meanwhile, the Force India Formula One team were fined 5,000 euros ($6,524) at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Friday for muddling up their tyres for the second time in two race weekends.         
	Stewards said in a statement that reserve driver Paul di Resta, standing in for Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi in the first practice session, had been sent out with a set of tyres reserved for Saturday and Sunday use only.

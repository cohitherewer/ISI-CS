	Madrid: David Ferrer crushed Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 to fire depleted champions Spain into the quarter finals of the Davis Cup on Sunday and set up a clash away to nine-times winners France. Then Nicolas Almagro beat Marco Chiudinelli 6-1, 6-3 in the inconsequential rubber. Spain won 4-1.         
	France, 2009 finalists Czech Republic and 2005 winners Croatia all progressed 3-0 on Saturday, the French defeating Germany in Toulon, Czech Republic ousting Belgium in Bree and the Croats seeing off Ecuador in Varazdin. The Croats made it 5-0 Sunday.         
	World No. 16 Ferrer took the first set on the clay at the Plaza de Toros de la Ribera, before 19th-ranked Wawrinka stormed back to open a 4-1 lead in the second.         
	However, the Spaniard reeled off five straight games and Wawrinka lost his cool at 5-4 down, smashing his racket into the ground and incurring a point penalty.         
	The Swiss, leading his side in the absence of world No. 1 Roger Federer, fell to pieces in the third set in the face of some brilliant play from Ferrer that delighted the boisterous red and yellow-clad Spanish fans.         
	It was Spains 19th straight win in Davis Cup home ties stretching back to a defeat by Brazil in 1999.         
	Playing here in front of your fans is the greatest thing for a tennis player, Ferrer said in a television interview. The match against France will be a tough hurdle but I think we have the squad to keep this run going.         
	The Czechs will play Chile or Israel in Julys quarters, while Croatia will take on the United States or Serbia.         
	The tie between Chile and Israel in Coquimbo was rescheduled to start on Saturday because of the disruption caused by last weekends earthquake and the Chileans took both points in the opening singles for a 2-0 lead going into Sundays doubles.

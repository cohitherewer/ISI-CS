	Paris: Leander Paes and Cara Black advanced to the quarter finals of the French Open mixed doubles after a hard-fought victory in super tie-breaker over Su-Wei Hsieh and Bruno Soares here Monday.         
	The second seeded Indo-Zimbabwe pair beat the unseeded Chinese Taipei-Brazilian duo of Hsieh and Soares 7-5 2-6 1-0 (10-8) in a second round match which lasted 111 minutes and spread over two days. Rain delay and bad light had forced the match to stop Sunday night after Paes and Black were leading 7-5, 0-2.         
	In the quarters, Paes and Black will take on another unseeded duo, Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan and Julian Knowle of Austria.         
	Partnering with Lukas Dlouhy of Czech Republic, Paes, the lone Indian remaining in the fray in the clay court Grand Slam, has also reached the quarter finals of the mens doubles.

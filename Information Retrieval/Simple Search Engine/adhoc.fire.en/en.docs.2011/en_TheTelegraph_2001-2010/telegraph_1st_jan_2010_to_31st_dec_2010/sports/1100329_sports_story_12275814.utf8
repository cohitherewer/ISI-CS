            A STAFF REPORTER              Chirag Uniteds Brazilian striker Joshimar tries to get past Mahindra United defenders at the Salt lake Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                      
	Calcutta: Mahindra United put up a professional performance as they defeated Chirag United 1-0 in an 18th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium, here on Sunday. Subair Murithala Ali scored the winner in the 56th minute.         
	Following a throw-in, D. Ravanan headed the ball inside the box for an unmarked Murithala who got enough time for a bicycle kick. With neither Eduardo Chacon nor Safar Sardar closing him down, the Murithala effort caught the entire Chirag defence unawares. Even goalkeeper Sandip Nandy did not have any clue.         
	The win took Mahindra to 33 points from 18 games, while Chirag United remain on 29 from same number of matches.         
	With neither of the teams able to make decisive inroads in the opposition territory, adjudging Murithala as the Man-of-the-Match wasnt a tough decision. He now has 13 goals in the League, one less than Joshimar.         
	Chirag might have had more possession, it was a 15-minute spell in the second half that got Mahindra three important away points before the crucial match against Dempo.         
	At the post-match news conference, Mahindra coach David Booth rightly pointed out that his boys were never really under pressure.         
	Agreed they had better ball possession but they didnt have any shots at goal. They were generally playing the long balls and we needed to close them down. We did that and there was no pressure, Booth said.         
	With Joshimar unusually coy in front of the goal and Ashim Biswas completely off-colour, Chirag lacked the initiative on Sunday. Even the crosses delivered by the two Gourangas  Dutta and Biswas  were lacked direction and hardly bothered Mahindra goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury.         
	Teams         
	Mahindra United: Subhasish Roy Chowdhury; Dharmaraj Ravanan, Kalialaudeen Nishtar, Lamine Tamba (Justine Stephen, 49), Debabrata Roy; Steven Dias, N.P. Pradeep (K. Ajayan, 64), Sushant Mathew, Paresh Shivalkar; Subair Murithala Ali, Mohammed Rafi (Thoi Singh, 75).         
	Chirag United: Sandip Nandy; Safar Sardar, Kingshuk Debnath, Eduardo Coelho, S. Dhanarajan; Gouranga Dutta (Sankar Oraon, 82) , Denson Devdas, Jayanta Sen (Lalkamal Bhowmick, 56), Gouranga Biswas (Shylo Malsawmtluanga 69); Josimar Martins, Ashim Biswas.         
	Referee: P.K. Bose (M.P.)         
	MoM: Subair Murithala Ali

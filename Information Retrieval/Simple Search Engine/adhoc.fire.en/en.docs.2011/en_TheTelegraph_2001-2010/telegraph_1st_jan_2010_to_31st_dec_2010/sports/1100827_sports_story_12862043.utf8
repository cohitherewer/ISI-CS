The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cyclists get a raw deal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cyclists get a raw deal
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian cycling probables, currently training in Patiala for the Commonwealth Games, are still waiting for their new cycles to arrive.         
	With only 37 days left for the Games, their preparations have been badly hampered as they were supposed to train with the new cycles, which will be used in the competition.         
	All 27 probables at the national camp are using their own cycles as neither the Sports Authority of India (SAI) nor the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) have cared to look into their needs, one of the coaches informed.         
	Things are extremely bad here, lamented the coach.         
	We use imported cycles for competitions. For the past one year, we have been pleading for cycles without any result. Now we have been told the cycles will arrive only in mid-September. How can our cyclists prepare in such a short time? he fumed.         
	KVS Sidhu, a former national champion and an official of the Cycle Federation of India (CFI), seconded the national coach. He said: This drama has been going on for the past one year. First the SAI invited tenders, but since it did not receive enough responses, the responsibility of buying the cycles was passed to the IOA.         
	Now that the IOA has also failed to get the cycles, the onus of buying cycles is back on sports ministry and SAI, Sidhu said.         
	They again floated fresh tenders and have assured us that cycles will arrive, but only in the third week of September. But, by then, it will be too late, he added.         
	CFI alleged that they need at least 54 cycles for 27 probables and 15 more after the final selection of the team, but SAI is reluctant to give more than 27 cycles.

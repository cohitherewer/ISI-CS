The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag win on late surge
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chirag win on late surge
            A STAFF REPORTER            Joshimar                           
	Calcutta: Two late goals from Brazilian striker Joshimar Da Silva helped Chirag United beat Eastern Railway 2-0 in a CFL Premier Division match on Thursday.         
	After a barren first half, when it appeared that Chirag would drop points, Joshimar came to the rescue with a couple of opportunistic strikes, in the 82nd and 88th minutes, respectively.         
	Chirag now have 17 points from seven matches. The twin strikes earned the burly striker the Man of the Match award in their fifth victory of the campaign.         
	If Joshimar scored the goal, it was Ashim Biswas, who made a comeback after a season-long injury lay-off, playing provider on both occasions.         
	For the first goal, Ashim set up Joshimar after receiving the ball from Soumik Chakrabarty who had overlapped from the right. All Joshimar had to do was place it past a diving Jayanta Paul.         
	On the second occasion, it was Ashim whose measured centre from the left found an unmarked Joshimar who headed home unchallenged.         
	Meanwhile, Nigerian Baba Tunde netted a hattrick as BNR beat West Bengal Police 3-1 in another league match. Kishore Mullick reduced the margin for the policemen. The match between George Telegraph and Calcutta Port Trust ended in a 1-1 draw. Abiola and Kaushik Prasad scored for either side.

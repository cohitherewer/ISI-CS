            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans (from left) Okonyo Diamondstar, Edeh Chidi and Jose Ramirez Barreto discuss a point, at the club ground, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan captain Ishfaq Ahmed had a very low-key Eid celebration on Saturday. After all there is a big match against Chirag United in the Calcutta Football League on Sunday. The Bagan captain, however, promised to celebrate it in a big way if his team manage to log full points. I want to concentrate on Sundays match. Its a big match for us, he said on Saturday.         
	Its true that Sundays match is big for Mohun Bagan and Ishfaqs teammates will have to raise their game by a few notches if they want to see their captain smiling. Barring Jose Ramirez Barreto and Edeh Chidi, none of the Bagan players have looked ready for the grind till now. Jayanta Sen has been woeful, Okonyo Diamondstar already looks to be a bad investment and the likes of Kingshuk Debnath and R Dhanarajan have looked very unimpressive.         
	You may say these are the early days but still it doesnt look bright for Bagan. No wonder Ishfaq has reserved his Eid celebrations for Sunday. For anything can happen with this team. Just the other day, Aryan went away with full points!         
	Agreed Bagan have an enviable frontline consisting Barreto, Chidi and Subair Murithala Ali. But that alone cannot guarantee success. Unless and until, there are some good reinforcements before the real action begins, Bagan once again will be left twiddling their thumb. Like they have done in the last few seasons.         
	Barreto probably knows that too well. So when he was asked some questions, obviously not to his liking, the usually amiable Brazilian lost his cool.         
	Go and watch East Bengal play, tune in the telly, follow EPL and Spanish League. You people have this tendency of seeing everything bad in Bagan, the Brazilian shot back at the club tent on Saturday.         
	Bagan on Sunday will go with Barreto, Chidi and Murithala upfront and it will be interesting to see how Chirag handle them. Defender Chika Wali and company surely will have a tough time.         
	Chirag, like Bagan, did not have a good start in the CFL  they lost to Southern Samity in their last match  but still, would like to avenge their 2009-10 defeat which gave the green and maroon brigade their third league title on the trot.         
	We are confident of pulling it off. Last time it was a close call, Denson Devadas said.         
	Incidentally, Devadas faced disciplinary action for giving the referee a peck on the cheek after being given a red-card in that match.         
	However, the IFA let him off after his brace gave Bengal the Santosh Trophy after 11 years. Hopefully nothing of that sort will happen on Sunday, he said.

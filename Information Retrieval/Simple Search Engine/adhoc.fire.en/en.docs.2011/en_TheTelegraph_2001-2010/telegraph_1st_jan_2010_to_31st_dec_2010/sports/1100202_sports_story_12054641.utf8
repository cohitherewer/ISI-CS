The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib Malik to lead in T20
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shoaib Malik to lead in T20
                      
	Lahore: Beneficiary of the ball-biting episode that earned Shahid Afridi a two-match ban, former captain Shoaib Malik will lead Pakistan in Fridays one-off Twenty20 International against Australia in Melbourne.         
	Malik will lead the Pakistan team in the only Twenty20 match against Australia in the absence of Afridi, the PCB said in a statement Monday.         
	Analysts here believe the decision to revert back to Malik is a clear indication that the Board might be thinking on the lines of bringing him back as captain of the Test and one-day sides as well.         
	Meanwhile, former Test captain Ramiz Raja has called for drastic changes in the national side after their disastrous tour of Australia. Ramiz said that the present Pakistan batsmen lacked discipline, self-belief and technique to beat the top sides at the moment.         
	The way I see it, you need to carry out a comprehensive surgery to set things right because the team performed very poorly in Australia, he said.         
	Another former captain Inzamam-ul Haq lashed out at Shahid Afridi and said that the all-rounder was extremely fortunate to have escaped with just a two-match ban after the ball-tampering.         
	A six-member inquiry committee, headed by the Pakistan Cricket Board chief operating officer Wasim Bari, has been formed to probe into the teams disastrous performance.           (PTI)

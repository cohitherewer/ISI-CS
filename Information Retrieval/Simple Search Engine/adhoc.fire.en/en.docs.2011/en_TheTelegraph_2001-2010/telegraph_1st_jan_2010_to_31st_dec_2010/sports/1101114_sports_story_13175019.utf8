                                                                                                                       7                                        Dont know when I last played on a turner, says Harbhajan
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan, on Saturday                           
	Hyderabad: Harbhajan Singh, who claimed four wickets to hasten New Zealands collapse in the first innings, feels that it was actually Zaheer Khans two early wickets in the day that provided India with an upperhand in the second Test.         
	Speaking at a media conference, the off-spinner also spoke of the need to have sporting tracks to save Test cricket.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Indias performance on the day         
	We are happy with our show Satisfied with the situation that we are in. Now onwards, we need to bat well, surpass their total and put up as many runs on the board as possible.         
	His own bowling         
	Its good to get wickets I give my inputs for setting the field when I am bowling And we need to bowl according to the situation and the field. So, its good when success comes.         
	On Zaheer taking two crucial wickets early in the day         
	Zaheer is in tremendous form It is great to see him bowling at his best. In fact, he has done extremely well in the last two years. Today also, he gave us the edge by picking up two early wickets, which were extremely crucial.         
	Mood in the dressing room after Sehwags dismissal         
	It is obviously unfortunate for him to miss the hundred But he always bats for the team. Today, he set the tone for us with his brisk innings.         
	Sachin being one short of his 50th Test century         
	We need more runs tomorrow (Sunday) And it will be great if, in the process, Sachin reaches the milestone. It will be a memorable experience for the entire team.         
	The Hyderabad wicket         
	This is a good wicket for Test cricket... There is good bounce for fast bowlers, even for spinners. . I hope it will continue to play even better for the bowlers as the days go on.         
	On why the Indians are not provided with turning tracks to exploit home conditions         
	I think this question should be asked to those people who make the wickets I dont know when I last played on a turner. Maybe, the last time we got a turning track was in Kanpur (against South Africa, in 2008).         
	The importance of sporting wickets         
	Test cricket needs to be preserved. Were not necessarily asking for a track that will only help spinners. A sporting track just means that on the first day, the fast bowler must get the carry The edges must carry to the wicket-keeper. On the fourth and fifth days, if there is turn and bounce, whats wrong with it? CCI (Brabourne stadium) was probably the best wicket I have played.

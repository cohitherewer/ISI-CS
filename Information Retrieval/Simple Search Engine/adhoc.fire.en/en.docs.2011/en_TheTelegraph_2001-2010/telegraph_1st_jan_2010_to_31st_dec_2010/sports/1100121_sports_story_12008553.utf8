            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Lajong FC suffered their second successive defeat as they went down 1-3 to Mumbai FC in an eleventh round match of the I-League at the Cooperage, here on Wednesday.         
	After a bright start when Anil Gurung tested the hosts defence with his speed, Lajong conceded the lead in the 22nd minute through an own goal by Niwan Gatphoh.         
	But Stanley Rozarios men put up a strong fightback and the equaliser came five minutes into the second half when, as a poetic justice, Gatphohs shot took a deflection of E Anas and went in.         
	Gurung and his partner Seikhahao Tuboi, returning to the side after missing the 5-0 drubbing against Mahindra United last week, continued to be a menace for Khalid Jamils team.         
	But Mumbai FC began to dictate terms and the second goal came in the 73rd minute from Abhishek Yadav who headed in a 35-yard free kick by Subhas Chakraborty.         
	Chakraborty then sealed the issue with a goal, in the 86th minute.

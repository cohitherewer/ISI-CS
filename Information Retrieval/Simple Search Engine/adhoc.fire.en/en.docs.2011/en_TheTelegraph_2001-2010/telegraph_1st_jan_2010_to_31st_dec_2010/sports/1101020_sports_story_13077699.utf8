The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Feeling no pressure, says Michael Clarke
                                                                                                                       7                                        Feeling no pressure, says Michael Clarke
  - We always play competitive cricket: Aussie captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT            David Warner during a training session in Visakhapatanam, on Tuesday. (AP)                                 
	Visakhapatnam: Australian captain Michael Clarke has denied feeling any pressure ahead of the two ODIs because of his poor form.         
	While he hoped for a full game of cricket after the washout in Kochi, he said it would be silly to take the young Indian squad lightly, at a press conference here on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If the Aussies are a bit under-prepared going into the match         
	Both teams are exactly the same... Its about getting what you can get today. Most of our players have been playing domestic cricket before coming here. We have no excuses, we have one day to get ready and give our best tomorrow.         
	Doug Bollingers injury         
	He is going well... He has not done enough bowling though. The physio is happy with his improvement. But we need to make sure he bowls 10 overs for us tomorrow, otherwise I dont think its worth a risk.         
	On David Warner         
	He is a very exciting player. He had a lot of success in T20 format. But again, not sure whether he will play tomorrow. Well decide on the team once we finish training...         
	If hes upset with the criticism about his form         
	Not at all. Everybody is entitled to give their opinion. My performances in the Test series were not good enough, so I deserved that criticism. I am very disappointed about that. But I cant change that. Im training very hard as possibly as I can. Im not at all under pressure. Im really excited about these two one-day games.         
	On the dew factor and the first match under lights at this venue         
	The dew is pretty important. The weather has been fantastic. Its great and exciting to play the first day/night match here. The dew certainly plays a role in India.         
	Yuvraj Singhs form         
	I think hes a great part of the game. You can still contribute with bowling or fielding ... You have ups and downs in your career. But the main thing is to help the team achieve success.         
	His take on the series         
	Its a huge one-day series, there are a lot of new guys... Its going to be a fantastic experience. It will be tough. India have got a young squad, but there is a lot of talent out there. We have one day to prepare. We all are excited to see the sunshine... Hope the same weather continues tomorrow.         
	The frequency of India-Australia matches         
	The more they play the more comfortable for the players We are very lucky that the IPL is played here, we are lucky that a lot of Test and one-day cricket is played here. We spend a lot of time. Certainly I am more comfortable here than when on my first tour. Thats part of being an international cricketer. The fans love seeing competitive cricket and Australians bring that.

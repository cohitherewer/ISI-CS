            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: They havent been best of friends during the last five years. However, on Tuesday, the former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya and present BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan exchanged pleasantries as the latter dropped in at Eden Gardens to watch the third days proceedings of the second Test between India and South Africa.         
	I enjoyed meeting Mr Dalmiya, Srinivasan, who was in the city to convene the selection committee meeting for the ODI series, said at the end of the days play.         
	I have come to Calcutta many times for Board meetings but I have never watched any international match at the Eden. This is the first time I am watching a Test match at this venue. It feels nice. All the more because India is doing really well and I am hoping that we win the match by tomorrow (Wednesday), he added.         
	In fact, both Dalmiya and Srinivasan had a long chat over lunch on the day and the eyewitnesses say that the meeting was cordial.         
	The Board secretary was greeted at the airport by the Cricket Association of Bengal joint secretary Biswarup Dey who is also a member of the BCCIs Tours, Programmes and Fixtures committee.

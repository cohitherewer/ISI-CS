            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indian women crushed Sri Lanka by 71 runs in a must-win Group B match to qualify for the semi-finals of the Womens World Twenty20 in Basseterre (St. Kitts).         
	With a victory apiece against Pakistan and a defeat to the in-form New Zealand, both the sides went into the match with a semifinal place at stake, but the Indian eves produced a clinical all-round display to knock the islanders out of the tournament.         
	Off-spinner Diana David (4/12) wreaked havoc with the ball to restrict Sri Lanka to 73 for nine after India rode on twin half-centuries from opener Sulakshana Naik (59 off 54 balls) and Mithali Raj (52 not out off 39 balls) to post a commanding 144 for three in their allotted 20 overs.         
	Defending the total, Diana mowed down the Lankan top order to restrict Sri Lanka well ahead of the 100-run mark with just two batters  Deepika Rasangika (31 not out) and Eshani Kaushalya (10)  managing double digit scores.

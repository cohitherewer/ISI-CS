The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This time, Yuvi loses out to rookie Pujara
                                                                                                                       7                                        This time, Yuvi loses out to rookie Pujara
  - Test Series     -  Looking at the bigger picture, selectors pick Sreesanth         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Despite being dropped by the selectors, theres no slump in Yuvraj Singhs popularity, as was evident in Patiala, on Monday. (PTI)                                       
	Calcutta: The Galle Test, two months ago, will forever be remembered as Muttiah Muralidharans last. It may also just turn out to be Yuvraj Singhs last, for the time being, at least.         
	In the foreseeable future, after all, everything points to Yuvraj only being considered for ODIs and T20 Internationals. For that to change, something dramatic has to happen.         
	Having lost his No.6 position to Suresh Raina, in Sri Lanka, it was taken for granted that Yuvraj would find it very tough to retain his place even in the squad, for the two-Test series against Australia, which begins in Mohali on October 1.         
	Yuvrajs worst fears  one can say on authority that he did have them  came true on Monday afternoon, when the selectors ignored him while choosing the XV for Mohali and Bangalore.         
	The second Test is from October 9.         
	Of course it is a disappointment, but disappointments have become a part of my life, Yuvraj told the media in Patiala.         
	Its not the first time that Yuvraj has been dumped, but never before did he react within hours of being unwanted. Just goes to show that, this time, the hurt goes deep.         
	Instead of Yuvraj, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) have shown faith in rookie Cheteshwar Pujara.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten werent present at the meeting in Chennai. Both are in South Africa. Kirstens views, it seems, were ascertained by the chief selector.         
	That Pujara, a 22-year-old Saurashtra right-hander, was a strong contender had been reported in these columns. Incidentally, hes served as one of Shah Rukh Khans Knights in the IPL.         
	Its no consolation, but Yuvraj has been named the Rest of India captain for the Irani Trophy.         
	Raina got his chance when Yuvraj became ill, on the eve of the second Test (at the SSC, in Colombo) and made the most of that break. He hit a quality hundred on debut and followed it up with impressive scores in the decider, at the P.Sara Oval, in Colombo again.         
	Such was Rainas run that he topped the averages (111.50).         
	Actually, not being picked for the final Test was message enough for Yuvraj. In any case, The Telegraph learns that Kirsten had been exceedingly blunt in explaining why the team management felt he had to sit with the reserves and not be out on the park.         
	If injuries and illnesses hadnt been helping, Rainas spectacular start in Test cricket made it worse for Yuvraj. That hes seen as somebody who doesnt work hard enough has been a negative in his balance sheet throughout.         
	Sadly, no matter how much Yuvraj sweats it out, the strong impression that hes a playboy first and, only then, a cricketer, remains.         
	For years, Yuvraj was in the shadow of his one-time mentor, Sourav Ganguly. Now, he has to contend with Raina and Pujara.         
	Two factors came into play... Pujara has been performing big in domestic cricket and doing very well on the A tours... He needed to be rewarded... Then, if Yuvraj cant make the Test XI, theres no point making him sit in the dressing room, a well-placed source said.         
	Where the quintet is concerned, it probably feels Yuvraj has been spared the agony of water-boy taunts.         
	October 3, by the way, is when Yuvraj completes 10 years as an India cricketer. He wont be in the mood to celebrate, though.         
	Given his class, if Yuvraj gets a hold on himself, the selectors could eventually have to eat humble pie.         
	As expected, Zaheer Khan has made a comeback. Hed missed the Sri Lanka tour owing to an injury. In the squad, too, is Sreesanth  another injury-prone medium pacer.         
	Abhimanyu Mithun is to consider himself unlucky, but if you look at the bigger picture, and the tour to South Africa later this season, then youll appreciate why Sreesanth had to be brought back. If he breaks down, yet again, then his claims are going to be set aside, the well-placed source added.         
	Sreesanth, it may be recalled, had been the MoM in the first Test (Johannesburg) on our last tour to South Africa  2006-07.         
	Squad for the test series               
	Batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay, Suresh Raina, Cheteshwar Pujara         
	Wicket-keeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.)         
	Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha         
	Medium pacers: Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Seeking Messi as the heir 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Seeking Messi as the heir 
            ROB HUGHES                                  Argentinas captain Javier Mascherano and Lionel Messi during a training session in Pretoria      
	Johannesburg: Argentina may not win this World Cup, but it will pose one of the most intriguing human questions of the tournament: Can Diego Maradona manage Lionel Messi?         
	Maradona is Argentinas coach, giving Messi, the teams star, a free role in their opening World Cup match against Nigeria in Johannesburg on Saturday. They were both small boys, but people observed in their childhood that they were destined to become soccer greats.         
	Maradona led Argentina to victory in the World Cup in 1986, and put himself up there with Pele, Cruyff, Zidane and another Argentine, Alfredo di Stefano, as the best players of all time.         
	He could earn a place in that quintet. Messi has the talent, the speed, the balance, the beauty of movement, the ability to outwit an entire defense and score goals. But that is the Messi of FC Barcelona. The Messi of Argentina has not looked the same game winner, or even a player sure of his place on the national team.         
	The paradox has grown since Maradona became the national team coach in November 2008.         
	The countrys aging soccer president, Julio Grondona, gambled everything on a hunch that genius would feed off genius. He presumed that, if anyone could understand what Messi needed to fulfill his pressurised role, it could be Maradona.         
	There has been little evidence to date that Maradona, the nations fallen idol, knows how to convert performance into sage team management. This is unsurprising, given that his fame, and sometimes notoriety, relied heavily on his doing things without really thinking how he did them.         
	If there is such a thing as a sports genius, Maradona looked the part  as a player.         
	There are signs of Messi growing into a similar role. He shines for Barcelona, but seems lost, almost forlorn, with Argentina. Messi is trying hard, no question, but why has this dichotomy emerged? If soccer is so simple a game, why does suspicion arise between two men who presumably want the same thing? The situation is the more remarkable because Argentina has at its disposal seven exciting goal-scorers  more than any other country, Brazil included.         
	What Argentina lacks is team mentality. Maradona was made national coach without even a basic apprenticeship in management. The most telling perspective on this has been made by Cesar Menotti, who coached Argentina to win the 1978 World Cup.         
	Things are completely different, Menotti said last year. Messi started as a boy with Barcelona. He came onto the bench, then he was allowed to play a few minutes before claiming a regular place. Messi is not responsible for the strategy at Barcelona, he added. That is Iniesta and Xavi. Messi is the one that completes the moves. Argentina, however, expects Messi to cope with the strategy of the team, to create goals, score goals, to do everything.         
	The end result, Menotti said, is, With Barcelona, Messi plays. With Argentina, he runs. So has Messi become part of the problem, rather than the solution to Argentinas puzzle?         
	It would be too harsh to suggest Messi lacks the savvy of Maradona in his time.         
	Messi is still only 22, and at that age Maradona crashed out of the 82 World Cup when he was red-carded for a willful two-footed kick back against a Brazilian. Maradona atoned by inspiring Argentina to win the next World Cup. By then, Maradona was the best he would ever be. He was mature, mischievous and masterful, and he carried his country with him.         
	If Messi were to replicate that now, he would be ahead of schedule. But he couldnt do it alone, and Argentina needs to find better balance between attack and defence.         
	Maradona must quickly create a group ambiance. He is not the star performer any longer, and he has to trust the one who should be. Maradona says he urges his players: Thirty days of sacrifice for the chance to kiss the World Cup is nothing in the life of a man. An achievement like this is like touching the sky. I played in two World Cups; I earned the right to talk on this subject.         
	There is a sense that the further Argentina goes in this tournament, the closer Messi might come to emulating Maradona. There is the hope that there is no suppressed resentment from the coach because of Messis youth and his untarnished reputation.         
	For all that draws them together, Messi will never be Maradona. They are different men, from different backgrounds. It is 300 kilometers from Buenos Aires, where Maradona grew up, to Rosario, the birthplace of Messi.         
	 To this day, Maradona looks for fighting spirit in his men, but in the news conference before the game Saturday against Nigeria, Maradona acknowledged Messis value.         
	Thank God hes an Argentine, he said. We are hungry for glory. I see it similar to 86. Besides, Messi arrives better than I was.         
	Perhaps, too, Messi was never quite the angel he appeared to be. His primary school teachers tell of a boy impossible to keep out of the playground, a boy whose blank exam papers were filled in by a girlfriend.

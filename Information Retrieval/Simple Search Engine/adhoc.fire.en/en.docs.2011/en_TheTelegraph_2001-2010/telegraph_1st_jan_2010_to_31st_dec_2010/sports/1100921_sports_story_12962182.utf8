The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blockbuster Iran have last laugh 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blockbuster Iran have last laugh 
            A STAFF REPORTER                            Victorious Iranian players and support staff with the trophy, at Netaji Indoor Stadium, on Monday. A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: The hero of the day named Sholay as his favourite movie. But before you frown and say whats the big deal, wait  the hero is not an Indian and doesnt understand Hindi (or English if you are thinking of the subtitles).         
	Golmohammed Sakhavi, the Iranian libero, was perfect at his job, at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, on Monday, much like the heroes in Bollywood flicks of which he is a fan.         
	And with able assistance from his teammates, Shakhavi inspired Iran to lift the 3rd Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship title humbling hosts India in straight sets.         
	Shakhavi, incidentally, is not Irans first choice and the 20-year-old only made it to the team because their No. 1 was injured. Whoever said first choice is the best choice, should have a rethink.         
	The 25-19, 25-22, 29-27 scoreline might suggest that the Indians gave the Iranians a tough fight in the final. Reality, however, was that India were smashed left, right and centre by the faster and better-organised Iranians.         
	Not only did India repeat their mistakes made in the group league stage, they coupled that with a barrage of fresh goof-ups.         
	In volleyball, somewhat like in Formula One, it is extremely difficult to stage a comeback once you have conceded the lead.         
	On most of the times, you are left to play the catch-up game, without much success.         
	India, in the first two sets, fell back early and never managed to bridge the gap in points conceded. And in the third set, when they finally took the lead, they achieved the unique feat of losing it.         
	As Iran raced to 8-5 lead in the first set, the crowd anticipated a fightback. But all they got to see was some poor smashing and poorer blocking.         
	With Shakavi throwing himself all over the court, Iran extended their lead to 16-10 and it was just a matter of time before the set was wrapped up.         
	The second set portrayed a similar picture  Iran took the lead while India were busy chasing, without catching. Some powerful smashes by Vali Nourmohammadi and efficient blocks by Mojtaba Shaban and Saber Narimanazhad helped Iran in their cause.         
	It was only in the third set that the Indians found their rhythm. They shot off to a lead and at one stage were 18-13 ahead.         
	However, on 24-23 they faltered. The Iranians grabbed the Indian lapse and turned the match in their favour.         
	Iran head coach Peyman Akbari, himself an accomplished spiker, pointed out Indias problem after the match. India have good players, but no planning, he said.         
	Well thats a smash, which is spot on. And the Indians, once again, will not be able to block it.

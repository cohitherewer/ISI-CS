The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big 3 may get plots 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Big 3 may get plots 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The state sports ministry, along with the land and land reforms ministry Thursday offered plots of land to city giants Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting to have their own ground.         
	The representatives of the Big Three met sports minister Kanti Ganguly and land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzaq Mollah at Writers Bulding.         
	Bagan were represented by finance secretary Debasish Duta, East Bengal by football manager Swapan Ball and Sporting by football secretary Mohammed Kamaruddin.         
	It was learnt that the ministers offered a plot of 89 acres in the Kalikapur area adjacent to the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. However, there is a practical problem associated with that particular plot. The matter of ownership of the plot is still sub-judice and it will only be handed over to the clubs if the state government wins the case.         
	That has made the officials sceptical about the offer.         
	Since the case is sub-judice we are still not sure whether we will get the land. However, the sports minister has assured us that if the state government doesnt get a favourable verdict, the three clubs will be given money to buy plots. There can be eight to nine football grounds on that plot and three will be allotted to the clubs, Kamaruddin said.

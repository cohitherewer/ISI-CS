	Johannesburg: Ramnaresh Sarwans gallant half-century went in vain as Guyana suffered a 15-run defeat against South Australia Redbacks, in the Champions League T20 tournament Tuesday.         
	Sarwan hit eight boundaries and two sixes in his 46-ball 70 to lead a Guyana fightback after they were set an imposing target of 192 by Redbacks at the New Wanderers stadium, here. With this win, they booked a semi-final berth.         
	But the right-hand batsman didnt get enough support at the other end. Barring Richard Ramdeen (35) and Steven Jacobs (32) and Lennox Cush (12), none of the other batsmen were able to reach double figu res as Guyana succumbed to their fourth loss..         
	Earlier, Callum Ferguson smashed a 37-ball 55 and Cameron Borgas blasted a 36-ball 48 to power South Australia to a challenging 191 after being put into bat.         
	For Redbacks, Daniel Harris scalped three for 33 to lead the pack of wicket-takers. Daniel Christian took two wickets, while Jake Haberfield and Aaron Brien took one each.         
	Chasing 192 to win, Guyana lost their first wicket in the second over when Travis Dowlin was trapped plumb in front of by Jake Haberfield. Opener Ramdeen and Sarwan then added 42 runs for the second wicket before the former was sent packing by Christian in the last ball of the seventh over as Guyana slumped to 51 for two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif and Aamer future worries Imran Khan
                                                                                                                       7                                        Asif and Aamer future worries Imran Khan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Shahid Afridi                           
	New Delhi: Imran Khan said on Thursday that though Pakistan cricket was in a mess, all-rounder Shahid Afridi had the ability to pull the team out of the rut.         
	Pakistan cricket is in a mess, and in this situation, Afridi is the best man to lead the team, said the legendary all-rounder, who led Pakistan to their only World Cup triumph in 1992.         
	Afridi is probably someone, and the only one, who can pull something out of the ordinary. Pakistan have their back to the wall, but Afridi is unpredictable. If he hits a purple patch in one-day cricket, you need just two batsmen to hit a purple patch and others can rally around.         
	Imran felt Pakistan face their biggest challenge post the suspension of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer for their alleged role in spot-fixing.         
	Today my country faces the biggest challenge in international cricket. Sadly, the patron of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is our President (Asif Ali Zardari). The less I talk about him, the better as I dont want to talk about politics, the cricketer-turned-politician said.         
	Imran said he wont get into cricket administration. My philosophy of life is that I dont look back into the past. My cricket chapter was closed after I led Pakistan to win the 1992 World Cup. I dont want to get into cricket administration and think about match-fixing I have a bigger task fixing my country, he said.         
	Imran said that he was concerned about the future of young bowlers Asif and Aamer, who are staring at possible life bans from the International Cricket Council.         
	I am specially concerned about the future of the two young fast bowlers. Asif and Aamer are the best opening pair in the world and I can certainly tell you that Aamer is the most exciting talent in international cricket. I saw Wasim (Akram) at the age of 18 and I also saw Aamer, who is now 18 Aamer at this stage is better than Wasim and that is saying a lot. If Asif and Aamer are part of the team, then Pakistan has a chance, he said.         
	Imran also said that he is in favour of the Umpire Decision Review System. I think this the best thing to happen in international cricket. I wish we had this system during our playing days, he said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Shooters could have done better: Bindra
                      
	New Delhi: Indian shooters could have done much better than winning just eight medals at the Guangzhou Asian Games last month, Beijing Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra said on Sunday.         
	After a rich haul at the Commonwealth Games here, where they had won a record 30 medals including 14 gold, the shooters were a let down.         
	We could have done better but thats how it is; someday you win, someday you lose, Bindra said on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony here on Sunday.         
	Athletes supported by the Mittal Champions Trust were felicitated on Sunday for their exploits in the Asian Games where Bindra teamed up with Gagan Narang and Sanjeev Rajput to clinch the team silver in 10-metre air rifle event.         
	Meanwhile, for Ronjan Sodhi, the Italy trip a day after the Commonwealth Games, was the secret for the gold medal in in Guangzhou.         
	The world No. 3 said: There were so many felicitation programmes in the 15 days between the CWG and the Asian Games. So where was the time to prepare? I left for Italy the next day, right after it (Delhi Games) got over. (PTI)

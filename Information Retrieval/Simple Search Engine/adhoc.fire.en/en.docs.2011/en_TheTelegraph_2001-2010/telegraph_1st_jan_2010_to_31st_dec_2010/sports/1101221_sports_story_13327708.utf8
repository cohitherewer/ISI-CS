                                                                                                                       7                                      Want to see Sachin win World Cup: Achrekar 
                      
	New Delhi: Proud of Sachin Tendulkars ever-growing list of achievements, mentor Ramakant Achrekar now just wants him to win the World Cup, which is perhaps the only feat that has eluded him till now.         
	I am very happy for Sachin. He has not only made me proud but the entire nation is celebrating his feat. I dont think that anybody can ever come near his record, said Achrekar.         
	Achrekar, under whose guidance Tendulkar had started his cricketing career, still follows his progress on television.         
	The veterans only wish now is to see Tendulkar winning the World Cup. Sachin has almost all the batting records under his belt now. His dream is to win the World Cup and I want him to achieve that. I am sure we will win the trophy next year, Achrekar said.           (PTI)

	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, on Saturday at a press conference, warned his teammates against getting distracted by the hype surrounding Muttiah Muralidharans retirement from Test cricket.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Muralidharans farewell         
	Theres a lot thats going to happen over the next five days. The SLC, ground staff  all have done their bit for Muralis farewell. As a team, the best we could do for Murali is to make sure, that we dont get overwhelmed or too carried away with whats happening around. We should rather concentrate on really giving him a good farewell by playing a great match.         
	The impact of Murali on Lankan cricket         
	Without a doubt, he is the best ever to have played the game. He has taken more wickets in less matches than some of the other greats. The greatest contribution from Murali to Lankan cricket, is the manner in which he has carried himself in the dressing room. The way he has influenced the thought process of youngsters. He has had a great influence on me as a person. Not only are we losing a match-winner, but more importantly, someone who has contributed immensely to the culture, performance and the hard work of our team. He has been one of the most important figures, far more than most politicians or any other person of such stature. Murali has been the one uniting factor. At the end of the 30-year war, for us to look back and understand the role the Sri Lankan team played, the way we played, carried ourselves on the field, and represented the country as a united family         
	On Murali being on the verge of 800 Test wickets         
	If Murali takes eight wickets (that will complete his 800 wickets in Tests), we will probably win the game. He bowled excellently in the nets. He is not going to leave anything behind. He will make sure, he wins this one for Sri Lanka. The eight-wicket haul is the farthest from his mind. For him, its winning is what matters the most.         
	Murali, the person         
	He has never had any ego which is amazing for someone whos done so much. His only complaint has been if something is not going right on the field or if something is not going right at training. Money, fame didnt matter one bit to him. Thats a huge plus for someone because it keeps egging him on to do better. He is humble, so he is always training as if he is not the best. It always keeps driving him to bigger targets, thats the greatest thing about Murali.         
	On chucking allegations         
	He is a gutsy guy. I dont know who doubted him. Emerson and Hair (the two umpires, who no-balled Murali for suspect action) doubted him. But we never had any doubts in our mind that he is the best bowler in the world. Hes absolutely clean. No other bowler has been put under scanner so many times. It will be interesting to see how other bowlers around the world go through such rigorous scrutiny with a cast on their arm. Whether they can stand up to that scrutiny and come out with a clean action and a strong mind.         
	Life after Murali         
	Life goes on it. It doesnt stop for anyone. Theres been a Don Bradman, a Garry Sobers, all of them have come and gone. But the game is still played. The good thing is that a Bradman, a Sobers, a Muralidharan leave cricket a better game.         
	On the team combination         
	We got quite a strong squad different combinations to pick from. Ajantha Mendis has come back strong in the practice game and he will be with us from the next Test onwards. The key is to make sure, we pick a good combination.         
	Element of mystery back in Mendis deliveries         
	I dont think Mendis has been on the wane. It is just that we expected too much from him. When a bowler comes on and takes 27 wickets in his first series and has figures of six for 13 to show for in a final, you keep expecting him to churn out magical performances every time he comes on to bowl. It doesnt happen like that. Batsmen will adjust theyll have plans. Mendis has just shown in that practice game, no matter what anyone says, he is one of the best spinners in world cricket.         
	Lasith Malingas comeback to Test squad         
	Everyones worked really hard to get him fit. Malingas worked so hard to get where he is now. Its a credit to him that he is out there fit and ready to play. It gives us a huge X factor. Thats really important going through into a Test match. He is a guy who can trouble any batsman in the world with his variation. We look forward to him to try and make an impact in the match.         
	On the transition phase in Lankan cricket         
	We had a transition period with Chaminda Vaas and Sanath Jayasuriya retiring from Test cricket and not making it to the one-day side. Vaasy is doing very well in the County circuit. Theres a little bit more left in him. We got some talented young spinners coming through. We are not finding the next Murali, next Sanath or Vaasy. We are going to find the next best fast bowler and spinner. Thell bring their own uniqueness to the mix.         
	On Indo-Lanka rivalry         
	India vs Sri Lanka is a great hot bed for rivalries to be built and for the public. If this builds into a traditional top notch rivalry, it would do Test cricket a lot of good. India is the No. 1 Test side in the world. We go into this Test match knowing that. We are basically trying to make sure that they try and earn that No. 1 spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shukla, Bose do the trick
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shukla, Bose do the trick
                      
	Ahmedabad: Laxmi Ratan Shukla had shone with the bat in the last match, against Assam, when he cracked a brilliant double century. On Friday, the all-rounder did the trick with the ball as he picked up three wickets against Gujarat, on the third day of the Ranji Trophy Super League tie.         
	Shukla, along with Ranadeb Bose, who picked up four wickets, helped restrict Gujarat to a moderate score of 273. Pacer Sourav Sarkar clinched two wickets while Anustup Majumdar grabbed one.         
	In reply, Bengal were 99 for the loss of two wicket at the close of play. With just a day left, an outright result is almost impossible. However, both the teams will be fighting for that crucial first innings lead.         
	And that is where Shukla and Ranadebs show will be helpful as the duo has provided Bengal with a good chance to grab three vital points.         
	At stumps, Dibyendu Chakraborty (batting 17) and Manoj Tiwary (batting 18) were at the crease.         
	Tiwary praised his bowlers for their good work. Our bowlers did an excellent job today Especially, Ranadeb and Shukla. Now its the batsmens responsibility to ensure a first innings lead. We all will have to dio our job well, the captain said.           (AGENCIES)

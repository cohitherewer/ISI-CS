The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sneijder downs Japan
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                          Sneijder downs Japan
                        GUEST COLUMN
     P.K. Banerjee                
	Another goalkeeping error! After Englands Robert Green and Algerias Faouzi Chaouchi, it was Japans Eiji Kawashima against the Netherlands on Saturday. Agreed Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijders volley from the edge of the box had power but Kawashima should have dealt with it properly. He seemed to have missed the flight and was almost diving out of the way.        
	The ball hit his left palm and crashed into the net. When you are playing at the international level, you are expected to stop such shots. And I can tell you that the Jabulani did not have anything to do with this bit of bungling.        
	Well, Sneijders 53rd-minute goal was the difference between the two teams in this Group E match and the Dutch, after this 1-0 win, are assured of a second-round berth.         
	Japan should consider themselves unlucky not to get a point from this match. Tactically, Japan have made rapid strides and that was showcased like never before on Saturday. Unlike South Korea, who played an open game against Argentina and paid the price for it, Japan were much more disciplined and cautious.        
	The defence was rock solid with the lanky pony-tailed Marcus Tanaka leading from the front. What a match he had.         
	He did not yield an inch to the likes of Robin van Persie and, whenever Japan got a chance from a set-piece, he was in the opposition half, creating a great deal of confusion in the Dutch ranks.         
	Even the Japanese midfield was very compact, chasing every ball and closing down on their rivals. Such was their compactness that a Dutch side known for their flamboyance had a look-in at the rival goal only once in the first 45 minutes!         
	The likes of Yuto Nagatomo, Yasuhito Endo and Makato Hasabe made life miserable for Sneijder and Rafaael van der Vaart.         
	Japan adopted the hounding tactics typical of the small teams when they are up against fancied rivals.         
	But I must also say that they were not scared of testing the rival defence. Keisuke Honda, the hero in the win over Cameroon, did get a couple of chances but could not capitalise on them.         
	The Netherlands, probably shaken and stirred by the defeats of big guns like Spain and Germany, never tried to play an open game.         
	Its better to have a point than losing three, was their mantra. The string of upsets in this World Cup is clearly having an effect on the favourites.        
	Frankly speaking, I was not at all impressed by the Dutch style of play. Ever since Johan Cruyff displayed his magical skill, the Netherlands have been once of favourites for the title.         
	This time also they are one of the contenders. But I think they are lacking in the cutting edge. May be once Arjen Robben returns to action, this team will look a different side. So, sooner Robben returns, the better it is for the Dutch.        
	On Saturday, after Eljero Elia was inroduced in the 72 nd minute, the Dutch showed some purpose in the attack. Once he freed another substitute Ibrahim Afellay on the left but Kawashima this time did not make any blunder.         
	Afellay, once again found Kawashima at his mercy and this time, too, the Japanese rose to the occasion. Wish he was focussed enough when that Sneijder volley came!

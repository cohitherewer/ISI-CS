	Fabio Capello
  (England)             
	It does not get more enviable than this Italians CV as a club coach. At the helm of a national team following highly successful stints with some legendary European clubs, Capello is only the second foreigner after Swede Sven-Goran Erikkson to be appointed England manager. His arrival has brought about a visible change in the England team, who are now considered among the favourites for the title. At the club level, no manager has a better record than Capello. The 63-year-old has the distinction of winning the domestic league title with every club he has coached. In his first five seasons as the manager, Capello won five Serie A titles with AC Milan and the Champions League in 1993-94. He then spent a year at Real Madrid, winning a La Liga title. Thereafter returned to Italy to give Roma their first league title in 18 years.               
	Vicente del Bosque
  (Spain)                 
	Famed for his humble, patient and unassuming style, Del Bosque is one of the most successful coaches in the history of modern football, both with club and national teams Appointed Real Madrid coach in November 1999, Del Bosque, in his four seasons, steered the club to two Champions League titles in 2000 and 2002, two domestic La Liga titles in 2001 and 2003, a Spanish Super Cup in 2001, a Uefa Super Cup in 2002, the Intercontinental Cup in 2002 as well as a last four finish in the Champions League every year he was in charge. In 2008, he replaced Euro Cup winning coach Luis Aragones at the helm of the national team and then set the record of being the first manager ever to win his first 10 games on debut. Although he is not an Alex Ferguson or a Jose Mourinho, Del Bosque is widely tipped to lead his team to World Cup triumph.               
	Raymond Domenech 
  (France)                         
	Les Bleus coach at a second straight World Cup, Domenech is known for his strange style of working. A surprise choice to succeed Jacques Santini in 2004, the 58-year-old coach is a keen amateur dramatist and an astrologer. He is known to distrust Scorpios, which is believed to be the reason behind his very apparent dislike of Robert Pires. On several occasions he raised a storm by keeping out established players and selecting unknown faces. Yet, in 2006, he led France to the final of the World Cup where they lost to Italy in the shootout. In the friendly against Tunisia, which France drew 1-1, Domenech equalled Michel Hidalgos record of being in charge in 75 consecutive matches. Despite Frances mediocre show in the 08 Euro Cup, the French football federation firmly believes Domenech can turn the tables in South Africa.    
	Dunga
  (Brazil)                 
	Dunga has no coaching degree, just like Diego Maradona but was appointed Brazil coach in July 2006 mainly on the strength of his reputation as a footballer. In his playing days, Dunga was fierce and aggressive, a commanding midfielder and an important member of the 1994 World Cup-winning team. Like all Brazil coaches, Dunga was initially under great pressure but made an impressive start by winning four of his first five matches. With most teams in modern football looking to strike a balance between attack and defence, Dunga chose not to depart from the convention and ensured triumph in the 2009 Confederations Cup. He treats the players as equals and believes a lack of teamwork lead to Brazils exit at the quarter final stage in 2006 and has ensured egos do not result in a lack of hard work.               
	Marcello Lippi
  (Italy)                 
	A high-profile coach, Marcello Lippi led Italy to their fourth World Cup triumph in 2006 and quit the job after three days. In 2008, the Italian football federation asked him to make a comeback after the national teams disappointing Euro Cup performance under Roberto Donadoni. No coach in the world holds a better record than Lippi at both the national and club levels. Apart from winning the World Cup, he has five Serie A titles, four Italian Super Cups, one Champions League and one Intercontinental Cup under his belt. Twice, in 1996 and 1998, the International Federation of Football and Statistics named him the worlds best manager before crowning him with the ultimate accolade of worlds best National Coach in 2006. Lippis biggest quality is that he is not bound by any rigid tactical approach.               
	Joachim Loew
   (Germany)                         
	A man with a forgettable playing career, Joachim Loew was appointed Germany manager after Jurgen Klinsmann decided to quit the post. Known for his friendly nature and tactically smart moves on the pitch, Loew has done a commendable job with the national team. He first came into prominence in the mid-nineties when he guided VfB Stuttgart to a victory in the National Cup final and, the following year, reached the final of the Cup Winners Cup before losing to Chelsea. Under him, Germany reached the final of the Euro 2008 but lost to Spain by a solitary goal. Loew knows how to motivate his boys but the campaign in South Africa could be his toughest task yet as Germany have been hit by a series of injuries to their leading players.               
	Diego Maradona
  (Argentina)                 
	One of the greatest heroes of the last millennium, Diego Armando Maradona is still quite the most famous face in world football. The captain of Argentinas World Cup winning team of 86, Maradona has no coaching degree but all the same was appointed national team manager for the 2010 World Cup. Although Argentina struggled in the qualifiers, Maradona is confident of victory and has even promised to run naked through the streets of Buenos Aires if Argentina manage to lift the Cup. His team selection, however, has raised eyebrows. While his choice of the ageing Juan Sebastian Veron in midfield has surprised many, Maradonas over-dependence on homegrown defenders Nico Otamendi, Clemente Rodrigues and Ariel Garce has come in for heavy criticism. Yet, all said and done, all eyes would be on Maradona in 10.               
	Bert van Marwijk
  (The Netherlands)               
	Bert Van Marwijk was perhaps not the fans first choice to lead the Oranje into the World Cup but a 100 per cent record, eight wins out of eight matches in the qualifiers, has seen his stock rise considerably. Marwijk was never a great success as a player and could represent the national team no more than once in his career as an attacking midfielder. As a coach, however, he has not been afraid to make big decisions and a lot of eyebrows were raised when he decided to drop Clarence Seedorf for Mark Van Bommel. The last named happens to be Marwijks son-in-law. As a tactician, he believes in the Dutch tradition of total football and with players like Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben, Dirk Kuyt and Wesley Sneijder involved, Marwijk likes to have a lot of interchanges between the midfield and attack.

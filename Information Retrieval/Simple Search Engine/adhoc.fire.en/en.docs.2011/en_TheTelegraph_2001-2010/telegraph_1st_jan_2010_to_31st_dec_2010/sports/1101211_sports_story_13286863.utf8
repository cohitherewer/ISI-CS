The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo look to bounce back
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo look to bounce back
                      
	Margao: Defending champions Dempo after their uninspiring start, are looking to bounce back after their defeat against East Bengal, when they take on JCT Saturday, in a third round I-League tie, here.         
	Dempo have made a very slow start to their campaign, picking up just one point from the two matches theyve played so far.         
	With several of their regular players absent, Dempo managed to contend East Bengal until a misunderstanding between defender Domnic Noronha and keeper Laxmikant Kattimani allowed Tolgay Ozebe to score the winner in the 48th minute.         
	Joaquim Abranches injury against the Churchill Brothers has punctured their attack and Ranty Martins, who had to fall back constantly to support the midfield against East Bengal, will have to carry much of the load upfront.         
	Dempos midfield also lacked the creativeness to open up the rival defense in the absence of Roberto Silva. Now that Roberto has started training with the team, his presence will influence the team to do better.         
	Its just the start of the I-League. Nothing can be said right now. There is still a long way to go, coach Armando Colaco said.         
	Half of my players are with the Indian team while Abranches and Valeriano are in the injured list of players. However, with Roberto Silva expected to play, it will give us more stability to the midfield. The boys are all geared up to win after a defeat, Colaco added.         
	JCT too are also struggling to find form as they lost their opener to debutant HAL and then drew against Churchill.

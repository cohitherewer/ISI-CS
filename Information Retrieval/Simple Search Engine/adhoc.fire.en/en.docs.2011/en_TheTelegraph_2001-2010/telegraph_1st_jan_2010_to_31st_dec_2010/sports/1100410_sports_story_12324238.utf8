	Jaipur: Ugly scenes were enacted Friday at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, which hosts the Indian Premier League match between the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians on Sunday, after the state sports council locked the western block where the franchise have their temporary offices.         
	The row, caused by the clash of egos among the state sports council, the Rajasthan Royals and the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) officials on the issue of sharing of tickets, was so bad that the Royals officials threatened to shift IPL matches from the city.         
	A series of meetings were held between the officials of the RCA, Rajasthan Royals, the sports council and IMG to sort out the matter before things finally calmed down.         
	The Royals officials accused the RCA for the fiasco while association official were claiming that it was the attitude of the franchises officials that was creating problems.         
	Meanwhile, there was trouble in store for RCA with the state police preparing to file an istgasa (complaint) against them for having hired and illegally deployed a security agency at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium for recent matches.         
	The RCA hired a security agency for Indias ODI versus South Africa and the Royals match on April 7 without registering it with the IG security office and the home department.

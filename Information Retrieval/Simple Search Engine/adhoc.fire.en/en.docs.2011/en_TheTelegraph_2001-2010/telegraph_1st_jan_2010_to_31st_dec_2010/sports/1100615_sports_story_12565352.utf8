The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil ready for the grind
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brazil ready for the grind
    - Five-time champions take on the secretive North Korea today           JAYDEEP BASU            Kaka trains at Ellis Park, on Monday. (AFP)                                   
	Johannesburg: The look on Dungas face said it all. On Monday, when Brazil came over to the Ellis Park for a training session, he refused to look at the hundreds of journalists and fans waiting outside the stadium gate and hurriedly walked through the tunnel.         
	On Tuesday, hot favourites Brazil, bursting with global stars, will open their World Cup campaign against rank outsiders North Korea but the Brazilian coach looked edgy and nervous.         
	For the last couple of weeks, Dungas relationship with the media, especially with the ones from his own country, has gone sour. He banned them from watching the team practice throughout the last week and even on Monday he allowed the media for only 15 minutes.         
	There are also reports that two of the team members  Daniel Alves and Julio Baptista  had heated arguments but the coach has denied it vehemently.         
	Its a speculation of the media, an angry Dunga said after the practice session. Everything is fine and the team is ready to start their campaign, said the former Brazil captain.         
	The problem with Dunga is that he is under pressure from all quarters. Even though Brazil have won more World Cups than any other nation, Dunga is facing criticism for discarding the attacking style of football that Brazil is famous for. When he began his term as the national coach, he picked up players known for their discipline and hard work and not for their stardom and past success.         
	Dunga also installed a style based on solid defence and quick counter attacks and even though his team earned significant results on the field, his system has displeased millions of fans in Brazil. They are not happy with the fact that since Dungas appointment, he has led Brazil to title triumphs in the 2007 Copa America and the Confederation Cup in 2009.         
	Dungas choice of the World Cup squad has left his detractors more enraged. Many household names, including Ronaldinho, Adriano and Ronaldo, were overlooked to make room for a new generation of players led by stars like Real Madrid midfielder Kaka, Robinho and Luis Fabiano. Despite the omission of big names, Brazil still have a host of highly talented seasoned campaigners like defenders Lucio, Maicon and goalkeeper Julio Cesar.         
	In Lucio, Brazil have a world class centre-back who has won just about everything wherever he has played  including a World Cup medal in 2002. This season Lucio was at the heart of Jose Mourinhos all-conquering Inter Milan side that ultimately won the Champions League. Goalkeeper Julio Cesar, also from Inter Milan, has set a record of 10 hours without conceding a goal during Brazils qualifying campaign.         
	Finally, Brazil have Kaka, the 2007 World Player of the Year. Though currently overshadowed by Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and other big players, Kaka still has the ability to tear open the any defence in the world. Thankfully for Brazil, Kaka said he was fit and warned he will be better with every match.         
	Yet, the unpredictable nature of North Korea forced Dunga to speak cautiously. We dont know much about them, Dunga admitted. We have seen little bit of their warm up matches, he added.         
	The North Koreans have secluded themselves from the public and the media since their arrival in South Africa and are staying in a secluded hotel in the northern outskirts of Johannesburg. The last time North Korea played in the World Cup was in 1966 and they created havoc by eliminating Italy.         
	Nevertheless, we respect the Koreans, Dunga said. I know we have the tag of the favourites but you have to win every match on the pitch. We have equal respect for all the teams.         
	The team is ready. My boys know what they have to do here. Whatever others have to say, our team is prepared to do well in the World Cup, added the coach.         
	Like Diego Maradona, the Brazilian coach is also hoping to match Germanys Franz Beckenbauers feat of winning the World Cup both as a player and a coach. The Brazilian fans all over the world are hoping that vintage Samba will work this time too, even though, it is being managed by a strict disciplinarian and dogmatic Dunga.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gerd Mueller                           
	Durban: Having reached the semi-finals with thumping wins over England and Argentina, the German camp is absolutely confident of flying home with the World Cup. While hundreds of German fans have already thronged the town to witness the historic semi-final against Spain, legends have also trooped to cheer the team.         
	Leading the pack are former captain Franz Beckenbauer and striker Gerd Mueller, whose support has come as a great boost for Joachim Loews side. Mueller has been the most vocal, having declared Germany as potential champions from Day One.         
	On Tuesday, after arriving in Durban, Mueller announced he was ready to put his money on Germany despite the absence of Thomas Mueller in the German striking force.         
	Muellers suspension is a big loss but that is not going to stop Germany from winning, said Mueller Sr, whose exploits in the upfront was largely responsible for Germanys World Cup triumph in 1974.         
	I am impressed very impressed, Mueller said. I am really surprised with their fine performance in the last two matches, especially against Argentina. The fact is that they are the second-youngest German side ever to play in the World Cup. I was pleasantly surprised to see them playing like experienced pros against top teams.         
	The midfield, Mueller predicted, will hold the key on Wednesday. Both teams like to attack. Germany have a no nonsense approach while Spain love to play with the ball.         
	But Germany are showing more variations in attacks. If Schweinsteiger can control the midfield the way he did in the earlier matches, then Germany shouldnt face any problem. There is a perfect understanding between Schweinsteiger, Podolski and Klose , said Mueller.         
	The German great admitted that David Villa could be a threat for any team. He is a tremendous goalscorer and is in brilliant form. His support line is not doing exceptionally well, yet he is hitting goals in every match... thats very appreciable, Mueller said.         
	Like Mueller, his 1974 World Cup captain, Beckenbauer also toed the same line. Speaking during a function in Johannesburg, Kaiser said he was amazed by the present set of boys in the German team.         
	This team is the masterpiece of Joachim Loew. He has placed his mark on its make up, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights rope in Pakistan pacer 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights rope in Pakistan pacer 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) have signed an agreement with Mohammed Irfan, a 7-feet tall fast bowler from Pakistan.         
	The agreement will only become a contract once the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) approves the participation of Pakistani players in the 2011 Indian Premier League.         
	The left-arm pacer was impressive during KKRs development tour of Sri Lanka and was recommended by none other than Wasim Akram, their bowling consultant.         
	All of them were impressed with my bowling.         
	My height helped me as well, Irfan told a news agency in Karachi.         
	Irfan shot to prominence after an impressive debut season in Pakistan and was nearly selected in their World Twenty20 squad in May.         
	I never faced someone bowling so quick. He bowls faster than Ishant Sharma, Sourasish Lahiri, the captain of the KKR Develpoment squad, said on Tuesday.         
	He will be quite a thing if he actually plays for us.         
	He can bowl yorkers at will, which I havent seen anyone do in our domestic circuit, Lahiri added.         
	Irfans rise is one of the more unique stories in Pakistan cricket.         
	A product of rural Pakistan, from the town of Gaggu Mandi, which produced another former quick, Mohammed Zahid, Irfan was working in a plastic pipe factory and playing club cricket.         
	A fan-forum cricket website  which heard Irfans name while talking to Nadeem Iqbal, former fast bowler and now coach in Multan  alerted Aaqib Javed at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore.         
	Enthused by what he saw, Aaqib helped Irfan get into the domestic side Khan Research Laboratories.         
	He took nine wickets in his second game and ended the season with an impressive 43 in 10 games.         
	He came close to national selection when he was named as a replacement for one of the injured seamers for the 2010 World Twenty20.         
	But surprisingly his name was withdrawn. Captain Shahid Afridi and coach Waqar Younis were keen on taking him along and announced his inclusion, before PCB chairman Ejaz Butt overrode the decision, claiming procedures had been violated in the call-up.

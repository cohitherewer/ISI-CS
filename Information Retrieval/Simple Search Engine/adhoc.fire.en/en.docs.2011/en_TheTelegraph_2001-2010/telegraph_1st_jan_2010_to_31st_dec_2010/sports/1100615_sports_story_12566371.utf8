The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raymond no coach: Zidane
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raymond no coach: Zidane
                              GUEST COLUMN    Shyam Thapa      
	Knysna: Former France captain Zinedine Zidane says Raymond Domenech is not a coach and that there is no teamwork among the French players at the World Cup.         
	France drew their opening group game 0-0 against Uruguay, and Zidane saw little hope for improvement.         
	Speaking to a television broadcaster on Sunday, Zidane said the players must take responsibility for themselves and must put ego to one side if the team are to reach their potential.         
	Zidane scored twice when France beat Brazil 3-0 to win the 1998 World Cup and helped France win the European Championship in 2000. In 2006, he wore the captains armband as he inspired Les Bleus to the World Cup final before being sent off for the infamous head butt on Marco Materazzi.         
	Frances next Group A match is against Mexico on Thursday in Polokwane.         
	But as France look to get their game together for Thursdays clash they have fresh injury problems to contend with.         
	Defender William Gallas and reserve goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso pulled out of the teams World Cup training session Monday.         
	Carrasso pulled a muscle in his left thigh and Gallas, who missed the last few weeks of Arsenals season after tearing his left calf muscle at the end of March, walked off midway through the session in Knysna alongside a team physiotherapist because of a muscle problem.         
	Gallas withdrew only as a precautionary measure, team press officer Francois Manardo said, without giving more details.         
	The public training session was attended by about 150 locals and a handful of French fans after a heavy downpour. (Agencies)

	Shillong: It is a battle for survival for both but the rivals taking the field will do so in contrasting frames of mind. While Lajong ooze confidence, visitors Mumbai FC are cautiously optimistic on the eve of their 22nd round I-League encounter on Tuesday.         
	The reasons are not too difficult to grasp.         
	Hosts Lajong have been buoyed by Saturdays spectacular come-from-behind 2-1 win over title challengers Mahindra United and now are looking forward to repeating that show. But they know well that they are not yet out of the woods because every match from here on will impact on the fates of the eight teams with 25 points or less.         
	Lajong will hope for full points against MFC and a win will take them closer to safety.

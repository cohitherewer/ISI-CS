The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wang gets past Baun
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wang gets past Baun
                      
	Paris: Chinas Lin Wang destroyed Tine Bauns hopes of reaching the final by thrashing the Dane, in straight games 21-11, 21-8 here in the semi-finals of the World Championships, on Saturday.         
	Wangs entry into the final also ensured an all-Chinese final in the womens singles as the other semi-finals also pits Xin Wang and Shixian Wang, both Chinese against each other.         
	Denmarks Tines was reduced to tears after the match as she struggled for words to describe possibly her worst defeat in a semi-final clash.         
	I just struggled through the match, said Tine, wiping back her tears. Lin was just too good.         
	Lin Wang, a semi-finalist at the last 2009 World Championships was in complete control of the match from the first game when she took a 10-4 lead.         
	Baun was uncharacteristically error-prone. The back court, which is a strong point for the Dane, became her biggest weakness as she made wrong line judgments giving away precious points. Even her net play, normally very sound was also error-prone.           (PTI)

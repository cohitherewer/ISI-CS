The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Three wickets have brought us back
                                                                                                                       7                                        Three wickets have brought us back
  - Sehwag and crowd unnerved our bowlers, says SA coach Van ZYL         A STAFF REPORTER            Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar at Eden Gardens, on Monday. Picture by Gautam Bose                                 
	Calcutta: South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl felt that three quick Indian wickets towards the end of the day had brought the visitors back into the game in the second Test here.         
	He also said that Virender Sehwags 165 and the vociferous crowd unnerved his bowlers.         
	I think Sehwags innings unsettled everybody... The fact that he scores very quickly and obviously gets the crowd behind him, all of that is unsettling. That is the time when youve got to stick to game plans and get back to the basics. I thought sometimes we didnt do that and that is the strength of Sehwag, he said after the second days play.         
	It was a very hard day for us... Some really good batting but we also didnt execute our game plan well. But those last three wickets, out of which two were really big, has set up for a good day tomorrow, Van Zyl said.         
	He blamed the bowlers impatience for their performance on Monday.         
	I think our patience was definitely lacking. We did apply patience at times in Nagpur That is one thing as a team we can improve upon. I wont say we panicked. We need to go and understand why we didnt execute our game plan, he reasoned.         
	The three wickets brought back balance to the game. We need to look at a few things, set up in a few areas.         
	Van Zyl was all praise for Sachin Tendulkar. He (Tendulkar) is special. Those were two different innings, both of them very important. Sachin is very special, the way he always plays, a workman like innings nothing was different today.         
	He didnt blame stand-in wicketkeeper AB de Villiers for missing an easy stumping against Sehwag.         
	(Mark) Boucher is a crucial player. It is a real pity that he is not available due to his back injury. I thought AB was good, he obviously missed an opportunity and he is very unhappy about that miss because he knows what it means for the team, said the visiting coach.         
	Van Zyl defended his bowlers who consistently bowled outside the leg, saying they were exploiting the rough areas. You can see it as a negative line... The umpire did think so too There wasnt as much turn as there was in Nagpur for Paul Harris and that is what he needed to contend with.         
	Some of them did turn from the rough, some of them didnt. You got to take the rough with the smooth, some day it works, some days it doesnt. But I still think Harris did a good job for the team but it was tougher than it was in Nagpur, where there was some assistance.

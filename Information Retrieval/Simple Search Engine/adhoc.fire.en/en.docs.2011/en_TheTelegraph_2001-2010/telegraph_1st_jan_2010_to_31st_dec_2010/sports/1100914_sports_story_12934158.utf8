The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manoj out for 10 days with injury
                                                                                                                       7                                      Manoj out for 10 days with injury
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengals No. 1 batsman Manoj Tiwary will be out of action for the next 10 days owing to a toe injury. Tiwary sustained the injury recently while playing for his employers, CESC, in the BCCI Corporate Trophy.         
	The 10-day break will mean that Manoj will neither play the CAB-organised S.K. Acharya Challenger Trophy nor the J.P. Atray Invitational one-day tournament for CESC.         
	I hurt my toe while taking a run during a match in the Corporate Trophy. There was considerable amount of swelling and pain. Thankfully, its not a fracture. But a few tissues have been damaged. The physio has advised me rest for the next 10 days, Manoj said on Monday.         
	I dont want to aggravate my injury as Ranji Trophy is just a month-and-half away. I dont want any injuries or niggles to bother me as a very important season is coming up for me and Bengal, he said.         
	The CAB has issued a diktat that Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Ashok Dinda and Arindam Das will have to play in the CAB Challenger Trophy instead of taking part in the J.P. Atray Invitational meet for their respective employers. While Abhishek and Dinda are CESC employees, Arindam works for BSNL.         
	The players are keen on playing in the Challenger so there shouldnt be any confusion, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said. However, it has been learnt that the players are in two minds as not playing for their office may irk their employers.         
	Wriddhiman Saha, however will be excused as he is a part of the Board Presidents XI side that will take on Australia in the tour opener in Chandigarh from September 25-27.         
	Meanwhile, the working committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue of paid selectors. It is expected to be passed by the committee members without much trouble. The finance committee will take a call after that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Dhoni is all praise for bowlers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Captain Dhoni is all praise for bowlers
  - Reverse swing was a factor behind giving Zaheer a longer spell                       
	Dhaka: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday singled out star performer Zaheer Khan for the series victory and said the bowlers did an excellent job on an unresponsive track in the second Test against Bangladesh.         
	It was a difficult task to get wickets on this track, both for spinners and pacers. But all credit goes to the bowlers. They really put their best to get those 20 wickets, especially Zaheer, Dhoni said after his team crushed the hosts by 10 wickets to clinch the series 2-0.         
	The ball was getting old and the wicket was getting slower and slower.         
	This is a reason we decided to bowl first. If you bat first you need to score 600 plus. It was tough but I think the bowlers did a terrific job, Dhoni said.         
	Bowling a long spell, Zaheer was at his best, decimating the hosts with his seven for 87 in the second innings.         
	Heaping praise on the left-arm seamer, Dhoni said, The ball was old and it was getting reverse swing. It was also keeping low. So we felt we can get some LBW decisions in our favour and decided to give Zaheer a longer spell.         
	Also praising left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha for chipping in with two second innings wicket, Dhoni said, Credit also goes to Ojha who took that one wicket of (Mohammed) Ashraful at that time.         
	Dhoni, however, refused to be complacent.         
	We always can do better. For the last 12 months we have done well in both ODIs and Tests. There is always scope for improvement but the result is very satisfactory, he said.         
	However, Dhoni sounded a bit worried about the number of injuries that haunted the side in this series.         
	Weve had many injuries so I am a bit worried. But with the amount of cricket that we play these days, its okay, he said.         
	Dhonis Bangladesh counterpart Sakib Al Hasan didnt blame the wicket for the comprehensive defeat in the second Test and said they just didnt bat well.         
	We didnt bat well for two hours, especially the one hour before lunch and that brought our downfall. There is nothing wrong with the wicket, he said.         
	Shakib conceded they made the mistake of taking the game lightly when Mohammed Ashraful and Shahadat Hossain were batting splendidly.         
	When Shahadat and Ashraful were batting, we got slightly relaxed. We were laughing in the dressing room and at some point of time we got relaxed, not thinking about the game.         
	We should have thought that the wicket would get tougher. We just could not cope with the situation, he said.         
	Sakib admitted that they were completely outplayed by the Indians in the Test series.         
	We tried our best and did everything we are capable of doing but something went wrong and we have to find out that.         
	On the positive side, I think our bowlers did well and a couple of guys got centuries too, he said.         
	Shakib also said that Zaheer Khan was a much better bowler in Test cricket.         
	He is a much different bowler in Test cricket than in one-dayers. It was difficult for us to face him, the home team captain said.           (PTI)

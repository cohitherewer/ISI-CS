            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                            
	Dirk Kuyt admits he has dreamt of playing in a World Cup final all his life, but the Netherlands and Liverpool winger knows he needs to put those thoughts aside and focus on the job ahead.         
	The hard-working 29-year-old has been a key player for his country and is certain to take his place in the starting line-up against Uruguay in their World Cup semi-final on Tuesday.         
	He said the whole team was excited at still being in the tournament, but they were not get getting carried away at the prospect of meeting either Germany or Spain in the decider.         
	We are all so happy and we know how close we are to getting to the final, he said. This is something we have dreamed about our whole lives but we know that we have got to be careful and everyone expects us to get there now. We have got to make sure we stick together and not get too carried away because the semi-final will be the hardest game we play.         
	Kuyt, who blossomed at Feyenoord where he scored 83 goals in 122 matches, moved to Liverpool in 2006 and said he was looking forward to working with new manager Roy Hodgson.         
	The Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk was cautious while speaking to the media on Monday.         
	The euphoria at home is massive at the moment and maybe its good that were so far away and cant witness it because we really need to focus on Uruguay and that wont be easy. They didnt reach the semi-final for nothing, so we have to really focus again and not think that were already there, the coach said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mark Taylor is not game for ICC post 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mark Taylor is not game for ICC post 
    - CA chairman, chief executive to open fresh dialogue with NZC           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mark Taylor                                 
	Calcutta: Mark Taylor, arguably the most suitable candidate to replace Australia-New Zealands joint nominee John Howard, for the International Cricket Council (ICC) vice-presidents post, has said hes not game.         
	That the former Australia captain and one of the all-time great openers may not have the time was, in fact, reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Among other things, Taylor has a lucrative contract with Channel Nine and, for years now, has come to be respected as a commentator.         
	Having turned a media pro, he obviously wouldnt like to abruptly end this innings.         
	Mark has himself gone on record to say hes not in the running. So, theres no question of Cricket Australia (CA) suggesting his name to New Zealand Cricket (NZC), CA spokesman Peter Young pointed out, on Friday evening.         
	Earlier in the day, the CAs directors (including Taylor) had a teleconference and it was decided that chairman Jack Clarke and chief executive James Sutherland would liaise with NZC on the way forward.         
	The two boards have time till August 31 to make a fresh nomination, after the ICC Executive Boards rejection of Howard (a former Prime Minister of Australia), during the recent annual conference week, in Singapore.         
	India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the West Indies got together to oppose Howard. Besides Australia and New Zealand, he had the support of only England.         
	To make it, Howard required the support of seven of the 10 Test-playing nations. As it turned out, exactly that many werent in his favour.         
	Like it or not, its all about numbers and the opposition to Howard is going to stay even if CA and NZC decide to nominate him yet again.         
	According to Young, though, the Howard issue wasnt discussed during the teleconference.         
	You must remember that Mr Howard is the joint nominee of CA and NZC and, so, there cant be a unilateral decision. The chairman and chief executive will get back to our board members after speaking to NZC, Young maintained.         
	One understands that the NZC board will meet on July 23, while the CA board isnt scheduled to meet before August 13.         
	At this point in time, the ICC is without a vice-president. The one who gets nominated will succeed Sharad Pawar, as the president, in 2012.

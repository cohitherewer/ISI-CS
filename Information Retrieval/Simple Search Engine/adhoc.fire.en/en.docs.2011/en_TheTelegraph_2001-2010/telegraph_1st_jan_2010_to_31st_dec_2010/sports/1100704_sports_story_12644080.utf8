            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	London: Serena Williams beat Vera Zvonareva in straight sets 6-3, 6-2 to win her fourth Wimbledon championship and her 13th Grand Slam  taking her to sixth on the all-time Slam winners list. Fierce hitting and stunning serving from Serena, as well as nerves from Zvonareva in her first ever Grand Slam final, combined to create one of the most one-sided finals the spectators on Centre Court have ever seen.         
	There is one day remaining, of course, and anything can happen, but for now at least this weirdest of Wimbledons had no more curve balls left to throw. Roger Federer gone before the mens final for the first time since 2003, no rain for a fortnight, the longest match in the history of tennis  naturally. Serena lose the ladies singles final? Dont be daft.         
	Serena had dwarfed Zvonareva at the photo session before the start, towering over her as they tried to smile for the cameras before battle commenced, and the dominating presence never went. From the first game of the match when Zvonareva couldnt even force Serena to stray a yard from the centre of the court, to the final games of the second set, when she had to play through a haze of tears.         
	This is Serenas fourth Wimbledon Venus Rosewater Dish. It was brutal.         
	In her previous games, the crowds watching Zvonareva had been evenly split. Sexist it may sound, but the boys were cheering for the pretty Russian, the girls going for Zvonarevas opponent: the underdog. This time, the whole crowd were with her. It told its own story. The key moment came when Serena broke to go 5-3 up with a running cross-court forehand down the line, allowing her to serve for the opening set.         
	When Zvonareva went down two breaks in the second set, she started crying. At 4-1, there was no way back.         
	My dream was able to come true, Serena said after accepting the Venus Rosewater Dish from the Duke of Kent with a curtsy. Everyones dream can come true if you just stick to it and work hard. This one is very special.         
	Serena, who has won five of the last eight Grand Slams, moved ahead of Billie Jean King into sole possession of sixth place on the all-time list of womens Grand Slam champions with 13, the most of any active woman player. Serena also has five Australian Opens, three US Opens and one French Open. She turned to King, who was sitting in the Royal Box, and said: Hey, Billie  I got you. This is No. 13 for me now. Its just amazing to able to be among such great people. King grinned and applauded. Thats actually my lucky number, Serena said of No. 13.         
	In the mens doubles final, the Austrian-German pair of Jurgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner beat Robert Lindstedt of Sweden and Romanian Horia Tecau 6-1, 7-5, 7-5. Zvonarevo lost in the womens doubles final with compatriot Elena Vesnina. They lost 6-7 (6), 2-6 to Vania King and Yaroslava Shvedova.

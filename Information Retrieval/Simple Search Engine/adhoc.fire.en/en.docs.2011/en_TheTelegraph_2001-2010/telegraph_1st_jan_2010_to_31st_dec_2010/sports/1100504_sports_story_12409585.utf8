The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weve improved in the past 12 months: Clarke 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Weve improved in the past 12 months: Clarke 
                  Man of the Match Shane Watson in a punishing mood, in Gros Islet, on Sunday                     
	Gros Islet: World champions in Tests and one-dayers but considered duds in Twenty20, Australian skipper Michael Clarke says his sides win over Pakistan on Sunday has shown how much it has improved in the games shortest format in the past one year.         
	Theres extra motivation from within the squad, we want to perform better in Twenty20 cricket then we have in general. I think our form has improved over the last 12 months and weve started really well, Clarke said after the 34-run triumph over Pakistan.         
	The key is going to be adapting to conditions and I think weve got a really good squad to do that, he added.         
	Australia face Bangladesh up next and Clarke said it would be foolish to take them lightly. We got beaten by Zimbabwe a couple of days ago. It just shows in this form of the game, you have to be at your best, it doesnt matter who you are playing against, he said.         
	We certainly wont be taking Bangladesh lightly. Theyve got some wonderful Twenty20 players who are very aggressive with the bat.         
	Reflecting on the teams performance, in which all-rounder Shane Watson and David Hussey starred with knocks of 81 and 53 respectively, Clarke said the batting success made it easier for the bowlers.         
	It was a very good start from the boys. Obviously our batting sets the game up there, getting 191 runs, Clarke told reporters. The bowlers did a great job as well in the first six overs up front and we caught really well as well.         
	Clarke said the variety in Australias pace attack gives them the edge over other teams.         
	All four fast bowlers in our squad are not just four fast bowlers who just run in and bowl at the same pace, and bowl the same ball every ball, he said. Theyve got great variation, great pace and the key for those guys is their execution which they did really well, (PTI)

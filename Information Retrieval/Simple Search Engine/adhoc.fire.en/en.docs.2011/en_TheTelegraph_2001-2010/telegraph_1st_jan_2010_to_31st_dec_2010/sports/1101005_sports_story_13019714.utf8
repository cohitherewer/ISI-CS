            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Ben Hilfenhaus did to India what Ishant Sharma did to Australia. The Australian quickie, on Monday, removed three key Indian batsmen, who could take the hosts beyond the finishline.         
	The visitors may sulk failing to set up a bigger target for India, but Hilfenhaus brought cheer for Ricky Pontings men by sending back Gambhir, Sehwag and Raina.         
	There was some disappointment for not putting up a few more runs on the board in our second innings However, by the end of the day, we were pleased with our performance. We were successful in sending four Indian batsmen back to the pavilion, Hilfenhaus said.         
	The wicket is playing pretty well Theres good bounce in the track now and its good for the bowlers, he said.         
	Hilfenhaus said Sachin Tendulkars wicket would be crucial on Tuesday. We are definitely sensing victory We will try to dismiss him early tomorrow. We have a plan to put pressure on him. Hopefully, he will succumb to that, he said.

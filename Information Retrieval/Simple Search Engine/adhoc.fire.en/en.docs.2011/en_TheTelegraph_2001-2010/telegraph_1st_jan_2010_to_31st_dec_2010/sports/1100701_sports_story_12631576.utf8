   - Back and leg issue bothers Swiss as he bows out of big W                        
	London: Exasperated that his body could not hold up to Tomas Berdychs onslaught, Roger Federer had one thing on his mind after his shock Wimbledon quarter final exit  getting as far away from tennis as quickly as possible.         
	A news conference packed with eager journalists was clearly the last place on earth Federer wanted to be, cupping his weary head in his hands, counting down the minutes before a plane whisks him away for two weeks of rest and recuperation.         
	Followers of Federer knew something was amiss when the great champion trailed claycourt journeyman Alejandro Falla in the first round, and their worst fears were confirmed in startling fashion on a sun-kissed Centre Court on Wednesday.         
	Struggling for the fluency and finesse that has marked his reign at the All England Club, Federer crumbled in four sets.         
	I was just not able to defend well enough and I didnt come up with the good stuff when I had to. It was disappointing, said Federer deadpanned.         
	A niggling leg injury sustained in the pre-Wimbledon tune-up event at Halle and a stiff back, which went away after he defeated Falla and returned again to stifle his movement on Wednesday, did not aid help Federers cause.         
	I am struggling with a little bit of a back and a leg issue. That just doesnt quite allow me to play the way I would like to play. When youre hurting, you just dont feel as comfortable. You cant concentrate on each and every point because you do feel the pain.         
	Under the circumstances I think I played a decent match. But Ive been feeling bad for the last two, three matches now. So if theres anything good about this, its Im gonna get some rest, thats for sure.         
	While visibly nonplussed by the result, Federer still dwelt on the few positives. Quarters is a decent result. Obviously people think quarters is shocking, but people would die to play in the quarter final stages of Grand Slam play.         
	Its not something Im used to doing, losing in quarter finals, its not something Ive done in the last six years. I was struggling with my own game and with my physique. Im looking forward to a rest, and then attack again in North America.         
	Will he be watching Sundays final? I dont think so, Ill be on vacation.         
	Berdych however, said he didnt notice anything wrong with Federer.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals aim to carry form
                                                                                                                       7                                      Royals aim to carry form
                      
	Ahmedabad: The Rajasthan Royals have managed to bring their campaign back on track with back-to-back wins but Shane Warne and Co. face a stern test of resilience when they take on the Deccan Chargers in an Indian Premier League match on Friday.         
	The subplot will be provided by the battle of former teammates, Warne and Adam Gichrist, who had once ruled the game as members of an all-conquering Australia side.         
	The Royals, who have been hit by injuries with Graeme Smith and Dimitri Marcarenhas out for the season, came up with an all-round show to register their second win against laggards Kings XI Punjab on Wednesday but the clash against the Chargers would be a much bigger test of character.         
	The Chargers have been on a roll with three victories on the trot and they would want to see that winning streak extended at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera on Friday.         
	For the Chargers, Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds has emerged almost like a born-again cricketer after he was dumped from the national side.         
	Symonds has been in good form for the Chargers in IPL III and picked up the Man of the Match award for his performance against the Delhi Daredevils last week. The top-order batsmen, led by captain Gilchrist and Herschelle Gibbs, have got the starts in their pursuit of big scores.         
	On the bowling front, veteran Sri Lankan Chaminda Vaas has been among the wickets, utilising his vast international experience while opening the bowling and at death.         
	Rohit Sharma and Pragyan Ojha, too, have been doing reasonably well although the former has not been contributing much with the bat. The only worry for the Chargers has been Rudra Pratap Singh leaking runs.         
	The good news for the Royals is that the side have performed like a cohesive unit in their last two matches.         
	Fortunately for the Jaipur-based side, Australian pacer Shaun Tait seemed to have got back his rhythm with a fine show against the Kings XI. Also, Siddharth Trivedi has been doing the job of stifling rival batsmen quite well.

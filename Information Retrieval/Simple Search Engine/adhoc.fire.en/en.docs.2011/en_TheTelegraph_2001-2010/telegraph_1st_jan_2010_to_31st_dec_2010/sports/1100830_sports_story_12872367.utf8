            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Saurav Ghosal, the world No. 26 squash player, said that he was unhappy with the controversies surrounding the Commonwealth Games.         
	As an Indian, I really feel sad with whats happening around. Of course, its not possible to bring in changes at the eleventh hour. But I do feel that some people need to be held accountable, said Saurav at a media conference.         
	However, if any player gets demotivated by the off-the-court incidents, he is not concentrating on whats more important to him, he added.         
	Meanwhile, the Punj Lloyd All India inter school east zone squash championship, in association with the SRFI, will be held at the Calcutta Racket Club, from Monday to Saturday.         
	The championship will be played in individual and team categories. Students from five schools will participate in the under-11, 13, 15 and 17 events.

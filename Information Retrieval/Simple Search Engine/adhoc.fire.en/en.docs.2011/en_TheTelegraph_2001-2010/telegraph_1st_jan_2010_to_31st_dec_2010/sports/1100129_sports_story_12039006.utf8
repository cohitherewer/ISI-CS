	Margao: Dempo Sports Club will bank on home advantage to keep their winning momentum going when they meet East Bengal on Friday in the Round XII I-League match at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda here.         
	Dempo, who played without Beto and Ranty Martins, did well to demolish Sporting Clube de Goa and regain the top spot with 22 points.         
	Joaquim Abranches, who replaced injured Ranty Martins, played well upfront scoring a goal. Dempo will be once again relying on him to do the damage to the rival defence who are looking good after their Federation Cup triumph.         
	East Bengal carried on their Federation Cup triumph into the I-League when they ended defending champions Churchill Brothers unbeaten run beating them in a 3-2 thriller in their last match.         
	Yakubu will be the one Dempos defence will have to watch closely.         
	He along with Bhaichung Bhutia, Abel Hammond and Alvito DCunha have combined well among themselves.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder said his team will be playing for full points.         
	We are in good form and we are confident of logging full points, he said.           (PTI)

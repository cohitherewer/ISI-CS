The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Muralis action legitimate 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Muralis action legitimate 
                      
	Melbourne: Australian spin legend Shane Warne has given a clean chit to Muttiah Muralidharans action, saying he did not think the Sri Lankan tweaker was a chucker.         
	Muralis action has been passed by scientific tests... I always thought it was legitimate, Warne said.         
	But because of the way he bowled, I was worried that young spinners would try to copy his action and end up bowling illegally, the Australian said of his one-time great competitor.         
	Muralidharan has already announced that he will quit the longer version of the game after the first Test, against India, starting Sunday at Galle.         
	Warne said with the off-spinners retirement, world cricket will lose one of its great competitors.         
	Murali simply loved bowling  he loved a challenge (and) was fantastic for the game, he said.         
	Sometimes he would pick my brain about different things and, although we always tried to outdo each other, we always got on well.         
	Warne also feels that it will be a Herculean task for any other bowler to achieve Muralidharans world record of Test wickets.         
	Warne retired with 708 Test wickets while Muralitharan has 792 scalps to his credit but still has one more match to take his tally to 800 wickets.         
	I dont think it will ever be broken. Even though so much more Test cricket is played these days, I think Muralis record will stand for a long, long time and probably forever, Warne said.         
	You just have to work it out by numbers  for that record to be broken someone has to play 140-150 Tests and take 5-6 wickets a Test. That will take some doing, he added.         
	A few days ago, former Australian umpire Ross Emerson, who had no-balled Muralidharan seven times during a Gabba one-day International years back, had said that the offie does not deserve to retire from Test cricket as the most distinguished wicket-taker of all time.         
	I havent changed my views in 15 years  he doesnt deserve the record, Emerson had said.         
	You cannot compare his record to Shane Warnes  no one ever doubted the legality of Warnes action. Murali was a great competitor and a great bowler but a lot of the time he just didnt bowl within the limits of the law, the umpire had said.         
	Muralidharans action first came under the scanner when another Australian umpire Darrell Hair called him for throwing during Sri Lankas tour Down Under in 1995-96.         
	Hair still stands by his decision. I have no angst over him holding the record but the fact that the rules had to be changed to handle bowlers like that vindicated my actions and the actions of other umpires who called him, Hair had said.         
	Muralidharan himself, however, had said that he was not bothered with the scrutiny he faced in his career. No I dont regret. People have opinions, they can carry their opinions. I dont care as long as I am clean... And my supporters think I am clean.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lack of equipment hinders practice
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lack of equipment hinders practice
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With less than a month to go for the Commonwealth Games, the preparations of Indian sportspersons, in at least three events, have been badly hit due to the lack of equipment.         
	While the dengue hit 27-member cycling squad has been sent to Patiala for practice, the participants are yet to get the bikes promised by the Sports Authority of India (SAI), months ago.         
	The worst hit, however, is the full-bore shooting team. The seven-member squad, which will leave for England, on September 15, to attend a training camp will have everything in their baggage, except rifles.         
	SAI had promised to import the necessary rifles for the shooters long ago, but we are yet to receive them, said an official of the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI).         
	Now, the rifles may be delivered by the third week of September, but by that time, the team will be in England and will have to practise with borrowed rifles, he added.         
	The official went on to say that though NRAI asked for 15 rifles, SAI will be able to provide them with only four.         
	Chief coach CS Dhillon said that efforts are on to deliver the rifles in Bisley, Surrey, where the team would be practising.         
	There is a chance of the team getting their rifles in England, but we are not sure, he said.         
	The government had sanctioned Rs 678 crore for the preparations of the sportspersons for the Commonwealth Games.         
	More than Rs 30 crore was spent in building the state-of-the-art Kadarpur Shooting Range, where the full-bore event will be held during the Commonwealth Games.         
	During the Commonwealth Shooting Championships at the same venue, last April, Indian shooters had to use borrowed rifles that was arranged by Commonwealth Shooting Federation president Graeme Hudson.         
	No better is the condition of the 19-member gymnastics squad, which has been complaining about the paucity of equipment, at the Indira Gandhi Stadium, for a long time.         
	Their demands, too, are yet to be fulfilled.         
	A distraught Indian foreign coach, Vladimir Chertkov, has already gone on record blaming the authorities for lack of facilities at the venue.         
	But the Organising Committee continues to maintain that they were satisfied with the arrangements.

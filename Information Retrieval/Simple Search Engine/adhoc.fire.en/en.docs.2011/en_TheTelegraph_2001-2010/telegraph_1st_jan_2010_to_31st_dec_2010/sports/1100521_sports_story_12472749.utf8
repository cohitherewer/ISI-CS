The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For the two Koreas, joint appearance turns sour
                                                                                                                       7                                        For the two Koreas, joint appearance turns sour
            NYT NEWS SERVICE            North Korean striker Jong Tae Se during a send-off reception at Nagoya, in Japan                           
	Seoul: With both North and South Korea in the World Cup for the first time, many on this war-divided peninsula were hoping that sports could cross the border and unite people.         
	The feeling was so strong that some South Korean lawmakers even proposed to send a united group of fans to South Africa to support both Korean teams.         
	But the sinking of a South Korean warship in March has shattered the mood and heightened tensions between the two nations, turning the World Cup into a missed opportunity less than a month before the games start.         
	With Seoul expected to accuse the North Korea of firing a torpedo that sank the Southern ship, a diplomatic push to haul the North before the U.N. Security Council seems likely to follow.         
	Its a far different feeling than in 1966, when North Korea made its last appearance in the World Cup and  despite Cold War tensions  won over fans in Britain and elsewhere. The lightly regarded North Koreans produced a famous upset, eliminating Italy to advance to the quarterfinals.         
	They took a 3-0 lead against Portugal, but the Portuguese  led by the legendary Eusebio  surged back with five goals to put an end to the North Koreans fairy-tale run.         
	A lot has changed for the Koreas in the four decades since that tournament.         
	Today, the cash-strapped North relies on handouts to feed its people, while the South boasts the worlds 15th largest economy.         
	Sanctions for its nuclear defiance have further strained the North and earned pariah status for the regime led by Kim Jong Il. Footage from 1966 shows the North Koreans interacting playfully with their newfound English fans as they wave and sign autographs, even bouncing local kids on their knees.         
	Soccer could be one way to reach out to the North Koreans and break down political walls, said the former South Korean foreign minister, Han Sung-joo, citing the Ping-Pong diplomacy that between the U.S. and China in the 1970s.         
	North Korea and South Korea remain locked in a state of war because they never signed a peace treaty at the close of the three-year Korean War in 1953. Sports, however, has been one arena where both sides have made fledgling efforts at reconciliation.         
	At the 2000 Summer Olympics, athletes from the two Koreas walked into Stadium Australia together under a unification flag to an emotional standing ovation. Hopes were high that the Koreas might eventually field a united team.         
	Last year, the blue-and-white unity flag fluttered in the packed stands at the World Cup Stadium in Seoul as North Korea played the South, with the home teams exuberant fans cheering for both squads.         
	Han, who now heads South Koreas bid to host the World Cup in 2022, has a bold vision for the Koreas if the South wins: He wants to hold three or four games in North Korea.         
	Jong Tae Se, a North Korean striker , said holding World Cup games in the North would be historic.         
	It would be beyond our wildest dreams, and I would be happy and all Korean people would be happy, Jong, who was born and raised in Japan but holds a North Korean passport, said .         
	For now, North Koreas hopes rest with the World Cup squad, the most visible ambassadors the nation has had in decades.

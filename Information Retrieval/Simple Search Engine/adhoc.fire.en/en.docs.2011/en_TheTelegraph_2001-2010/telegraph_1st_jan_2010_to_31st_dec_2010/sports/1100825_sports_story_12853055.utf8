The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have worked on flaws: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Have worked on flaws: Dhoni
    - Captain backs Rohit and Jadeja ahead of key tie vs nz             A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni inspects the wicket in Dambulla, on Tuesday                                 
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that the top-order batsmen have worked on their flaws and one will find a better execution from them on Wednesday, against New Zealand.         
	Speaking at a media conference, on Tuesday, Dhoni highlighted the importance of patience for batsmen during the first 20 overs.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the match being billed as a virtual semi-final         
	We have practised for the last couple of days. Had an optional session on Monday and a full session today (Tuesday). As of now, there are no injuries. Yes, its a virtual semi-final. If we win, well proceed to the final, else we return home. I think the preparation has been very good. Hopefully, the execution will also be good.         
	If there is any pressure ahead of the crunch tie         
	Its more about that particular day. The bowlers have to keep bowling in the right areas, keep building the pressure. And its important to take early wickets so that you can put pressure on the opposition.         
	Whether the batsmen have worked on their weaknesses         
	Two to three days in between matches gives you good enough time to work on your flaws. But, at the same time, its more about the mindset in ODIs  we are so used to going after and hitting the bowlers right from the first delivery. Not only in the sub-continent, but also in other parts of the world, the wickets are a lot flatter now, especially for ODIs. Give respect to the bowlers for the first 10 overs, and the next 40 overs will be yours. This (Dambulla) is one of those venues where you have to prolong the respect for bowlers by another 10 overs. If you dont lose too many wickets for 20 overs, then you can really dictate terms to the bowlers and can have your own gameplan.         
	Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharmas performance on this tour         
	You have to see the strength of an individual player. Especially, if you see Ravindra Jadejas bowling performance in the past one-and-a-half years, he has bowled really well in majority of the matches. He is literally our fifth bowler unless you can find an all-rounder who can bowl 10 overs for us. For Rohit, its a tricky situation. He has been in and out of the side quite a number of times. Theres pressure when you are always in and out of the side. Also these are tough conditions for batting. He is working hard.         
	Whether there will be any change in the batting order         
	Well have to see exactly what is thrown at us. We have to see what kind of start we get. One good thing for us is we have a lot of players who can bat at different positions.         
	On playing seven specialist batsmen         
	That is definitely one of the options But then, you have to see whether in these conditions we can bowl well with the part-timers. If we let them off the hook, it will become difficult to chase a stiff target. At the same time, it may be difficult to contain them if they are chasing. We have to strike a balance...         
	The challenge of facing short-pitched deliveries         
	The tall bowlers, we all know, will extract bounce. But they are not quick bowlers. So we just have to be careful not to fish at the ball. Rather, we will just leave or play a shot that we are capable of playing.         
	If India are banking too much on individuals         
	That has always been the case in Indian cricket. When it comes to individual brilliance, you want one batsman to play a big innings, whoever the batsman might be. Especially, on these kind of wickets, individual brilliance is important because you have one batsman batting through and the others batting around him.         
	The wicket         
	I think the wicket will behave the way it has behaved throughout the tournament. Initially, there will be a bit of help for the seamers. Once you are through the 25-over mark without losing too many wickets, you can set a decent target.         
	Indias huge defeats         
	As a team, we are disappointed about it. But if you see, all the matches have been one-sided, which suggests that if you lose too many wickets earlier on, there is bound to be a batting collapse. We have seen that it has happened throughout the tournament. The batsmen are trying to work out their plans as to what needs to be done. Most of the batsmen havent got out to bad shots.         
	On Wasim Akram terming Indian youngsters as soft         
	I dont know what Wasim Akram has said. For me, whats important is how the team is shaping up. If you talk about the team being soft, it must be mentioned that we have done really well in adverse and difficult conditions. Even in the Asia Cup, we did well with youngsters. So I dont think you should make a statement based on three or four games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akhil has a great fall
                                                                                                                       7                                        Akhil has a great fall
                  Akhil Kumar                     
	New Delhi: The shoddy state of the Games Village stood exposed Saturday, when the Indian boxing team checked in at their residential block, only to find defending Commonwealth Games gold medallist Akhil Kumars bed collapsing.         
	The 10-member Indian team, comprising among others, Olympic and world championship bronze medallist Vijender Kumar, were also kept waiting for nearly four hours at the Olympic Bhavan here for the bus to take them to the Games Village.         
	On reaching the Village, Akhil said it was a rude shock as his bed collapsed when he sat down to take rest after a long journey.         
	We reached the Olympic Bhavan late in the afternoon to collect our accreditation cards. But when I sat down on my bed to take rest, it collapsed, he said.         
	I checked the bed and part of it has no plywood on it. It was very disappointing after having endured a long journey. The athletes are at least entitled to a decent place to rest. Even the toilets are not very clean. I have told coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu about this, said the boxer who will compete in 56kg category at the Commonwealth Games.         
	Apart from Akhil and Vijender (75kg), the team also comprises Asian champion Suranjoy Singh (52kg) and Commonwealth champions Jai Bhagwan (60kg) and Dinesh Kumar (81kg). (PTI)

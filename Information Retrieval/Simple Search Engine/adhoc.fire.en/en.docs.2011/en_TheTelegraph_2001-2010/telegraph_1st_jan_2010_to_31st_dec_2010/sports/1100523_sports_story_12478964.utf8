The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa has a chance if fully fit

	The jaded injury riddled world of the top ranking stars sprang to life when Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer clashed in the final of the Madrid Masters. Missing from the line-up were top players like Novak Djokovic, Juan Martin del Potro, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick, Fernando Gonzalez, Tomas Berdych while Jo-Wilfried Tsonga retired hurt after playing just one set.         
	The tournament attracted global attention because it resurrected in the final the Federer-Nadal rivalry, one of the greatest in the history of the game. Their clashes in the past have been spellbinding, especially the 2008 Wimbledon final, considered one of the greatest finals of all time.         
	With victories at Monte Carlo and Rome, Nadal was on a hattrick of spring-time Masters. Federer, struggling with his form, had played only nine matches since winning the Australian Open in January. Incredibly, out of the nine he had lost five of them. He stated that he was aiming to peak so as to retain his French Open title.         
	Nadals 6-4, 7-6 victory produced a close tension packed encounter, with occasional flashes of past brilliance. The Spaniards consistency and variety of ground shots prevailed over Federers superior service game which was sprinkled with aces. Both were far from their best form. Nadal had more unforced errors than usual while Federer was not able to dominate the rallies as in the past.         
	Since Nadal has moved up to the No. 2 spot in the ranking, a clash with Federer can only happen in the final at Roland Garros. But the path to the summit clash for both is by no means an easy one.         
	So often in modern tennis a better player loses because he is injured or has not fully recovered from an injury. But the slow clay of Roland Garros is the most punishing test in the game. Rallies of between 20-30 shots are frequent and the matches are of much longer duration. If there is a chink in your armour it will be found out and exploited ruthlessly.         
	If Nadal has not fully recovered from the tendinitis in his knees and other problems, he will be put on the rack. The physically relaxed Federer will have to sharpen up his game considerably. One wonders if the mileage on his clock with 16 Grand Slams and his age of 28 years will eventually start to signal a decline.         
	Both Nadal and Federer are vulnerable. It is not like the old days when they were far ahead of the rest of the pack. The pack has caught up with them and they feel positive about their chances of bringing the duo down.         
	In the absence of Juan Martin del Potro, the 66 Argentinean giant who powered his way to win the US Open, Andy Murray and Djokovic will be the main challengers. Del Potros absence due to wrist surgery will keep him out of the game till after the US Open in September.         
	It will be a huge loss to the game. He is one of several top players between the 64 to 69 range in height who are making their presence felt in the top echelons of the game.         
	It seems that in the future the taller players with their power and telescopic reach will dominate the game, unless there is another Federer lurking in the ranks. If Nadal is fully fit he will be a good bet to win la Coupe des Mousquetaires for the fifth time.

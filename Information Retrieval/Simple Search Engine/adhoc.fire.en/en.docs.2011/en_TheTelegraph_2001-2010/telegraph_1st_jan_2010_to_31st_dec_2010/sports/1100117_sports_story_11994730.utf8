The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | THE WAR OF WORDS IN CHITTAGONG
                                                                                                                       7                                      THE WAR OF WORDS IN CHITTAGONG
                                        Shakib-al Hasan      
	VIRENDER SEHWAG (Indias stand-in captain): Bangladesh is an ordinary side... They can surprise in one-day cricket, but not in Test matches... It will be difficult for Bangladesh to take 20 Indian wickets... Even Sri Lanka couldnt do so (in the recent series)... Im not saying all this out of overconfidence... Were not worried about Bangladeshs preparations, were looking at what we need to do... Being No.1 isnt going to change our thinking or attitude...                     Jamie Siddons		    
	SHAKIB-AL HASAN (Bangladesh captain): I dont want to comment on what Sehwag has said, hes entitled to his opinion... A declaration can come into the picture and, in that case, you dont have to take 20 wickets... Even the Indians are human and its not that they cant get out... Today, India is ranked No.1, but I feel South Africa and Australia are the top teams (in Test cricket)... They are much better than India... We dont have a defeatist attitude, if we did, we wouldnt be taking the field...         
	JAMIE SIDDONS (Bangladesh coach): He (Sehwag) probably shouldnt come before a mike! Every team goes through phases of development... We look to improve and will be taking this series day by day... Indias No.1 and to get there you need to win games... Indias won enough... Well have to work hard to get 20 wickets in every Test...

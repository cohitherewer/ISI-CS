The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto brilliance in Bagan victory
                                                                                                                       7                                        Barreto brilliance in Bagan victory
  - Chidi, murithala on target too       A STAFF REPORTER            Barreto on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans 4-0 victory over Tollygunge Agragami in their CFL Premier Division opener can be segregated in to two phases. The first 65 minutes, when Jose Ramirez Barreto cut a lonely figure upfront with virtually no support from midfield or his fellow strikers.         
	And the last 25 minutes, when a half-fit Edeh Chidi was introduced in place of Subair Murithala Ali. With his inclusion suddenly the Bagan attack which till then lacked fizz started looking lethal. The Barreto-Chidi combination toyed with the inexperienced Tollygunge defence and in the end the 5000 odd spectators left home satisfied.         
	On Wednesday, Barreto earned a penalty for his side and then scored twice.         
	Agreed Chidis goal (teams fourth) was the best of the match but the Brazilian talismans cracking 30-yard pile driver in the 69th minute will rank as one of the best goals he has scored for Bagan. Such was the ferocity of the low drive that the opposition custodian Raju Ganguly could hardly do anything even after getting his hands on the ball.         
	The deadlock was broken in first minute of stoppage time in the first half when Barreto entered the box on receiving a pass from Ashim. As he tried to flick the ball over defender Sundarlal Hembrem, the latter handled the ball and Bagan were awarded a spot-kick. Murithala made no mistake from the spot.         
	However it was Chidis introduction that made Bagan attack look more potent. The third goal in the 88th minute was a joint effort from the duo. Chidi received the ball in central midfield and played a long ball for Barreto who raced down the right flank. Though he wanted to keep a pull back from Manish Mathani his shot deflected off Hembrem before going in.         
	The fourth from Chidi was the best. The Nigerian weaved past a couple of defenders first with an inside dodge and followed it up with an outside dodge before unleashing a booming shot that rammed into the far corner of the net.         
	Teams

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | White century powers Australia to victory
                                                                                                                       7                                        White century powers Australia to victory
                  Cameron White                     
	Brisbane: Cameron White finally showed he could be a potent force at home as his muscular century pushed Australia to a five-wicket win in the first ODI against Pakistan Friday. The hosts reached the target of 275 with nine balls to spare.         
	For the first time in Australia, White has scored more than 50. His match-winning knock of 105 came off 88 balls. Australia were uncomfortable after slipping to 84/3 with Ricky Pontings exit, but White joined Michael Clarke to settle the nerves and then take the major responsibility on himself after the vice-captains departure, according to Cricinfo.         
	White hit three consecutive sixes off Shahid Afridi between long on and mid-wicket in the 41st over. Those blows turned the steep required rate into comfortable. Afridi himself had scored a 26-ball 48, but White made sure it was his fireworks that will be recalled first.         
	He innings had four sixes and eight fours, including an unorthodox cross-bat down the ground off Rana Naved-ul-Hasan followed by a textbook cover drive in the same over. The all-rounder was finally bowled by Rana, going for another boundary. Michael Hussey, who was unbeaten on 35, finished the task to earn a 1-0 lead in the five-match series         
	Salman Butts 72 had put Pakistan on track for a sizeable total, and Afridi made sure it materialised, with a powerful late surge, that took them to 274. After winning the toss, the visitors had a series of useful stands over most of the innings.         
	Australia had fought back from Butts display through Watson and Clint McKay, but when the visitors were wobbled at 227/7 in the 44th over, Afridi steadied them. He forced a six to long-off from Nathan Hauritz before pulling Peter Siddle into the stands at mid-wicket to provide a much-needed boost during the batting Powerplay.         
	Meanwhile, Cricket Australia informed in a release Friday that all-rounder James Hopes has been included in the Australian squad for the second and third ODIs.

    - Team management may have final say on Zaheer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Harbhajan Singh                                 
	Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan Singh are set to feature in the three-match ODI series against Australia, which begins in Kochi, on Sunday.         
	While Sachin hasnt played an ODI after his record-creating 200 not out in Gwalior, eight months ago, Harbhajan missed the last tournament  tri-series in Sri Lanka  owing to an injury.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the team management may have the final say on Zaheer Khan. Even he wasnt seen in action in Sri Lanka.         
	If the captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) and coach Gary Kirsten want Zaheer to be fresh for the upcoming Test series against New Zealand, then his ODI return is going to be delayed, one of the sources pointed out.         
	Gautam Gambhir and Ishant Sharma, it appears, are still not fit. Both have a knee problem and were left out of the squad for the ongoing Test here.         
	Yusuf Pathan is in the frame, as is Ashok Dinda. Pathan could take Ravindra Jadejas place, while it may turn out to be Dinda or Ranganath Vinay Kumar.         
	The selection committee meeting will be held at the Chinnaswamy, on Tuesday evening.         
	LIKELY SQUAD

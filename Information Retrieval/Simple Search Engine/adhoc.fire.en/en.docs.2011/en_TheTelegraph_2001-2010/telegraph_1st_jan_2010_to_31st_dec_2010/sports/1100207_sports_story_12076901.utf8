	I am a right-arm medium pacer. How does one keep the seam upright when bowling?              
	(Suhom Mukherjee, 17, Calcutta-26)              
	Work with your coach on getting a good grip and good wrist position at the time of delivery.               
	When attempting the defensive stroke off the backfoot against short-pitched deliveries, I often get caught in the close-in field. Please help.              
	(Pradip Chaudhri, 21, Calcutta-41)              
	Dont push at the ball. Also have a high left elbow while defending if you are a right-hander.              
	I am a right-handed batsman. I have a high backlift and that leads to problems when tackling short-pitched deliveries. Please help.              
	(Sunil Saha, 18, Calcutta-12)              
	Adjust your backlift so that you have time on your hands.              
	Are fast bowling all-rounders usually less successful than spin bowling all-rounders?              
	(Ankit Pattnaik, 18, Rourkella)              
	The best all-rounders over the years have been the fast bowling ones.               
	I am a right-handed batsman. I often indulge in careless strokeplay and get out quickly. Despite repeated attempts I havent learnt to be careful. Please help.              
	(Sanket Datta, 21, Calcutta)              
	Know your strengths and be selective in your shot making.               
	I am a decent off-spinner, and want to be an all-rounder. Despite working hard, my batting hasnt improved. I am getting frustrated. Should I only on concentrate on bowling?              
	(Yash Mehta, 21, Calcutta)              
	Yes if it starts affecting your bowling.               
	I am a right-handed batsman. I often get bowled or am adjudged leg before when attempting the flick. Please help.              
	(Soumya Guha, 17, Balasore)              
	Dont go too far across or fall over when attempting the flick.              
	I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to lift the ball, it goes high but never reaches the boundary. Is it due to less bottomhand into the shot?              
	(Sudip Roy, 19, Calcutta)              
	Could be the case. Also you might be lifting your head early.               
	I am a left-arm spinner. Should I bowl round the wicket when there a few spots on the wicket?              
	(S. Banerjee, 24, Agartala)              
	Its better to bowl round the wicket to right-handers most of the time.              
	I am a medium pacer. I often lose balance on my follow through. How does one rectify this?              
	(Sanjay Chaturvedi, 17, Siliguri)              
	Keeping a steady head at the time of delivery might help.

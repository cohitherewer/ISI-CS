The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav may skip the tie against Tripura
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav may skip the tie against Tripura
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly may not feature in Bengals opening Vijay Hazare Trophy (East Zone leg) encounter against Tripura in Cuttack on February 10. Sourav, though, will be available from the second match against Jharkhand on February 12.         
	The senior selection committee, headed by Sambaran Banerjee, will be naming a 15-member squad on Friday. However, it is still not clear whether the squad will be announced for a couple of matches or the whole tournament (five matches).         
	We would ideally like to announce the squad for the whole tournament. But, if CAB wants us to announce it for two matches, we will do just that, one of the selectors said.         
	It will be interesting to watch whether Bengals highest run-getter in the Ranji Trophy, Arindam Das, is inducted into the squad although he isnt a part of the 20-member probables list.         
	In all likelihood, they wont include Arindam citing his poor fielding as one of the reasons.         
	Likely Squad         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Anustup Majumdar, Sreevats Goswami, Sourav Ganguly, Manoj Tiwary, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Sayan Sekhar Mondal, Arnab Nandi, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose, Sourav Sarkar, Mohammed Sami Ahmed/ Syed Eklakh Ahmed, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Iresh Saxena.

	Rustenburg: England were held 1-1 after a horrendous handling error by goalkeeper Robert Green gifted the United States an equaliser in their World Cup opener on Saturday.         
	Green failed to get his body behind Clint Dempseys powerful low shot in the 40th minute on Saturday and it slipped through the West Ham keepers hands.         
	Steven Gerrard put England ahead four minutes into their Group C encounter by flicking the ball past goalkeeper Tim Howard in Rustenburg.         
	Emile Heskey could have restored Englands lead at the start of the second half but his shot  after racing onto Aaron Lennons ball  was easily saved by goalkeeper Tim Howard.         
	Green made amends for his blunder when he turned Jozy Altidores shot on to the post.         
	Earlier, Rustenburg started to welcome a red, white and blue invasion as fans arrived ahead of their Cup match.         
	Supporters from both countries, many clad in their national flag, took the streets around the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on the edge of the city, soaking up the unique atmosphere of Africas first ever World Cup finals.         
	The dusty platinum mining city in South Africas North Western Province has been transformed from an industrial centre into a bright and bustling carnival of football.         
	At the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in the suburb of Phokeng, there was no sign of the chaos which threatened to mar Fridays opening ceremony in Johannesburg when gridlock on the roads left many fans unable to arrive on time.

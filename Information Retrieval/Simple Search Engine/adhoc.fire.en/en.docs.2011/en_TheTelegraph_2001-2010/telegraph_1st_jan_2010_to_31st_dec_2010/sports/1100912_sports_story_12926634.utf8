The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trott denies Akmal taunt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Trott denies Akmal taunt
                      
	Leeds: England batsman Jonathan Trott has denied taunting Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal in the first one-day International over the fixing allegations surrounding the visiting team.         
	Akmal reacted angrily while batting to something Trott said, on Friday, in Englands 24-run win in Durham, forcing the umpires to intervene. There was no further action taken against either player.         
	Akmal, who made 53 in the match, is also reportedly under investigation for spot-fixing, the rigging of events within a match.         
	Trott labelled the incident with Akmal as a mountain out of a molehill, and said it had nothing to do with the allegations of fixing that have resulted in three Pakistan players being suspended and charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	Not at all, nothing like that. Whatever is going on in the background is none of our business. We dont talk about it on the field, Trott said. We dont have any grudges or anything. We just play cricket. The last thing you want is to be dragged down on the field. Its important we project a good image and play within the rules, hard but fair. I havent said anything (to Kamran). I didnt think there was much need (to apologise)  I didnt say anything that extraordinary.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss also attempted to take any heat out of a potential spat, saying he felt Trott did not overstep the mark and that the match officials handled it appropriately.         
	There werent any words that were particularly scolding out there, and the umpires did a good job to cool it all down again, Strauss said. Then the players themselves managed to get on with it, which was important.         
	It was nothing I felt particularly concerned about, just one of those situations where a fielder says something and the batsman bites.         
	The second match in the five-game series is at Headingley, on Sunday, and Trott says England have to stay focused.           (AGENCIES)

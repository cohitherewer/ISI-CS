The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi loses out, again
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yuvi loses out, again
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj has been demoted to Grade B                           
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) believes in really rubbing it in, especially if it happens to be Yuvraj Singh.         
	If being dropped from the Test squad (not just the XI) wasnt bad enough, earlier this season, Yuvraj has been demoted to Grade B in the central contracts list for 2010-11.         
	Suresh Raina, who replaced Yuvraj in the Test XI, during the July-August series in Sri Lanka, has taken his place in Grade A as well.         
	Raina got a hundred on Test debut, yes, but has struggled after that. Hes still in the process of establishing himself at the very highest level.         
	Surely, the BCCI could have added Raina, instead of pushing Yuvraj down, but the Gradation Committee (president Shashank Manohar, secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan and chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth), which met in Chennai on Thursday, chose to target Yuvraj.         
	The selectors, in particular, expect Yuvraj to be a match-winner in the 2011 World Cup, yet the 28-year-old left-handers confidence is repeatedly being hit for a six.         
	So much for looking after players having the potential to alter the complexion of a game. In any case, its not that we have match-winners by the dozen.         
	For now, then, Yuvraj seems condemned. Even big scores in domestic cricket and longer hours at nets may not impress the people who matter.         
	While enhancing the retainership slabs in the three grades, the Gradation Committee has done away with Grade D, which had been introduced in 2008-09.         
	Grade D had a specific purpose  to prevent players from enrolling in the rebel Indian Cricket League... Now that the League is defunct, theres no need to hold out even small carrots, a senior BCCI official told The Telegraph.         
	The official couldnt have been more blunt.         
	As many as 17 players had been accommodated in Grade D, in 2009-10, reducing the central contracts to somewhat of a farce.         
	Incidentally, with that grade part of history, theres nobody from Bengal on the central contracts list. Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda had been there the last time, with each getting a retainership of Rs 15 lakh.         
	The BCCI, meanwhile, has appreciably hiked the match fees for Tests (Rs 7 lakh from Rs 2.5 lakh), ODIs (Rs 4 lakh from Rs 1.6 lakh) and T20 Internationals (Rs 2 lakh from Rs 1 lakh).         
	Goodies for all, then.

	GRADE A (Rs 1 crore, up from Rs 60 lakh): Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S.Laxman, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag, Zaheer Khan, Gautam Gambhir, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cristiano on song as Real crush Villarreal
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cristiano on song as Real crush Villarreal
                  Cristiano Ronaldo                     
	Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo inspired Real Madrid to an entertaining 6-2 victory over Villarreal that moved them within two points of La Liga leaders Barcelona on Sunday.         
	The Portugal forward was a constant threat and led the charge with a thunderous free kick after 18 minutes, before having a hand in four more goals.         
	After Kaka converted a penalty in the 21st, Ronaldo helped set up Gonzalo Higuain for a double, laid on Kakas second and won a penalty at the end scored by Xabi Alonso.         
	Barcelona crushed Racing Santander 4-0 on Saturday and have 58 points from 23 games. Real are on 56 and third-placed Valencia, who host Getafe on Monday, have 43.         
	Cristiano has played very well but the important thing is what the whole team has done, Argentina striker Higuain told reporters.         
	Real coach Manuel Pellegrini needed a positive result after severe media criticism of the 1-0 Champions League defeat at Lyon in the week.         
	Ronaldo set them on the way when he forced a foul on the edge of the area and arrowed a vicious free kick into the top corner for his 12th league goal of the campaign.         
	Real were awarded a penalty when Higuain was tripped and Kaka netted from the spot.         
	Villarreal pulled one back as Marcos Senna curled a superb free kick over the wall in the 31st minute before Ronaldo broke wide in the 54th and crossed for Higuain to restore the two-goal cushion.         
	Villarreal engineered a neat second goal from Brazilian Nilmar in the 66th minute but had no answer to Ronaldos power and pace.

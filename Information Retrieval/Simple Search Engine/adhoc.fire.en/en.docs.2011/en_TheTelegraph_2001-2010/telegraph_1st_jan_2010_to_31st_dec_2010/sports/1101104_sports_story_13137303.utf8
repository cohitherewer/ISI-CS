The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - New season from Friday
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      New season from Friday 
            SRIMAX                        
	Bangalore: The winter season is scheduled to start, here, from Friday. In all there would be 34 days of racing during the season. Concurrently a 17-day Mysore season will also commence  mainly on Wednesdays  from next Thursday.           
	The rainfall has been adequate in the past fortnight, here. Therefore, the track has been rendered fit for racing. The Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) stewards have planned to generate more revenue by increasing the entrance fees from Rs 15 to Rs 20 on all race days. This is at par with any other racing club in the country; said D. M. Kumaraswamy, chairman BTC, to the mediamen on Wednesday.           
	However, there has been no increase in the stake money this season.          
	To another question about the punishment  given by the Mysore Race Club (MRC) to the erring professionals  being diluted by the BTC, under whose guards the MRC conducts racing, Kumaraswamy said: BTC goes purely on case to case basis.           
	However, it is generally felt that the frequency of such dilution is not only demoralising the MRC stewards but it is also giving room for more mischief by the race professionals.           
	The following are the important meetings: The Bangalore 1000 Guineas (on November 27), Bangalore 2000 Guineas (December 11), Bangalore Oaks (January 1), Bangalore Derby (January 26), Sprinters Trial Stakes (January 29) and Stayers Trial Stakes (February 3).

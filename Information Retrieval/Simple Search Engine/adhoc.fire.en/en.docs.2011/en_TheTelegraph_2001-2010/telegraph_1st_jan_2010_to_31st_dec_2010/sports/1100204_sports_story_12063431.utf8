The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting practice for the Proteas
                                                                                                                       7                                        Batting practice for the Proteas

	Nagpur: South Africa made the most of their drawn practice match against the Board Presidents XI with their top-order looking in good nick even though Piyush Chawla and R Ashwin proved that the Proteas can be vulnerable against quality spin.         
	Having bowled out the Board Presidents XI for 318, Graeme Smith and his men did overwhelm the target to reach 354 but leg-spinner Chawla (4/88) and off-spinner Ashwin (3/96) exposed the vulnerability of the South Africans, especially the middle and lower-order, against turning balls.         
	The visitors, on their part, can draw confidence from the fact that Ashwell Prince (42), Smith (45), Hashim Amla (72 retired), Jacques Kallis (63 retired), AB de Villiers (27) and JP Duminy (39) all got the starts and looked in form.         
	Resuming the second and final day on 44 for no loss at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, on Wednesday, South Africa lost their captain when Abhimanyu Mithun had Smith caught behind.         
	Prince looked good for a fifty when Ashwin trapped him eight runs off the mark to reduce the visitors to 115 for two.         
	Amla and Kallis batted with utmost ease and milked the Board Presidents XI attack which just could not trouble the veteran duo.         
	Kallis was particularly impressive, using his feet well against the spinners, while he cut and pulled the pacers with elan to race to his half-century, which came when he hit Chawla over his head for a massive six.         
	He grew so much in confidence that he started stepping out to meet even the pacers.         
	Amla was tentative early in his innings but once he found his foot, the right-hander played some delectable flicks and cover-drives en route to his fifty.           (PTI)

	Chennai: Ravichandran Ashwin on Tuesday said that this was a performance he had been waiting for. The off-spinners three-wicket haul broke the backbone of the Kolkata Knight Riders batting and sent them crashing to defeat at the Chepauk.         
	Being left out in the last two games, I was pumped up with this opportunity. I was waiting for it to happen. I have been working on a few things and todays performance has boosted my confidence, the Man of the Match said.

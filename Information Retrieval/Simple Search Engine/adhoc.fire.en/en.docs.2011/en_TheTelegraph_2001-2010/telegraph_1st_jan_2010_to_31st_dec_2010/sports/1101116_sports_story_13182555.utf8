	Calcutta: Australia named a 17-man squad on Monday for the first Ashes Test in Brisbane as selectors looked to keep their options open after injuries and poor form struck some of their key players.         
	Left-armed spinner Xavier Doherty was the biggest surprise in the party for the Gabba Test, the 29-year-old having made his one-day International debut against Sri Lanka just 12 days ago.         
	Uncapped batsmen Usman Khawaja and Callum Ferguson as well as leg-spinner Steve Smith  all set to face England for Australia A this week  were other inclusions who should keep the more experienced players focused.         
	Under-fire Michael Hussey and Marcus North hung onto their places.         
	National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said selectors would watch this weeks domestic and Australia A fixtures before trimming the party to 13.         
	THE SQUAD: Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Doug Bollinger, Xavier Doherty, Callum Ferguson, Ryan Harris, Nathan Hauritz, Mike Hussey, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Usman Khawaja, Marcus North, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin.

	New Delhi: Australian left-arm pacer Doug Bollinger will replace injured Jacob Oram, who was ruled out of the Indian Premier League III, in the Chennai Super Kings team.         
	Bollinger, who is presently playing for Australia in the second and final Test against New Zealand, will join the CSK on April 5.         
	Doug Bollinger to debut for CSK, replaces injured Jacob Oram who is out for the entire series, IPL chief executive Sundar Raman wrote on his Twitter page.         
	Bollingers inclusion will bolster Super Kings bowling department which is sorely missing a genuine strike bowler this season. (PTI)

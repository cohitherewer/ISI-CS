	Berlin: Holders Barcelona visit VfB Stuttgart on Tuesday in a Champions League last-16 tie which may have looked easy when the draw was made but has since taken on a completely different complexion.         
	When Stuttgart came out of the hat on Dec. 19 they were 15th in the Bundesliga, with two league wins, and only goal difference stood between them and the relegation playoff spot.         
	Since then the Germans have jumped to ninth in the table after seven wins in eight games under Christian Gross and they go into the first leg against Barca full of confidence. Stuttgart sounded another warning on Saturday when they won 5-1 at Cologne, helped by four goals from Brazilian-born striker Cacau who returned after a month out through injury.         
	Now we are looking forward to Barcelona. We need to focus our energy for that one then we can cause an upset, said Cacau, who played four matches for Germany last year and is still nurturing hopes of a World Cup call-up. Saturday was a first step.         
	Gross, who took over two days before their final group stage match against Unirea Urziceni which Stuttgart won 3-1, said: Were happy to be playing against one of the worlds best teams. Theres a lot of prestige at stake.         
	Gross has used Pavel Pogrebnyak and Ciprian Marica as his starting forwards. Marica was suspended for the Cologne game and now that Cacau is back and scoring, Gross may use him in the staring lineup.         
	Sami Khedira, another occasional Germany player, has recovered from a thigh injury and should take his place in the midfield, likely forcing Zdravko Kuzamnovic to return to the bench.         
	Meanwhile, defender Arthur Boka is out with a dislocated shoulder. Cristian Molinaro, the new arrival from Juventus, will probably take Bokas place on the left.         
	La Liga leaders Barcelona, 4-0 winners over Racing Santander on Saturday, have lost only one league match all season.         
	They topped Champions League Group F ahead of Inter Milan but managed only seven goals in six games which included two goalless draws.         
	Barca captain Carles Puyol acknowledged they would be facing a much-improved side. They are doing better, he said. They are a very dangerous team. If we do not keep our concentration we will find ourselves in trouble.         
	The Catalans have included Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Daniel Alves and Xavi in their squad but Barca did not say whether the trio would be fit to play.         
	Ibrahimovic was replaced by Thierry Henry, who scored only his third goal of the season, against Racing.         
	His ankle was swollen up, but the doctors reckon it will go down soon, Guardiola said. Well see how he gets on and see if we can get him fit for Tuesday. I hope his goal will give him a lift, Guardiola said. The team needs much more of him and I expect more from him.         
	Aleksandr Hleb, the Barcelona midfielder who is now on loan to Stuttgart, was anything but happy to face his former teammates.         
	Honestly, its the only team I didnt want to play against. Its the best team in the world, Hleb said.         
	Meanwhile, Olympiakos Piraeus winger Jaouad Zairi has told Girondins Bordeaux to expect a red-hot reception from the crowd in Tuesdays other last-16 match.         
	However the Greeks are up against one of the Champions Leagues form teams.         
	Laurent Blancs swashbuckling side are top of Ligue 1 and dropped just two points in the group stages of Europes elite club competition, conceding only two goals.         
	Zairi, who has been injured recently and is likely to be on the bench on Tuesday, said his team mates were fully aware of the task ahead.         
	The atmosphere in the Karaiskakis Stadium is boiling hot. Our supporters are fanatics and are literally our 12th player. We have already beaten Arsenal at home this season and we will give everything to win on Tuesday, he said.

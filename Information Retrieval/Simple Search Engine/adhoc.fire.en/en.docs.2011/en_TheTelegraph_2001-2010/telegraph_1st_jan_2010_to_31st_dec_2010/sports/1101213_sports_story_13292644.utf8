	Calcutta: Former Asian under-8 girls champion Khushi Dharewa of Ashok Hall held 10th seed NR Visakh to a draw in the third round of 22nd The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chyawanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club, at the Gorky Sadan, here on Sunday.         
	Nine-year-old Khushi, in fact, was winning as she had an extra pawn in a Bishop versus Knight ending but she failed to convert her material superiority into a win and the game petered out into a draw.         
	In other upsets of sorts, Sumit Kumar of Holy Uttarpara Childrens Own Home was held to a draw by Aditya Chowdhury of St Joans School. Debankan Dhara of Vivekananda Mission School, surprisingly, was content to split the point and agreed to a draw against his unrated opponent Abhiroop Dasgupta in just 17 moves.         
	Top seed and defending champion Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School won both his games with ease as he beat Bidisha Roy of Carmel Junior College in the second round and later got the better of his schoolmate Sraman Bhowmick in a Pirc Defence.         
	Second seed, Prince Bajaj of DPS, Ghaziabad, effortlessly won his second round game against Bikranta Ghosh of MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth in a Pannov-Botwinnik Attack.         
	In the afternoon round, Bajaj scored a facile win with a beautiful combination against Trinath Ghosh of M.C. Kejriwal Vidyapeeth in a Ruy Lopez.         
	National U-13 champion Diptayan Ghosh showed his class as he outclassed Tamal Naskar of Marias Day School with characteristic ease as he utilised his space advantage to bag the full point.         
	Earlier he had got the better of Bipasha Patra in the second round.         
	The underprivileged students of Future Hope School had a lot to cheer on the day as 7 of their 10 players registered victories on Sunday.         
	The youngest participant Hrishiraj Chowdhury of Mongrace Montessori opened his account as he won in the morning.

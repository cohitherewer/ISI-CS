The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boucher achieves a unique double
                                                                                                                       7                                      Boucher achieves a unique double
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mark Boucher became the first wicketkeeper in the history of the game to record 500 Test dismissals during the fourth days play against the West Indies at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.         
	He also achieved the unique double of 500 dismissals (479 catches and 21 stumpings) and 5,000 runs in Tests. There is no other current player remotely in a position to achieve the same.         
	An edge from Ravi Rampaul off Morne Morkel was snapped up by Boucher to mark the historic moment.         
	Earlier in this Test, there had also been important career moments for Graeme Smith (7,000 runs) and AB de Villiers (4,000 runs). Jacques Kallis also reached 11,000 Test runs during the second day of this Test.         
	Boucher had been excluded from the initial few games on this tour, with AB de Villiers preferred as the wicketkeeper-batsman and the milestone came as a welcome relief.         
	I have kept wicket to some fantastic bowlers and also on wickets that at times have been friendly to bowlers, Boucher said in a Cricket South Africa release. It has been a hard month for me, he added in a reference to his omission from most of the limited-overs tour matches, and it is nice for me to have something to smile about.

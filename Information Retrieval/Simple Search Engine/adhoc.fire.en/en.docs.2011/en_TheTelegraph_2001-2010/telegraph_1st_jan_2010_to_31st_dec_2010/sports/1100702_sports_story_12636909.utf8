The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ghana on threshold of history 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ghana on threshold of history 
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: On Friday night, when Ghana take on Uruguay in their first-ever World Cup quarter final appearance at the gigantic Soccer City Stadium, the hope of Africa will rest on Milovan Rajevacs closely knit side.         
	Ghanas Black Stars have been Africas only shining lights in the ongoing World Cup with all five other teams bowing out in the first round.         
	Ghana became only the third African side in history to reach the World Cup quarter finals when they defeated the US 2-1 thanks to Asamoah Gyans sweetly struck shot early in the extra time.         
	Surely, the onus is now on Ghana to represent the continent in the first ever African World Cup. Ghana have already been dubbed as BaGhana BaGhana by the locals here and support has grown in leaps and bounds for the team.         
	So much so, that the Ghana defender John Paintsil has openly urged the local fans to raise the sound of vuvuzelas when they throng the stands on Friday. The support has been massive so far and we can feel how much Africa is behind us. On Friday, I want the fans to come in huge numbers with their vuvuzelas and make a lot of noise for us. We have to play with our heart out plus a great deal of determination, he said.         
	Ghanas minister for youth and sports Akua Sena Dansua is already in Johannesburg and said the team would meet former South African president Nelson Mandela after the match.         
	But despite all the hype, Uruguay, riding high on the back of their striking duo  Diego Forlan and Luis Suarez  will start firm favourites. All of Ghanas goals have come because of Asamoah Gyan and Kevin-Prince Boateng but both are going into the big match carrying injuries. To make it worse, Andrew Ayew, son of all time great Abidi Pele and Man of the Match against the US, is suspended and likely to be replaced by Inter Milans Suley Muntari, who has a prickly relationship with Rajevac.         
	The coach, however, remained cool on the eve of the match. We are not thinking about the pressure, the Serbian said at the Soccer City on Thursday. We played very well at the African Nations Cup, so we have already proved that we are a team that knows how to compete. We will try to relax. You know it is good for us to be here. We are very happy with the whole situation, he said.         
	We have no obligation but still we want to use this opportunity to do our best and to make history, Rajevac commented.         
	Rajevac is one of the most well known coaches in Africa having enjoyed managerial career at teams such as FK Vojvodina and Borac Cacak. He also took charge of Red Star Brigade in 2004 but steering Ghana to the World Cup last eight is his greatest achievement.         
	Uruguay will rely on the striking combination of Forlan and Suarez. They are hoping against hope that the Ghanaians will be unsettled by the speed of the striking duo and may struggle to get through a tightly knit midfield set up.         
	Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez knows that a semi-final spot is within his teams grasp for the first time in 40 years but has managed to remain humble so far.         
	Before we began this World Cup, we saw this great harmony among the players and I said to them that the people back home have aspirations, they have dreams and we have to deliver them. We all have objectives, both professional and personal, and our objective is to go as far as we can in this tournament, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dengue claims Tollygunge player
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dengue claims Tollygunge player
  - Asheshs reluctance to proper treatment proved costly, says club coach       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Ashesh Das, a promising footballer, died of dengue late on Wednesday.         
	Ashesh, who used to ply his trade for Calcutta Football League Premier Division club Tollygunge Agragami, was suffering from fever for the last seven days and it was his reluctance to proper treatment, which claimed his life, said Tollygunge coach Ranjan Chowdhury.         
	Dengue, in fact, has become quite a concern for the citys football fraternity. East Bengal midfielder Alvito DCunha was hospitalised with high fever on Tuesday. While medical reports were yet to be made official, Alvito told The Telegraph that he was suffering from dengue. And on Thursday, Robin Singh, East Bengals new recruit, too, was admitted to a city hospital with complaints of high fever.         
	Ranjan, on Thursday, rued that had Ashesh paid heed to his repeated pleas of undergoing proper medication things would have been different. I kept asking him to get his blood tests done and not ignore the matter. He said that he had consulted a doctor and, in fact, insisted that he was better However, now I get to know that he had thought it was viral fever and didnt get the specific blood tests done, Ranjan said.         
	Ashesh, a resident of Maslandapur in North 24 Parganas, was running high fever and was first admitted to the Habra State General Hospital. Later, he was shifted to a private hospital in Barasat where he passed away.         
	According to Ranjan, the 25-year old was a talented right-winger and a regular at Tollygunge Agragami for the last three years.         
	Two of his friends, who also play for us, first informed me a few days back that he wouldnt be able to practice since he had fever. I called him up that day and asked him to consult a doctor and not neglect the case. Then on Monday he came to practice and wanted to join his teammates. But I didnt allow him to train.         
	Later, when I asked him why he had come inspite of being unwell, he said that he was keen to play the first match (against George Telegraph) of the season, which was on Wednesday. While I was moved by his eagerness to play, I advised him to get well first and that he wouldnt have to worry about his place in the team since he was a regular in the side, Ranjan recollected.         
	Im terribly upset with the incident He was not only a good player, but also a lively guy, the coach said.         
	While Ranjan has cancelled practice for the next two days, the club has requested the Indian Football Association to postpone their next CFL match (against Aryan, on Sunday) for some days since the players are too shocked to play.         
	But one possibly cannot just blame ignorance on Asheshs part for the mishap. As pointed out by Ranjan, and rightly so, poverty could also be the reason in Asheshs reluctance to go to a doctor. While Ashesh was the only child of his parents, his father is a small-time daily labourer.         
	But I had promised him that he wouldnt have to worry about the financial needs and that the club would bear the cost if needed, rued Ranjan.         
	If only Ashesh had paid heed to his coachs advice, off the field as well

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DAY III HIGHLIGHTS
                                                                                                                       7                                      DAY III HIGHLIGHTS
                      
	Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay notched up a third century stand for the first wicket in their four innings together. The duo now aggregate 600 runs in four innings with an average of 150.00.         
	Sehwag missed out on his fourth consecutive Test hundred. It may be recalled that the opener had scored 109 and 165 vs South Africa in February this year and followed that up with 109 vs Sri Lanka at Galles.         
	Sehwag is only the second player to be dismissed on 99 in a Test match on Lankan soil. The only other player to have been similarly checked was Mahela Jayawardene, way back in 2001-02, at Galle against the West Indies. While Sehwag was stumped, Jayawardene was run out!         
	Sehwags dismissal on Wednesday was the eighth instance of an Indian being sent back on 99 while the opener himself became the seventh Indian player to miss out on a century by a run. Sourav Ganguly has the dubious distinction of doing so twice.         
	Sehwag became the only third player in Test history to be dismissed stumped on 99. The other two being Pakistans Maqsood Ahmed in Lahore (1954-55) and New Zealands John Wright in Christchurch (1991-92).         
	It was only the second time in Test history that a bowlers first Test wicket was a batsman who he dismissed on 99. The only other instance is Bob Woolmers dismissal on 99 of Australian Ross Edwards for his first Test wicket, at Lords in 1975.         
	Suresh Raina became the 22nd Indian to score a 50 on debut. Interestingly, the last left-hander to score a 50 on debut was Sourav who made 131 vs England at Lords in 1996         
	Sachin Tendulkars 100 was his         
	 94th international hundred         
	 75th first-class hundred         
	 48th Test hundred         
	 42nd at No.4         
	 36th in the first innings         
	 27th away from home         
	 Ninth vs Sri Lanka         
	 Fifth in 2010         
	 Fifth in Sri Lanka         
	 Fourth at the Sinhalese Sports Club

                                                                                                                       7                                        A silver lining from the track and field 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Prajusha Maliakkal                           
	New Delhi: With a rich haul of 15 medals, including five gold, hosts India pipped England to win back the second spot on Sunday. While Indias medal tally at the end of the day read 29-22-22, Englands read 26-45-33.         
	In athletics, Vikas Gowda won silver for India in the mens discus throw by hurling the disc as far as 63.69 metres. The Mysore-born Gowda had the 40,000 odd crowd at Jawahar Lal Nehru stadium on their feet, thanks to a stiff contest with Australias Benn Harradine, who settled for silver. And shortly after bagging the silver, Gowda lashed out at the authorities for refusing a pass to his father-cum-personal coach Shive Gowda.         
	Though Gowda said he was satisfied and happy with his performance, he sounded very unhappy about the authorities attitude. He (Shive Gowda) had to buy a ticket, Gowda said in disbelief. In the womens long jump, MA Prajusha narrowly missed a track and field gold, and had to settle with a silver due to a calf muscle problem.         
	 In boxing, Vijender Singh (75kg) took just over a minute to pull off an intimidating knock-out win and assure himself of a second successive Commonwealth Games medal.         
	But it was curtains for defending champion Akhil Kumar who was beaten by Olympic bronze-medallist Bruno Julie in the boxing quarter-finals.         
	Asian silver-medallist Jai Bhagwan (60kg), Asian bronze-medallist Manoj Kumar (64kg) and nine-time national champion Dilbag Singh (69kg) were the other three boxers who assured India of medals at the event.         
	In badminton, top seed Saina Nehwal thrashed Sarah Thomas of Wales 21-5, 21-9, while Chetan Anand beat Nigerian Ola Fagbemi 21-12, 21-6 in 21 minutes. Debutants P Kashyap and Aditi Mutatkar also stormed into the third round in the singles event with straight-game victories in their second round match.         
	Mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju entered next round with a 21-13, 21-8 spanking Jamaican Henry Gareth Andre Theodore and Kristal Karjohn Fayonne.

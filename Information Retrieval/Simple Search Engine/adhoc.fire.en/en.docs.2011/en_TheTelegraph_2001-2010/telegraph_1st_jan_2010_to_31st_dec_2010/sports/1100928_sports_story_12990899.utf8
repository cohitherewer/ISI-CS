The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players arent children: Butt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Players arent children: Butt
                      
	Karachi: PCB chief Ijaz Butt Monday defended its decision not to suspend the three Pakistani cricketers for their alleged involvement in spot-fixing, saying that such a move would have sent a wrong message.         
	We didnt take action against them and let the ICC follow its course of action. We didnt want to send out a message to the world that we believed our players were tainted. The world would have believed that the trio was indeed guilty of spot-fixing, Butt said.         
	The players are not children and should know what their responsibilities are. They are properly briefed about everything. It is their choice on who they appoint as agents. We manage a national team of players not schoolboys, he said.         
	He also rubbished speculations that the PCB was on a warpath with the ICC and other cricket boards.         
	Meanwhile, Butt will arrive in London Tuesday to consult his legal advisers about replying to English demands that he apologise over allegations about match-fixing. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Low interest affects ticket sales
                                                                                                                       7                                      Low interest affects ticket sales
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Put it down to Indias shoddy performance in Nagpur or to the scheduling of a major part of the second India vs South Africa Test at the beginning of a week, the ticket sales for the Eden match (on the first of the two days for the affiliated units to buy their quota of tickets) on Monday was pathetic to say the least.         
	Most of the affiliated units didnt show much interest in picking up their quota of tickets with only 325 season tickets being sold on the day.         
	Among the 325 tickets sold, 128 of Rs 1500 denomination and 197 tickets valued at Rs 750 each were bought by the various affiliated units on the day.         
	The sales figure is approximately Rs 3.4 lakh at close of sales on the first day. Tuesday is the last day for affiliated units to buy their quota of tickets after which we will put up season tickets for sale to the public.         
	Whatever remains will be for daily sales, treasurer Subir Ganguly said.         
	Due to reduced capacity, the first division and second division clubs are allotted 60 and 40 priced tickets respectively. It is unlikely that ticket sale figures will massively improve if India capitulate in the next two days.         
	Obviously, Indias performance will be an indicator for the ticket sales. Also, nowadays no one likes to buy season tickets.         
	After Sunday, the next four days are working days. The exams are also nearing, so it may not increase massively.         
	However once the teams are in the city, it might improve marginally, a senior office-bearer told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	Another matter that the CAB officials are discussing in hushed tones is the IPL being just a month away. During the IPL, you will pay the same money and will get three hours of instant entertainment. Shah Rukh Khan will be here.         
	So the way the public sees it is that why pay for a Test match is when I can watch seven IPL matches for the same amount of money? said another official.         
	A small piece of statistic will help us understand how the senior CAB officials have bought their clubs quota of tickets.         
	Former BCCI joint secretary and Shambazar Club supremo Gautam Dasgupta is likely to buy only 20 tickets (from his quota of 60) while CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey (Central Calcutta Sporting Club) will buy just 50 per cent of his quota of tickets.         
	Big clubs like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are likely to buy some tickets on Tuesday.         
	On Monday, ACP (headquarters) Anjan Ganguly inspected the security arrangements.

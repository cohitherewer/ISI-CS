  - Jayanta sen rsquo;s late equaliser gives hosts a point
            A STAFF REPORTER            Tushin Mashangva of Delhi goes for a header as Bengals Arnab Mondal (left) looks on, during their Santosh Trophy match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Bengal cant even beat Delhi! And you were thinking this time the Santosh Trophy would be yours simply because every time Bengal hosted the National Football Championship they won it!         
	The sorry state of Calcutta football came to the fore, once again, and, this time, it was done by some unknowns of Delhi. Trailing 0-1 till the 88th minute, Bengal needed a Jayanta Sen strike to salvage a point in a quarter final group B match at the Salt Lake Stadium, on a rain-sodden Friday afternoon.         
	They looked bad and disjointed throughout and Delhi must be ruing that sudden loss of concentration at the fag end of the match. Three points were almost in their kitty.         
	Delhi had a very simple plan on the day. Soak in the pressure and then catch the rival off-guard on the break. And with Subhas Chakraborty on the wide right looking pathetic and Sneshashis Chakraborty, once again proving he is the most one dimensional player around, Bengal frontliners looked lost in the opponent half.         
	The frontline duo of Tarif Ahmed and tall and well-built Robin Singh gave an impression as if they were meeting for the first time. There was no co-ordination or understanding between them. If Robin was moving on the left thinking Tarif would play the ball there, Tarif invariably would pass it on the right.         
	Robin did not score but his movements on the pitch showed that he has a different soccer grooming. The TFA blue did make a couple of attempts and both had ample amount of flamboyance and swagger. A left-footed long ranger without hardly any back lift, and then whipping one in, from the left, which almost got Bengal the equaliser.         
	However, once excitement got the better of him, when a regulation flick would have done the job, he tried to round off the goalkeeper and was easily thwarted by Delhis Pranoy Roy.         
	Delhi got their goal with a lot of help from Bengals back-four. When Vikash Rawat floated in a cross from the right, there was not a single player to mark Tushin Mashangva whose header crashed into the net giving Sandip Nandy hardly a chance to move.         
	The equaliser came two minutes from full time. Jayanta Sen got a loose ball six yard outside the penalty box, and before Delhi players could close on him, his low right-footer hit the back of the net.         
	A good goal on a not so great afternoon for Bengal.         
	TEAMS         
	Bengal: Sandip Nandy, Rajib Ghosh, Sk Azim (Safar Sardar 66), Arnab Mondal, R Dhanarajan, Subhas Chakraborty (Gauranga Datta 46), Jayanta Sen, Denson Devadas, Snehashis Chakraborty, Robin Singh, Tarif Ahmed (Shankar Oraon 59).         
	Delhi: Pronoy Roy, Bijendra Bhardwaj, Yogesh Prasad, Bhuvan Joshi, Monu Choudhury (David Nghaite 71), Ashish Pandey, Vikash Rawat, Mohender Singh, Pushpender Kundu, Golmei Akhonmei, Tushin Mashangva.         
	Referee: Andrew Shekhar.         
	In the evening match of the Group B, Tamil Nadu started their campaign on a winning note scoring a 2-0 victory over Mizoram.         
	CS Sabeeth opened the account for Tamil Nadu after the change of ends, after a pale first session, while R Rajesh scored the second.

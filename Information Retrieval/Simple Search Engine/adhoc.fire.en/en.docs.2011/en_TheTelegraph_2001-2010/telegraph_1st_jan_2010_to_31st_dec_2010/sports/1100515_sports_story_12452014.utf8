	Gros Islet: Captain Alex Blackwell led from the front with a swashbuckling 61 as the Australian womens team Thursday crushed India by seven wickets to storm into the final of the Womens World Twenty20.         
	Pursuing a modest 119 for five, Australia got 123 for three to maintain their winning streak in the tournament.         
	The 27-year-old Australian skipper struck eight lusty boundaries as she raced to her maiden T20I half-century and shared 74 runs for the second wicket with opener Shelley Nitschke (22).         
	All Jhulan Goswami and Co. could do when Blackwell and Nitschke were in charge was watch helplessly as the runs came in torrents. That mayhem lasted 60 balls and it took leg-spinner Priyanka Roy to silence both the batters but the damage had been done.         
	Priyanka first dismissed the left-handed Shelley who holed out to Rumeli Dhar. Blackwell was stumped by Sulakshana Naik but those two wickets were not going to halt the Aussies.         
	Out came Leah Poulton (30 ..) and along with Jessica Cameron (6 ..) drove the last nail in Indias coffin as Australia romped home with seven balls to spare.         
	Earlier, the Indian innings was bolstered by a gutsy 57-run third-wicket partnership between Poonam Raut (44) and Harmanpreet Kaur (24).         
	The duo relied on picking up the ones and twos in between occasional boundaries to anchor the innings after India lost two early wickets           (PTI)

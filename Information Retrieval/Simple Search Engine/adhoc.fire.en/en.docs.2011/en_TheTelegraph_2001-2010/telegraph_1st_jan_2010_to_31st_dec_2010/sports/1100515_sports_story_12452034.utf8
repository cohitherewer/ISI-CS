The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Commitment not a worry for Kirsten 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Commitment not a worry for Kirsten 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                           
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Contrary to reports doing the rounds, Team India coach Gary Kirsten didnt question the players commitment after yet another early exit from an ICC event.         
	On Tuesday, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men bowed out, in the Super Eights stage of the World Twenty20.         
	At no point in the past 26 months has Gary doubted the commitment of any player... He has worked hard to create an environment where every single player is expected to perform at a 100 per cent and he believes theyve been doing just that, a Kirsten confidant, who requested anonymity, told The Telegraph.         
	The confidant, speaking on Friday evening, added: Its not to say that Gary hasnt been disappointed. Hes very disappointed and is aware of the sentiments of a cricket-crazy India... However, Garys looking ahead and, so, are the players.         
	According to the confidant, the fitness issue came up during Kirstens meeting with the players  individually and collectively  but it wasnt the first time that such a discussion took place.         
	In fact, fitness was only one of the aspects talked about (on Wednesday morning)... The players themselves agreed that it was a critical area and all needed to be supremely fit...         
	Gary probably focused on fitness as most of the players have a month off (till the Asia Cup) and he wanted them to use this time wisely... There was no finger-pointing as has been made out and nobody got a dressing down, the confidant maintained.         
	The confidant pointed out that Kirsten wanted the players to build a fitness base which will help them be in shape till the 2011 World Cup, the next major tournament once the World Twenty20 gets over.         
	Kirsten, highly respected by his wards, was himself not available for comment.

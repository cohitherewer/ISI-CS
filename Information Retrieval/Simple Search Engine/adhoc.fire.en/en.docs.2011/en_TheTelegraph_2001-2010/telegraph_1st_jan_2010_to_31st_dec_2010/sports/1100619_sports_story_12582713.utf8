The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im deeply upset, says Evra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Im deeply upset, says Evra
                      
	Polokwane: France defender Patrice Evra gave a damning verdict on his team after its 2-0 World Cup defeat to Mexico, saying he feels like France have become a small football nation, and it hurts.         
	Thursdays defeat, as reported in Fridays Late City edition, left France with only one point from two games in Group A, and on the brink of elimination from the World Cup ahead of next weeks final group matches, because both Mexico and Uruguay have four points each and require only a draw on Tuesday to progress.         
	I am deeply upset, even if it wont change anything, Evra said. Tonight I feel a bit like (we are) a small football nation, and it hurts.         
	France were eliminated from the European Championship two years ago at the group stage without winning a match, and Evra fears the team is still just as bad now.         
	When you go out of the Euro in the first round, and then you are about to go out again, you really dont want to think about football anymore, Evra said.         
	There is nothing to say except that it is a huge catastrophe tonight. I honestly didnt see it coming, Evra said. What hurts is that we didnt know how to react, or how to equalize, and then they killed us with that second goal.         
	 Evra refused to protect his players and said harsh words may be exchanged in the next few days.         
	Whats the problem? Were not a good team. If we dont win, it means were not a good team, he said. We will speak to each other during the week. Im not going to start telling you (the press) what the problem is, Ill tell those concerned.         
	Im disgusted, and we owe it to ourselves to beat South Africa, he said. But as for miracles, I dont believe in them too much.         
	We couldnt pass the ball properly, they closed us down straight away, midfielder Yoann Gourcuff said. We felt that Mexico were starting to get on top of us in the second half.         
	Im very, very disappointed. It has been a collective failure over the two games. Football is hard when you cant play together, Gourcuff said. Perhaps I have paid the price, I dont know. Ive not had any explanations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time to move on: Mahela
                                                                                                                       7                                      Time to move on: Mahela
                      
	Dambulla: Former captain Mahela Jayawardene Friday said the no ball incident, which had threatened to snowball into a major controversy, was not the worst thing his side had faced and advised the players to move on and focus on their next tri-series match on Sunday.         
	What happened was unfortunate... We take total responsibility as a team and I think it is time we move on. There were worse things that have happened in the past (than the no-ball controversy) and people have moved on from those things, he said at the press conference after their match against New Zealand was abandoned.         
	Definitely, we are looking forward to the game against India which will be a very good game, he said.         
	Jayawardene remained not out on 59 in Sri Lankas 203 for three in 43.4 overs before rain stopped play. Sri Lanka and New Zealand got two points each from the abandoned tie.         
	Asked about the weather conditions here after rain played spoilsport for the second consecutive day, he said: We cant control these things Just have to concentrate on the game against India.         
	We have been playing some good cricket. Just do that... Rather than worrying about things we cannot control.         
	Jayawardene said he was happy with his performance after failing to contribute much to the teams cause in the earlier two matches.         
	I was disappointed (by my performance) in the last two games. And I got that (bad) decision against India. Some decisions go your way, some do not. You have to take it, he said.         
	Jayawardene said his side could have scored a big total had rain not intervened Friday.           (PTI)

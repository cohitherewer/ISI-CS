            OUR CORRESPONDENT            England captain Charlotte Edwards with the trophy, in Mumbai, on Monday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Lack of firepower in batting and big match inexperience cost Indian women dear as they went down to England by five wickets in the third and final T20 International at the MCA ground here on Monday.         
	There was a sense of dj vu as India put up 125 for 4 on the board after being sent in, the same total that England had overhauled in the first game last week at the same venue.         
	And while Charlotte Edwards team might have messed up the chase in the second match, where again the target was a modest 127, this time they made sure there were no such hiccups.         
	On Sunday, Edwards led the chase from the front with a short and sweet 17 that was peppered with four boundaries to help her team to a smooth get-away.         
	Laura Marsh then anchored the innings with a steady 46 while Beth Morgan (28) and Jenny Gunn (22) combined with her to see the team home with four balls to spare and clinch the series 2-1.         
	The Indian spinners, who had been dominant in the series, seemed to have an off day as, except Gouher Sultana (3/26), none of them proved to be penetrative.         
	Earlier, Poonam Raut provided the hosts a bright start with a sparkling 26, and although Mithali Raj (22), Harmanpreet Kaur (30) and Anjum Chopra (22) got into groove, none of them could break the shackles placed around them by England.         
	We were short of runs, we seemed to be stuck with 125. Our batting was slow when compared to the first two games. We should have picked up the pace after 15 overs but Englands bowling and fielding were excellent, said Raj, leading the side in place of Jhulan Goswami who had an ankle injury in the first game.         
	Batting has been a worry in the recent one-day series as well, especially the form of the seasoned Anjum Chopra who batted much below her regular slot at the top on Sunday.         
	Anjum was not getting runs and was getting out to the same bowler. So we decided to play her down the order, Raj said.

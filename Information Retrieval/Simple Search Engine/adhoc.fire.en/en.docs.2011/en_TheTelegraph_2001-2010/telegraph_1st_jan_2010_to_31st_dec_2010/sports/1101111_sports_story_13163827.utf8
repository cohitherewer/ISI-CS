  - RANJI TIE vs MUMBAI 
  -  Tiwary strikes after Rahane century; Jaffer hits 73         A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary celebrates with teammates after taking one of his two wickets, on Wednesday.   A Telegraph picture                                       
	Calcutta: Two late strikes by Manoj Tiwary put Bengal in command after Ajinkya Rahane (110) and Wasim Jaffer (73) threatened to run away with Day One honours in the Mumbai-Bengal Ranji clash here on Wednesday.         
	In a topsy-turvy first days play, Bengal paid the price of dropping Rahane, but bounced back through skipper Tiwary, who accounted for the wickets of the two dangermen.         
	At stumps on Wednesday, Mumbai were 287 for 4. Rohit Sharma (37 batting) and Abhishek Nayar (13 batting) will take guard for the visitors on Thursday.         
	Rahane and Wasim Jaffer have always been the bedrock of Mumbais batting. So, it wasnt exactly a throwback when the two combined to orchestrate a Mumbai attack on Wednesday. The duo added 152 runs runs for the third wicket, and Rahane slammed his 15th first class hundred. But just when it seemed the two veterans were on the verge of posting another colossal total, Tiwary struck in consecutive overs after tea. Rohan Banerjee dived full stretch to nab Rahane, while keeper Wriddhiman Saha grabbed Jaffers nick with a glee.         
	The Bengal skipper was unlucky at the toss, but lady luck soon smiled when Mumbai opener Sushant Marathe was run out in the 10th over. Marathe tapped Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who was bowling his second over, for a single but slipped mid-way. Rohan Banerjee swooped on the ball and clipped the bails straightaway.         
	Though the visitors began rather shakily, Bengal didnt help their cause with an equally insipid bowling display.         
	Both Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda failed to get any movement off the deck or in the air. Omkar Gurav played himself in gallantly trying to wear the shine off the new ball with Rahane. Dinda chugged in tirelessly and failed to create an alarm, barring an edge off Rahane.         
	Mumbai had just sailed to 35 when Rahane (on 12) sliced at Dinda. The ball flew to debutant Ritam Porel, who failed to latch on to it at gully.         
	Mumbai were uncharacteristically slow to score their runs having managed just 38 in the first 16 overs. But, given Mumbais legacy to out-bat their opponents, the ploy to settle down against the hosts seemed appropriate.         
	A change of ends, however, gave Dinda hope when he angled the ball in to Rahane in the 23rd over. After an hour of unproductive trundle, the slip squadron suddenly came to life with a sharp leg before appeal. The only occasion after Dindas effort when the hosts came close to dismissing Rahane was in the 38th over. Gurav had flicked Shib Sagar Singh and pushed for a double. Rahane, who was running towards the danger end, had to make a diving attempt to make his ground.         
	Gurav dead-batted the Bengal seamers and grew in confidence even though Dinda hurled a few bouncers at him.         
	But it was off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri who did the trick, finally, for the hosts. Gurav, who was looking solid, pushed at one from the offie that went straight. Arindam Das, fielding at first slip, took an easy offering.         
	Rahane rocked back to unfurl some of his trademark shots through cover. Known for his ground strokes, the Mumbai batsman hit some crisp drives off Bose and Dinda. Shukla, who often banged it short, also took a hitting for his wayward bowling.         
	The Mumbai batsman brought his 50 up after lunch, and, at the stroke of tea, pulled Dinda for four to get to his 100.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For Dhoni, its a break from the same rooms
                                                                                                                       7                                        For Dhoni, its a break from the same rooms
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Rahul Dravid, in Nagpur, on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, made an unusual admission on Tuesday afternoon: That hed been mentally tired before the three-Test series against New Zealand, which ended in a 1-0 win for us.         
	Dhoni went candid during the post-victory media conference in neighbouring Jamtha.         
	In fact, Dhoni was frank on other issues as well. For example, he said the out-of-form Suresh Raina needed a rest and that his team had played to only 60 per cent of its potential in the first two Tests.         
	Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Dhoni (who now has a success percentage of 61.90 in Tests) elaborated: One sign of mental tiredness is making a mistake when a decision has to be made in that split-second... Actually, its a sure sign that all is not well...         
	Its not a disease, but the only way to recover is by taking a complete break from the game... Like some of the others, Ive been playing non-stop since the Asia Cup in June... Its a relief that Ive been given a rest and wont be there in the ODIs against New Zealand.         
	Dhoni added: A break is essential, because all dressing rooms end up looking the same, as do the hotel rooms... Most of the faces, too, turn out to be the same... There comes a time when the mind has to focus on other things... Family, friends, outings... Even commercial shoots.         
	As December 6 is (as of now) the departure date for the advance party heading to South Africa, Dhoni can rest till then. Most of his time will perhaps be spent in Ranchi, with a trip to Delhi/Mumbai.         
	For obvious reasons, the players need to be at a 100 per cent, mentally and physically, when they land in South Africa.         
	As Daniel Vettori, the New Zealand captain, put it: India are No.1 for a reason and South Africa is probably the final frontier for them.         
	Dhoni grinned when asked if beating Vettori, who is highly rated for his leadership skills, made the win over New Zealand that much sweeter.         
	Look, you dont defeat captains, but teams... Also, a captain is only as good as his men... The way I see it, India beat New Zealand... Ive never gone into a series thinking that, on a personal level, Ive got to get the better of X. All captains are good, its about how things work out.         
	What about soaring expectations?         
	I accept that, with every victory, expectations are going to grow... Its inevitable and fans are entitled to wish for more... As a pro, that has to be accepted and the reality is that were No.1 in Test cricket, Dhoni replied.         
	Listing the biggest plus from the series, Dhoni said: At the top would be Rahul Dravids batting... Its not only about his two hundreds (104, 191) in three Tests, but the manner in which he batted throughout... Hes such a critical player in such a critical position (No.3).         
	Dravid, too, is getting a break  after all, hes not in the scheme of things for ODIs.

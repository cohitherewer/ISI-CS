                                                                                                                       7                                                                                                        
	Johannesburg: South Africas Pakistan-born uncapped leg spinner Imran Tahir has been withdrawn from the Test squad against England because of eligibility issues. The Lahore-born 30-year-old spinner was picked in the South African squad for the fourth and final Test against England which gets underway at the Wanderers here on Thursday.    
	But a requirement of Cricket South Africa (CSA) is that only South African passport holders can be selected for the national team and Tahir doesnt have one. Chief selectors Mike Procter said that he accepted full responsibility for the fiasco which had clearly upset CSA chief executive Gerald Majola. I was very irate when I found Tahirs name on the 15-member players list and conveyed this to Mike as well, Majola told a daily.        
	Karachi: Former Pakistan batsman Qasim Umar has held chief coach Intikhab Alam and his support staff responsible for the national teams continuing poor show and said the struggling Mohammed Yousuf-led side presently require a motivating figure to guide them.    
	He is not the right person to be the coach of the national team. I remember when I played under him. When he was manager and coach, he always used to run me down and call my selection a waste of money, Umar said.        
	 New Delhi: Former India pacer Manoj Prabhakar believes that India have achieved the numero uno status in ICC Test rankings mainly because of their batting consistency and now the bowlers also have to prove their mettle to ensure the country doesnt get toppled from the pinnacle.        
	Dibrugarh: Hyderabad made 274 for four against hosts Assam on the first day of their plate group match of the Cooch Behar (U-19) Trophy that got underway in Tinsukia.    
	Brief Scores: Hyderabad 274/4 in 90 overs (R.Kaundinya 101n.o.). Assam. Match to continue       
	India joint 3rd  
	Bursa (Turkey): Krishnan Sasikiran beat Levon Aronian, but India slipped down to joint third after they drew with Armenia in fifth round of the world team chess championship.  
	P. Harikrishna lost a wild game against Vladimir Akopian on the second board. On the third board, Surya Shekhar Ganguly played out a draw with Gabriel Sargissian.    
	India and Armenia now share the third spot with seven match points each.        
	New Delhi: MotoGP world champion biker Valentino Rossi wants to strut his stuff in India too if the country hosts a Grand Prix in future. Racing in a Grand Prix in India, well I hope to, if there is one in India, Rossi said.

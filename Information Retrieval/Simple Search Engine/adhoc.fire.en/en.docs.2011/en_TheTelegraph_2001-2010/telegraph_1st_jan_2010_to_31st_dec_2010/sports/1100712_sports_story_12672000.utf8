The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar: FTP needs a revamp
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar: FTP needs a revamp
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has urged cricket bosses to prepare a balanced international calendar that gives equal opportunities to all teams and bring the fans back to the stadium for Tests and ODIs.         
	Sangakkara said global viewership of the sport had dwindled over the past year, despite a packed schedule of Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 cricket.         
	I am told about 40 percent of viewership has dropped for Tests, Sangakkara said in an interview. It has dropped for one-dayers and T20 too.         
	According to Sangakkara, the rise of Twenty20 cricket has made the one- and five-day games look like the boring siblings of the cricket family.         
	Sangakkara, 32, welcomed suggestions for making Test cricket interesting through night games or a world championship, which could attract viewers and sponsors.         
	We cant just ignore the consumers, he said. Ultimately its sponsorship that generates revenue for the boards.         
	The articulate Sri Lankan skipper called for more Test matches to be fairly distributed in the Future Tours Programme (FTP) that is being prepared by the International Cricket Council to govern cricket from 2012.         
	He lamented the lack of Test matches for his own team, which would have played just two matches against the West Indies this year had India not agreed to a hastily arranged three-Test series against Sri Lanka starting Sunday.         
	All sides should have an equal opportunity to play Tests, Sangakkara said. We are lucky India are touring us, but the opportunity for Sri Lankan players to fulfil their Test dreams are getting more and more limited.

	Mumbai/Margao: Both Mahindra United and Mumbai FC will be gunning for victory when clash in the I-League encounter at the Cooperage, on Wednesday. But contrasting motivations will be at work.         
	Mahindra, who are top of the table with 36 points after a somewhat surprisingly comprehensive win over nearest contender Dempo last week, would be keen to tighten their grip on the title by securing full points.         
	Three points is what Mumbai FC also will be aiming at, but with 20 points in the kitty and placed second from the bottom, getting away from the drop zone would be their top priority.         
	Meanwhile, in Margao, buoyed by their empathic win over Salgaocar, Sporting Clube de Goa would look to maintain their winning momentum when they take on depleted JCT.         
	Sporting scored their second win of the campaign, against Salgaocar 3-1, in the last round.

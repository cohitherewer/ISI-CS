            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Vikas Krishan                           
	New Delhi: At 18, Vikas Krishan is mature beyond his years. The teenage sensation, who clinched the Asian Games gold medal in his maiden senior level tournament, is known in his fraternity as Mr. Cool of Indian boxing.         
	Famous for his defensive tactics that saw him win many major battles in his short career, the Haryana pugilist has the rare knack of staying calm and composed in a difficult situation.         
	Vikas may not be a spectators delight but he is exactly what a modern day boxer should be, said Jaidev Bisht, one of the coaches with the Indian team.         
	Vikas, too, readily admits that he likes to do things in his own way in the ring. Watch your back is my policy, he once said. I am never in favour of giving away unnecessary points.         
	The Bhiwani boxer, who started his career under Jagdish Singh has already won many laurels for the country.         
	In the World Youth Championships, at Azerbaijan, last year, Vikas won the gold, beating Evalados Petrauskas of Lithuania in a hard-fought final.         
	Though the Asian Games was my first senior level international tournament, I did not get nervous, said Vikas.         
	Employing his typical ploy, Vikas made the Chinese rival lose his cool and earned two crucial penalty points to pocket the title. I dont use same tactics always, he said .

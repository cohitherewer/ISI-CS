The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians inflict crushing defeat
                                                                                                                       7                                        Australians inflict crushing defeat

	Perth: England were not bowled out on the fourth day of the fourth Test. They were bombed out in less than an hour, to lose by 267 runs. The Ashes series stands at 1-1. But the psychological advantage is with Australia after this rout which atones for their innings defeat in the second Test at Adelaide.         
	England needed a tactical withdrawal when they resumed with five wickets left. Any thought of chasing 391 was absurd, given a bit of unevenness in the Perth pitch, but England needed to bat well  to pass 200 at least  to preserve their self-esteem and curb Australias.         
	Instead, England were put to flight by Mitchell Johnson, who finished with nine wickets in the match, and Ryan Harris, who took six in Englands second innings for his best Test figures. They are, as a pair, more potent than any England can manage at the moment: an ominous sign with two Tests left.         
	Ricky Ponting rightly hailed Johnsons spell on the second morning, when the fast lefthander took four wickets for seven runs, as probably one of the all-time great Ashes spells. Ponting did not field, having broken the little finger of his left hand, and it was his 36th birthday, but wild horses will be needed to keep him away from the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.         
	Harris was fast and straight  too fast and straight for Englands remaining batsmen, let alone tailenders. Harris is particularly good at lefthanders  and detonated James Andersons offstump out of the ground.         
	Ian Bell played some shots  one too many in fact. It was over-ambitious shot-selection to drive a fast straight ball from Harris. The best that England could have salvaged from the wreckage would have been a neat unbeaten 50 by Bell.         
	Matt Prior has been discomforted by the bounce more than any of Englands batsmen. He top-edged a six from one attempt at a hook before fending to third slip, where Mike Hussey capped his marvellous batting with a flying catch to his right. The Australian players and supporters were whipped up by now. Their fielders ran around, applauding each other and patting bottoms, just as England had done in Adelaide.         
	Graeme Swann inside-edged a drive at Johnson, Steve Finn fended to third slip, and the celebrations began  almost as if the Ashes had been regained.         
	Englands captain Andrew Strauss said afterwards, and rightly: As a batting line-up we have to be very, very disappointed. He exonerated the bowlers as they had dismissed Australia for two unremarkable totals on a pretty reasonable wicket.         
	There is a week to go before the Melbourne Test: time for England to regroup. But if Johnson keeps swinging the ball, Englands ambition may have to be reined back to retaining the Ashes with a 2-2 draw, rather than winning the series.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Okolie Odafe tries to get past Narugopal Hait during their I-League match on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Determined to buck up after a heavy drubbing in their last I-League encounter, Churchill Brothers thrashed ten-men Chirag United 4-2 at the Salt Lake Stadium Sunday. It was Man of the Match Okolie Odafe and Felix Chimaokwu who stole the show for the Goan team.         
	After scoring three of the four goals for his team Sunday, Odafe joined Chirags Joshimar and Mahindras Muritala Ali with 12 goals each in the I-League top scorers chart. This victory put the defending champions third on the table with 25 points while Chirag remained fifth with 25.         
	To make a point and show how determined they were to win it, Odafe, scored in the very 10th minute from a Felix cross. And that just set up the mood for the visitors.         
	Felix again, in the 38th minute, passed to Reisangmi Vashum. Vashum then took an incredible shot from the right flank which hit the goal post and rebounded straight to Ogba Kalu, who slotted home for the visitors to go up 2-0.         
	Felix was at it again just before first half when he ran all the way up to pass the ball to Odafe, who scored his second goal with ease.         
	The visitors seemed a bit relaxed after the lemon break which Chirag strikers, Joshimar and Edmilson, took full advantage of. In the 63rd minute, Joshimar took an attempt that rebounded straight to Edmilson and he wasted no time in finishing it off clinically.         
	The Brazilian was at it again in the next minute when Joshimars attempt rebounded off goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya and came to his feet. The striker scored his second goal.         
	Nigerian Odafe scored his hattrick in the 70th minute when he got the ball inside the box, wrong footed Eduardo and Arnab Mondal, and toed it in.         
	Chirags midfield played well and created opportunities for the forwards, but they seemed unable to penetrate the Churchill defense. Though Edmilson pulled two back, he killed Chirags chances by getting a red card in the 80th for spitting on Robert Lalthlamuana.         
	Eduardo too, will be unavailable for Chirags next match against Mumbai FC as he was shown a yellow card in the 21st minute. It was his second yellow on the trot.         
	Unity and determination played key factors in this victory, said Churchill coach Carlos Roberto da Silva.

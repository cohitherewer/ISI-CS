The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Enjoy yourself: Dravid to Raina
                                                                                                                       7                                        Enjoy yourself: Dravid to Raina
  - Debutant has the potential, says former India captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Suresh Raina and Rahul Dravid                                 
	Colombo: Suresh (Raina) has the potential and it will be good for him and India if he translates that into something big... I wish him the very best...         
	With those words, Rahul Dravid welcomed Raina into the Test cricketers fraternity. His own debut had been at Lords, in the summer of 1996.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Dravid added: While handing the Test cap to Suresh (at the SSC on Monday morning), I expressed the hope that he has a fruitful career... I also said that he should go out and enjoy himself, enjoy the moment...         
	Dravid, incidentally, had also handed Raina his maiden ODI cap  in Dambulla, five years ago, when hed been the (stand-in) captain and Greg Chappell the coach.         
	Raina, by the way, regards Dravid as his ideal batsman. The senior-most after Sachin Tendulkar, Dravid has played 141 Tests, totalling 11,457 high-quality runs, with 29 hundreds.         
	It has been an innings which would attract the envy of those with big ambitions.

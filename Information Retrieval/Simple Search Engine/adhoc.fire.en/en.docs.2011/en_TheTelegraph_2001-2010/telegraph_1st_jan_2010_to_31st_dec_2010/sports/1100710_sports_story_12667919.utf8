The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gavaskar   writes to captains
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gavaskar   writes to captains
                            
	New Delhi: Legendary batsman and IPL governing council member Sunil Gavaskar has written an e-mail to the captains of eight original IPL teams, seeking suggestions for conducting the next edition of the Twenty20 league in 2011.         
	Gavaskar, alongwith Ravi Shastri and Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, have been entrusted by the BCCI to work out the modalities of the auction and conducting the tournament since the initial three-year contract of the players ended in April. The three former India captains were given the responsibility after Modi was suspended immediately after the third edition of the meet.         
	According to the letter written on July 5, it is learnt that Gavaskar has favoured retention of four Indian players and three foreigners. However, the players whom the franchises wish to retain would still go into the auction and the owners would be given the preference in case of a tie in the bid.         
	The next governing council meeting is slated for August and all the suggestions will be discussed in that meeting before finalising.           (PTI)

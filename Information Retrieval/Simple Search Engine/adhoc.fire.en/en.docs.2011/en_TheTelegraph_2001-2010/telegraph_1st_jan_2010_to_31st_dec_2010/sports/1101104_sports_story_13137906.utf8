The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cronje made fixing offer in 1996
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cronje made fixing offer in 1996
            Team had declined the proposal, says Herschelle Gibbs              Herschelle Gibbs                      
	Johannesburg: Herschelle Gibbs has claimed in his controversial autobiography, To the Point, that former South Africa captain Hansie Cronje had made an offer to the team to fix a match in India in 1996.         
	However, the opener admitted that Cronje remained a man he would always admire.         
	In a chapter titled The controversies, Gibbs recalled the day Cronje changed the face of the game forever.         
	It was 6.30 am and knocking on my door was the Proteas team captain Hansie Cronje. We were touring India in 2000, and in Nagpur about to play our final ODI match against India. My roommate Henry Williams was in the shower when Hansie sat down on the bed. He got straight to the point. Ive got a mate here in India, he said, and you can make some good money if you do what hes asking. Hes offering $15,000 if you go out for less than 20 in todays game.         
	But it was not the first time that Cronje had approached his side about match-fixing, according to Gibbs.         
	During a tour to India in 1996, we were due to play a benefit game for one of the (unnamed) Indian players  it would be the last game of the tour. The night before the game, Hansie got the whole team together and dropped a real bombshell. I know a guy, he said, who is going to give us $250,000 if we lose this game.         
	Of course the team decided against taking the bribe, but even so, it hadnt been an immediate and strong reaction to an activity totally abhorrent to the notion of sport. Instead we talked the offer over. We declined the offer. Sachin Tendulkar ended up getting a 100 in that game and, predictably, we lost.         
	Gibbs said when Cronje made the offer in Nagpur, the consequences of the offer did not even enter his mind as he thought about how it might help him pay off his mothers house.         
	And just like that I made a decision that would get me into a world of trouble and that I would bitterly regret. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag: Need to maintain consistency
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sehwag: Need to maintain consistency
                      
	Dhaka: Ahead of Indias first assignment this year, vice-captain Virender Sehwag on Saturday told his teammates to maintain the kind of consistency that has made them the No. 1 Test team in the world.         
	Sehwag, who arrived here on Saturday along with his teammates for an ODI tri-series to be followed by a two-match Test series against hosts Bangladesh, said the team would try its best to maintain the high standard that has become the hallmark of the side.         
	Its important for the team to play well consistently. If you do that you will stay there in No. 1 or No. 2 positions, he said.         
	Even though India comprehensibly beat Sri Lanka at home and the islanders would be without key players like Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralidharan, Ajantha Mendis and Mahela Jayawardene, Sehwag refused to underestimate them.         
	When new players break into the side, nobody really knows what he will do or what his strength is. Its difficult for the teams to bowl or bat against them.         
	The swashbuckling opener expected the pitches here to be similar to the ones in India and sounded worried about the dew factor. I think whenever you play in the subcontinent, you get more or less the same kind of wicket, he said. Its generally a good track to bat on and the wicket subsequently gets slower and slower. Dew can also be a big factor, Sehwag said.         
	Sri Lanka, who arrived later in the day, will meet the hosts in the tournament opener on Monday while India begin their campaign with a game against the Lankans on Tuesday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.         
	Meanwhile, Gautam Gambhir, Sehwags opening partner in Tests, has said that he always tries not to be influenced by Sehwag.         
	I just try to be myself. I know areas where Im strong at and play accordingly, rather than thinking what Sehwag is doing at the other end, Gambhir said.         
	I have my own game, I have my own style. I know my strength and I play according to it... I dont try things I cannot do. You cannot take challenges which you are not up to, he explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkars absence good for others: Afridi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tendulkars absence good for others: Afridi
                      
	Karachi: Sachin Tendulkars refusal to return to Twenty20 cricket for next months World Cup in the West Indies is a relief for Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi.         
	Tendulkar, who quit the format along with Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid in 2007, has been in red hot form in the ongoing edition of the IPL and it has forced present and former cricketers, including Afridi, to ask him to change his decision.         
	If he is not playing for India in the Twenty20 World Cup, it is certainly a big advantage for the other teams, Afridi said. If Tendulkar had played in this World Cup, I am sure he would made big impact for India.

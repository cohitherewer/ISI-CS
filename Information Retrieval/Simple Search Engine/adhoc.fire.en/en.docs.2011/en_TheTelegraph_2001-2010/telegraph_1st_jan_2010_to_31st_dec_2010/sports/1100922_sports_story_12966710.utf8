            A STAFF REPORTER                                Tope Fuja      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Club have roped in Nigerian Tope Fuja as their new coach on Tuesday, a day after sacking Syed Nayeemuddin. Fuja, who has a Confederation of African Football (CAF) B licence, has signed a three-year contract with the club. Fuja was the coach of Mumbai United FC last season. In the past, he had coached the Tibetan national team and a few clubs in Nepal.         
	My aim is to qualify for the I-League, said the new coach at a news conference. It will be a challenge, but am sure the goal will be achieved.         
	Nayeem earlier said he doesnt have any regrets. I dont have any regrets but this is not the way how things should have gone down, said Nayeem. Had I been given more time, we could have accomplished more, he added.         
	 quot;I had gone to the club to help them in their hour of crisis. But if they ask me, again, Ill definitely go. The team is young and have good players, quot; said the former India coach.

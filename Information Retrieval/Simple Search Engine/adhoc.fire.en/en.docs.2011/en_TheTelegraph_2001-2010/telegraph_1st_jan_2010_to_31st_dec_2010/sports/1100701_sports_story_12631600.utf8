    - John Howard left red-faced; ICC asks for fresh nomination           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              John Howard                            
	Calcutta: That Australia and England, two of the three founders of the International Cricket Council (ICC), or the Imperial Cricket Conference as it was first known, have little relevance in its boardroom, got confirmed on Wednesday.         
	South Africa, the third founder-nation, is still relevant  thanks to being on the right side of the very powerful lobby captained by India.         
	Not only England and Australia, even New Zealand has little relevance today, with all three merely completing the numbers in the Executive Board of the ICC.         
	Indeed, their failure to push through the nomination of John Howard, a former Prime Minister of Australia, for the post of vice-president, is bound to have fairly far-reaching consequences.         
	That Howard was up against heavy odds was reported more than once in these columns. On Wednesday, in Singapore, the lobby led by India ensured that Australia-New Zealand didnt press for their joint candidate.         
	Had they done so, India and its allies (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the West Indies) would have emphatically defeated the nomination on the floor of the house.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya had mastered the art of isolating Australia, England and New Zealand. He was, clearly, the first to realise the awesome power of a united Asia, Africa and the West Indies. That legacy is being carried forward by the Shashank Manohars.         
	Besides Australia and New Zealand, among the 10 Test-playing nations, Howard had the support of England. A poor three versus seven.         
	Obviously, the two (nominating) nations did no homework, or else they would have been able to gauge the anti-Howard mood.         
	There wasnt just one reason for the opposition to Howard. Political factors came in, then there was talk of his being a racist... The outsider bit was there, too.         
	Plenty was at play, really.         
	Cricket Australia, in particular, has to take almost all the blame for embarrassing a well-known public figure. Now, its to be seen whether its chairman, Jack Clarke, will step down after this fiasco.         
	The episode reflects poorly on David Morgan, the outgoing president of the ICC, as well, for failing to provide the leadership required in a crisis.         
	Morgans two-year tenure, which ends on Thursday morning, will be best remembered for his failure to get Howard nominated. The Englishman had taken it upon himself to clear the path.         
	Australia-New Zealand have been asked to re-nominate a candidate. They have time till August 31.         
	That Australia and New Zealand would be left with no choice but to nominate someone else was, in fact, also reported by The Telegraph more than once in the past few weeks.         
	Sharad Pawar, who takes over as president in a few hours, wont have a No.2 for a couple of months, at least. The next vice-president will succeed him, in the top job, in 2012.         
	Meanwhile, in a joint statement, Australia-New Zealand have said they were deeply disappointed and that it was premature to make any comment on the way forward.         
	Footnote: The coming together of India and Pakistan, after a year-and-a-half of strained relations between the boards, is significant. The first move, one understands, was made by the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Ijaz Butt.

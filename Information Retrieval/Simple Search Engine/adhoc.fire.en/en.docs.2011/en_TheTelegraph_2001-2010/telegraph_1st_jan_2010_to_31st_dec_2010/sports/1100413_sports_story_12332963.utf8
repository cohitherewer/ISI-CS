The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haunted Adebayor not to play for Togo again
                                                                                                                       7                                        Haunted Adebayor not to play for Togo again
  - Deadly attack on team at the African Cup of Nations forces international retirement             Emmanuel Adebayor                           
	London: Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor retired from international football Monday, saying he is still haunted by the deadly attack on his team at the African Cup of Nations in January.         
	Gunmen killed an assistant coach and team spokesman in the Jan. 8 attack in Angola, two days before the start of the tournament. Adebayor was subsequently furious that Togo was suspended for the next two African Cup of Nations tournaments as punishment for withdrawing from the competition in Angola.         
	Following the tragic events during Januarys African Cup of Nations, in which two of my fellow countrymen were killed by terrorists in Angola, I have made the very difficult decision to retire from international football, Adebayor said in a statement released by Manchester City.         
	I have weighed up my feelings in the weeks and months since the attack, and I am still haunted by the events which I witnessed on that horrible afternoon on the Togo team bus.         
	We were just footballers going to play a match and represent our country. Yet we were attacked by people who wanted to kill us all. It is a moment I will never forget and one I never want to experience again.         
	The 26-year-old Adebayor, whose team did not qualify for the World Cup in South Africa, made his international debut in 2000.         
	Togo have some very talented players, and I dearly hope the players who remain will be able to put their memories of Angola behind them and go on to be a success for the nation, the former Arsenal player said. I have enormous belief in each and every one of them, players, coaches, staff and their families.         
	The people who were on that coach together will forever be joined by a special bond - we are all brothers. I will always have the team and the people of Togo close to my heart and wish them every success in the challenges that they will face in the future.

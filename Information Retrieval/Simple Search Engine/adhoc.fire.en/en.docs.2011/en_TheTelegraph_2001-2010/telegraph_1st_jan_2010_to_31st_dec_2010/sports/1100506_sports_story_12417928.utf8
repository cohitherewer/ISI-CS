The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wada expects ICC to apply clause
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wada expects ICC to apply clause
                      
	Mumbai: The World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) is waiting for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to apply the controversial whereabouts clause, which has been opposed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in its Anti-Doping Code.         
	The Wada senior manager of media relations and communications, Frederic Donze, in an e-mail, said that the ICCs anti-doping rules were in compliance with World Anti-Doping Code.         
	Wada continues to work with the ICC in the expectation that their out-of-competition testing programme, which has started, will advance and that the whereabouts requirements of the International Standard for Testing will be applied in cricket, he said.         
	Wada responded to a query about the current status of the controversial clause in cricket which the BCCI has refused to be part of.         
	The contentious clause requires cricketers in the common testing pool to furnish details of their whereabouts three months in advance to the anti-doping authorities.         
	Indian players have rejected the ICCs Wada-compliant code because of this clause, saying its a violation of their fundamental right to privacy and poses a security threat as well and the BCCI has supported their stand. The ICC had last October decided to suspend the whereabouts clause until the concerns of the Indian players were sorted out.         
	Last month, ICC chief executive officer Haroon Lorgat said in Mumbai that the ICC was close to finding a solution to the problem and a consensus would be reached on the matter within a week. However, the official media release issued after the April 20 meeting made no mention of this matter.

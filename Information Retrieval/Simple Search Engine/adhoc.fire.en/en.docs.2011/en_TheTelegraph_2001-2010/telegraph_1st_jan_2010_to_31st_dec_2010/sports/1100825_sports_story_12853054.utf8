The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top billing for Rafa, Caroline 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Top billing for Rafa, Caroline 
                      
	New York: World No.1 Rafael Nadal has been given top billing in the mens singles for the US Open, on Monday, as the Spaniard bids to complete a career Grand Slam.         
	While Nadal chases his maiden US Open crown, Swiss Roger Federer, a finalist at Flushing Meadows the last six years lifting the title five times, is seeded second. The US Open starts on August 30.         
	Serb Novak Djokovic is seeded third and Briton Andy Murray, the 2008 US Open runner-up, fourth.         
	Title holder Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina pulled out of the tournament earlier this week. He is still recovering from surgery on a right wrist injury that has put him out for almost the whole season.         
	Andy Roddick is the top American. The 2003 US Open winner has been seeded ninth.         
	Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark has been seeded No. 1 at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time, on Tuesday. She was given top billing because Serena Williams had earlier pulled out with a foot injury.         
	Wozniacki, ranked No. 2 behind Serena by the Womens Tennis Association, was the runner-up at Flushing Meadows last year and is the first woman since 2003 to be seeded No. 1 at the US Open without already having won a major championship.         
	Defending champion Kim Clijsters was seeded No. 2 by the US Tennis Association, which stuck strictly to the rankings in determining the seedings. Venus Williams, the 2000-01 US Open champion, is No. 3, followed by 2008 runner-up Jelena Jankovic and French Open runner-up Samantha Stosur.         
	Two other past US Open champions who were seeded, are No. 11 Svetlana Kuznetsova and No. 14 Maria Sharapova.         
	Serena withdrew last week, saying she was recovering from surgery to repair cuts on her right foot.         
	The womens seeds were announced on Tuesday, due to the Monday finish of the rain-delayed Montreal Cup won by Wozniacki.         
	The Indian challenge at the years last Grand Slam begins with Sania Mirza drawing Russian Ksenia Lykina in the first round of qualifying. She has been forced to go through the qualifiers due to low ranking.         
	This is for the first time, since her breakthrough year in 2005, that Sania has to go through the qualifiers to play in a Grand Slam.         
	Sanias singles ranking has dipped to 160, as she is struggling with form and a recurring wrist injury. She made a desperate attempt to improve her ranking by playing a few ITF tournaments but her efforts has not met with much success.         
	Sania and Ksenia, ranked 236, have never played each other. The Indians best performance at a Grand Slam came in 2005 at US Open when she made the pre-quarters.         
	Somdev Dev Varman, ranked 99, is all set to make a direct entry into the mens singles draw of the US Open after breaking into top 100.         
	There are 16 places up for grabs in the qualifying event for the main draw, starting August 30.                   (AGENCIES)

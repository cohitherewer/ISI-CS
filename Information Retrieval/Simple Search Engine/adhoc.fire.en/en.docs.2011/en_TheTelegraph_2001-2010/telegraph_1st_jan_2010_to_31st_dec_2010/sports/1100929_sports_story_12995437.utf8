	Mumbai: The venues for one Test and two ODIs will be changed during New Zealands tour of India, later this season.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Hyderabad is going to host the second Test (instead of Kanpur) from November 12-16. As a result, it wont stage the December 4 ODI.         
	Also, Mohali has opted out of hosting the December 1 ODI.         
	The two ODIs will now be shifted to Jaipur and Vadodara. The order of those matches is going to be known on Wednesday, after the Boards AGM.

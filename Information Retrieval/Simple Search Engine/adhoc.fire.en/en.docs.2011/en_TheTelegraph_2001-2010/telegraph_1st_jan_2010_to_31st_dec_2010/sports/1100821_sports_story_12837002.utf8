The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani is off to a good start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Advani is off to a good start
                      
	Pune: Defending champion Pankaj Advani opened his campaign in style by winning both his group matches but eight-time winner Geet Sethi suffered one of the worst starts of his career after losing back-to-back league matches on the opening day of the IBSF World Billiards Championship on Friday.         
	Advani made short work of Englands Billy Bousfield 3-1 (150-70, 151-61, 37-150, 151-10) and then blanked Chul Ho Hwang of Korea in straight frames (151-31, 150-125, 150-60) to virtually seal a pre-quarter final berth in the points format of the prestigious event at the PYC Hindu Gymkhana, here.         
	The biggest draw of the championship was the first round clash between Geet Sethi and nine-time champion Mike Russell. Sethi seemed too rusty as he struggled to get the roll of the green baize and lost in straight frames to his long-time nemesis.         
	The 41-year-old Englishman played as if he was in a hurry as he raced to a 150-49, 151-9, 150-58 win in less than 90 minutes. Russell went on to win his second league match, beating Min Hu Baek of Korea 150-89, 152-29, 150-8. Sethi then slumped to another defeat, losing to Myanmars Nay Thway Oo, to hamper his qualification chances further.         
	Among the other Indians in the fray, Dhruv Sitwala, Rupesh Shah, Ashok Shandilya and Alok Kumar made a sound start to their campaigns by winning their opening two matches. (PTI)

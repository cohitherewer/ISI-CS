  - Ingram scores a quickfire 31, Theron grabs four wickets             South Africa players celebrate the fall of a Pakistan wicket, on Wednesday                           
	Abu Dhabi: South Africa closed in on a 2-0 series win by restricting Pakistan to 120 for nine in the second Twenty20 International, at the Zayed International Cricket Stadium, on Wednesday.                     
	South Africa defeated Pakistan by six wickets in the second T20 International to win the series 2-0. Chasing a 121-run target, the Proteas made 125 for four in 18.4 overs. Graeme Smiths 38, Colin Ingrams 17-ball 31 and JP Duminys unbeaten 16-ball 20 helped South Africa to victory.                     
	Bowlers Rusty Theron (4/27) and Lonwabo Tsotsobe (2/20) shared the bowling honours while Misbah-ul Haq top scored for Pakistan with 33. Abdul Razzaq chipped in with a breezy 25. After winning the toss, Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi elected to bat after both teams kept the same teams they fielded in Tuesdays first game.         
	South Africa struck early when Tsotsobe removed both the openers Shahzaib Hasan and Imran Farhat for single figures. At the other end, Morne Morkel bowled Mohammed Hafeez as Pakistan was reduced to 29 for three.         
	Umar Akmal, the highest Twenty20 scorer this year, was on only five when he went for a non-existent second run and was run out, leaving his team four down for 36.         
	Skipper Afridi came and left after playing an irresponsible shot, but Misbah, as he did during an unbeaten 27 in the first match on Tuesday, played some steady cricket while Razzaq slammed two sixes in his 29-ball innings of 25.         
	Misbah fell in the final over for a fighting 33 off 38 balls as Theron grabbed three wickets in that over.         
	In the first T20, on Tuesday, Tsotsobe and Johan Bothas bowling heroics helped South Africa beat Pakistan by six wickets.         
	Tsotsobe, with a career-best three for 16, and skipper Botha (three for 31) led a spirited Proteas bowling attack to restrict Pakistan to a paltry 119.           (AGENCIES)

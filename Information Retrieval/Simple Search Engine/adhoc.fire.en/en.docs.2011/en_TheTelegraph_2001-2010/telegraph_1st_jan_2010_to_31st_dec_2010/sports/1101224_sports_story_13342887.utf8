The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung to start own football club
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhaichung to start own football club
  - I sincerely believe United Sikkim can be raised in a professional manner, says India captain       JAYDEEP BASU            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	New Delhi: After 17 successful years with top club sides in the country, Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia is set to start his own club in the I-League in a big way.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the ace striker is actively working to form a new side, United Sikkim Football Club in Gangtok, and has already applied to play the second division I-League this season.         
	While Bhaichung, considered the biggest icon of Indian football, is likely to play for the club once he returns from Asia Cup, a few more national team stars may also join the outfit. Marcus Pacheco, currently the goalkeepers coach with the Indian team, could be appointed the coach in the first season.         
	The federation has received an application from United Sikkim Football Club to play in the second division, confirmed Sunando Dhar, chief executive officer of the I-League.         
	All the documents have been sent by Bhaichung along with a covering letter signed by him.         
	We have written to Bhaichung to send a few more relevant papers needed to fulfil the AFC (Asian Football Federation) criteria, Dhar said adding the club already has around 20 registered players.         
	The AFC has set December 31, 2010 as the deadline for all the clubs to fulfil the criteria for participating in the I-League, both premier and second Division.         
	Contacted in Dubai, where he is busy preparing for the Asian Cup with the national team, Bhutia said the United Sikkim club was going to be his dream project.         
	Since we are yet to receive the green signal from the AIFF, it would be a bit premature on my part to reveal all the plans. But I sincerely believe United Sikkim can be raised in a professional manner. There are several corporate houses in the country who are interested in investing in professional football clubs, the Indian captain told The Telegraph.         
	The government of Sikkim is also believed to be backing the project and has assured the Indian captain of allotting the team the stadium in Gangtok.         
	The AIFF is happy with the development since the formation of United Sikkim will allow it to get a foothold in the North Eastern state and tap talents. The relegation of Lajong FC last season was a blow as it was the only team in the I-League from the North Eastern sector. Now with Bhaichung taking an interest in forming a club would definitely help us in spreading the I-League there, said an AIFF official.

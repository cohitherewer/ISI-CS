                            Final day hurdle for Australia

	Adelaide: Reports of the demise of Australian Test cricket have been exaggerated. The hosts go into the final day with an outside chance of saving the second Test, especially if rain arrives at the Adelaide Oval as it has done for the last two afternoons. Utterly outplayed on first innings - Australia were 375 runs behind in the first half of the match - the home side have had their spirit revived a little in their second.         
	The fight was taken to England firstly by Shane Watson and Simon Katich, who shared another of their moderately successful opening stands, then by Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey in a fourth-wicket partnership which had England worried - until Kevin Pietersen ended the day as he began it, triumphantly.         
	Clarke had not made significant runs since being promoted from number five to four. Today, he justified his promotion, and his vice-captaincy, by conducting Australia to 238 for the loss of three wickets just before the close of day four. Only for Pietersen to intervene.         
	Pietersen had earlier made his highest Test score of 227, beating his previous best, against West Indies, by one run - and had shredded Australias bowling in the process, and reduced their fielding to some village-green antics.         
	But Pietersen was just as triumphant when he delivered - with a more vigorous bowling action than he has used hitherto - an offbreak, which leaped at Clarke in the last over of the fourth day. Australias vice-captain could not keep the ball down, so much did it lift, and it went off the shoulder of his bat to his thigh pad before lobbing up for Alastair Cook to sprint back from short-leg.         
	England had not become despondent, but they had surely become perplexed by the number of chances that had just eluded them. Graeme Swann, from the Cathedral end, brought about a succession of nicks, squeezes and pop-ups with his offbreaks; but they kept on falling just out of the reach of Englands close fielders in a defiance of probability.         
	So England were due some luck. Steve Finn had bowled his best spell of the series, making even Hussey - in his purple patch - play and miss several times. Swann, too, had bowled his best yet in Australia. And it could be counted as ill luck that Stuart Broad had strained some stomach muscles - an injury which normally takes some weeks to mend and makes Broads participation in any of the last three Tests doubtful at best.         
	The facts are that only about one England pace bowler per tour stays fit for all five Tests of a series in Australia. In 2006-7, Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison played all five Tests, if to no great avail, while in 2002-3 none of Englands pace bowlers did. In 1998-9, Darren Gough played all five Tests, but no England bowler did in 1994-5. In 1986-7, no England pace bowler played all five, but Bob Willis and Ian Botham did in 1982-3.         
	The replacement for Broad in Perth will be Chris Tremlett if England want a fairly like-for-like to bowl downwind, if not like the wind, and to generate some bounce.         
	Alternatively, England could replace Broad with Tim Bresnan. Then Bresnan would be treated as the workhorse who would bowl into the wind - the Fremantle Doctor - along with Swann, while Anderson is given the end which his senior status deserves and bowls downwind with Finn.         
	Englands batting would be less weakened if Broad were to be replaced by Bresnan: indeed it would be just about a like-for-like replacement in batting terms at No 8. On the other hand, an England tail of Swann, Tremlett, Anderson and Finn would be rather long.         
	No tailenders were needed in Englands first innings here when Pietersen, Ian Bell and Matt Prior did all the demolition required first thing. They added 69 runs in only1 40 minutes before the declaration, 375 runs ahead.         
	It was almost a shot a ball by England. Australias new left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty bowled his three overs for 38 runs. They might remain his last for Australia - if those of his teammates left to bat do not perform on the final day, starting with the second new ball.         
	Then they will have to contend with the offspin of Swann and Englands talented, remodelled, practioner: that man Pietersen.

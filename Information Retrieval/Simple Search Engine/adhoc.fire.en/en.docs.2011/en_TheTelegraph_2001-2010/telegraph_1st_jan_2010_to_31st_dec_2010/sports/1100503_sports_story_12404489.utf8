The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt opens with a bang
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bolt opens with a bang
                      
	Kingston: Triple Olympic and world champion Usain Bolt ran the fourth-fastest 200 metres of all-time with a blistering 19.56 second sprint in front of his home fans at the Jamaica International Invitational on Saturday.         
	Only Bolt (twice) and former world record holder Michael Johnson have ever clocked faster times.         
	I felt good, the race was a good one and I am on target to have a good season, Bolt told reporters after his first individual race of the season.         
	My training has been going well and I am pleased with my performance, he added.         
	The Jamaicans world record stands at 19.19 seconds, which he set at last years world championships in Berlin, and his latest effort was all the more impressive as it was run into a headwind of 0.8 metres per second.

	Calcutta: The National Cricket Association director Sandeep Patil said on Monday that the academy was looking to achieve uniformity in coaching. Coaches should impart the same type of coaching to the young cricketers as that will help the players in the longer run. In the present context its a must. We have to look towards something on those lines, he said.         
	Patil said that for a cricketer to be successful in all the versions  Test, one-day or Twenty20  he has to get the basics right. There cant be any second opinion on that. Your basics have to be right, he said.         
	Patil, who visited the Jadavpur University campus ground in Salt Lake, was very impressed with the blueprint of the CABs proposed academy at Kalyani.         
	The member of the 1983 World Cup-winning side, who is visiting the 21st state association on his travels since taking over as the NCA director, had fruitful discussions with the various age-group Bengal coaches. And he has promised to visit in late August or early September for a seven-day camp here, CAB secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	Meanwhile, the BCCI is planning to start a cricket university in Bangalore where NCA will have a big role to play. The university will have coaching courses for the higher levels and video analysis courses among other things.

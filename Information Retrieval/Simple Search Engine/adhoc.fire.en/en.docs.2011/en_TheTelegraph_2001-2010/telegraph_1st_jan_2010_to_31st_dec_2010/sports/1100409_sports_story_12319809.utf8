	Old prejudices die hard in Europe. After Bayern Munich fought back from three goals behind to knock Manchester United out of the Champions League on Wednesday, Uniteds veteran manager Alex Ferguson went on television and blamed those typical Germans!         
	The United manager accused Bayerns players of deliberately kicking the ankle of Wayne Rooney after United had taken a calculated gamble on it. Rooney started injured, and the world knew it.         
	But Ferguson also blamed those Germans for getting his 19-year-old fullback, Rafael da Silva, sent off halfway through the contest.         
	Hes young and inexperienced, Ferguson said. And they got him sent off. Everyone sprinted over to the referee.         
	You get that with the Germans.         
	Right, and wrong. You get from German teams, whatever the nationalities of players wearing their colours, a fighting spirit that sometimes chases down lost causes. That happened Wednesday, when Bayern came back after United had started in rampant fashion and scored three goals in the first 40 minutes at Old Trafford, as briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition.         
	The comeback began before Rafael was sent off. Ivica Olic had stolen a goal before half time. Arjen Robben completed the recovery in the 74th minute with a volley as close to perfection as we will ever see. That made the match score 3-2, and the aggregate score 4-4.         
	The Germans are through on the away-goals rule, to face Lyon in the semi-finals.         
	Ferguson should know better. He has been around the European game for 40 years, he was born during the Second World War, but he, more than most men of his time, has mastered changes that make soccer a global entity.         
	Ferguson is a Scot managing a club in England, owned by Americans, drawing players from all over the world. What has not changed is his enduring ability to create teams to his own attacking taste  he has done it four times in 24 seasons at Old Trafford  and his lack of grace in defeat.         
	Put a microphone in front of Ferguson while the taste of losing is still bitter, and he speaks from the gut.         
	His barbs about Bayerns players targeting the vulnerable ankle of his star player was partially correct. Daniel Van Buyten kicked Rooney early on. Bastian Schweinsteiger trod on that sore spot too. Schweinsteiger is German, but Van Buyten is Belgian.         
	And, while Schweinsteiger was again one of a crowd calling upon the Italian referee to dismiss Rafael, that unsporting posse of players was led by Franck Ribery, the player who was fouled, Olic and Mark van Bommel  from France, Croatia, and the Netherlands respectively.         
	The player sent off is Brazilian.         
	Rafael had been promoted to take the place of the club captain Gary Neville because, understandably, Ferguson had seen from the first leg in Munich that even a half-fit Ribery is too swift, too tricky for Nevilles ageing limbs.         
	The reinvigoration of United team, replacing older players in defence and midfield with more youth, more energy, certainly seemed the right call for the first 40 minutes. In that time, Antonio Valencias swiftness and sorcery down the right had set up two goals for Nani, the first finished with an audacious flick of the heel and celebrated with Nanis full array of back somersaults.         
	Before that, Darron Gibson, again youth preferred to the experience of Paul Scholes, had shot United ahead with a fine low shot from outside the penalty area.         
	The crowd of 74,482 was jubilant, the narrow lead Bayern had gained on their ground was forgotten, the party was growing loud. Then Olic took advantage of a tumble by Michael Carrick. Then Rafael and Ribery tangled.         
	Thus, the spirit of Olic, who never gives up on anything, turned the semi-final, and Louis van Gaal, the Bayern coach, boasted that he did the rest.         
	In the dressing room at half time, said van Gaal, I gave the (Barack) Obama speech. I told my players: Yes, we can do this.         
	So, for the first time in seven years, there is no English club in the Champions League semi-finals. For the first time in eight years, Bayern are back at that level. And for the first time in more than a decade, four different countries  France, Germany, Italy and Spain  are in the last four.

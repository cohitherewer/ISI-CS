The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bell props up England
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bell props up England

	Manchester: England batsman Ian Bell swelled his average against Bangladesh to 197 with an unbeaten 87 on the opening day of the second Test at Old Trafford.         
	Bell, playing his sixth Test against Bangladesh, helped take England to a competitive 275 for five when bad light stopped play after Kevin Pietersen (64) had succumbed to a left-arm spinner for the 17th time since March, 2008. Bangladesh, who need to win to draw the two-match series after losing at Lords, started brightly when recalled pace bowler Shafiul Islam removed Andrew Strauss (21) and Jonathan Trott (3).         
	England slumped to 48 for two after the openers appeared in little danger at 43 without loss after Strauss had won the toss. Those wickets, the first deliveries of Shafiuls sixth and seventh overs, quickly turned the morning in the tourists favour.         
	Strauss pushed forward to a ball just short of a length on off-stump and edged to second slip Imrul Kayes. Trott, following his 226 at Lords, was then bowled for three after an inside edge on to his pad. Another recalled player, left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, had Alastair Cook caught at slip for 29 with his first ball. The day then developed into thePietersen Show, ending in a familiar fashion.

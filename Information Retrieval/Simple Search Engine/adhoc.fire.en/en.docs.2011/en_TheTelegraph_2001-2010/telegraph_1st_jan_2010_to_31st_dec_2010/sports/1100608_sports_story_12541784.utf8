The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Am dazed: Saurabh
                                                                                                                       7                                        Am dazed: Saurabh
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: Saurabh Tiwary was on the India A coach, travelling from Leeds to Leicester, when The Telegraph got through to him on his cellphone around midnight (IST) on Monday.         
	Main kya kahun... Kuch samajh mein nahin aa raha... Im quite dazed, the hard-hitter from Jharkhand said in a rather soft tone.         
	Clearly, Tiwary was still trying to digest that hed actually made the Team India XV for the forthcoming Asia Cup.         
	Obviously, main bahut khush hoon... A dream, that of playing for India, is about to come true... I realise Ive been selected in place of Yuvraj Singh, so the pressure will be more, the 20-year-old added.         
	Not that the left-hander is worried. Kuch to pressure rehna chahiye... Im confident of being able to perform and (thereby) reducing the pressure...         
	Asked if he was grateful to somebody in particular, Tiwary replied with some emotion: My parents (Sunil Kumar, Kalaklata)... My entire family, really... Its a big day for them, too...         
	Was a celebration planned on reaching Leicester? Dekhiye... Will depend on my teammates... First lets get there (for the four-day match against West Indies A).         
	Now that the tour has ended for him, Tiwary should be back home in a couple of days.         
	Earlier, in the evening, the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) had reason to celebrate after word came that hed been picked.         
	Saurabh had been disappointed at being overlooked for the tri-series in Zimbabwe, even though many seniors had been rested... But, then, its good that hes made it when the team is almost at full strength... Its so much the better, the Ranchi-based JSCA president, Amitabh Choudhary, pointed out.         
	A former India manager, he added: Its a matter of pride that a state which isnt even 10 years old has two players (first, of course, being captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni) in the India team.         
	The JSCA, in fact, came into being as recently as August 2004, four months before Dhoni was selected for the first time  an ODI series in Bangladesh.         
	Big Brother Bengal, who have been struggling, have one representative (medium-pacer Ashok Dinda). Perhaps, theres a message in that.         
	Tiwary, incidentally, is the only rookie in the XV. Obviously, 419 runs for the Mumbai Indians in IPL III went a long way in getting the Jamshedpur boy a call-up.         
	Its possible that idol and the Mumbai Indians captain, Sachin Tendulkar, also did his bit by nudging the powers-that-be.

	Praveen Kumar will miss the first ODI against New Zealand, to be played at Guwahati on Sunday, due to fever. The All India senior selection committee has chosen Ashish Nehra as his replacement for the first ODI. Nehra was picked after he passed the fitness test, stated a Board of Control for Cricket in India release.         
	Nehra was part of the one-day team for the series against Australia last month and also figured in the only completed match, but was ignored for the series against the Black Caps as he didnt submit his fitness certificate.

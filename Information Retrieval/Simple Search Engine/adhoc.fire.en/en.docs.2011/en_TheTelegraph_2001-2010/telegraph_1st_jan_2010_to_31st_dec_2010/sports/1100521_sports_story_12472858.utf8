The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muralidharan bats for Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Muralidharan bats for Dhoni
  - Unfair that captain should be flayed over World T20 flop show, says Lankan             Dhoni                           
	New Delhi: Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan is of the view that Mahendra Singh Dhoni remains one of the best skippers in international cricket and considers it unfair that the Team India captain should be criticised on the basis of just one bad tournament.         
	The worlds highest wicket-taker in Tests and ODIs, who has Dhoni as his skipper in Indian Premier League side Chennai Super Kings, said he was amused by the outrage that greeted Indias early ouster from the showpiece event in the Caribbean.         
	He is one of the best captains. He won the IPL for the Chennai Super Kings. A week later, India were knocked out of the World T20 and, in India, when you win you are the best but when you lose you become the worst, Muralidharan quipped.         
	But you cannot become the worst in just a week. The media cannot bring him down like that, the off-spinner said.         
	Apart from the teams poor batting and fitness issues, critics put down the dismal showing partly to what they claim was uninspiring captaincy by Dhoni.         
	Muralidharan said India cannot overnight be labelled a bad team as Dhoni amp; Co. had proved themselves in both the Tests and ODIs. Dhoni also led India to the title in the inaugural World T20 in 2007.         
	They dont lack skill. They are the No.1 in Tests and No.2 in ODIs. You cannot reach there if you dont have the skills, Murali said on the sidelines of a function to announce the Indian International Film Academy (IIFA) awards ceremony that is to be held in Sri Lanka this year.         
	Twenty20 is a game anybody can win on his day. While in Tests and ODIs, there is time for you to come back there is no such thing in T20. India had a good team but they lost the grip after winning two matches initially. In T20 you need a bit of luck also.         
	England were the best team and they won the title but Australia won all their matches and lost in the final. It just shows that you need some luck too. Like, in IPL, the game can change in just one over, he said.         
	As to the IPL post-match parties, which Dhoni blamed for exhausting the players, Murali said he had never attended any of them.         
	No, I dont think its fair to blame the IPL. I never attended the parties... So, I cannot say, he said.         
	Nursing an injured groin at the moment, the off-spinner is all set for a comeback in next months Asia Cup.         
	I will be there at Asia Cup. I am fine now, he said.         
	Muralidharan will quit cricket after the 2011 ODI World Cup in the subcontinent and the 38-year-old veteran of 132 Tests and 334 one-dayers said he wanted to sign off on a high.         
	I never dreamt of getting what I have got. I have everything and I want to go out on a high, instead of (going) when I am down, he said.                 (PTI)

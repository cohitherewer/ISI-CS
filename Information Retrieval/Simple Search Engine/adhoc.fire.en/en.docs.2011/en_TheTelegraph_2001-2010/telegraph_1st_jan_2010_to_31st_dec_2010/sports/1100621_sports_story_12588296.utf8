The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I see myself as a bowler who can contribute with the bat 
                                                                                                                       7                                        I see myself as a bowler who can contribute with the bat 
    - Harbhajan after a sterling show             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Harbhajan Singh                                 
	Calcutta: Weve known Harbhajan Singh to be a match-winner with the ball. On Saturday night, the offie proved a winner with the bat, too. Indeed, Harbhajans unbeaten 15 (11 balls, 2x6), in a heart-stopping tight finish, carried India to the Asia Cup final and finished Pakistans hopes of getting there.         
	Harbhajan, who has completed a dozen years in the India colours (355 wickets in Tests; 242 in ODIs), turns 30 on July 3. On Sunday afternoon, the occasionally controversial senior pro spoke to The Telegraph from Dambulla.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the morning-after...         
	Felt great... The win, I think, has sent a strong message that were capable of beating any team... Its a message for Sri Lanka, whom we play in the final, as well.         
	Whether he slept well         
	(Laughs) Surprisingly, I didnt... Its said that you sleep well after a good day in office, but it wasnt to be for me... Perhaps, because of being over-excited.         
	Doing a Javed Miandad  getting the winning runs, in an India-Pakistan game, via a six         
	Yeah... Id grown up listening about Miandads last-ball six off Chetan Sharma in that (April 1986 Austral-Asia Cup) final in Sharjah... I was five years old then... In fact, log abhi bhi baat karte hain. Of course, Ive watched that tape a few times since and remember that Miandad didnt stop running till hed reached the Pakistan dressing room. Now, I suppose, people will also talk of my six.         
	Significance of the win in Dambulla         
	It has come at a critical time in our cricket... We didnt do well in the World T20 and, then, the somewhat young team which went to Zimbabwe didnt make the tri-series final there... Having said that, people must remember that this team is capable of defeating any opposition. Nobody wants to lose, but there are occasions when you end up being second-best... Weve been No.1 in ODIs and still are at the top in Test cricket.         
	Having been fired up in the closing stages of the match         
	One must play with josh... An India-Pakistan game is always big and, so, there will be plenty of passion, energy and emotion... Special hota hai.         
	Thoughts going into the last over, with four wickets in hand and seven runs required         
	Was confident... Knew it was a matter of just one hit... Id been confident when (Suresh) Raina was there... I was confident even after he got out and PK (Praveen Kumar) came to the crease. It was important to stay calm and we did so.         
	Exchange of words with speedster Shoaib Akhtar, for whom the Asia Cup has been a comeback tournament         
	Shoaib kept abusing me, something which increased after I hit him for a six, in the 47th over... I dont have a problem with players being charged up, but Im definitely going to react if somebody abuses members of my family... Shoaib did that, bolte raha... So... I dont know if the Match Referee (Andy Pycroft) had a word with him.         
	Whether he raised the issue with Shahid Afridi, the Pakistan captain, during the presentation ceremony         
	I did... I said Shoaib has no right to abuse an opponent... That he should look to win fair and square, not by abusing fellow-professionals.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni saluting him as an all-rounder         
	Im happy the way I am... I honestly see myself as a bowler who can contribute with the bat... Todays cricket is such that everybody needs to play a role in all three departments... Ive been working hard on my batting and its nice that I could deliver in such a crucial match, against Pakistan... (After a pause) Touch wood, whatever I had in mind, worked... I have, in the past, played some useful innings in ODIs, but wasnt able to finish it off. Last October, for example, I scored 49 in Vadodara but we still lost to Australia by four runs... Yesterday, I was able to complete the job... I dont know what everybody else feels, but I dont have to be called an all-rounder.         
	Specialists having to reinvent themselves         
	Bowlers, in particular, have to realise that theyve got to contribute with the bat... As Ive mentioned, thats a requirement of the times.         
	Rating his performance (two wickets, besides the all-important runs)         
	Probably the most satisfying in ODIs... I say so for two reasons  the opposition being Pakistan and, then, making an impact with the bat (too).         
	His No.1 show for India         
	Oh, the Test hattrick at the Eden, against Australia, nine years ago... If I may add, the response, by way of calls and messages, has been the same for what I managed last night. Khushi ho rahi hai... I mean, Ive helped bring joy to so many.         
	Thoughts going into Thursdays final...         
	Well have to play to potential. If we do, the Asia Cup will be regained... Weve stumbled only when we havent played to potential.         
	[India, of course, have an inconsequential league game, against Sri Lanka, on Tuesday.]         
	Finally, what came to mind after hed smashed Mohammed Aamer for the match-winning six         
	(Laughs) I thanked God, for being kind... Remembered the near and dear ones and thought of the millions who support us. Actually, I wanted to scream Jai Hind!

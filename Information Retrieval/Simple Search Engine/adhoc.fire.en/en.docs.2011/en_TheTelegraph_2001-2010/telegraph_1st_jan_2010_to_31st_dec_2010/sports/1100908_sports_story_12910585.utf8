	New Delhi: On the tender shoulders of Rashid Khan will rest the onus of ending Indias three-decade-old quest for the golf team gold, in the Asian Games, in Guangzhou, in November.         
	The exciting Delhi talent will have Abhijeet Chaddha, Rahul Bajaj and Abhinav Lohan as teammates, but the 19-year-old Rashid will have to be in his elements if India are to win the team gold. The medal has been eluding the team since they won it in 1982, when the sport made its Asian Games debut, in Delhi.         
	Ashbeer Saini has been named the reserve player in the five-member squad for China.         
	The Indian Golf Union (IGU) also named the womens team, comprising Shreya Ghei, Vani Kapoor and Gurbani Singh. Shradhanjali Singh is the reserve player in the womens squad.         
	The players were selected after trials in Noida and Bangalore in July. Their Australian coach Peter Murphy is happy to get enough time for some late fine-tuning. I am glad that the team has been chosen early, which gives adequate time to the team members to adapt, he said.         
	IGU president Ashit Luthra explained how the trials were conducted. Both the teams were selected after extensive trials and they have been picked after they beat their peers. The process was transparent. The biggest challenge for India will come from Korea and Japan. But our teams have potential champions who have the wherewithal make it big at the pro level as well, Luthra said.         
	The mens team will compete in Octobers Eisenhower Trophy to be held in Buenos Aires. Rashid spearheads the Indian team in the Asian Amateur Championships. The other members of this team are Amit Luthra, Abhijeet Chaddha and Abhinav Lohan.         
	At the press conference, T-shirts for the team, designed by the Calcutta-based Kiran Uttam Ghosh, were launched. On this, Luthra said: For the first time the IGU has commissioned a designer to take a fresh look at the apparel worn by the Indian teams.

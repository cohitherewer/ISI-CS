The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Questions raised over delayed start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Questions raised over delayed start
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A first division CAB league match between Aryan and Kumartuli created controversy Thursday as the match started an hour late.         
	Chasing a target of 363, set by Aryan, Kumartuli scored 295 for five in 72 overs, and the match ended in a draw. Around 13 overs were lost because of the umpires decision to start at 11 am.         
	The match in question is being played at the Bhowanipore ground. Both teams alleged that the two umpires denied them a chance to win. Aryan went to the extent of saying Kumartuli officials pressurised the umpires to delay the start.         
	We will be submitting a written complaint against the two umpires, Biplab Basu and Indranil Chakraborty, said club secretary Samar Paul.         
	Kumartuli supremo Saradindu Pal, however, clarified that there was no pressure on the umpires. In fact, we could have won the match had it started on time, Pal said.         
	The two umpires reasoned that overnight drizzle had created a few damp spots on the pitch, but all the matches in other grounds of the Maidan started at 10 am sharp.         
	However, the groundsman claimed that the pitch was ready for scheduled start. The match could have started on time. We prepared the pitch for a 10am start. But then it was umpires call, said groundsman Rabi Sahu.

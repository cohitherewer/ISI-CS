            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Harbhajan Singh                           
	Gwalior: Indias leading spinner, offie Harbhajan Singh, may not figure in the XV for the third and final ODI against South Africa, in Motera, if Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. take an unbeatable lead here itself.         
	The second match of the series is scheduled for Wednesday and the five selectors are expected to have a tele-conference after it gets over.         
	Much, I suppose, will depend on the result of the ODI in Gwalior... Should the South Africans draw level, then Harbhajan is almost certain to be there for the final match. Otherwise, theres no guarantee, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Harbhajan made himself unavailable for the first two ODIs on account of sister Sandeep Kaurs wedding last Saturday.         
	Nobody will go on record, but the selectors hadnt been very happy with Harbhajans form going into the recent Calcutta Test. The offie, as it turned out, returned match figures of eight for 123 and helped India draw the series and retain the No.1 ranking.         
	For Harbhajan to return, replacement Ravichandran Ashwin would have to be dropped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Global alliance on the anvil
                                                                                                                       7                                      Global alliance on the anvil

	The first global alliance among professional sports clubs is to be revealed with the announcement of a link-up between an Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise and teams from four other continents.         
	This newspaper has learnt that the Rajasthan Royals, captained by Shane Warne and winners of the inaugural IPL in 2008, are in advanced stages to sign partnership deals with teams from England, South Africa, Australia and the West Indies.         
	Middlesex, Leicestershire and Hampshire, Warnes former county, have held talks with the Royals, who are expected to sign a deal with one county over the next couple of days.         
	The move  to be announced next week  fulfils part of the long-term goal to set up business interests around the world with branching out into England, the worlds second biggest cricket economy, a key aim. In the initial phase of the partnership, the clubs will adopt the Royals name during their domestic Twenty20 competition.         
	Global events featuring the five teams will follow with the first due to take place in the United Kingdom this year, possibly at Lords, and others planned in South Africa, Australia and the Middle East. It is believed that, under the terms of the agreement, teams will share income from any global sponsor of the Royals brand and other merchandising opportunities.         
	All teams will be branded with the Royals logo and kits will be standard. Future opportunities are likely to include talent sharing among the group.         
	The agreement is believed to be the first of its kind among elite professional clubs. Other sports, such as football and basketball, have explored the idea but never managed to settle on an agreed business model. Ajax, the Dutch football giants, own talent feeder clubs around the world but they operate on the fringes of their respective domestic leagues.         
	The Royals deal follows last weeks announcement that all 60 matches of this years IPL will be streamed live on YouTube.         
	The opportunity to create a global brand is a unique one across all sports, and will enable us to take advantage of the changing landscape in cricket, not least in the areas of marketing and talent development, said Sean Morris, the English chief executive of the Royals.         
	The Royals will hope the deal will expand their supporter base and enable them to become the first IPL team to cash in on the worldwide Indian community. They were the first team to play overseas last year, in South Africa, and then later at Lords, against Middlesex. The phases of the Twenty20 calendar will give the Royals exposure in different parts of the world for about 80 per cent of the year.         
	The challenge for the Royals will be to convince supporters to buy into a team brand that is only two years old. The Champions League Twenty20 in India last year proved how difficult it is for teams to crack an alien market (matches featuring non-Indian sides were poorly attended). So it remains to be seen if fans in the West Indies will buy into Rajasthan just because their local side sport the Royals name.         
	For the county, this could offer the potential to develop financially in India and for the players, it opens up the possibility of Twenty20 deals around the world. For non-internationals, who do not have to be signed via the lottery of an auction, it will almost certainly ease the passage to the IPL.

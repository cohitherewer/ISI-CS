The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal selector walks out 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bengal selector walks out 
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Calcutta/Guwahati: National womens selector and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) representative Mithu Mukherjee staged a walkout from a womens Zonal Cricket Academy (ZCA) meeting in Guwahati on Thursday disapproving the selection of players.         
	According to zonal convenor and Assam Cricket Association secretary Bikash Baruah, Mukherjee walked out without signing the list of 24 selected players for the ZCA camp to be held in Cuttack from June 1-30, after four other states did not approve of her demand for inclusion of seven players from Bengal.         
	Her behaviour was unbecoming of a national selector. We are lodging a complaint against her with the BCCI. We have already informed the BCCI CAO Ratnakar Shetty about the development, Baruah added.         
	Back in Calcutta, Mukherjee didnt hide her feelings. How can Tripura and Bengal have the same number of players at the camp? Bengal are the most successful and should have the maximum representation         
	I dont believe in quota system and Baruah was trying to do exactly that. Ill report all this to CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, she said.         
	Paramita Roy, Neha Maji, Madhumanti Bhattacharjee, Annesya Moitra, Archana Das have been selected from Bengal.

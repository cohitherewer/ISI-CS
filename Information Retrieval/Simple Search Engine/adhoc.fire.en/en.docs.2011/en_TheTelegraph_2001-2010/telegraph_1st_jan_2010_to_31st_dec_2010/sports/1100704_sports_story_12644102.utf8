The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag is our best off-spinner: Bedi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sehwag is our best off-spinner: Bedi
                      
	Mumbai: Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi said that Virender Sehwag, is the best off-spinner in the Indian team.         
	I think Sehwag is probably the best off-spinner in the Indian team. He has a clean action and also spins the ball, said Bedi indirectly taking a dig at star spinner Harbhajan Singhs action.         
	I think every team has at least 2-3 chuckers. It makes me sick to see somebody bowling a dart ball at 90 kmphs per hour and running around the ground in celebration, Bedi said at the second Dilip Sardesai Memorial Lecture here on Saturday.         
	(Upcoming) Spinners have some role models. If you get rid of these, youll get a clean action, he said referring to the likes of Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Why cant we have bowlers like Anil Kumble or Shane Warne? Ive never seen better than S. Venkatraghavan or Erapalli Prasanna, he added. Bedi said he was concerned that while BCCI has banned 132 spinners with suspect action in domestic cricket, he had heard about no such steps from countries like Australia, and South Africa.         
	We need to take collective responsibility to eradicate the ills of the game, he added. Asked to explain the doosra, Bedi, in a veiled dig at Muralidharan, said it was an illegitimate delivery coming from a man with a flawed action.         
	What would you call another man in a womans life. Are they accepted? Cricket is a very social game. Doosra is not acceptable. It is an illegitimate delivery coming up from a man with a wrong action, he said.         
	Talking about Sardesai, named as the renaissance man of Indian cricket by former selection panel chief Vijay Merchant, Bedi said he was surprised that with all the knowledge and keenness he possessed, he was never chosen as a national selector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumble: Bad start hurt us
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumble: Bad start hurt us
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble said that their failure to get the momentum in the first six overs of the match, along with poor bowling led to their defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden on Sunday.         
	A total of 135 was not the best score on this pitch. We had to really bowl well and get some early wickets. That did not happen. That probably helped the Knight Riders get away with the game, Kumble said.         
	We did not get the momentum in the first six overs. Probably that cost us the game. We lost three wickets as well inside six overs. (Jacques) Kallis and (Rahul) Dravid were putting together a partnership but after Dravid got out, we just lost the momentum.         
	Kumble was all praise for Kallis.         
	He batted really well to get us to 135. It was a decent score but not good enough. We lost too many wickets early on that probably pushed us back.         
	Kumble supported Kallis role. Thats the game he plays. We dont want to change the way he plays.         
	Kumble said the wicket was slow, but didnt wish to offer any excuses.         
	The ball was not coming on to the bat.         
	When you have 135 runs on the board and your opponents get off to a good start, its not easy to get back the momentum. I dont like to give excuses, we played poor cricket.

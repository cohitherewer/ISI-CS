The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies hit India for a six
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies hit India for a six
  - Batsmen fall to pace and bounce Jadeja concedes 38 in 2 overs
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Bridgetown: A perfect start for one, a perfectly haunting beginning for another.         
	Clearly, on Friday, theres little that Australia could have done better. Equally, India couldnt have done worse. That being the reality, Mahendra Singh Dhonis team got flogged by 49 runs in their opening Super Eight fixture of the World Twenty20.         
	With three strong performances on the trot, Australia have quickly become the side to watch in the most prized T20 tournament. And, to think, Michael Clarke and Co. werent seeded!         
	Its when Australias credentials get questioned that the team responds in stunning manner. That, indeed, has been their story in this third edition.         
	The wicket here, at the Kensington Oval, is very different from the rather sluggish ones offered in St Lucia and Indias batsmen were found wanting.         
	Australias, on the other hand, had a carnival: Smashing 16 sixes, one short of South Africas record.         
	After a potential match-winner (Ravindra Jadeja) turned a confirmed loser, conceding 38 runs in two overs and dropping Shane Watson, of all batsmen, India struggled against the furious pace of Dirk Nannes and the hostility of Shaun Tait.         
	Dhoni gambled with just three specialist bowlers, fielding Rohit Sharma in place of Piyush Chawla, but was left red in the face as Australia, despite being reined in towards the close, still managed a pressure-creating 184 for five.         
	Rohit finished as the sides top scorer (79 not out in 46 balls, 4x4,6x6), but thats another matter.         
	That Dhoni chose to field also surprised many, including Clarke. Defending the move, Dhoni said: We have the firepower to chase down big totals, but things didnt work out... Batsmen at the start tried to counter fire with fire, but that didnt work... Initially, we needed to be careful as pulling doesnt come naturally...         
	Its significant, perhaps, that each of the first four batsmen fell to deliveries bowled in excess of 91mph.         
	The shot selection left a lot to be desired and Dhonis mates didnt follow what he holds dear  that youve got to be smarter than the opposition. Otherwise, its funeral time.         
	A few things went wrong... You cant spoonfeed everything, Dhoni pointed out, accepting that Australia built on the momentum.         
	Harbhajan Singhs maiden in the innings very first over was forgotten as the negative feats began to take centre stage. For example, Jadeja going for a six in six consecutive balls  three in his opening over, three in the second.         
	Cricket is all about learning from mistakes... We have it in us to come back strongly... Weve done it in the past and were capable of doing it again and again, Dhoni maintained, showing little emotion.         
	The defeat, though, has hurt the captain. Now, its a test both for him and the team.         
	One has to have the balance emotionally... The swings dont help, Dhoni told The Telegraph the other day. Hell be looking to take comfort from that philosophy.         
	Clarke didnt go overboard, but quipped that the match had actually been easy, because he didnt have to bat. He kept pushing himself down the order, allowing the big-hitters to take guard.         
	If we keep putting such totals on the board, then, with the attack weve got, teams will find it hard to beat us, Clarke warned.         
	Commenting on Australias strategy of bowling short, Clarke said: More than the bowling of bouncers, the execution of the next delivery has been spot on... That next ball is very important...         
	With MoM David Warner (72 in 42 deliveries, 2x4, 7x6) by his side, at a media conference, Clarke pointed out that he (Warner) and Watson were the worlds best openers in T20.         
	On form, at least, few will disagree         
	Indias next match, against the temperamental West Indies, is on Sunday.

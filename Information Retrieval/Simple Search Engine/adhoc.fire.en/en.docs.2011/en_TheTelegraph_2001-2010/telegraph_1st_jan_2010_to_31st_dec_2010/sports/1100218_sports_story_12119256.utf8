The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The reign depends on rain
                                                                                                                       7                                      The reign depends on rain
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Calcutta: Until Wednesday, Amit Mishra had spent the most part of the Jaypee Infratech Cup in hibernation. The leg spinner generated a frisson of excitement at the Eden, on Day IV, with his craft and charisma that put India on the path to retaining the No.1 spot till rain and bad light threatened to throw a spanner in the works.         
	Mishra ended a listless streak with a double strike which proved that he is bound to call the shots. If Graeme Smiths departure had started the slide, the return of Jacques Kallis ten balls before the forced close has already raised visions of a series-levelling victory. Of course, if the weather holds true.         
	The forecast for Thursday, though, is encouraging, and that should allow Gary Kirstens men a good nights sleep.         
	A 93-minute delayed start and two stoppages resulted in only 157 minutes of play and a loss of 61 overs. South Africa still need 232 runs  with seven wickets remaining  to avoid an innings defeat.         
	Yet again, Hashim Amla (49 batting), with his patience and reliability, could become the thorn in Indias flesh. Theres a question mark over Zaheer Khans fitness, but Mishra (2/15) and Harbhajan Singh have bowled well enough in the second innings for sentiments to turn bullish.         
	The South African top-order, so far, hasnt shown the resilience and dependability needed to play out the remaining sessions. Add to it the pressure that can only mount with every passing minute and the vocal Eden Gardens crowd.         
	The teams have shown totally different mindsets so far. While, from the first day, India played with an attitude that the Test has to be won, South Africa have been defensive, knowing a draw would suffice. The visitors became more circumspect as the Test wore on and India tightened their grip.         
	Dhoni made his intentions clear by opening the bowling with Harbhajan in the second innings. It surprised the South Africans who werent expecting this, given the overcast conditions at the start.         
	The Indians were alive with the challenge. Harbhajan got enough drift in the air and turn and bounce from the wicket to trouble the batsmen. Mishra chose to put his disappointment in the series behind with perfect line and length.         
	It was widely believed that Mishra, who took seven wickets on his debut Test against Australia, had been sorted out. But Wednesday proved otherwise.         
	South Africa never looked in their elements. Zaheer almost got Alviro Petersen with a full-pitched delivery that he played away from his body. V.V.S. Laxman dived full length to his right at second slip but it was too far; a third slip would have taken it comfortably.         
	The alarm bells had started to ring. But Smith and Petersen were hell bent on surviving the one-hour opening session when Mishra struck with his first ball. He made Smith play the leg break with the turn to trap him in front.         
	Harbhajan, at the other end, was also on a roll. In the first over after lunch, he nearly got Amla when he swept a fullish delivery. In the next over, he met with success. The ball turned sharply across the bat and pad of Petersen and Badrinath held on smartly at forward short leg.         
	The pressure mounted with Harbhajan bowling an inspiring spell. In the next over, he again succeeded in getting an inside edge, this time off Amla, but Murali Vijay was slow to react. Eden had erupted and Dhoni and Co. had smelled blood.         
	Amla and Kallis tried to provide some stability with a 57-run partnership for the third wicket. Zaheer was taken off after a one-over third spell because of a tightening of his quadriceps. Ishant failed to do enough in his place, and Amla used the sweep to negate Harbhajans turn.         
	A little later, with Mishra back, the breakthrough was achieved. He started with a maiden to Amla and, in his second over, got one to turn across Kalliss bat, more than he had expected. As the batsman pushed forward, the snick settled in Dhonis gloves.         
	It was 111 for three, and South Africa had suffered their biggest blow. Four balls later, the umpires called bad light. Play resumed after tea only to be called off in three minutes.         
	Thursday, though, will be different. The Proteas will have to be wary of not just the bowlers but the crowd, too.   
	The fifth day rsquo;s play is scheduled to begin at 8.45am

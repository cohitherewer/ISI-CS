  - Ricky gets into argument with umpires over referral             Ricky Ponting                           
	Wellington: Brendon McCullum changed his tactics to produce a superb innings that allowed New Zealand to take their battle with Australia into a fifth day, in the first Test.         
	Standing up to fierce winds gusting up to 120kph, McCullum smothered his attack-first mentality and overcame a distracted Australian side to finish unbeaten on 94.         
	The same winds then caused Australia captain Ricky Ponting to get into an argument with the on-field umpires and hold up the game for several minutes.         
	Disturbed by the wind, the virtual-eye cameras could not provide the actual trajectory of the ball and that infuriated Ponting who kept arguing with the umpires.         
	The problem started when Nathan Hauritzs leg-before appeal against McCullum was turned down by umpire Asad Rauf, prompting Ponting to seek a video referral. But with the cameras failing to project the accurate path of the ball, third umpire Aleem Dar upheld Raufs decision.         
	McCullum built on the work of Daniel Vettori, who produced a committed 77, and took the hosts further ahead during their follow-on.         
	By stumps on a day curtailed by rain, light and regular interruptions caused by the gale, their advantage stood at 67.         
	It is not much, but some more wet weather is predicted on the final morning, giving them a chance of saving the game.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2 rookies set for debut
                                                                                                                       7                                        2 rookies set for debut
            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla                           
	Calcutta: Two players are set for their senior Bengal debut against Tripura in the East Zone leg of the Vijay Hazare Trophy match in Cuttack on Wednesday.         
	Under-19 captain Sudip Chatterjee and under-22 captain Arnab Nandi will be included in the playing XI that has a mix of youth and experience. The match will be played at the Ravenshaw College ground.         
	The wicket has a fair sprinkling of grass but that is not bothering Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Co. Were not taking Tripura lightly. The Tripura of today cannot be compared to what they were five/six years ago One good spell or a breezy innings can change the complexion of the match in the shorter format, said Shukla.         
	Pacer Sayan Sekhar Mondal is down with fever and that has rendered him uncertain. If he fails to make it, Sourav Sarkar will take his place.         
	Bengal have been runners-up for the last two years in the tournament having lost to Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu in the finals.         
	Sreevats Goswami and Subhomoy Das will open the innings while Avishek Jhunjhunwala or Sudip will take the No.3 slot. An early dismissal could send in Avishek but Sudip will take the field if Bengal begin with a bang.         
	Manoj Tiwary and Shukla will follow. Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda will open the bowling.         
	Meanwhile, Bengal will be bolstered by the return of Wriddhiman Saha, who was dropped from the squad for the second Test against South Africa. The wicketkeeper will join the squad before the second match on Friday.         
	As decided earlier, Sourav Ganguly will also be available from the second match onwards.         
	LIKELY BENGAL XI         
	Sreevats Goswami, Subhomoy Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Manoj Tiwary, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sudip Chatterjee, Arnab Nandi, Sayan Sekhar Mondal/ Sourav Sarkar, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Iresh Saxena.

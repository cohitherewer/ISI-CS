                                                                                                                       7                                      Win the Cup for   a fat bonus
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Johannesburg: The United States football team that held England to an unexpected 1-1 draw in the Group C match on Saturday, have been promised a bonus of $20 million by their national federation if they manage to defy the odds and win the World Cup.         
	The money, according to a football official from the US, would equally be divided among the 23 players in the squad. The promised payout is perhaps one of the most lucrative bonus schemes in the history of the World Cup. Even favourites Spain have reportedly offered a bonus of $700,000 if Fernando Torres and company can take the Cup home.         
	Brazil have offered even less to the players. The Brazilian footballers have been promised $350,000 each if they win the World Cup after a gap of eight years.         
	The German football federation is understood to have agreed to pay a bonus of $300,000 per player for a victory in the final with lesser amounts for reaching different stages. The England players are expected to receive a huge amount for a title triumph but the actual amount has been kept as a closely guarded secret.         
	The World Cup winners will earn $30m from Fifa in prize money, while the runners-up will win $24m, and all the participating teams will receive $8m each. Clubs who have contributed players to teams competing in the World Cup will get $1600 per day, per player. This payment was agreed with clubs, who have promised not to pursue any claims or compensation through civil courts, but only through Fifa or the Court of Arbitration of Sports.         
	The four participating teams in the semi-finals will get $20 million, and quarter-finalists teams will get $18 million. At the same time, each of the 32 qualifying teams will receive $1 million as preparation costs.         
	If the US win the World Cup, then US federation is committed to putting as much as two third of the prize money straight into the players pockets.         
	Among the other teams, Nigerias Super Eagles stand to pocket around $4.6 million in allowances, appearance fees and victory bonus should they manage to reach the final. The Nigerias football federation has already promised to pay the players 25 per cent of the money that their team will receive for featuring in the first round of the ongoing World Cup. In addition, the players are also expected to receive a daily allowance of $200 during their stay in South Africa.         
	Defending champions Italy are the only team that has willingly agreed to accept a bonus cut as the players want to contribute money for the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy to be celebrated next year. Should Italy successfully defend the title, each player stands to receive a bonus of $300,000 and the team has decided to donate a total of $725,000 to the celebration committee.         
	Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon said the players feel it is their duty to contribute for the celebration. The committee for unity celebrations has budget problems. Then we, who are a symbol that unites the whole country, have decided that if we get a bonus, each of us will contribute part of the amount, big or small, to emphasise the unity of Italy, Buffon has been quoted saying.

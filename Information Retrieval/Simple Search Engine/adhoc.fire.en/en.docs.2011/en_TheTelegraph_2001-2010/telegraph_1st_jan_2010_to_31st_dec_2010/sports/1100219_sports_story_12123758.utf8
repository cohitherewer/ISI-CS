The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Singh, the king, saves Team Indias crown
                                                                                                                       7                                      Singh, the king, saves Team Indias crown
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                  Harbhajan Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni after the former picked up one of his five wickets at the Eden, on Thursday.   Picture by Gautam Bose      
	Calcutta: At 4.23pm, when most of the half-filled stands had fallen silent dreading the unthinkable, Harbhajan Singh roared. With him the Eden rose, and rose like a crescendo.         
	With clenched fists, he stopped and back-pedalled for a while, before sprinting in a flash. He was screaming, jumping, making wild gestures. The celebratory run seemed unending.         
	After 76 agonising minutes and 126 balls, the last-wicket pair of Hashim Amla and Morne Morkel had been separated. Only nine balls of the mandatory overs were left, even though the match could have continued for another 16 minutes.         
	The ball had landed on the middle stump and just about straightened. Left-handed Morne played slightly outside the line and the ball hit him in line with the middle stump. Harbhajan, his teammates and the Eden appealed! Gone! Umpire Steve Davis dreaded finger was up after a thoughtful moment.         
	Victory was achieved by an innings and 57 runs, and the No.1 ranking stayed with Mahendra Singh Dhonis men. The Jaypee Infratech Cup ended tied 1-1.         
	The denouement was almost a replay of the closing moments of the famous March 2001 Test, in which Australias last man Glenn McGrath was trapped leg before by Harbhajan with just 8.5 overs left. The journey that began under Sourav Ganguly, has come full circle.         
	True India won, but the heart went out to Hashim Amla. He stayed unconquered, batting for 499 minutes. Nothing could disturb his resolve or concentration. He took blows on his body, was teased and tested by Harbhajan and Amit Mishras guile, but was unfazed. Desperate to keep the strike in the closing stages, Amla hung on even as wickets fell at the other end. As he made his way back to the pavilion, undefeated on 123, despite the disappointment, he was his calm, assured self. South Africa lost, but Amla won.         
	There could not have been a better advertisement for Test cricket. Forget the thrills of Twenty20 or one-dayers, the drama, passion and tension witnessed on Thursday, and the preceding days of this Test, should be an eye opener for those vouching for the shorter versions. Test cricket is a class apart.         
	India had 98 overs to get the remaining seven wickets on a bright sunny final day.         
	In the absence of the injured Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan, Mishra (3/78) and Ishant Sharma (2/84) never let the advantage slip. Harbhajan was going for the kill, teasing the batsmen in the air and off the wicket. Mishra was menacing, mixing his leg breaks and googlies intelligently.         
	Amla kept frustrating them. Ashwell Prince stuck around for close to two hours.         
	 The fourth-wicket pair had stitched together 47 runs when Harbhajan struck in his second spell. Prince was done in by flight and the shift in line from leg and middle to outside off. It lured the left-hander who, without getting in line, holed out to mid-off.         
	The breakthrough had been achieved. Mishra then produced a googly to dismiss AB De Villiers in the penultimate over before lunch. The momentum was back with India.         
	JP Duminy was caught in front and Dale Steyn was clueless. The off-spinner switched to round the wicket and struck almost immediately. The ball drifted in, landed on the middle stump and hit him in front. It was 180 for seven, and the end seemed near.         
	Wayne Parnell joined Amla, and given a life by Suresh Raina, held on for 64 balls. The 70-run partnership had provided the Proteas with some hope when Ishant returned to end Parnells vigil.         
	Amla shielded Paul Harris for 36 minutes before Ishant induced a snick. Then it was Morkel who almost took the fight out of the Indians. Both he and Amla defended with soft hands and judged balls convincingly.         
	Dhoni tried every trick up his sleeve, including Sachin Tendulkar for two overs.         
	The desperation grew by the minute as the Indians tried everything to keep Morkel on strike. Virender Sehwag even tried to kick the ball out of the boundary when it had stopped inches short of the rope. The team was penalised five runs for that.         
	Dhoni gave Harbhajan the penultimate mandatory over, and the offie came up with another magic ball to end Morkels resistance. Harbhajan finished on 48.3-23-59-5.

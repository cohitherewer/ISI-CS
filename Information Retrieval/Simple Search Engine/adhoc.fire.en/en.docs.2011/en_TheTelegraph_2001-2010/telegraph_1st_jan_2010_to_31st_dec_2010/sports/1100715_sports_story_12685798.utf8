	London: Australia closed a dramatic second day of the first Test at Lords on 100 for 4 and with a lead of 205 runs over Pakistan after 15 wickets fell on Wednesday.         
	After being bowled out in the first innings for 253, Australia took advantage of good bowling conditions to dismiss Pakistan for 148, with Shane Watson claiming career-best Test figures of five for 40 after ripping through the middle order.         
	Australia took a 105-run cushion into their second innings but Pakistan pacers Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul both grabbed two wickets in the third session to keep their side in the match, giving them a sniff of what would be a first Test win over Australia in 15 years.         
	Simon Katich was 49 not out and nightwatchman Mitchell Johnson unbeaten on 2 when bad light stopped play, with Asif having removed Watson (31) and captain Ricky Ponting (0), before Gul snared Michael Clarke (12) and Mike Hussey (0) in successive balls.         
	Australia lost their final first-innings wicket in the first hour after adding 24 runs to their overnight total of 229 for 9, before Pakistan imploded. Only opener Salman Butt (63) provided any resistance, hitting 12 fours in his 171 minutes at the crease, while captain Shahid Afridi excited spectators briefly with a cameo knock of 31 from just 15 deliveries.         
	Pakistan lost the first wicket in the seventh over when Ben Hilfenhaus, who switched to the Nursery End, moved the ball up the famous Lords slope and got an edge from Imran Farhat (4) through to wicketkeeper Tim Paine.         
	The seamer, playing his first Test in nine months after returning from a knee injury, made a second breakthrough in his final over before lunch as he moved a shorter ball down the slope. Azhar Ali (16) fended at it with the bat away from his body, only to give fellow debutant Paine one of four catches in the innings.         
	Umar Amin (1) fell just after lunch to make the score 54 for 3 and the slide continued, with the surprise bowling of medium-pacer Watson doing most of the damage as he removed brothers Umar (5) and Kamran Akmal (0), Afridi and Butt.         
	Meanwhile Mohammed Aamer was warned by Match Referee Chris Broad for making physical contact with Ponting while crossing paths on Tuesday.           (AGENCIES)

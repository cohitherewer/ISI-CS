The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lady luck smiles on Marchetti
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lady luck smiles on Marchetti
                      
	Irene: Inexperienced Italian goalkeeper Federico Marchetti has finally seen destiny swing his way after years of persecution following a near-fatal car crash and the death of friends.         
	Marchetti, who was playing in the third division when Italy won the World Cup four years ago, will start against New Zealand in Sundays second Group F clash after Gianluigi Buffon suffered a back injury during Mondays 1-1 draw with Paraguay.         
	Marchetti, who spoke to the media for the first time since arriving in South Africa, said his introduction at halftime against Paraguay followed his recovery from a major car crash five years ago.         
	After seeing death so close up, something changes inside of you, he told a room full of journalists. Its hard to explain, its a bad experience that I carry inside of myself. It will always be a part of who I am.         
	Marchetti and two friends who were with him in the car during the crash then felt they had almost a feeling of being persecuted by destiny when two other friends died in a crash and a third died in another incident. As a sign of thanks for his survival he had the Hail Mary inscribed as a tattoo and said he would grab his chance while he could to shine for his country.         
	The 27-year-old is also likely to start when Italy play Slovakia in their final group game on June 24 as 2006 winner Buffon takes time to recover from a small herniated disc.         
	I knew before halftime that I would be going on so I had time to mentally prepare, he said. Im staying calm and Im convinced of my own ability. Everything changes from one day to the next but Ive always kept the faith.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Asian Games silver medallist Abhijit Chadha of Chandigarh, who hit a one-under 71 in the first round, returned with a par round of 72 to clinch the coveted Goodricke East India Stroke Play Championship, here at the RCGC, on Monday.         
	While local favourite Samaresh Sardar returned with a three over 75 (69+75=144) and finished runner-up, first round co-leader, Ashbeer Saini, ended as second runner-up after returning with a card of four-over 76 (69-76=145).         
	Abhijit managed just two birdies on the fourth and 13th hole against bogies on ninth and 14th hole. Samaresh had six bogies (5, 9, 11, 12, 13 amp; 16) against three birdies (3,4 amp; 15). Ashbeer had a disastrous round with seven bogies against one eagle and one birdie.         
	Monday, in fact, saw quite a few ups and downs.         
	Some of the players, who returned the top best 5 cards on the first day, were clueless on the course and had poor scores. Jasjeet Singh (73-83) sighed loudly when he heard the cut went at 13 over. It was the worst card he ever returned.         
	The surprise of the day was Raghav Wahi from Jammu and Kashmir. Wahi returned a one over par 73 consisting of three birdies.         
	Important matches for the Round One of the match play are Abhijit Chadha versus Raghav Wahi, Angad Cheema vs Gagan Verma and Samaresh Sardar vs Jasjeet Singh.         
	The East India Ladies Stroke Play Championship will be starting from Wednesday, and 20-25 girls of the gold division will be playing three rounds.         
	Number one golfer Vani Kapoor of DLF Golf amp; Country Club will be participating, along with Meghna Bal, Shreya Ghei and Shraddhanjali Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were a bit nervous: Dunga 
                                                                                                                       7                                      We were a bit nervous: Dunga 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: One couldnt have certainly missed the triumphant smile on the face of North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun as he walked in for the customary post-match news conference at the Ellis Park on Tuesday. Despite the 1-2 loss against Brazil in Group G of the World Cup, Hun said he was satisfied with his teams performance against the five-time world champions.         
	In fact, between the victor and the vanquished, the latter appeared to be far more cheerful. While Dunga admitted there was scope for improvement, his North Korean counterpart didnt look too perturbed after losing three points.         
	We wanted to prove a point and did so loudly, declared Hun. The match was dubbed as Worlds Cups biggest mismatch. We proved how wrong the idea was.         
	Watched by thousands of fans on a freezing night when temperature touched one degree, Brazil were expected to run over their rivals but found the going tough against a disciplined and well drilled North Korean defence.         
	For 55 minutes, Brazil encountered some dour defending from their Asian rivals before Maicon and Elano ensured full points. Maicon made the breakthrough with a superb shot from an acute angle and then Elano added the second.         
	I dont know what the world media feel, but we know our football, said Hun. The Brazilian team is obviously very strong and though we couldnt win, I believe our players fought very well against such an established side, the coach said.         
	Though North Korea employed a defensive tactics, Hun said with little luck his team could have won the match. We had to wait till the last minutes to score but in the first half the players really carried our plan. The Brazilians are usually strong on the wings. They also have players who possess individual brillliance. We were able to thwart them, said the coach.         
	While Hun rejoiced the narrow defeat, Dunga had too many problems. With Gilberto Silva and Felipe Melo anchoring the midfield more in a defensive manner, it was left to Kaka and Robinho to do the attacking on their own. I agree Kaka could have been better, said Dunga, who sounded far less defiant than he was before the match. He (Kaka) was expected to come off, he hasnt played a full game for five months (because of injury) so I put on Nilmar to give more velocity, and replaced Elano with Daniel as he is a similar player with a long shot.         
	We were bit nervous against the Koreans, after all it was our first match. There is anxiety after a long period of training, he said. All of us are hoping for a better game next time. Its difficult to play against a defensive team like North Korea but in the second half we had more speed, our passes were perfect, especially when Maicon got the ball and created opportunities.         
	During the first half we didnt have the right game mechanism, it came later, said the captain of the 1994 World Cup winning team.         
	Despite a spirited show by the North Koreans, Maicons fantastic strike that provided Brazil the lead was the talking point. Later, the defender said he wasnt sure about scoring the goal initially.         
	I couldnt reach the ball, he said. But I stretched myself and said to myself Ill shoot. Im happy with my goal, I thought about all the things Ive been through to reach this moment, to play in a World Cup, said Maicon.

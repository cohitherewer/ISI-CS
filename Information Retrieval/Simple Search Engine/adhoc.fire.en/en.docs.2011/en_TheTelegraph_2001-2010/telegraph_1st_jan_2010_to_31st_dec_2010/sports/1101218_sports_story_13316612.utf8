The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cheteshwar has an outside chance
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cheteshwar has an outside chance
    - World Cup probables Saha may be lone Bengal representative           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be captaining India in a 50-over World Cup for the first time                                 
	Calcutta: Cheteshwar Pujara, thus far seen as a Test specialist, stands an outside chance of being named among the 30 probables for the 2011 World Cup.         
	Pujaras in the reckoning, thats for sure. Id say he has an outside chance of making it, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Friday, on the eve of the selection, in Mumbai.         
	One learns that no real surprise is on the cards.         
	Besides the 18 who featured in the five-match ODI series against New Zealand, the following will/could be there: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag, Ishant Sharma, Pragyan Ojha; Amit Mishra, Piyush Chawla, Abhimanyu Mithun, Pujara, Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane.         
	As of now, it looks tough for Manoj Tiwary and Ashok Dinda to make it. If they dont, then Wriddhiman Saha is going to be the lone representative from Bengal.         
	Unless theres a change in thinking, Saha and Parthiv Patel will be the only keepers besides regular captain Dhoni.         
	It does appear that Dinesh Karthik has run out of luck.         
	Dhoni, Sachin, Sehwag, Harbhajan, Ishant and Ojha had been rested versus New Zealand, a series won 5-0 under stand-in captain Gautam Gambhirs leadership.         
	The probables have to be pruned to 15 by January 19, exactly one month before the opening match  India-Bangladesh in Dhaka.

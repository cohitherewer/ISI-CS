The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Men to watch
                                                                                                                       7                                      Men to watch
                      
	Kolkata Knight Riders               
	Sourav Ganguly: The Kolkata Knight Riders captain has been in good form this season and it is important that the southpaw gets runs at the top for another good start. It will help the team find momentum and also make the middle-orders task easier. A good total becomes more essential on account of the poor performance by the bowlers.               
	Chris Gayle: His hurricane knock against the Kings XI Punjab had set up the match for the Knights before they let it slip away. His ability to turn the tide even after a slow start, as witnessed in the last match, makes him very dangerous. He can massacre any attack with his brute power.         
	And dont forget, he has the experience to guide the side in a crisis. Wednesday could again be his day.               
	Shane Bond: The New Zealander is the sole exception among the Knights pacers in that he is the only one to have made a mark this season. The team will obviously be looking up to him for an early breakthrough against the power-packed DareDevils top order. An inspirational spell may also set the pace for the Knights in the do-or-die clash.               
	delhi DareDevils               
	Gautam Gambhir: Hampered by injuries, the Delhi DareDevils captain hasnt had a great tournament so far and might just choose Wednesdays match at the Eden Gardens to get back among runs.         
	A solid opening partnership will make things easy for the side that have been improving with every game.               
	Virender Sehwag: You can never rule him out! With the ability to single-handedly demolish any attack, his swashbuckling style remains the biggest worry for the opposition. His aggressiveness can spell doom for a Knights side struggling with bowling. The firm nature of the Eden wicket might be to his liking. Hes hungry to contribute and the DareDevils will be hoping that he joins the party soon.               
	Amit Mishra: With 14 wickets from nine matches, at an economy of 6.94, he is the DareDevils most successful bowler so far. The leg spinner would be determined to prove himself after being overlooked for the World Twenty20.         
	Hes in terrific form and will prove this to the cricketing observers, said DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gangjee shares third spot
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gangjee shares third spot
  - German Marcel Siem leads the pack with eight-under 64       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Rahil Gangjee                                 
	Gurgaon: The Calcutta-based Rahil Gangjee stole the thunder from his illustrious compatriots to emerge the unlikely Indian hero as he was tied third on Day One of the Avantha Masters.         
	While Gangjee, with a dazzling five-under 67, is three shots off the lead with six others at the DLF Golf and Country Club, here, on Thursday, Germanys Marcel Siem squeezed six birdies and an eagle in an eight-under 64 to earn a one-shot lead over Chinese Taipeis Chan Yin-shin.         
	I am happy with my opening day performance, said Gangjee. Thats the way I wanted to play and it went off well, he added.         
	The 32-year golfer, who won his last big title way back in 2004 when he bagged the Volkswagen Masters in China, said he wanted to focus on one shot at a time. For the past four months, I have been concentrating on one shot at a time. It has certainly helped me to do well today (Thursday). My strategy would remain the same in the next three days also, he added.         
	Last week (at the Asian Tour International), I was rusty. I actually planned to start with a tour event in Dhaka but I took ill and began last week in Bangkok. Now I am feeling fine and the rust is gone, said Gangjee.         
	It was a rather disappointing day for the rest of the Indians in the fray. Gaganjeet Bhullar and C. Muniyappa were tied 19th, while Jeev Milkha Singh, Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa all turned in identical even-par 72 to lie tied at 57 .         
	Bhullar was full of praise for Marcel Siem. Eight-under on this course is fantastic, he said. The course was playing tough. The ball is not running much. I could have got five-under but missed a couple of close ones, he added.         
	Bhullar said he was not disappointed by his opening day performance of three-under. The Bangkok win has not put me under pressure. I am motivated by it. As for my game, it is getting better and I am looking forward to a good week.         
	Muniyappa, coming to the DLF after his amazing triumph at the Indian Open last year, said: Im quite pleased with how Ive played today (Thursday) as like Ive said, I just recovered from my food poisoning and to open my campaign today like how I did, I cant really ask for more.         
	Among other Indians, 2008 Indian Masters winner SSP Chowrasia was tied 74th after going one-over 73, while European Tour regular Shiv Kapur was languishing at tied 111st after stuttering to four-over 76.

	Dhaka: Alastair Cook hit a second successive century and Kevin Pietersen struck an unbeaten 74 on Wednesday as England crushed Bangladesh by nine wickets in the second and final Test to sweep the series.         
	Skipper Cook (109 not out) and Pietersen added 167 for the unfinished second wicket to help England comfortably achieve a 209-run target on the fifth day.         
	England, who won the opening Test by 181 runs in Chittagong, also completed a double under Cook following their victory in the preceding one-day series.         
	The England captain hit 11 fours in a 156-ball knock for his 12th Test hundred.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussie, SA bowlers better than Indians: Rahim
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangladesh wicket-keeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim, who scored an aggressive 114-ball 101, stood out among the ruins as his team succumbed to a 113-run defeat against India in the first Test on Thursday. Speaking to the media after the match he said that the fact that they were almost able to scalp 20 Indian wickets was a positive aspect.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Feelings after hitting maiden Test hundred         
	Its a nice feeling to score maiden Test hundred, and it was all the more special because it came against the No. 1 Test side in the world.         
	On the Indians sledging him         
	They were at me throughout, with most of the sledging coming from Sreesanth.         
	Teams approach on the fifth day         
	We approached the day with a positive mindset, and we wanted to win. So we just wanted to stick to our natural game. We dont know if a change in the approach could have done any difference. But as I said earlier, we lost too many wickets in the first session.         
	On Indian bowling         
	They are a very good batting unit, their batsmen are better. Their bowlers are also good but not in the same league as the Aussies or the South Africans.         
	Positives from the Test         
	We have acquired some positives despite the defeat. We nearly took 20 Indian wickets.

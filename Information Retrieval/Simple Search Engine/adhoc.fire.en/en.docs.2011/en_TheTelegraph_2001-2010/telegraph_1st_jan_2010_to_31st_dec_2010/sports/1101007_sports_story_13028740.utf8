	Saurabh was provisionally suspended by the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) after he tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.         
	He said that he was desperate to win the gold and prove that he was innocent. I was not in the perfect frame of mind when I took the field. But I gave my best and am looking to win a medal on Thursday, Saurabh said.         
	Bengals Prashant Karmarkar gave India its first medal in para-sport by winning the 50m swimming bronze on Wednesday.

	Ashwini Ponnappa and Aparna Balan got the better of Carissa and Harvey Caroline 21-11, 21-13 in womens doubles while the reliable mixed doubles pair Jwala Gutta and V. Diju demolished Martyn and Thomas Sarah 21-8, 21-5.

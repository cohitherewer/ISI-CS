The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni is out for 10 days
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni is out for 10 days
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Team India and Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be out of action for at least 10 days after sustaining a bad bruise on his right arm from a Shane Bond snorter on Tuesday.         
	Team owner Gurunath Meyappan, however, informed the media that the captains injury will be assessed in Chennai on March 21 before taking a call. In Dhonis absence, Suresh Raina will be leading the side and Parthiv Patel will be the wicket-keeper.         
	The Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni will not be playing in the two matches  against the Delhi Daredevils at the Kotla on March 19 and against the Kings XI Punjab in Chennai on March 21.         
	He will be returning to Ranchi and will be back in Chennai on March 21. After assessing his injury, we will take a call, Meyappan said.         
	He also informed that Dhoni will be paid his full salary. Meyappan was accompanied by teams director of cricket operations V.B. Chandrasekhar.         
	Dhoni was hit on the arm by a rising delivery from Bond during Chennai Super Kings innings but continued batting, scoring an unbeaten 66 off 33 balls to lead his team to a match-winning 164.         
	He kept wickets as well during the Knight Riders unsuccessful chase but was seen wearing an ice pack during the post-match presentation ceremony. Later, he had an X-ray and an MRI scan done at a city hospital.         
	Although the team management is expecting Dhoni to play against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on March 23, it is unlikely that the India captain will take any chance before being completely fit.         
	With the ICC World T20 starting next month (team selection likely on March 26), Dhoni wouldnt want to risk aggravating his injury.         
	Dhoni left the team hotel in the afternoon, for hometown Ranchi, in a Scorpio.

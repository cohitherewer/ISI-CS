The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger unfazed by lack of practice

	Akron: Tiger Woods has always tried to maintain tight control over every aspect of his game but he conceded on Wednesday that his troubled private life had taken its toll on his practice time.         
	The American world No.1s marriage has been in tatters since revelations of his serial philandering emerged at the end of last year and, with a divorce looming, he has tried to see his two young children whenever possible.         
	I havent had as much time to practise overall with the kids, Woods, 34, said while preparing for this weeks WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club.         
	Life has changed. I havent practised as much as I used to, nor should I. My kids are more important.         
	Asked if he had any concerns over his limited practice time, Woods replied, No. Just got to be more efficient with what I do and when I do it.         
	The greatest player of his generation, the 14-times major winner has lost the aura of invincibility he once enjoyed.         
	After taking a self-imposed five-month exile in a bid to repair his marriage to his Swedish wife Elin, Woods returned to the PGA Tour in April but has yet to win in seven starts.         
	Its not only concentration, but also preparation and then also my preparation out here (at events), he said of his 2010 season. People have been wanting more of my time.         
	Ive had more things going on once Im at a tournament site than I have in the past, and for different reasons. Thats obviously taken a little bit of a toll on my preparation. But things are starting to normalise, and thats been a good sign.         
	Woods, who triumphed six times on last years PGA Tour, said he did not feel any sense of urgency to return to winning ways.         
	Ive been through periods like this before, he added. Ive just got to keep being patient, keep working, keep building and keep putting the pieces together.         
	When they do fall into place, thats usually when I will win a few tournaments.         
	Woods could have not wished for a happier hunting ground than this weeks par-70 Firestone layout where he bids for a record eighth victory.         
	Ive always liked this type of golf course, he said. It fits my eye ... its not target golf and Ive always liked that. Im looking forward to getting out there.         
	Of late Ive been driving the ball so much better, my iron game has been spotty and I just havent putted well all year, he said.         
	If I clean all that up, hopefully (I can) put together at least these two weeks.         
	Woods is scheduled to tee off with British world No.3 Lee Westwood .           (REUTERS)

    - The BCCI is not for a knee-jerk reaction           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dhoni                                 
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has, as of now, no plans of asking the national selectors to split the captaincy.         
	Where were concerned, (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni will remain at the helm in all three forms. At this point in time, theres just no question of removing him from the captaincy in ODIs and T20 Internationals, a top official told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday afternoon, he added: Of course, like the rest of the country, even were very disappointed with another failure at a world event, but that doesnt mean weve got to respond in a totally knee-jerk manner...         
	Dhoni got the top job in T20 Internationals and ODIs in September 2007 and, 14 months later, after Anil Kumbles retirement, became the Test captain, too.                     
	Best remembered, so far, for winning the inaugural World Twenty20, Dhoni has taken India to the No.1 ranking in Tests. For a while, wed been at the top in ODIs as well.         
	With Dhoni and the other seniors getting a break, rested from the tour to Zimbabwe, Suresh Raina has been placed in the hot seat.         
	Dhoni, then, will be back at the helm when the squad for next months Asia Cup, in Sri Lanka, is picked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo set to clinch I-League 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo set to clinch I-League 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dempo Sports Club, inarguably the most consistent Indian club team in the last five years, are all set to win back the coveted I-League title after a gap of one year. It will need a miracle for any other side to snatch it away from Armando Colacos boys.         
	For the record, Dempo had lost out to Churchill Brothers last year. Dempo, who are on 47 points from 23 matches, now have three matches left  two at home against Air India and Pune FC, while one away against Lajong FC.         
	Theoretically, Churchill Brothers, who have 32 points from 20 games (as they are playing in the AFC Cup), can reach up to 50 points if they win all six matches.         
	Therefore to be absolutely sure, Dempo need four points from their next three matches. Save Dempo, none of the other teams can reach 51 points, which stands as the magic figure.         
	If Churchill Brothers lose their next match against Salgaocar (on May 2), then Dempo will just need to get a point against Air India in their next round match (on May 5) at home.         
	As of now, the second-placed Mahindra United can at best get to 47 points if they win their remaining three matches and finish second if Churchill lose a few in between.         
	Similarly, Mohun Bagan who have four matches remaining including three away games (Churchill Brothers, Viva Kerala and Mumbai FC and against East Bengal at home) can at best get to 44.         
	For all practical reasons, Mohun Bagan can finish third in the 14-team table.         
	Armando, however, wanted to play it safe at the post-match press conference. I would still say that we would require four points to be assured of the title, he said.         
	Once Dempo clinch the title, they will be the first team to win four national league titles since its inception (Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have won thrice).         
	Armando has been the most successful Indian coach in the last decade, yet not getting any national assignment hurts him. They (AIFF) told me to write an application... Sorry, I cant write an application to prove my credentials as a coach. My record speaks for itself.         
	Please ask the AIFF officials as to why despite being a Fifa instructor, I have been ignored, he said a touch emotionally.         
	On a different note he had a word of advice for the Calcutta coaches. Please upgrade yourself. Modern football is changing. You need to constantly keep a tab on the latest happenings. Think about international tournaments like AFC Cup, AFC Champions League.         
	I was really disheartened in the manner East Bengal played against Al Nejmeh. Why did they even think of concentrating on local league matches? Also the club officials shouldnt change coaches like they change their T-shirts, said the man who is also the secretary of Dempo.         
	So what is left for him to achieve in the context of Indian football?         
	Doing well in the AFC Champions League. Thats my ultimate dream as a Dempo coach.

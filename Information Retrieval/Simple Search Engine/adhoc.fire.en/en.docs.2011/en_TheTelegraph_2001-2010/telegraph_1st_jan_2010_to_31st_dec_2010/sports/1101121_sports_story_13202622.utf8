The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suraj shines for   Md. Sporting
                                                                                                                       7                                      Suraj shines for   Md. Sporting
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: A 74th-minute strike by Suraj Mondal added leaven to a dry gathering at the Mohammedan Sporting Club ground and also helped his team beat Mohammedan A.C. by a solitary goal in a Calcutta Football League clash, here on Saturday.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting forward, who substituted Mohammed Muktar after half-time, broke the teams three-match losing streak and took the clubs points tally to 22 after 12 matches. Mohammedan A.C, who are facing relegation, remained at six points from 13 ties.         
	Both teams got off playing some wayward football, failing to create any goal-scoring opportunities. Sportings desperation to shake off their inertia was visible in skipper David Mkandawires constant vigil on opponent skipper Olowdni Saheed. The Sporting full back eclipsed Saheed so much so that Mohammedan A.C.s foray into the foes defence was almost nullified.         
	But the second half saw some quick counter-attacks, Mohammedan A.C. initiating the moves early on. Wing-half Md. Shahid ran solo for nearly 30 yards and cut inside nicely. But Sporting custodian Rakesh Prasad easily parried his shot at goal. Next, it was Oladipupo Abiolas turn inside the box when he failed to negotiate the bounce and connect his shot at goal.         
	Mondal, who had replaced Muktar minutes into the second-half, broke the deadlock in the 74 th minute by tapping in from a goal-mouth melee. Mohammedan A.Cs Sanjit Mali failed to intercept a cross from the left and Dipendu Biswas blocked him on the run to leave Mondal steer the ball in.

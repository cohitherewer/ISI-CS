The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cook serves a double 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cook serves a double 
            Scyld Berry                            
	The first Test ended with honours rather more equal than they need have been. Australia, by scoring 107 for one in 26 overs in their second innings, regained some face instead of having it even more sunburnt.         
	Englands 517 for one wicket declared was still the highest total ever recorded in Test cricket for a completed innings. But it would have been higher and even more embarrassing for Australia if Andrew Strauss had delayed his declaration until tea or shortly afterwards.         
	Australias target was 297 off 41 overs - completely unobtainable, of course, but leaving enough time for Ricky Ponting to get into the series with a nice 51 not out, following his first innings of 10.         
	If England had ploughed on beyond 550, Australia would have been left with 15 to 20 overs: enough time for each of Englands bowlers to have had a spell, not enough for Australias batsmen to score any brownie points.         
	Still, England could take heart from the resilience of their batting, even if their bowling - by the end - appeared little more potent than the home sides. Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott took their partnership from an overnight 121 to 329 by Strauss declaration, and Trott looked rather lovingly at the pitch before tearing himself away.         
	Cook, with his 235 not out, thus became only the fourth England batsman ever to score a Test double-hundred in Australia. Only one of the other three players is still alive, although Graeme Swann would probably contest that description of Paul Collingwood after he dropped a slip catch - offered by Shane Watson - off his bowling.         
	Cook, too, looked as though he could have batted a lot longer. His highest Test score had taken him 428 minutes and come at the healthy lick of 54 runs per 100 balls. The best feature of it - apart from the general resolve and disciplined shot-selection - was that he went after Xavier Doherty and made Australias first-choice spinner look ordinary ahead of the second Test starting in Adelaide on Friday.         
	Cook was a worthy winner of the man of the match award, almost as much for his first innings of 67 which held England together in a crisis, after their captain had gone third ball, as for his second innings harvest.         
	Trotts century was his second in two Ashes Tests, after his debut hundred at the Oval. Some of his open-faced shots behind the wicket on the offside would have got him into trouble on a livelier pitch like Perth - and he was dropped off a sitter to slip by Michael Clarke, when he dabbed at Shane Watson. But his appetite for batting is never anything less than insatiable.         
	There was a third star on the England side as they made their recovery from a first innings deficit of 221 complete: the Barmy Army. The opportunity to poke some fun as the Australians expense - as Englands total reached 400 then 500, but not 550 - was not missed.         
	Chanting, the Barmy Army asked if they could play Australia every week. Then they wondered who was the home side - for home advantage has availed them little.         
	Best of all, they asked Ponting for a wave and - affable soul that Australias captain is at heart - he fell for it, and waved to the serried ranks. A few seconds later he realised his mistake: Rickys in our Army, Rickys in our Army, la, la, la - la, la, la.         
	But Ponting lived to fight another day, after the declaration had allowed him to post an assured half-century, marred only by ducking into Steve Finns third ball of the day after he had spanked the first two for four. It hit Ponting on the left earpiece of his helmet.         
	So, after Australias final little flourish, it was seen that the pitch was the only winner. On the first day 10 wickets had fallen, five wickets on day two, five on day three, then only a single wicket on each of the last two days.         
	May the Adelaide Oval pitch be dissimilar.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

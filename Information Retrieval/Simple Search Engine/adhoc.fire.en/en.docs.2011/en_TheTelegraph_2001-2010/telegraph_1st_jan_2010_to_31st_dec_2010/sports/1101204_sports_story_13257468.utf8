The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Iron Curtain opens to reveal a new Russia
                                                                                                                       7                                        The Iron Curtain opens to reveal a new Russia
    - When fans arrive in 2018, they will find a much-changed country           Owen Slot            Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin with Fifa president Sepp Blatter, in Zurich, on Thursday. (AP)                                 
	Zurich: At about 8.30 Thursday, local time, they were starting to ask: Where is he? Has he arrived?         
	We heard that his plane had indeed touched down. He would be here in threequarters of an hour, half an hour. He is here. Like incumbent royalty, Vladimir Putin flew into Zurich Thursday as if to be crowned. The World Cup was his; he had won it without even being here to play his shots. He just rolled in to town, slagged off the British media again and then got on with the party.         
	You might imagine that there were celebrations on the streets of Moscow Thursday, too, but it was late and dark and uncomfortably cold and so, no, we cannot report in time-honoured fashion that the new host nation was rocking to the World Cup news.         
	Indeed, Russia will challenge England and its preconceptions and its football fans all the way to kick-off time 7 and a half years away. More so than any other World Cup of recent times, Russia will be a trip in to the unknown. Do you know Kazan from Krasnodar? Saransk from Samara? What will you make of Nizhny Novgorod? And are you aware that Yekaterinburg is a city with a population greater than Birmingham (in size, of course, no reference to quality here) and so far from Moscow that it takes more than a day to get there by train?         
	By the time that England have been knocked out of the World Cup, these are the kinds of host cities that will be household names. England will know Kaliningrad for its old town beauty and Nizhny Novgorod for its culture and history and Yekaterinburg, if England ever get there, as the town where Boris Yeltsin came from. And when those despondent England fans troop home, as tradition dictates, a week and a half before the final, what kind of a country will they have found?         
	They will have discovered a country that is old, but that is new to the world. Since its days in the Soviet Union, Russia has never opened its arms to the world like this before. It has never had huge surges of foreigners arrive in its towns, and certainly never with painted faces, flags and an unusual appetite for beer.         
	We are dealing in generalisations here, indeed exactly the kind of generalisations that the Russian bid fought to quell throughout the last few months of competition. But when the victorious Russian bid coin the cliche that their World Cup will be one massive party, the question is: How can they know? How can they know how partial the citizens of Volgograd will be to the prospect of sharing their streets and bars to hoards of foreigners all following the quadrennial dream that football offers of world domination?         
	And are they really as football obsessed as the bid would have us believe? Because attendances have been falling for years. Anything above 10,000 for a Russian Premier League fixture is pretty decent and, though people will point to the Spartak-Chelsea game recently as a sell-out, a better gauge was two days earlier when Dinamo and Lokomotiv Moscow were both playing at home and the numbers were 7,000 and 10,782 respectively.         
	Go to Sochi, another host city, and you will find a summer resort where, for much of the Nineties, they didnt even have professional football. They only now have a second division team playing to crowds of 5,000. Football mad? Pretty sane actually.         
	And when the English fans on their Sochi camp sites want a kickaround, they will have trouble finding the nearby pitches because a) the locals will not be able to speak English, the communication barrier will be immense, and b) there actually arent a lot of pitches.         
	Russia does not have a great sports participation culture. Roman Abramovich is engaged in a huge project funding new AstroTurf facilities around the country, but even his deep pockets will struggle to change a way of life.         
	Yet, it will indeed be a new way of life that we will find in 2018. There will be new stadiums, new airports, new roads, new hotels, new railways, and that day-long trip to Yekaterinburg, they say, will be on a new train that takes half the time. At least, so the promises go.         
	So we will see a new Russia with a new infrastructure. But whatever these airports look like once the wrapping has come off, it will still be fascinating to see what the hosts of Kazan and Krasnodar make of the invading armies tumbling out of them.         
	It is not east meets west. It is: Russia opens its doors, changes the rules and lets hundreds of thousands of punters in for the very first time without any requirement of a visa. It is a first, and not just for the football.                 THE TIMES, LONDON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreesanth is wasting his   talent: Azhar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sreesanth is wasting his   talent: Azhar
                            
	Kochi: Not many have the talent of Sreesanth but the temperamental pacer is wasting himself by not being consistent and fit enough, says former India captain Md Azharuddin.         
	He has got natural swing but I think his talent is totally wasted. I think he needs to understand that he has to deliver and remain fit. So, I do not like to see him waste his talent, Azharuddin told reporters.         
	To be very honest, I think he should use his brain more. With due respect, I think he is a very good bowler. I think he is one of the few bowlers who can swing the ball, he said.         
	Hoping Sreesanth would take his comments in the right spirit, Azharuddin said the spunky bowler needed to work harder. He must not take it in the wrong way. I am saying all this only for his betterment. I think he needs to work harder as he is such a good bowler. Not many bowlers can swing the ball, he said.         
	Sreesanths career has been marred by several disciplinary indiscretions and he has been in the Indian cricket boards firing line for losing his cool too often on the field.         
	Talking about Indias World T20 debacle, Azharuddin feels it is selection blunders and not the IPL or its post-match parties that led to Indias humiliating exit.         
	I think we did not pick the right side. I thought two or three players should have been selected like Robin Uthappa and Pragyan Ojha and others who had really done well. But they were not selected, the cricketer-turned-politician said.           (PTI)

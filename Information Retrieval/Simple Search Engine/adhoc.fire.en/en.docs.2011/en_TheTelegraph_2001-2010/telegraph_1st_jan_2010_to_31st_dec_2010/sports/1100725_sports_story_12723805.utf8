  - Sachin looking forward to grand Opus that has been more than a year in the making       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Colombo: Having carried the weight of a demanding nations expectations for over two decades, Sachin Tendulkar has decided that others, too, must do a bit of weight-lifting!         
	Towards that end, the deluxe edition of Tendulkar Opus, which will hit the stands around the time of the 2011 World Cup, is going to weigh between 35-40 kgs.         
	A couple of people will be needed to lift each copy, Sachin quipped, during an interaction with The Telegraph at the Sinhalese Sports Club on Saturday afternoon.         
	Only 10 such copies are going to be printed (by Kraken Media), and each has already been pre-booked at a whopping $75,000.         
	Of course, thats a steep price, but proceeds from those sales will be set aside for charity... Therefore, its all for a good cause... Im not aware of those 10 buyers, though, Sachin pointed out.         
	Incidentally, no decision has been taken on the charities which stand to gain.         
	Sachin quickly added: Were actually looking at making the book accessible and one way would be to give it to certain libraries across India... A regular edition is also going to be brought out, which will be priced much lower... Im aware of the sentiments of fans.         
	It may even be available on the net.         
	According to Sachin, Muhammed Alis The Greatest: My Story and the late Michael Jacksons Moonwalk inspired him to lend his name to a pictorial collectors item.         
	I have both copies and each one of them is absolutely awesome... Mine is strictly pictorial, the written editorial work limited to the captions, Sachin said.         
	Sachin clarified that not a drop of his blood had been taken for use in the deluxe edition.         
	That bit of news (coming out of the UK) is totally incorrect. A sample of my saliva has been taken, yes, but thats just for the DNA profile which is going to feature in the book... Nothing more.         
	Asked if he was excited, Sachin grinned and replied: Well, yes. Im looking forward to the finished product... Work has been on for over a year.         
	By all accounts, the Tendulkar Opus will be as classy as the icons cricket.

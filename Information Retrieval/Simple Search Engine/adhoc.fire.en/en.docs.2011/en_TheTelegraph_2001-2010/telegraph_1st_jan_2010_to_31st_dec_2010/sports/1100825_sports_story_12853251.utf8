                                                                                                                       7                                      Focus on athletes: Bindra 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indias only individual Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra is sad to note that athletes are the most neglected lot in the run up to the Commonwealth Games (CWG) to be held in the capital from October 3-14.         
	One of the six brand ambassadors of the Games, the crack rifle shooter turned up at the CWG Organising Committee (OC) headquarters, on Tuesday, and instantly became the centre of attention.         
	Calm and composed as he always is, but the tinge of sadness in Bindras voice was clearly evident.         
	 quot;I am here to make a point. Please dont forget the fact that athletes are the most important stakeholders in any sport. Whatever is happening is for the athletes only. So, please focus more on sportspersons and their achievements, quot; he said.         
	The Games, Bindra said, meant a lot to him. quot;I remember taking part for the first time in the Games as a wide eyed 15-year-old kid. Today, I stand here as the brand ambassador of the Games that I am sure will be the best ever in history he said

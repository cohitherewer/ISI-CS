The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eto hattrick in Inter victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eto hattrick in Inter victory
                      
	London: Samuel Eto scored a scintillating hattrick for holders Inter Milan in the Champions League, on Wednesday, but Lionel Messis magic went missing as Barcelona laboured to a draw with their Russian bogey team.         
	While Rafa Benitez celebrated a 4-0 victory over Werder Bremen and his first home win in Europe as Inter coach, Pep Guardiolas Barcelona were forced to scrap for a 1-1 draw at Rubin Kazan in Group D.         
	Manchester United savou-red a rare win in Spain, as briefly reported in Thursdays CM edition, when they beat Valencia 1-0 to go joint-top of Group C with Rangers, 1-0 winners over Bursaspor. Olym-pique Lyon won 3-1 at Hapoel Tel Aviv to lead Group B.         
	While Eto was lighting up the San Siro, Tottenham Hotspurs Rafael van der Va-art chalked up a different kind of triple when he missed a penalty, scored and was sent off in a 4-1 home win against Twente Enschede, taking his side level with Inter at the top of Group A.         
	There was no rivalling Eto for the performance of the night, as the Cameroon striker scored two in a six-minute first half burst, helped set up Wesley Sneijder for Inters third and completed his hat-trick nine minutes from time. Where Inter shone as brightly as Etos brilliant yellow boots, Barcelona struggled with World Player of the Year Messi returning from an ankle injury.         
	FC Copenhagen pushed Barcelona off the top of the group, with striker Dame NDoye returning to haunt his former club Panathinaikos, who had former Arsenal midfielder Gilberto Silva sent off, in a surprise 2-0 away win.         
	With Wayne Rooney sidelined by injury but Rio Ferdinand returning, Uniteds new Mexican signing Javier Little Pea Hernandez came off the bench to break the deadlock with a clinical finish in the 85th minute of an uninspiring match.         
	Roman Pavlyuchenko made no mistake with two spot kicks either side of a goal from Twentes Nacer Chadli and Gareth Bale wrapped up the scoring five minutes from time, with Spurs now level on four points with Inter.         
	In Group B, Schalke 04 netted two late goals in Gelsen-kirchen to beat Benfica 2-0. Lyons 3-1 win over Hapoel Tel Aviv.

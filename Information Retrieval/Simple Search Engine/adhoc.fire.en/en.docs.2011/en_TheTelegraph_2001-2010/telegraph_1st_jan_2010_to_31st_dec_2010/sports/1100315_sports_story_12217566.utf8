	Chennai: Chaminda Vaas (3/21) ripped apart the Chennai Super Kings top-order after Andrew Symonds and Herschelle Gibbs sparkled with the bat as defending champions Deccan Chargers beat the hosts by 31 runs to score their first win in the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL) here Sunday.         
	Symonds and Gibbs weaved together a crucial 95-run partnership for the third wicket to lift the Chargers to a handsome 190 for four. Captain Adam Gilchrist, at the top, and Rohit Sharma, down the order, also contributed in decorating the Chargers innings after winning the toss and electing to bat. The Chargers then restricted the Super Kings for 159 for nine at MA Chidmabaram Stadium. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Albie Morkel were joint top scorers for the hosts.         
	The Chargers never recovered from the early blows from Vaas, who yet again gave his side a superb start by getting rid of the hosts top order. Pragyan Ojha and Symonds took two wickets apiece. The Sri Lankan pacer dismissed Murali Vijay and Suresh Raina in his second over, and returned to get rid of the dangerous Matthew Hayden.         
	The men who followed had hardly settled down when Ojha sent back S. Badrinath to leave the Super Kings innings in tatters at 32 for four.         
	Kemp and Dhoni had an enormous task at hand but all they could manage was a 38-run stand. As the asking rate was jumping up, Kemp stepped out and lifted Ojha for a huge six over long off to break the shackles, but it was the left-arm spinner who had the last laugh as two balls later, he foxed the big hitter and had him stumped.         
	Dhoni had Morkel as his new partner and they were left with no option but to go for the kill. However, the Chargers spinners bowled magnificently and did not let the two big hitters do much damage. Symonds clean bowled Dhoni to make the task all the more difficult for his team. Although Morkel came up with some lusty blows in his unbeaten knock but that proved insufficient.         
	Earlier, Symonds, who scored his second IPL fifty, and Gibbs, joined forces after the Hyderabad outfit had lost two quick wickets, albeit after a fiery start. The two batsmen dug in and placed the defending champions in a position from which their bowlers could fight.

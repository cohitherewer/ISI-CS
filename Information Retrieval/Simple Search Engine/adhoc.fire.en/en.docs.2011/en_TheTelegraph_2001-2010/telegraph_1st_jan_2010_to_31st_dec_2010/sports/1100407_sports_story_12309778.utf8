The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moody still hopes for a semi-final berth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Moody still hopes for a semi-final berth
                      
	Jaipur: Kings XI Punjab may be languishing at the bottom of the points table but their coach Tom Moody has not stopped hoping for a semi-final spot in the Indian Premier League.         
	Defeat after defeat has almost ruled them out of contention, but Moody is still hopeful of making the last-four stage as they prepare to take on the Rajasthan Royals, here, on Wednesday.         
	Our focus is on treating every match separately. We want to do well and at the end of the day, we like to see how close we are to the last-four stage. I feel we can still make it to the semis, Moody said on the eve of the crucial match.         
	The Australian said different factors have contributed to their poor show.         
	Yes, we look better and strong on paper, but we have failed to execute (plans) on the field. There have been various reasons behind it but the biggest one is the injuries and bad form of our stars. But we are happy that we could break our long losing streak, against the Kolkata Knight Riders, and chased down a stiff target, said Moody.         
	If the Kumar Sangakkaras manage a win on Wednesday, they can dent the Royals chances of making the grade.         
	The 2008 champions have bounced back rather well with a thrilling two-run win over the Deccan Chargers on Monday.         
	The return to form of skipper Shane Warne, who, before Tuesday, had managed just two wickets this season, was a major gain from the tie.         
	To keep the Royals in check, Kings XI Punjab will have to get rid of one Yousuf Pathan very early.         
	Moody, however, said the presence of Yousufs brother Irfan in the Punjab side will not help in countering the explosive batsman.           (PTI)

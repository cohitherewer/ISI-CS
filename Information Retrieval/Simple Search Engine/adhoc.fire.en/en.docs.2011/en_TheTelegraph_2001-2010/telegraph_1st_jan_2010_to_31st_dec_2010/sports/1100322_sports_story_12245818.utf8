The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Ridders contract unlikely to be renewed
                                                                                                                       7                                      De Ridders contract unlikely to be renewed
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal authorities are unhappy with coach Phillippe de Ridders handling of the team and it is unlikely that his contract will be renewed.         
	Although a section among the influential officials was of the opinion that De Ridder should be handed the pink slip with immediate effect, a consensus was not reached. With only nine matches being left in the I-League, and the title well out of reach, it didnt make any sense to bring a new coach.         
	If the team doesnt win at least five out of the remaining nine matches and cant ensure a top five finish, De Ridders contract wont be extended. We dont entirely blame him as he didnt get a good team. But the authorities are not happy with his team compositions. Whatever be the situation, not winning for the last 10 matches isnt a good thing, an executive committee member told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	The coach himself feels that fatigue is one of factors for his teams under-performance. We are playing too many matches and players are not getting enough rest. Also I dont have too many replacements for my first team players. It cant get any worse than this. Lets hope we can finish as high as possible.         
	However, De Ridders explanations dont hold good.         
	Meanwhile, former India player Godfred Perreira, who is now the observer-cum-mentor of Air India, said something which wont be music to the ears of the red and gold fans. This is the worst East Bengal team in recent times, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar: NZ a tough side 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar: NZ a tough side 
            A CORRESPONDENT                                  Kumar Sangakkara during a practice session, in Dambulla, on Thursday.       
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara heaped praise on New Zealand, their opponents in the second match of the tri-series, on Friday.         
	Speaking at a media conference on Thursday, Sangakkara said that the Black Caps are always very competitive and other teams should try and emulate their discipline.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On New Zealand         
	They are not really an unknown quantity. The great thing about New Zealand is that they are very competitive. They play very orthodox and structured cricket. Strategies are set and they always try to execute those strategies. Thats the discipline that I think we can all learn from New Zealand. Its very important in T20 and one-day cricket that you apply strategies which everyone understands and everyone can execute. New Zealand, probably, do that best. That makes them a very tough side. They are very talented in batting and bowling, and their fielding is top-class. So it makes them an all-round side. Each time you walk out against them, no matter what the conditions are, its extremely challenging and thats what we enjoy.         
	NZs thrashing of India in the opener         
	They played really well (against India). Bowled a disciplined line and length, especially under lights, which you need to do. I think they enjoyed the conditions. Batting first, they recovered quite well which means their batting is quite formidable as well. So we are going to take it at face value and concentrate mostly on how we play. Everyones fit and ready to go No injury worries and we have the entire squad.         
	What Lankas approach will be         
	Win the toss, to start with. But realistically, we have to be ready to do whatever comes our way. Winning the toss is just a 50-50 affair. Whether you win the toss or not, there is a match to be won. We have just made sure that we talk about things that we can control and we are going to approach each game thinking just like that  play our kind of cricket and stamp our authority as soon as possible. If not, make sure we have back-up plans to get through our batting, especially under lights. But either way, it is going to be a challenge Its not mostly skill, its also about being mentally attuned to whats happening there and being ready with more than one plans.         
	Team selection         
	It depends on the opposition we are playing. Depending on that, we will pick one or the other. We got Rangana Herath in the wings as well. So each time we will make sure that we play the right combination for the opposition. My theory is that you play your best bowlers, but if all of them are bowling well, then you choose the two best or the one best suited to counter that particular opposition.         
	The wicket         
	The commentators were saying there was bounce and not much swing under lights. During the day, there was more swing; in the night there was more nibble off the track. I think its always the nibble off the track that is more difficult to play. For swing, you can see it out of the hand, you can see it in the air and decisions can be made early as a batsman, whether you can play it or leave it. Seam off the wicket is another story where you have to make your decision very late. They (New Zealand) exploited that nibble. Also, they have tall bowlers and so they get the bounce. Thats a reality we have to accept and get on with it.         
	Sri Lankas prospects in the tri-series         
	We have to wait and see. Playing in conditions like this is very good for us because when it is a challenge, you got to relish it, you got to accept it and win it. The harder the things you have to do, the faster the improvement comes. For us, that is how we are going to look at this tournament. We want to win it, we are up against two very good sides and conditions make the sides even.         
	If there are any complaints about the schedule         
	We have less cricket than India this year. Our itinerary is a bit more structured, which is good for the players. But the workloads are quite high. We have to basically make decisions on how many players we are going to play in particular formats. These decisions become crucial.

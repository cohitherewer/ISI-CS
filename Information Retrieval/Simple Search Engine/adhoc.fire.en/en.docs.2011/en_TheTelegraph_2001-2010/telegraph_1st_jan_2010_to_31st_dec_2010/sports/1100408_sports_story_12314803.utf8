	Calcutta: India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia on Wednesday became a proud father of twins with his wife Madhuri giving birth to a girl and a boy at a private hospital here.         
	The hospital sources said both the children and mother are fine.         
	The patient (Madhuri) was taken to the operation theatre around 6 am. The girl was born first, around 7.15 am while the boy was born minutes later. They are in healthy condition and doing fine, said a hospital source.         
	Bhaichung, who is currently recovering from a hamstring injury, was seemingly excited with the news.

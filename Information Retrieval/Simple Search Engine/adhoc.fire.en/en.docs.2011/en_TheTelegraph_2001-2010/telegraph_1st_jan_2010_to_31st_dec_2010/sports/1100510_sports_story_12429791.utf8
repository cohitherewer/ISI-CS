            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ramiz Raja                           
	Bridgetown: The unsettled environment in Pakistan cricket is contributing to disappointing performances on the field.         
	That, at least, is former captain Ramiz Rajas view.         
	When players get banned and fined, and so many changes are made, then its definitely an unsettled environment... Thats getting reflected on the field, where the performances have been disappointing, Ramiz told The Telegraph.         
	Pakistan, winners of the World Twenty20 last year, are as good as out of the ongoing edition.         
	We shouldve beaten New Zealand (on Saturday)... That loss may hurt for a long time... Nobody played his natural game... We shouldve gone for it in the first 10 overs and, then, controlled the match from there on... The target (134) was achievable, Ramiz, also a former chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, added.         
	Mathematically, were still in the tournament, but its not a happy situation to be in... The players needed to be fearless, needed to go for the kill... That hasnt been happening, which is sad, really, Ramiz, one of the heroes of the 1992 World Cup win, said.         
	According to Ramiz, the media back home, too, had made things difficult. A lot of pressure has been put, he pointed out.         
	Pakistans last match in the Super Eights is against South Africa.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has returned to the top five in the ICC rankings for Test batsmen, following his 183 in the second innings of the just concluded drawn third Test match against England in Cape Town. Smith has gained seven places to move to the fourth position.         
	Not far behind him is teammate Jacques Kallis, whose 33rd Test century has earned him three places to sixth position, not far behind Indias Virender Sehwag, who is currently in the fifth in the chart.         
	The list is still headed by Indias Gautam Gambhir followed by the Lankan pair of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, in second and third places, respectively.         
	In the bowlers list, Pakistans Mohammed Asifs eight-wicket haul in Sydney has given him a career-best rating as he now sits in the third position with only Dale Steyn of South Africa and Australias Mitchell Johnson ahead of him.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Wasim Akram and Sourav Ganguly at CC amp;FC on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: For the little known left-arm medium pacers like Bengals Eklakh Ahmed or Saurashtras Balakrishna Jadeja, it couldnt have got bigger. A chance to bowl before the Sultan of Swing Wasim Akram, priceless tips from the legend that they will cherish for a long time.         
	Everyone wanted to impress the former Pakistan captain during the first day of the Kolkata Knight Riders camp at the CC amp;FC ground on Friday.         
	Akram was in the thick of things  be it a detailed interaction with Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla on his bowling, or checking out Arindam Dass grip.         
	I met him after 11 years, since being a part of the Indian squad that played against Pakistan in the Test series in 1999. I couldnt believe when he asked me that how I was bowling right now. He remembered my performance in a side game against the visiting Pakistan side that year, said Shukla.         
	He watched left-armers like Eklakh and Balakrishnas bowling at the nets, making that extra effort to teach them a thing or two. He was seen showing them the correct seam position.         
	The stint in Guragaon was very brief. He watched us bowl from a distance but there was no chance of an interaction. Today he spoke at length about my bowling. He told me about three different variations of slower deliveries which is a must for the shortest version How the wrist position changes when you bring variation in your slower deliveries, Eklakh said.         
	The session turned out to be an eye opener for the Bengal bowler who has come back after his stint with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	He told me that the slower delivery that I bowl should be only bowled to right-handers... There were certain tips as to how one can avoid bowling length balls or full-tosses at the death, he added.         
	It was learnt from KKR sources that 20-year-old Jharkhand medium pacer Varun Aarons bowling has impressed Akram. If one goes by the first days events, Akram has settled down pretty quickly in his new role  that of a mentor.         
	The bonhomie with skipper Sourav Ganguly and coach Dav Whatmore was there for all to see. Whatmore later said that the players should make full use of the opportunity when getting to interact with Akram. He has commitments across the globe. One should make full use of it during the short span that he is here, Whatmore said.         
	The coach categorically stated that this camp would help them identify the core Indian players who will make it to the main squad. This is a camp for skills training. Obviously this is the best domestic talent that we have got. We will have to choose from them. Obviously, it would have been great had Ishant Sharma and Ajit Agarkar been there. But we have to do with what we have, said the World Cup winning coach.         
	Asked about their decision to rope in Manoj Tiwary, Whatmore said: He is a fine young talent. We wouldnt have chased anyone who isnt good enough. Manoj is good and thats why he is here.         
	However, he refused divulge the players that the KKR will bid for during the upcoming auctions on January 19.         
	KKR will have another camp from January 18-21 for its development squad players which consists of first team rejects like Arindam Ghosh, Debabrata Das.

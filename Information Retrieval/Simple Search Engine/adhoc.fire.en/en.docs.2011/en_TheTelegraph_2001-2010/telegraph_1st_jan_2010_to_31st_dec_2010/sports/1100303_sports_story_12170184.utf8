The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra aim to close gap
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahindra aim to close gap
                      
	Margao: Placed third in the league table, title contenders Mahindra United would look to close the gap at the top by making a bright start to their second-leg campaign in the I-League when they meet reigning champions Churchill Brothers in a tough away fixture here Wednesday.         
	Coming up with decent performances in the first half of the league, Mahindra United, still capable of playing much better, would be disappointed with the opportunities missed to consolidate their position at the top when they reflect back at the first-leg, where they enjoyed a ten-match unbeaten run at one stage.         
	At the half-way stage of the league, where there has been no runaway leaders, Mahindra find themselves just four points behind Dempo Sports Club, who are placed at the top.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bravo claims four
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bravo claims four
                      
	Kingstown: All-rounder Dwayne Bravo claimed four for 21 as the West Indies bowled out Zimbabwe for a modest 141 off 48.5 overs in the fourth ODI at Arnos Vale Sports Complex on Friday.         
	On a pitch that aided fast bowlers, Bravo was ably assisted by fellow seamer Ravi Rampaul, who took two for 21.         
	For the visitors, Elton Chigumbura topscored with 42 but no other Zimbabwean passed 15. West Indies captain Chris Gayle had no hesitation in bowling first when he won his first toss of the five-match series.         
	Rampaul made an immediate impact, removing Hamilton Masakadza for a duck as he edged a lifter to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin in the second over.         
	Bravo added the wicket of Timycen Maruma, promoted to No.3, as he skewed to gully on nine.         
	Zimbabwe, bowled out for 104 in the third one-dayer here on Wednesday, soon slipped up again as the middle order folded meekly. Brendan Taylor (1) lost his off stump as he drove at Rampaul while Vusi Sibanda (11) was run out after a mix-up with Tatenda Taibu.

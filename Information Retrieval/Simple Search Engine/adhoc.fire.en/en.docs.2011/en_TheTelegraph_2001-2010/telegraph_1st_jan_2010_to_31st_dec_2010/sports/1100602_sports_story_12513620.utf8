            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Haroon Lorgat, the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive, Tuesday evaded the issue of former Australia Prime Minister John Howards nomination for the post of the governing bodys vice-president.         
	If there is an issue, it will be typically dealt with by the ICC. The executive board will discuss the matter, Lorgat, in the city to attend a 2011 World Cup Central Organising Committee (COG) meeting, said at a news conference.         
	Nishanta Ranatunga, chief executive of Sri Lanka Cricket, and Mustafa Kamal, chairman of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, refused to comment on the issue.         
	That was not on the agenda for todays meeting, Ranatunga said while Kamal did not respond to the question.         
	In normal circumstances, the approval of the nomination for the vice-presidents post by the ICC board is a formality. But in Howards case  he was nominated jointly by Australia and New Zealand  it has come under a cloud as the boards of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka have openly opposed it.         
	Meanwhile, former ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed has backed Howards nomination. Pawars the incoming president and he still has a lot of influence in India so Im hopeful that the process will be followed and that Australia and New Zealands recommendation is accepted, Speed said in Melbourne.

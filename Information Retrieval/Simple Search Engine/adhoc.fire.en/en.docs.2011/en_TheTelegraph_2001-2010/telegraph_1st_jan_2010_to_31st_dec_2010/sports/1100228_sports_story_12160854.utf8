The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look for 2 in a row
                                                                                                                       7                                      United look for 2 in a row
                      
	London: There could hardly be a more apt pairing for the 50th League Cup final on Sunday than a meeting between holders Manchester United and Aston Villa, the first winners of the quirky little three-handled cup.         
	Villa, who beat Rotherham United over two legs to win the inaugural competition in 1960/61, have won the League Cup five times compared to Uniteds three, with one of those coming against United in 1994.         
	With both teams doing well in the Premier League, their presence at Wembley Stadium could make the Golden Jubilee final a memorable one, especially if United manager Alex Ferguson selects in-form Wayne Rooney to start.         
	Rooney was on the sidelines when United beat Tottenham Hotspur on penalties to win last seasons final, and is currently in killer form, scoring 19 goals in his last 19 matches, 27 in all this season.         
	Ferguson however, implied Rooney might have to be content with a place on the bench as he considers the team to win the 44th major trophy of his career. United have other targets besides the League Cup.(REUTERS)

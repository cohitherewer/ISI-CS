The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dont want to get carried away: Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dont want to get carried away: Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Zealand captain Ross Taylor didnt sound complacent ahead of their second tri-series match, against Sri Lanka, in Dambulla, on Friday.         
	Having thrashed India by 200 runs in the opener, Taylor, at a media conference on Thursday, said that the Lankans are tough to beat in their home conditions and it will be a big challenge for his side.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Thrashing India in the opener         
	Take away the 200-run margin, we were just happy with the victory. We had trained hard leading into the tri-series and its nice when you get the results for your hard work. We dont want to get carried away.         
	If NZ were taken lightly         
	Im not sure. Im sure a lot of their (Indias) players who played in the Test series will be a little bit tired. They have played the three-Test series over three-and-a-half weeks or so. The same applies for Sri Lanka, but they have had 2-3 days extra rest than the Indians and so might be a little more refreshed. Its still pretty hot and were still getting used to it as well.         
	Whether they are confident about reaching the final         
	I dont want to get carried away It was just a victory and the team played well. Sri Lanka are tough to beat in their home conditions and we have to come out with the same attitude and the same intent in the next game too. If we do that we give ourselves a good chance.         
	If there are any injury worries         
	Jacob Oram has a little bit of niggle, just a tight hamstring. Hopefully, he can recover well by tomorrow and well see how it goes. Hes an outstanding bowler for us, if we were to lose him, it will be a huge loss, but it will also be an opportunity for whoever comes in. Also, (BJ) Watling is not quite at per cent When you are struck down for a couple of days, you are going to be a bit off the weather. Hopefully, he wakes up feeling better than he did today.         
	On how the Dambulla pitch behaves under lights         
	I dont think it will swing as much as it did during the day. It did nip around a little bit. The history of this ground says that the team that win the toss always bats, but the win-loss ratio is about 50-50.         
	Nehra reversing the ball in the last match         
	He was reversing the older ball and was moving it across myself and into Jacob. Nehra bowled well, but I think Praveen Kumar bowled outstandingly well too.   
	How to handle Lasith Malinga and Ajantha Mendis  
	Have you got any tips? They are unique bowlers in their own right. Every team scouts every player and they will be no different. Well watch them hard. You have to respect them, but at the same time you have to play the ball on its merit Few of our batsmen have never faced them, so it will be a big challenge.         
	On Roger Mortimer, the NZ high performance manager         
	Roger Mortimer has come with a big sporting background. He has worked a lot with New Zealand athletes, who have gone on to win Olympic gold, and he didnt know much about those sports either. Hes been really good and hes added a lot to the group.

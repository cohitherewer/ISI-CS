	Guangzhou: India had a fruitful day at the Asian Games, on Tuesday, with young players from different disciplines winning four bronze medals.         
	The high point of the day was Ashish Kumar scripting history by becoming the first Indian gymnast to clinch an Asian Games medal. He secured a bronze in the mens floor event of the Artistic Gymnastics.         
	Virdhawal Khade became the first Indian swimmer in 24 years to clinch a Games medal by notching up a bronze in the 50m butterfly event, while Dronavalli Harika clinched the bronze medal in the womens individual chess.         
	Harika, 19, got the better of Irine Sukandar Kharisma of Indonesia in the ninth and final round to secure the bronze with six points. Overall, she won five matches, drew three and lost one.         
	Wushu player Bimoljit Singh Mayanglambam won the bronze in the mens sanshou 60kg event. He lost his semi-final bout to Mohsen Mohammadseifi of Iran 0-2 but still bagged a bronze for the country at the Nansha Gymnasium. The 27-year-old had knocked out Valasith Bouapha of Laos in the quarter finals to reach the semis.         
	Nineteen-year-old Khade topped his heat by clocking 24.56sec, finishing third in the finals with a timing of 24.31 seconds. Khazan Singh was the last Indian swimmer to win a medal at the Asian Games, when he clinched the 100m freestyle silver in the 1986 Seoul edition.         
	I am very happy to have won a medal for India after 24 years. I wanted to win after missing the bronze yesterday. It would have been better had it been a silver or a gold, Khade, who finished fourth in the 50m freestyle finals just 0.03 seconds behind the bronze-medallist on Monday, said.         
	His timing was, however, not even his personal best that is 24.25 seconds, which he managed at the Commonwealth Youth Games, in Pune, in 2008.         
	Kumar said he missed his coach Vladimir Chertkov but was determined not to make it lose his focus. On the day he (Chertkov) left, I was hugely disappointed and was quite unhappy. But I had to get out of it, otherwise I would not have won a medal, said Kumar, also 19.         
	Kumar tallied 14.925 points to take the bronze in a bitterly fought contest, in which Chinas Zhang Chenglong and Koreas Kim Soo Myun tied for the gold with identical 15.400 points.         
	Now, I am confident about winning an Olympic medal, he said. (PTI)

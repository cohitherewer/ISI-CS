The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto misses crucial penalty 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barreto misses crucial penalty 
                      
	Ludhiana: Mohun Bagan squandered a chance to break into top three of the I-League standings as they played a goalless draw with JCT in a Round XVI encounter of the ONGC I-League, played at the Guru Nanak Stadium, Ludhiana here on Monday.         
	It was all to play for both the teams but in the end neither of the team was successful to break the deadlock.         
	It was surely a game of two halves with the visitors showing their prowess in the first, while the hosts replied back strongly in the second session.         
	After a dull first half, where both the teams failed to hit the back of the net, Mohun Bagan got a definite chance to seal the match at the hour mark when Ishfaq Ahmed was brought down inside the box by JCT midfielfer Lalchhuuanmawia. But Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto failed to convert the spot-kick.         
	Barreto these days is finding it difficult to convert it from the spot. In the Federation Cup semi-final against East Bengal, the Brazilians attempt was too weak.         
	JCT defence on the other hand played their part with defender Jaswinder Singh taking away the Man of the Match award for his solid performance.         
	Mohun Bagan remained at fourth with 25 points, just one point behind Churchill Brothers, who are placed third in the table, while JCT gained a place in the standings and find themselves at ninth position with 19 points.

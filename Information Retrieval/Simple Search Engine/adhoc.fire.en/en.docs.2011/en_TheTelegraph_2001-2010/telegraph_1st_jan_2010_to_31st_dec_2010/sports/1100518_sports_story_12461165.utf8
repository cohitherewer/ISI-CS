  -  Former captain and the first bowler to take 500 Test wickets opens up...                 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL             Courtney Walsh                                 
	New York: Courtney Walsh, the first bowler to take 500 wickets in Tests (he finished with 519) and a former West Indies captain, spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour, at the Hilton Barbados, on Sunday evening.         
	Now 47, Walsh remains as affable as he was during a very distinguished career.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youre quite a busy man...         
	A (Grins) Im doing fine... I run a clinic for the U-15s in Jamaica... Ive got sponsors to help me... Then, as you know, I have a sports bar (Cuddyz) in Kingston... That continues to do well... Then, last November, I started the Courtney Walsh Foundation... Also, Im on the West Indies Cricket Boards cricket committee.         
	Whats the focus of your Foundation?         
	The Foundation works with kids who end up in jail, works with the first-time offenders, really... We do counselling, try and make them realise that they must not be bitter when they come out of jail... For, if they become so, then the problem gets worse... The idea is that they must not think the world is against them. Were into spreading awareness, too, in that prison isnt a bed of roses, so dont get in there. (After a pause) Ive worked for social causes overseas, when Id be on the road, this is one way of doing something for the kids of my own people.         
	How closely do you follow the fortunes of the West Indies team?         
	I do keep track of whats happening.         
	You must be quite disappointed with the state of affairs...         
	Yes, like so many others in the Caribbean... I think the players are themselves disappointed and Im not going to point fingers at anybody... However, what Ill say is that the level of commitment has to go up in every quarter.         
	That includes the players, isnt it?         
	Players, officials, coaches, fans... Everybody.         
	What else?         
	Look, the rebuilding is still on, its taking too much time, which is why were stuck up there (in mediocrity)... West Indies cricket needs a lot more passion and could do with a greater sense of pride.         
	Why is it that a row over contracts surfaces every now and then?         
	Issues will be there... They were there before I began playing for the West Indies and, till today, remain... Thats not going to change. Having said that, I feel the attitude on all sides must not be that of wanting to confront. Negotiate, yes... Confront, no. Indeed, negotiate in the best interests of West Indies cricket... Thats my message.         
	If I asked you to list three things needed to drive West Indies cricket, what would they be?         
	A disciplined approach on and off the field, a clear vision and a determination to achieve high goals.         
	Not too long ago, what made the difference for the West Indies?         
	Sure, the quality of players mattered, their talent... Besides, it was our dedication and the desire to come close to excellence. We had that want, you know.         
	Do you follow Indian cricket?         
	I do... Im aware Indias No.1 in Tests, which is a big achievement... I follow the IPL, too.         
	Sachin Tendulkars still going strong...         
	(Laughs) Im pleasantly surprised and, from what Ive seen, Tendulkar appears to have become better in recent years! Hes some cricketer... Actually, the little master looks good for a few more years.         
	Whats your take on T20?         
	It has advantages, its attracting newer audiences... But a balance has to be struck and the administrators must keep all three forms in mind.         
	T20 isnt for bowlers. Would you have enjoyed playing it?         
	Yes, because I love cricket.         
	Who is the most promising quick in the West Indies?         
	Jerome Taylor... Then, theres Kemar Roach... Fidel Edwards... The guys are there. Its not that the cupboard is bare, but fact is that the bowlers arent experienced.         
	Nobody is in the big league...         
	That could be because todays generation doesnt have role models to look up to.         
	Internationally, is there a fast bowler who has impressed you?         
	Quite a few, Id say... Mitchell Johnson, Dale Steyn... Even Stuart Broad, who has improved so much. I like the quality they have and I like their work ethic. Theyre hungry for wickets.         
	What goes into the making of top-bracket quicks?         
	Fast bowlers wanting to make it big must be strong, must be disciplined and must be willing to put in hours and hours of bowling at nets. Its very hard work... The basics have to be strong, otherwise the foundation will be weak. Once the basics have been mastered, it becomes easy to pick up the other things.         
	Youre a former captain, too. What are the qualities needed for that role?         
	The ability to read the game as a whole and, specifically, situations... The ability to keep the flock together and the ability to bring the best out of individuals.         
	Is cricket in the West Indies still threatened by baseball and basketball?         
	Its pretty well entrenched... Cricket and soccer are strong... As is athletics, in some of the island nations... I wont say cricket is threatended, but to attract more and more to the game, the team needs to do better. After all, the youth has options... (After a pause) The Board is planning to open a High-Performance Centre, in Barbados, so that will be a step in the right direction.         
	You were hugely successful...         
	Because I had the dedication and the want to do well for myself and for the team. Success doesnt come on a platter, you need to work very hard... Need to make sacrifices. To remain at the pinnacle, you then need to be consistent.         
	Did any batsman frustrate you?         
	Quite a few... The Steve Waughs, Tendulkars, Graham Gooch, Allan Border... The Mike Athertons... They made me work that much harder.         
	If you had to name one?         
	It will probably be Steve...         
	You quit playing in 2001, but your fan-following hasnt diminished. Your thoughts?         
	(Smiles) Its a humbling feeling... I thank God for all the recognition... Ive always been humble and have tried to keep the people around me happy... Ive never had an agenda.         
	Has todays generation become too commercial in its outlook?         
	Perhaps, yes. Its only natural, I guess.         
	Lastly, your finest moment...         
	Getting my first Test cap (in Perth, in November 1984)... Having the good fortune to be in the same dressing room as Clive Lloyd, Sir Vivian Richards, Brian Lara, Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose... Ive been blessed.

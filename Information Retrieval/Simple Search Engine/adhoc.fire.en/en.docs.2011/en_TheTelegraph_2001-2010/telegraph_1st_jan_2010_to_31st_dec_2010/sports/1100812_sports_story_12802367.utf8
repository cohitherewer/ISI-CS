	Buenos Aires: Argentinas soccer chief Julio Grondona broke his word when the ruling body did not renew World Cup coach Diego Maradonas contract, striker Carlos Tevez said on Tuesday.         
	Mr Grondona said Maradona could do what he liked (after the World Cup), Tevez said, adding the AFA president had told the coach the job was still his after Argentinas 4-0 quarter final defeat by Germany.         
	In the changing room (after Argentinas elimination) Don Julio told Diego he would continue (as coach). If (Grondona) holds a meeting and I can say it to him face to face, Ill do it, the outspoken Tevez told a sports broadcaster when he joined the squad in Dublin for Wednesdays friendly against Ireland.         
	Theres a lot lacking in the AFAs word... I say what I think and feel, I dont care if for the next match Im in the national team or not, the Manchester City player said.         
	The AFA board voted against renewing Maradonas contract after the coach had said he could not accept Grondonas demand to drop of some of his coaching staff and pick new assistants.         
	Argentina youth coach Sergio Batista has taken over as interim coach and is among a handful of candidates rumoured to be in the running for the position, including Alejandro Sabella, Carlos Bianchi, Diego Simeone and Claudio Borghi. There is also speculation that Maradona might return.         
	The AFA plan to name a coach in December to see Argentina through to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a job Batista, who played alongside Maradona in the 1986 World Cup-winning team, is keen to land.         
	Maradona, meanwhile, is not long without a job after his assistant said the Argentine legend has job offers from two clubs in Brazil and a national team in Europe.         
	Alejandro Mancuso, a member of Maradonas coaching staff with the national team, gave no details of the offers in a television interview and offered no timeframe.         
	Maradonas reign as Argentinas national team coach ended last month, three weeks after the team were knocked out of the World Cup with a 0-4 quarter final loss to Germany.         
	If the offers have popped up, its because we did something well, Mancuso said.         
	Mancusco was one of the assistants the Argentine federation asked Maradona to replace, a condition for the famous No. 10 to have his contract renewed.         
	Maradona refused to fire his long-time friend, which precipitated his departure.         
	Maradonas relationship with key figures in Argentine football has been tense to say the least.         
	He kept leaders of AFA, and businessmen with commercial ties to the organisation, out of practice sessions in South Africa, while allowing reporters to enter.         
	Maradonas results as coach have been mixed. Under him, the team played 15 games, with eight victories and seven losses.         
	Two of the defeats rank among the worst in the teams history: the 4-0 loss to Germany in Cape Town and a 6-1 loss to Bolivia during World Cup qualifying in La Paz.           (AGENCIES)

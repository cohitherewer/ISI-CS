The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Abel brace in EB win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Abel brace in EB win
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals Ghanaian recruit Abel Hammond struck twice while substitute Alvito DCunha found the back of the net once as the city giants beat West Bengal Police 3-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	After a barren first half, East Bengal upped the ante in the second session and scored thrice to go up to 14 points from seven matches. This is East Bengals fourth victory in the local league.         
	The red and gold brigade broke the deadlock in the 50th minute when Mumtaz Akhtar was brought down inside the penalty box by police custodian Soumava Ghosh.         
	Referee Prabir Dhar promptly awarded a spot-kick. Hammond made no mistake from the dreaded spot.         
	The second one saw young Budiram Tudus defence splitting through connected by Hammond, who raced into the box to send a right footer crashing into the net.         
	The policemen could have pulled one back, but Shankar Sils header was brilliantly parried away by young custodian Priyant Singh. The final goal came in the first minute of stoppage time when substitute Alvitos left-footer slipped through Soumavas grip to give the favourites a comprehensive victory.         
	Although, it was a team that consisted of mainly reserve players, the youngsters gave a good account of themselves.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridders decision to give the likes Saheb Ali Gharami, Poibang Poshna, Sayantan Das Roy, Mumtaz Akhtar a go in the local league is sure to pay rich dividends in the long run.         
	A good performance from the second team means that it will strengthen their reserve bench during the second leg of the I-League starts.         
	Teams         
	East Bengal: Priyant Singh, Saumik Dey, Sayantan Das Roy (Wasim Firoz, 77), Saheb Ali Gharami, Poibang Poshna (Suman Dey, 82), Mumtaz Akhtar, B. Beikhokhei, Sanju Pradhan, Abel Hammond, Budiram Tudu (Alvito DCunha, 80), Saikat Saha Roy.         
	West Bengal Police: Soumava Ghosh, Dipankar Das (Subhas Ghosh, 58), Manoj Das (Anupam Dutta, 78), Kishore Mullick (Prasanta Dutta, 85), Himadri Chakraborty, Swarup Kr Dey, Prayashu Halder, Indrajit Sil, Shankar Sil.         
	Referee: Prabir Dhar.         
	MoM: Sanju Pradhan.

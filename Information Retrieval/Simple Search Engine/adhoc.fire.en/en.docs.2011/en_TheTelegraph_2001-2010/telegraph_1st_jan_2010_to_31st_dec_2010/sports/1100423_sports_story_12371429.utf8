The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Disgust among players
                                                                                                                       7                                      Disgust among players
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Elder statesman Sachin Tendulkar is confident that Indian cricket will get over the latest crisis, but the players fraternity is absolutely disgusted with the happenings of the past 12 days or so.         
	That came through in a series of text messages received by The Telegraph from a senior pro, known to have his ears to the ground, on Thursday.         
	Sad and disgraceful... Cricket is the loser, read one such message. Another went as follows: Greed (is the cause)... Unfortunate...         
	The ongoing tamasha over the Indian Premier League should end quickly as the Board president, Shashank Manohar, in particular, strongly feels enough is enough.         
	Moreover, Manohar is quite clear about one thing: That the players have to be the face of Indian cricket, not a Lalit Modi or somebody else.         
	Its because of the players that the administrators get to play a role... In the presidents opinion, that must not be lost sight of, is how a source, who knows Manohar well, put it.         
	Refreshingly different that.

	Mumbai: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has been chosen as the Player of the Decade by a cricket website.         
	When I played my hundredth Test, I said that the one thing that Im most proud of has been the longevity of my career and the fact that Ive been able to play at a pretty high level for a long period of time, Ponting said.         
	I have played in an era where theres been a lot of great players. Some of the leading runscorers of all time have played in my time and a lot of the leading wicket-takers have played in my time as well, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern surprise United
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bayern surprise United
            HENRY WINTER            Manchester Uniteds Wayne Rooney is on crutches as he leaves a Munich hotel, on Wednesday. (AP)                                 
	Munich: Amazingly, this time it was the Germans partying like it was 1999. Alarmingly, it was Wayne Rooney limping like it was 2006.         
	Agonisingly, this was a night that dissolved into a nightmare for the English champions, who naively threw away the lead late on just as Bayern had done in that unforgettable Champions League final at the Nou Camp 11 years ago.         
	For Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer back then read Franck Ribery and Ivica Olic on a night when Bayern rediscovered their pride in a thrilling climax, as briefly reported in Wednesdays Late City edition.         
	This was also an evening of suffering for Rooney, who seems to have the whole nations hopes resting on his health. The incident that brought Rooneys incapacitation was strange, the dream-weaver for Manchester United and England sustaining an accidental kick from Mario Gomez on his left foot but then wincing as the ligaments in his right ankle contorted.         
	Fortunately for club and country, Rooneys injury proved only a bad sprain, rather than another addition to his extensive snapped bone collection. Surely, though, for all Sir Alex Fergusons hopeful prognosis, this rules him out of Saturdays potential title-decider with Chelsea.         
	On such moments can the destiny of championships be shaped. Dimitar Berbatov, who has yet to score against a top-eight side this season, will never coax the sweat-beads out on John Terrys forehead as Rooney would. It was all so frustrating, all so unnecessary.         
	If Rooney further confirmed his reputation as The Lancets cover boy, Uniteds full-backs exuded all the agility and composure of patients on crutches escaping from a darkened casualty ward. It was all such a waste of Rooneys ludicrously early goal, the striker sweeping in Nanis free-kick after 64 seconds.         
	But then Gary Neville, the sole survivor from 99 starting on Tuesday , gifted Ribery his chance with a mad hand-ball. Then Patrice Evra dithered in possession, allowing Olic to gain some revenge for the Nou Camp in injury time.         
	The Hand of Nev and Evras hesitation was utterly out of keeping with the mature, intelligent football offered by the English champions until then. Rio Ferdinand, Darren Fletcher and Rooney all impressed, keeping the ball and using it well.         
	Nani set the positive tone, storming down the right, nicking the ball past Martin Demichelis, the Bayern centre-half who sent the Portuguese winger flying. Climbing to his feet, Nani prepared to punish Demichelis with the dead-ball delivery.         
	Much to Uniteds delight, Demichelis slipped, unable to keep his balance as Rooney kept shifting from one foot to the other. His marker lost, Rooney slammed in Nanis ball with his left foot.         
	This was United at their most tactically sophisticated, the 4-3-2-1 formation giving them width, central numbers and the sharpest of spearheads in Rooney. Such was the Englishmans intimidating presence that Daniel van Buyten, the Belgian defender once of Manchester City in the Kevin Keegan era, took to knocking Rooney off-balance, even pushing him when United looked to break quickly.         
	Yet there is class in the Baverian ranks, particularly when the ball was at the quick, responsive feet of Ribery on the left or Philipp Lahm, the attack-minded right-back. Ribery had a shot saved by Edwin Van der Sar, and then spinning Neville and disappearing towards the line.         
	Van der Sar decided to punch Riberys cross away, a surprising choice as no Bayern attacker was close. When the ball was driven back in by Hamit Altintop, Van der Sar was fortunate that Olic just failed to turn it in. Maybe he was just setting his sights.         
	Bayern raised their game after the break, Ribery teeing up Olic, whose over-ambitious attempt to beat Van der Sar at the near-post failed. Louis Van Gaals side were beginning to push United deep and only a marvellous tackle from Scholes stopped Ribery. Only Van der Sars good positioning thwarted Altintop and then Mark van Bommel.         
	These were nervous times for United, particularly whenever Ribery was running at Neville, whose intelligence and anticipation got him out of some problems but whose ageing legs meant he remained vulnerable to Bayerns dashing Frenchman.

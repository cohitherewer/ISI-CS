    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  You need to be a big hitter in T20, says Explosive 20-year-old             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Saurabh Tiwary      
	Calcutta: Among the younger lot, few in IPL III have been more impressive than 20-year-old Saurabh Tiwary, the left-handed Jharkhand captain.         
	Saurabh, who turns out for the Mumbai Indians (MI), spoke to The Telegraph shortly after landing here, on Monday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q What made you take to cricket and not any other sport?         
	A It came naturally... Bachpan se hi cricket khelte the... My parents (Sunil Kumar, Kalaklata) didnt discourage me.         
	Did Mahendra Singh Dhoni have the biggest influence on you?         
	Ive always liked his batting, the way he approaches his game... It feels nice when, once in a while, some compare me to him.         
	Do you get the chance to interact with Dhoni?         
	Not much, because Dhonis busy with international commitments... He stays in Ranchi, while Im a Jamshedpur boy... Ive spoken to him during the IPL, just normal talk, nothing very specific.         
	Your hairstyle resembles that of the Dhoni of old         
	(Laughs) But Ive been this way for a number of years... Havent copied Dhoni.         
	Has anybody else also been an influence?         
	Sachin Tendulkar... In fact, hes my idol... Ive grown up watching him play, have been fascinated by his cricket.         
	What has it been like sharing the MI dressing room with Sachin?         
	Cant describe in words... Woh bahut mushkil kaam hai... Ive been with MI for three years and theres been so much to learn from Sachin... Actually, its an honour being in the same dressing room and, there was a time, when I couldnt even have dreamt of it.         
	You must have been overawed when you met Sachin for the first time, in IPL I...         
	Of course... I remember telling him that hed been my idol.         
	How would you describe your MI experience?         
	The atmosphere is very good... It has allowed me to grow both as a cricketer and as a person. The exposure given by MI has been invaluable... One likes to play in a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere and MI have provided that.         
	Why did MI not make it big in the first two seasons?         
	Its not that we played badly, its just that we lost some close matches... This time, we havent. That, I believe, has been the biggest difference.         
	Would you, at some stage, like to play for the franchise from your region  the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)?         
	Cant comment on it now... There will be a fresh auction for next season... Cant say how things will unfold. But, yes, KKR is the only team from East.         
	How would you describe your approach?         
	I play according to the situation... I know I have the reputation of a big-hitter, but T20 demands that... Woh zaroori hai... To survive in T20, you do need to hit big.         
	A common view is that even batsmen short on technique can flourish in T20... That it doesnt produce correct batsmen...         
	Look, Ill only talk of myself  T20 has definitely made me a better batsman... Im sure youve also seen a change for the better.         
	This seasons IPL has gone very well for you (367 runs in the league stage)... Whats your own assessment?         
	Perform karna mere haath mein hai... I can only perform, rest is left to destiny... Of course, today, Im a much more confident cricketer and Im mentally tougher, too. Id say that the more I play, the better Ill become.         
	You must be hungry now for the India cap...         
	As Ive said, I can only perform... The rest isnt in my hands.         
	Are you, say, a soccer enthusiast?         
	No... My interest in sport begins and ends with cricket...         
	Youre fond of movies... Who are your favourite actors?         
	(Laughs) Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif.         
	Both are involved in the IPL. Have you met them?         
	Shah Rukh once, but not Katrina.         
	Your biggest achievement?         
	Scoring 593 runs in the 2009-10 Ranji Trophy.         
	Lastly... How are you going to handle the pressure of the upcoming semi-final?         
	Karna pade ga... Ill be seeking Sachins advice, talking to some of the other big names in MI, as well... If one makes a mistake, then one cant make a comeback... It will straightaway mean being out of the tournament... Clearly, the knockout stage presents very different challenges. Bahut bada test ho ga.

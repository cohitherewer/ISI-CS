                                                                                                                       7                                      May flays ICC
                      
	Melbourne: Federation of International Cricketers Association (FICA) chief Tim May Sunday launched a scathing attack on the ICC, saying its governance structure is fraught with conflicts of interests, cronyism and lack of specific expertise and independence.         
	The governance structure of the board is a relic of the past, May said.         
	Board composition in the professional sporting world has moved beyond structures where members comprise the board.         
	Such structures are fraught with conflicts of interests, cronyism and lack of specific expertise and independence. While the ICC maintains its present board structure, it is most likely the ICC will continue to be held by the public as an underachiever.         
	May said given the state of affairs in ICC, the powerful boards would continue to have their way.         
	It will continue to make decisions that benefit the powerful at the expense of the greater good of the game.         
	Its the No.1 issue in the game today  its solution provides the pathway for better decisions surrounding future playing schedules, ICC events, managing the Twenty20 format, investment in the game, allocation of resources, he said.

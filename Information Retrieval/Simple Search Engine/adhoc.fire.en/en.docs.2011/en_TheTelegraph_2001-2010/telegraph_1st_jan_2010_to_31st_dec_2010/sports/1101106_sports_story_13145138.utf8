            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: After Harbhajan Singhs fiery innings at the Motera, members of the Indian cricket team celebrated Diwali at Gujarat Ranji skipper Parthiv Patels residence here on Friday.         
	According to sources, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Suresh Raina, VVS Laxman and some others were spotted at Parthivs residence. A local television channel flashed grabs of Dhonis wife Sakshi, too, partaking in the festivities.         
	Dhoni reportedly suffered from high fever in the afternoon and Harbhajan Singh during the post-match media briefing said that he saw Dhoni shivering and using a blanket to cover himself before he came on to bat.         
	The New Zealand team, however, celebrated in the team hotel.         
	It was a tough day for both the teams as the Motera wicket got slow and low as the game progressed. The Black Caps bowled exceptionally well to contain Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman, and eventually triggered their downfall. India were well set for a 500-plus first innings total after the Virender Sehwag blitzkrieg on Thursday, and it was expected that the likes of Tendulkar, Laxman and Dhoni would easily lift India to a commanding total.         
	According to officials at the team hotel, only the New Zealand players participated in a Diwali programme.         
	 We had organised a small rangoli competition in the hotel lobby for the players wives and some of the New Zealand players came down to participate with their spouses. We gave out gifts to the best three (rangoli) designs. Then the players joined us in lighting firecrackers in front of the main entrance, the hotel official said.

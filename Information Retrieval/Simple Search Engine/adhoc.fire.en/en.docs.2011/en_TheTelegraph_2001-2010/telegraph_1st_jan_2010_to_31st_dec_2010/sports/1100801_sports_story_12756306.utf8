The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A team effort: Dhoni 
                                                                                                                       7                                        A team effort: Dhoni 
  - No.1 ranking All praise for the players         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Colombo: Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has praised his players for ensuring that India stays No.1 in the Test rankings, irrespective of the outcome of the series third and final Test.         
	Sri Lankas ahead 1-0.         
	Of course, being the captain, I have reason to feel proud, but all credit to the team... To the players... After all, its a team effort, Dhoni told The Telegraph, at the Taj Samudra, on Saturday evening.         
	He added: The players have taken India to No.1 and are responsible for that position being retained... Its a good feeling, yes... The bowlers have done well, often in adverse conditions... The batsmen, too, have done their job.         
	Dhoni and Co. have, of course, benefited from the International Cricket Councils annual update, gaining six (ratings) points.         
	Frankly, Ive never been under pressure only because of the rankings... That we cant lose the No.1 position, irrespective of the result at the P. Sara Stadium, wont reduce the usual pressure, though...         
	We look to play well and that, obviously, cant change... If we play the way we should be doing, then the rankings will take care of themselves... Its not a question of less pressure or more pressure, well be playing to win, Dhoni signed off, preparing to leave for a reception at India House.         
	India became No.1 in early December last year, after defeating Sri Lanka at the CCI, in Mumbai. No.4 till the other day, thanks to the update, Kumar Sangakkaras team is now one position lower.         
	Dhoni has been the Test captain from November 2008; Sangakkara from early last year.

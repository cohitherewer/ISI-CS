The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain to meet Portugal 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spain to meet Portugal 
                                
	Pretoria: An inspired David Villa scored one sublime goal and created another for Andres Iniesta as European champions Spain beat 10-man Chile 2-1 and advanced to the last 16 of the World Cup on Friday.         
	However, both the teams proceeded to the Round of 16. While Spain will meet Portugal, Chile will fight it out with Brazil.         
	Both sides created early chances at a noisy Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria, before a combination of sublime skill and reckless goalkeeping led to the European champions opening goal in the 24th minute.         
	Striker Fernando Torres raced after a Xabi Alonso punt down the left and although keeper Claudio Bravo raced out and managed to make the clearance he found himself horribly stranded.         
	The ball fell straight to Villa wide on the left and he took one sight of goal and curled a stunning shot from 40 metres into the empty net.         
	Spain doubled their lead and Chile were reduced to 10 just under 10 minutes before the break.         
	Iniesta played the ball wide to Villa, ran on to the strikers return pass and slotted clinically beyond Bravo from just inside the penalty area.         
	As the Spanish players celebrated, Chilean midfielder Marco Estrada, who had already picked up a yellow card, was shown another and dismissed after he appeared to catch Torress heel off the ball, sending the striker tumbling to the ground.         
	The Chileans looked down and out at halftime but pulled a goal back two minutes after the break when a shot from substitute Rodrigo Millar looped up off Gerard Piques leg and over keeper Iker Casillas into the net.         
	As the clock ticked down, Spain dominated possession easily enough and were not seriously troubled by a toothless Chilean attack.         
	In the other match, Switzerland and Honduras drew 0-0 with chances missed at both ends as the two sides were eliminated from the World Cup.         
	Despite being more physically imposing, the Swiss were very disappointing and strangely displayed a lack of zest given the high stakes while Honduras played the more attractive soccer.         
	The Central Americans, for whom Ramon Nunez was dangerous, opened up the much-vaunted Swiss defence often and better finishing would have seen them a goal or two up by halftime.         
	Honduras started well but the first chance of the game went to the Swiss when captain Gokhan Inler shot wide from just outside the penalty area in the 10th minute.         
	Chances went begging at both ends. In the 38th, Wilson Palacios raced through the middle but was dragged down by Gelson Fernandes, who earned a yellow card for his efforts.         
	The best chance of the half fell to Swiss striker Blaise Nkufo just before the break, who chested down a cross from Eren Derdiyok a metre from goal only for the ball to bobble away.         
	After the break Honduras threatened when striker David Suazo failed to put away a diving header in the 52nd which would have given them a deserved lead.         
	Hakan Yakin, on for Fernandes, should have done better in the 59th but shot tamely. Tranquillo Barnetta and Derdiyok also both wasted good chances when well-placed in the Honduran box.

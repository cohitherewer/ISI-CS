	Johannesburg: Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel ripped through England on Thursday to put South Africa in control of the fourth and final Test, raising hopes they can square the series at the Wanderers.         
	Steyn had figures of five for 51 and Morkel three for 39 as the tourists, defending a 1-0 lead in the series, were bowled out for 180 just before tea after winning the toss. Having slumped to 39 for four after a poor start to the morning session, England lost its last six wickets in the space of 17.2 overs.         
	In reply, South Africa was 29 without loss when bad light brought an early end to play on day one and unbeaten openers Ashwell Prince (15) and Graeme Smith (12) will look to make further inroads on Englands total on Friday. Rain had earlier forced the home side off for an hour, when they were 16 for no loss.         
	A fifth-wicket stand of 76 between Ian Bell (35) and Paul Collingwood (47) rescued England from embarrassment as they struggled on a fast pitch.         
	South Africa claimed four wickets in the first 10 overs, including England captain Andrew Strauss on the first ball of the day. The pitch was expected to be a lively one, so it was a surprise when Strauss decided to bat first.         
	He did not last long, turning a Steyn delivery to the leg side where short-leg fielder Hashim Amla took a brilliant one-handed catch low to his right.           (AGENCIES)

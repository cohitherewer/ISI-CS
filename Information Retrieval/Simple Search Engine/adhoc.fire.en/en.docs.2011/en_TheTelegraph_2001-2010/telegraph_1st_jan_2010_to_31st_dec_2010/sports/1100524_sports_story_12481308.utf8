	Paris: Somdev Dev Varman fought his heart out in his maiden French Open campaign before crashing out of the clay court Grand Slam event following a marathon five-set duel with higher ranked Marco Chiudinelli of Switzerland in the opening round here Sunday.         
	Somdev, who became the first Indian to make it to the singles main draw in 13 years, lost 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6 in a gruelling three hour 38 minute clash here. Somdev came back twice from a set down to ignite hopes of a win but a break conceded at the second game of the deciding set cooked his goose.         
	The Indian started strongly making his world No. 65 opponent toil for every point. Somdev got an early breakpoint and a chance to surge ahead after 1-1 but the Swiss fought back and won the third game of the opening set after exchanging a couple of deuces.         
	Somdev failed to maintain his tempo and was broken in the sixth game as Marco first took a 4-2 lead before pocketing the first set 6-3. However, the world No. 109 Indian raised his game to take the second set 6-3.         
	In the third set, the Swiss big server, broke Somdev in the fourth game to take a 3-1 lead. The Indian played some close games later on and was on the verge of breaking his opponent in the next game but failed to convert it and eventually lost the third set 3-6. Somdev made yet another comeback in the fourth set, breaking his rival in the second and fourth games. Barring a third game slip-up, he held his serve till the end to win it 6-3 and level the match two sets all.         
	In the decider Marco stole the show when he broke the Indian in the second game and held his serve to take a 3-0 lead. Lagging 3-5, Somdev reeled off a couple of points and was 30-0 at one point in the ninth game, but the Swiss came back strongly to eventually pocket the match.

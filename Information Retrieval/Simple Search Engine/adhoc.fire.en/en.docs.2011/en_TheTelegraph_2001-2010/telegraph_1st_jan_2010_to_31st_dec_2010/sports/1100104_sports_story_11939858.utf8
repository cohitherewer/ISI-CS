                                                                                                                       7                                      Abhra hands EB the title
            IMTIAZ AHMED                      
	Guwahati: Abhra Mondal, who was deemed a villain two months back when he conceded five goals in an I-League encounter against arch-rivals Mohun Bagan, turned out to be East Bengals saviour Sunday.         
	The agile goalkeeper anticipated every shot correctly in the penalty shootout to help East Bengal end their title drought beating Lajong FC 3-0 in the 31st Hero Honda Federation Cup final at the floodlit Nehru Stadium here this evening.         
	A brilliant Abhra parried three consecutive shots from the Lajong players to give the red and gold brigade a much-needed title triumph.         
	Abhras Lajong counterpart, Gumpe Rime, who was otherwise excellent in keeping the East Bengal players at bay for 120 minutes, couldnt replicate the performance in the tie-breakers.         
	It was disappointment for the thousands of Lajong fans who had thronged to the stadium expecting an upset. Lajongs Anil Gurung, Samson Ramengmawia and Kyrshan Lyngshing failed to convert from the spot, while for East Bengal, Yusif Yakubu, Nirmal Chetri and Sanju Pradhan succeeded in putting the ball in the net. Harmanjot Singh Khabras shot rebounded off the crosspiece.         
	Playing against a young and swift outfit supported by almost the entire 24,000-strong crowd, the Calcutta giants started cautiously. Taking the advantage, the Shillong team made a few early forays into the East Bengal territory.         
	But the red and gold brigade capitalised on it to initiate some counter-attacks which pushed the Lajong men onto the backfoot.         
	East Bengal dominated most of the match and Lajong were mostly left to defending. Coach Stanley Rozarios boys could hardly initiate any move till the last few minutes of the regulation time, which, too, was ably tackled by the experienced defenders of the Phillippe de Ridder-coached side.         
	With their defence, manned by Zohmingliana Ralte, Ailad Kinta and Wailadmi Passah, falling too weak to resist the attacks of Yusif Yakubu, Mehtab Hussain and Sanju Pradhan, it was left to the veteran Rime to bring about spectacular saves to keep his team in contention.         
	The Shillong outfit missed the services of some of their key players, including the two foreigners  James Gbilee and Daniel Bidemi  who were out with double bookings. Bidemis absence in the defence was evident as almost the whole of the Lajong team had to come down in aid of their defence on most of the occasions.         
	Though Lajong managed to keep a clean sheet during regulation and extra time, keeper Rime couldnt help his side in the tie-breakers and create history as the first team from the Northeast to lift the coveted trophy.         
	A victory Sunday could have opened floodgates of opportunities for Lajong as they would have qualified for the AFC Cup.         
	Poor finishing from the East Bengal strikers meant that no goals were scored despite several opportunities being created.         
	The title victory would not only lift East Bengals spirit and boost their confidence after a disastrous start to the season, but has also earned them a place in the AFC Cup. The tournament, as well as the final clash, was also a confidence booster for Lajong who will hope to carry their good form into the I-League.         
	Along with the silverware, East Bengal went home richer by Rs 12 lakh in prize money and Lajong by Rs 7 lakh. Pune FC were awarded the fair play trophy.

  - United lead Chelsea and Arsenal by two points             Manchester Uniteds Wayne Rooney scores his third goal as Dimitar Berbatov looks on, in Manchester, on Saturday                           
	Manchester: Wayne Rooney scored four goals Saturday to send Manchester United to the top of the Premier League with a 4-0 victory over Hull.         
	Rooney took just eight minutes to beat Hull goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, latching onto the rebound after a shot from Paul Scholes was parried.         
	But it proved tough for United until Rooney added three more in the last ten minutes to take his tally for the season to 20 goals.         
	Wayne Rooney was the undoubted highlight of the match. Its the first time that hes scored four goals for us. He is in great goal-scoring form right now, United manager Alex Ferguson said.         
	Hell beat his previous best (season) tally of 23 goals, Im sure of that. Hes in excellent form. Its only encouraging for Wayne because hes wanted to develop himself as a scorer.         
	We are happy Being top is significant at this stage of the season. I know Chelsea have got games in hand but they have to win those games.         
	United have a two-point lead over both Arsenal and Chelsea.         
	Arsenal, though, have a game in hand over United and Chelsea have played two fewer matches than the champions.         
	United and Hull were playing on FA Cup fourth-round day after being eliminated from the competition earlier this month.         
	Ferguson used his program notes to urge fans to unite despite their concerns about the clubs debts, but the match started with chants against the owning Glazer family.         
	United, though, profited early on from Myhills failure to hold onto Scholess shot and Rooney pounced on the loose ball.         
	With Michael Owen making a rare start, United struggled to find a second goal until Dimitar Berbatov replaced the English striker with 17 minutes left.         
	Rooney then exploited a chaotic situation in the area in the 82nd to make it 2-0 after Myhill fumbled Nanis free kick onto his own bar and then flattened defender Andy Dawson.         
	The England forward then headed in Nanis cross four minutes later and added the fourth in stoppage time when he slotted home from Berbatovs cross.           (AGENCIES)

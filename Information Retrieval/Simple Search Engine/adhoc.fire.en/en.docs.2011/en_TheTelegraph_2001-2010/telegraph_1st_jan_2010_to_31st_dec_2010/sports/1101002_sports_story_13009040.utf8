The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting, Zaheer in verbal joust
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting, Zaheer in verbal joust
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: All pre-match talk of controlled aggression and harmony between teams were thrown out of the boundary when the opening days play of the first India-Australia Test, in Mohali, witnessed a showdown between Zaheer Khan and Ricky Ponting.         
	The Indians were frustrated by a 141-run second wicket partnership between Shane Watson and Ponting. As a result, when Ponting was finally dismissed, thanks to a smart piece of fielding by Suresh Raina in the post-lunch session, a pumped up Zaheer couldnt resist throwing a few words at the Australian captain.         
	Ponting was walking back to the hut, but Zaheers taunt made him turn back. He was walked towards the huddled-up Indians with his bat pointing towards the hosts.         
	But umpire Billy Bowden intervened and Ponting decided not to react further and went back to the pavilion.         
	Match Referee Chris Broad summoned Zaheer at the end of the days play and had a word with him. However, according to Indian teams BCCI coordinator Mayank Parikh it was just a friendly chat.         
	Watson, at the media conference, indirectly put the blame on Zaheer. Well, everyone saw the footage and know what happened. Zaheer said something after Rickys dismissal and that escalated the matter. We all know what kind of a person Ricky is He never initiates a war of words unless the other person steps out of the line. He knows how important it is for him as the Australian captain to keep things under control, Watson said.         
	India Pragyan Ojha played down the matter as nothing serious. When two top teams clash, such an incident is not unexpected. If you are playing hard, some words will be exchanged. Its not that serious, Ojha said.         
	Someone rightly said: There can be peace only among the dead.

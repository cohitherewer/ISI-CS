	Calcutta/Dubai: Crickets governing body, ICC, has called for more co-operation from international cricketers after Pakistan wicket-keeper Zulqarnain Haider fled the team hotel claiming he had received death threats.         
	Haider, 24, fled to London without telling the team management and Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) of the International Cricket Council (ICC) of the threats. ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said Haiders case highlighted the importance of sharing corruption information.         
	I think we have to build the confidence amongst the players that the right thing to do is to speak to the ACSU officials if they have got anything that they want to declare, Lorgat said.         
	The ICC has confirmed, in a statement, that it is in regular communication with the Pakistan Cricket Board and has offered to support the PCB in its current investigations into the reasons behind Haiders decision to leave the team.         
	Lorgat said Haider made a mistake by not informing the ACSU of the threats. I dont think it was wise of him to have done what he did, because it doesnt solve the problems for him as well and the right thing would have been to speak to the ACSU, said the ICC chief executive.

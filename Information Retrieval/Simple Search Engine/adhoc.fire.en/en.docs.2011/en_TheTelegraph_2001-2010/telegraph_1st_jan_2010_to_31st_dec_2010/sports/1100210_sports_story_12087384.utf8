The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SSP, Atwal upbeat about chances
                                                                                                                       7                                      SSP, Atwal upbeat about chances
                      
	Gurgaon: Hoping to recapture the form that fetched him his maiden European Tour title two years ago, SSP Chowrasia has made slight changes to his swing ahead of the tri-sanctioned Avantha Masters here this week.         
	Chowrasia says he is relishing the prospect of playing the $2.1 million event in front of his home fans.         
	The 31-year-old secured the co-sanctioned Indian Masters and is aiming to produce another memorable win in the event sanctioned by the European, Asian and Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI).         
	Ive always enjoyed playing at the DLF Golf and Country Club. Ive changed my swing a little and Im experiencing a better feel to my game. My form is very good, said Chowrasia.         
	Chinas Liang Wen-chong, meanwhile, has sacrificed his all-important annual Chinese Lunar New Year reunion dinner to compete at this weeks inaugural Avantha Masters.         
	The Chinese Lunar New Year falls this weekend and Liang, the 2007 Asian Tour Order of Merit champion, has decided to give it a miss in pursuit for glory in the February 11-14.         
	As a professional, there are sacrifices to be made and this weeks event will be one of them, said Liang.         
	India has been a happy hunting ground for Liang as he won his second Asian Tour title here in 2008 and he is looking forward to another happy return.         
	Its always nice to return to the place that brought you fond memories. I hope Ill leave here with sweet memories again at the end of the week, said Liang.         
	Meanwhile, Orlando-based Arjun Atwal is yearning to be back in the winners circle again.         
	The strapping 36-year-old golfer said the career-threatening shoulder injury is now behind him and he was out to recapture his old form.         
	I am looking forward to playing more this year since I have now fully recovered from my shoulder injury, Atwal said.         
	Unfortunately I got injured just when I was getting into rhythm last year. I did not have much of a season from there on. But I want to make up for it now. The challenge for me now is to get back into contention again, he added, who won the Asian Tour event Hero Honda Masters here in 2003.         
	I have been in the process of trying to change my swing since last season, so just want to concentrate on that aspect for the time being and as such have not set any targets for myself, he said.         
	Its a very competitive field this week and Im all keyed up to give it my best shot as I really like the layout of this course, said the former Asia No. 1.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aamer has the ability, says Wasim Akram
                                                                                                                       7                                        Aamer has the ability, says Wasim Akram
            Nick Hoult            Mohammed Aamer                           
	It is a long time since a Test series in England started with so much focus on both bowling attacks. There are different reasons why the bowlers of Pakistan and England will be under close examination when the first Test begins at Trent Bridge on Thursday, but one thing is for sure  the battle should make compelling viewing.         
	Last weeks events at Headingley between Pakistan and Australia proved it is batsmen suffering that provides Test crickets thrill factor.         
	Whereas it is the number of faces on parade that is the issue for the England management to grapple with, as they choose between four and five bowlers, it is the excitement of a new star rising which gives Pakistan hope for a successful series in this country.         
	Mohammed Aamer is only 18 and has played just 10 Tests for Pakistan, but his ability to swing the ball both ways at a decent nip was too much for some of the worlds best batsmen as Australia sunk to 88 all out in Leeds.         
	Several times during that match comparisons were made between Aamer and the finest left-arm quick of them all, Wasim Akram. It was Wasim who discovered Aamer three years ago at a training camp in the villages around Rawalpindi and he is convinced the pupil has already outstripped his master in terms of development.         
	He is definitely a much cleverer bowler at his age than I was, Wasim said. He is only going to improve from here. He is nippy and he swings the ball.         
	He is the perfect bowler for these conditions and he is a quick learner. I am very impressed by his performances so far. He is a wise bowler and it doesnt matter how quick you are as long as you swing the ball. With Waqar [Younis, the Pakistan coach] around him he will definitely improve a lot more as long as he realises how much hard work is required because this is just the start for him.         
	Voices from the past must have been echoing in Wasims ears when he uttered that last line. It was in 1987 that a 21-year-old Wasim enjoyed a seminal tour to England, opening the bowling with Imran Khan and delivering Pakistans first Test series win.         
	Imran drove his young apprentice around the country on that trip and said to him you have to work like a dog, Wasim, to succeed. He listened, and went on to take 414 Test wickets all over the world.         
	Wasim enjoyed the advantage of bowling in good attacks throughout his career. First with Imran and then Waqar. Aamer has Mohammad Asif, whose control will help build pressure for his younger partner to exploit, and Umar Gul, who has more than 100 Test wickets, as first change.         
	Neither Pakistan nor England have an experienced attack. James Anderson has been around for a decade but his tally of 48 Tests makes him far from a veteran, and the sense that we may be watching two teams of the future over the next few weeks is a prospect to relish  and something that certainly was not the case when those ageing Australians were in town.         
	Englands bowlers have the edge, Wasim said. Stuart Broad got eight wickets last week, he has good nip and James Anderson swings the ball both ways. But Pakistan bowlers have learned very quickly.         
	It will be a close match as far as bowling is concerned but Pakistans batting will definitely struggle against the bowling of England, whereas English batting is more experienced in these conditions.         
	Wasim also believes that while Pakistan enjoyed their first Test win for 15 years over Australia, England will be harder opponents.         
	For the first time in a long time I have seen England have a confidence in how they think, he said.         
	They will be difficult to beat. I have seen England in patches but this is the first time I have seen them doing consistently well. They were exceptional in 2005 but then went to Australia and lost 5-0 and since then  downhill. When they won the World Twenty20, that gave them confidence and there is consistency in selection, they are winning and at home they are hard to beat.         
	Bowling tends to dominate series against Pakistan, right back to the very first when Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets at the Oval back in 1954, and then down the ages through the eras of Imran, Wasim, Waqar and Shoaib Akhtar. It is a trend that appears unlikely to change.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

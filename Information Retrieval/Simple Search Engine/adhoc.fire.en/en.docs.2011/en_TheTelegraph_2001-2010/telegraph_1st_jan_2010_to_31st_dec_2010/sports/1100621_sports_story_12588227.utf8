The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lippi: Sorry for not winning
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lippi: Sorry for not winning
                      
	Nelspruit: A disappointed Italy coach Marcello Lippi apologised to the Azzurri fans after his team were held to a 1-1 draw by New Zealand on Sunday.         
	Were just sorry we didnt win a match we could have, Lippi said. If we didnt win against New Zealand, its our fault. Once again the opponent scored on their first chance. We were able to control the game after that, but this was a match we should have won.         
	New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert was ecstatic after the match. Its the most incredible result weve had across the board. As a football coach, its way above anything weve achieved in the history of the game. We are always daring to dream. At the World Cup anything is possible  weve seen some strange results  but nothing as big as that one.         
	Lippi lamented the way his players continually resorted to high balls, something he had been wary of in the match build-up. Italy havent won since beating Sweden 1-0 in a friendly in November, a streak of five games that includes four draws.         
	Teams         
	Italy: Federico Marchetti, Gianluca Zambrotta, Giorgio Chiellini, Fabio Cannavaro, Domenico Criscito, Daniele de Rossi, Riccardo Montolivo, Claudio Marchisio (Giampaolo Pazzini, 61), Simone Pepe (Mauro Camoranesi, 46), Vincenzo Iaquinta, Alberto Gilardino (Antonio Di Natale, 46).         
	New Zealand: Mark Paston, Tony Lochhead, Winston Reid, Ivan Vicelich (Jeremy Christie 81), Ryan Nelsen, Simon Elliott, Shane Smeltz, Chris Killen (Andy Barron, 90), Leo Bertos, Rory Fallon (Chris Wood, 63), Tommy Smith.         
	Referee: Carlos Batres (Guatemala) (Agencies)

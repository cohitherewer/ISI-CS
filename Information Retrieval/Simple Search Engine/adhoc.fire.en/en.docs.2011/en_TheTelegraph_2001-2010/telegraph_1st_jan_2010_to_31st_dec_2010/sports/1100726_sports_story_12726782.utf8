            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar gained two places in the latest ICC rankings for Test batsmen to reach the sixth spot.         
	Indian opener Virender Sehwag, too, benefited as he not only retained his numero uno position but gained points and have 866 ratings points in his kitty. However, fellow opener Gautam Gambhirs poor form saw him slip five rungs to be ranked ninth in the rankings which were released on Sunday.         
	Gambhir, who got out cheaply in both the innings in first Test, against Sri Lanka, have 773 points, while Tendulkar has 795 points in his kitty.         
	Among other Indians to figure in the top-20 list, V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid, went down one place each to sit at the 14th and 18th spot respectively.         
	In the ICC rankings for Test bowlers, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and pacer Zaheer Khan were static in the top-20 bowlers chart, which is led by South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn. Zaheer was seventh with 722 points, followed by an off-colour Harbhajan, 47 points adrift.         
	In the ICC team rankings, India retained their No. 1 status with 124 points, followed by South Africa (120) and Australia (116). However, India might lose their number one ranking if Mahendra Singh Dhonis men lose the three-match Test series against Sri Lanka with a 0-2 or 0-3 margin.

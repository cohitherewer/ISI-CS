                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumble blames it on the batsmen
                      
	Chennai: Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble attributed his sides five-wicket defeat against the Chennai Super Kings Wednesday in the Indian Premier League to the loss of momentum towards the end of their batting, saying it had them 20 runs short of a challenging total.                     
	We had the momentum until the 13th or 14th over, but then we lost it a little bit, Kumble said referring to Jacques Kalliss inability to force the pace of scoring at a crucial stage in the game. We were some 20 runs short, and that made it a little hard for us.         
	Man of the Match and Super Kings opener Vijay was happy he contributed to the win but said he should have carried his bat till the end of the chase.         
	Its something I will work on. I am really happy that my contribution helped the team win. I enjoyed batting out there in front of my home crowd, said Vijay, who made a scintillating 39-ball 78.         
	This match really mattered to us as a team. Everyone was pumped up. (PTI)

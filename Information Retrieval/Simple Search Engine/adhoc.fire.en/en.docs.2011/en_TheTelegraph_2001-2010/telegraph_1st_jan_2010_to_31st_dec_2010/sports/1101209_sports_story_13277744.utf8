                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal fail to build on early wickets
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashok Dinda                           
	Calcutta: What could have been an excellent day for Bengal turned out to be a gritty show of resistance by Saurashtra. But for Sitanshu Kotak, Rahul Dave and Kamlesh Makvanas defiant knocks, Bengal could have realistically thought of clinching five points from this Ranji Trophy Super League tie on the very first day itself.         
	Saurashtra were staring at a low first innings total when Bengal reduced them to 169 for six. Manoj Tiwarys three-pronged pace attack  Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda and Saurav Sarkar  was looking threatening enough to polish off the remaining for Saurashtra batsmen in quick time.         
	However, Dave and Makvana ensured that it wasnt the case as they stitched an unbeaten 85-run stand for the seventh wicket to take the hosts to 254 for six at stumps, on Wednesday.         
	While Kotak made 71 while Dave remained unbeaten on 66. Apart from Kotak and Dave, opener Sager Jogiyani (52), Makvana (34 not out) and Chirag Pathak (20) made useful contributions for Saurashtra.         
	For Bengal, right-arm pacers Sarkar (2/59) and Dinda (2/53) scalped two wickets each while Bose and off-spinner Saurasish Lahiri (1/33) got one each.         
	Earlier opting to bat, Saurashtra witnessed a shaky start to their innings, losing Pathak and Bhushan Chauhan within the 50-run mark.         
	But Jogiyani and Kotak steadied the ship with a handy 63-run third wicket stand before two quick wickets halted the home teams march.         
	Jogiyani was the first to depart, caught by Anustup Majumdar off Lahiri and then skipper Jaydev Shah followed suit with a two-ball duck.         
	But then came another face-saving partnership from Saurasthra  a 60-run stand between Kotak and Dave  before Bengal once again bounced back into the match with two quick wickets.         
	After all the hard work, Kotak threw his wicket away giving a straightforward catch to Writam Porel off Dinda at the team score of 167. And two runs later, Pruthvipal Solanki also returned without disturbing the scorers, sneaking one to Sreevats Goswami behind the stumps off Dinda.         
	Kotak hit 11 boundaries en route his 118-ball innings.         
	However, after that Dave and Makwana displayed tremendous resolute as they negotiated as many as 37.3 overs to ensure Saurashtras safety at the close of the day.         
	While Daves unconquered 66 came off 184 deliveries during which he struck seven fours, Makvana faced 114 balls to score 34 runs.         
	Bengal captain Tiwary said that as the pitch eased out with the day, it was easier for the Saurashtra batsmen to survive.         
	Its a goo wicket to bat on At some point of time, big partnerships will happen on this track and that is what happened with Saurashtra.         
	However, I must say that our bowlers did a good job today (Wednesday), he said.         
	He also added that Bengal have the advantage of the second new ball which might help them to bundle out Saurashtra early on Thursday.         
	We will the second new ball That might help us in getting them out. But the pitch is definitely not producing as much help to the bowlers as we expected, he added.

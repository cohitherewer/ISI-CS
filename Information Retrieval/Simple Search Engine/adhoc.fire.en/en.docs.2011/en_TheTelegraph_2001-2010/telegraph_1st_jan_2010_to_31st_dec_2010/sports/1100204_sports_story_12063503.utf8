  - Chirag United move to second position in I-League standings, Dempo stay on top
            A STAFF REPORTER            Joshimar after scoring the second goal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Chirag United climbed up to the second spot when they defeated Lajong FC 2-0 in an I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium, here on Wednesday. Joshimar scored both the goals after the change of ends.         
	Chirag now have 23 points from 13 matches, three points behind table toppers Dempo Sports Club. The win pegged Lajong back to the 13th spot with 10 points from 13 matches.         
	It is indeed a satisfying end to the first leg for Subrata Bhattacharyas men and, at the post-match news conference, the coachs face said it all. We played well today and deservedly won the match, he said.         
	We have done a good job finishing the first leg in the second spot But if we think the job is done, we will be punished, he said.         
	Chirag got the first at the hour mark when substitute Narugopal Hait dribbled past three defenders and slipped it to Joshimar.         
	The Brazilians prompt right footer nestled into the far corner past an onrushing Gumpe Rime, the Lajong keeper.         
	The second one came 10 minutes later when Joshimar acrobatically headed in an Edmilson delivery from the right. Joshimar now is on top of the I-League scorers list with 11 goals and it proves that with limited talent you can survive in Indian football if you know how to be at the right place at the right time.         
	Lajong were in the game till the half-time. Left-half Rohmingthanga was making some runs down the flank and one of his crosses did create panic in the Chirag defence. But S. Tuboi, one of the revelations during the Federation Cup, failed to time his jump to perfection.         
	Then, just some minutes before first goal, Rohmingthanga played it to foreign recruit James Gbilee, who, with only rival keeper Somnath Khara at his mercy, shot over the bar.         
	The second half was completely dominated by Chirag as Bhattacharya brought in Hait in place of a nervous Rahul Kumari in the 46th minute. That was a masterstroke as Hait was a constant menace on the left side and Lajong had no answer to his pace.         
	Its difficult to win matches if you miss chances, Lajong coach Stanley Rozario said after the match. We have too many players in the sidelines and our inexperience is showing very badly. Hopefully, this break will help us to regroup, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf is unlikely for 2nd Test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yousuf is unlikely for 2nd Test
                      
	Karachi: Senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf is expected to join the Pakistan team in England Wednesday but is unlikely to play in the second Test starting on Friday.         
	Yousuf has a visit visa on which he cant play cricket in the United Kingdom. We have applied for a work permit visa and hopefully he will be issued the fresh visa on Tuesday, a PCB official said.         
	If he gets the visa on time, we will put him on the first available flight to London on Wednesday, the official said.         
	But he admitted that Yousuf is unlikely to be played directly in the second Test, against England, starting in Edgbaston from Friday.         
	In all probability, he will be given a chance to practice for a few days and also play a tour match before the third Test that begins on August 19, the official said.         
	Yousuf, a former Pakistan captain, kept a low profile Monday avoiding speaking to the media.         
	The senior batsman, who has played 88 Tests and 283 one-day Internationals, was called back from retirement to join the team after Pakistan lost the first Test against England by a whopping 354 runs in Nottingham.         
	Pakistan was bowled out for 80 runs in their second innings in that match.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan tour manager Yawar Saeed has rubbished reports that captain Salman Butt and head coach Waqar Younis were not taken into confidence regarding Yousufs call-up.         
	This is totally untrue. All decisions taken after the first Test were taken after taking Butt and Waqar into confidence. Ijaz Butt, chairman of PCB, spoke to the touring selection committee consisting of Salman, Waqar and myself. We all agreed on Yousuf and Razas inclusion and Danish Kanerias omission from the squad, Yawar said.         
	In a related development, PCBs legal team is finding it hard to explain Yousufs return to the national team despite the fact that the ban on him for indiscipline has not yet been lifted.         
	PCB legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi said that Yousuf had been picked for the Pakistan team because he didnt challenge his ban in March and retired from the international arena.         
	Since he didnt challenge the ban, it became permanent after the period of 30-days. And now the chairman of the board has the authority under the existing constitution to pardon a player directly and lift any penalty imposed on him, Rizvi said.         
	He said that it was under this clause that Yousuf had been asked to join the touring squad in England.         
	Yousuf himself recently made himself available for national selection when he said he was ready to play if Pakistan team needed him, the lawyer said.           (PTI)

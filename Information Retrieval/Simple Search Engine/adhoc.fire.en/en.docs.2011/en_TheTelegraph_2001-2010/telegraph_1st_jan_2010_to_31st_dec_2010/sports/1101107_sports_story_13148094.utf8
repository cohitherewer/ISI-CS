	London: A stoppage-time winner by Park Ji-Sung helped Manchester United close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to two points on Saturday as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 at Old Trafford.         
	South Korean Park had given United a first half lead but Wolves substitute Sylvan Ebanks-Blake replied after the break and it had looked like being a frustrating day for United who lost midfielder Owen Hargreaves five minutes into his comeback.         
	Unbeaten United moved above Arsenal into second spot with 23 points from 11 games, two behind Chelsea who play Liverpool on Sunday. Arsenal, who have 20, are also in action on Sunday against Newcastle United.         
	Tottenham Hotspur fell to earth with a thud after their midweek Champions League win over Inter Milan, losing 4-2 at Bolton Wanderers who moved above the London club to fifth thanks to two goals by Kevin Davies. Bottom club West Ham United threw away a 2-0 lead at Birmingham City to draw 2-2 while Everton and Blackpool also shared four goals.         
	Asamoah Gyan scored twice for Sunderland in a 2-0 defeat of Stoke City while Fulham equalised late in a 1-1 home draw with Aston Villa. Blackburn Rovers beat Wigan Athletic 2-1.         
	At the Reebok Stadium, Davies double and strikes from Gretar Rafn Steinsson and Martin Petrov condemned Spurs to their second successive domestic defeat.         
	The visitors had threatened to make a late comeback after going down 3-0, with Alan Hutton pulling one back in the 79th minute and Roman Pavlyuchenko adding another.         
	But substitute Petrov added a fourth for Bolton in injury time to seal the win against that team that conquered Inter 3-1 on Tuesday.         
	They worked hard and pressed us and didnt let us play, Spurs manager Harry Redknapp said. We were too open playing with wide men and we didnt defend well enough.         
	Spurs were missing Rafael van der Vaart and Aaron Lennon, who both sustained hamstring injuries during the week. A defensive lapse led to Bolton going in front in the 31st minute. Sandro lost possession to Fabrice Muamba, who played the ball on to Matt Taylor.         
	He then slipped it through to Davies, whose shot was too strong for Heurelho Gomes and found the bottom corner.         
	Redknapp decided to boost his attacking options at halftime, bringing on Pavlyuchenko for midfielder Wilson Palacios.           (AGENCIES)

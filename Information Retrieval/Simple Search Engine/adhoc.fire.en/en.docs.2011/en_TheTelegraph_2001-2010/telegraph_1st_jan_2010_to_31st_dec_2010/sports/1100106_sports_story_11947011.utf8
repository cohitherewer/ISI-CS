The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winning start for Sania
                                                                                                                       7                                      Winning start for Sania
                      
	Auckland: Sania Mirza made a winning start to the new season, getting the better of Swiss Stefanie Voegele in a hard-fought first round encounter of the $220,000 ASB Clascic WTA tournament here Tuesday.         
	The 57th ranked Indian came from behind to beat her opponent, placed 18 places below her in the ranking chart, 5-7, 6-1, 7-5 in opening round of the hard court event.         
	Sania has a tough pre-quarter final opponent in fourth seed and world No. 17 Francesca Schiavone of Italy, who beat French Stephanie Cohen-Aloro 6-2, 6-3 in her first round match.         
	Sania has never beaten Francesca, with whom she teamed up for the doubles in the past, in the three matches they have played against each other.         
	Meanwhile, Israels Shahar Peer shrugged off a protest at her presence and a security scare that forced the evacuation of the venue to advance to the second round.         
	A small group of people carrying placards and chanting against Israels treatment of Palestinians mingled outside the Auckland Tennis Centre before Peer took to Court Four for her first round match against Slovenias Polona Hercog.

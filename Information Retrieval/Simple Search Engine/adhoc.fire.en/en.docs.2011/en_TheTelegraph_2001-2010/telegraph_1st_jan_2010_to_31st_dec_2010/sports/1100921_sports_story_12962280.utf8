The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Disappointments are a part of my life: Yuvraj
                                                                                                                       7                                      Disappointments are a part of my life: Yuvraj
                      
	Patiala: Axed from the Test squad on the grounds of poor form and fitness, Yuvraj Singh Monday insisted he was in good nick during the Sri Lanka tour and the selectors decision has come as a big disappointment for him.         
	Struggling to cement his place in the Test side, Yuvraj believed scoring a century and a fifty in the two games he played in Sri Lanka should have earned him a place in the two-match series against Australia.         
	He had smashed a 118 in the practice game before the first Test at Galle, where he made 52 in the first innings.         
	Selection is not in my hands. In Sri Lanka I played two games. In the first I scored a hundred and in the second, a fifty. If thats not good enough, I cant say, he told reporters here.         
	Of course it is a disappointment but, disappointments have become a part of my life. In the last two years, I have had a lot of injuries and struggled. Its out of my hands, he added.         
	Yuvraj missed the second Test due to illness and was left out of the third after Suresh Raina scored a century on his debut in second match.         
	Asked about his fitness, the Punjab left-hander said: Its much better now. Sri Lanka tour was hard for me especially due to dengue and the neck injury. In the next few days I will be fitter.         
	Yuvraj lends a lot of solidity to the middle-order in the Indian ODI team but has never been a regular in the Test side.         
	Asked why he was struggling in the longer format of the game, Yuvraj said he himself could not identify the shortcomings.         
	Not a great feeling. For the last seven years I have been trying to cement my place in the Test team but have not been able to do that. And that is a big disappointment. The reasons may be many. The first reason even I dont know. Then I was injured and got ill.         
	I was satisfied with the last two games, and then Raina scored a hundred and he got the chance to play the next match. These things are not under my control, he said.         
	If I continue to be dropped like this, I will definitely have to look for something else, he said in a lighter vein.         
	Following a disappointing World Twenty20 in the West Indies, where he scored 74 runs in five matches, Yuvraj was dropped for the Asia Cup but returned to the side for the tour of Sri Lanka with three Tests and an ODI tri-series.         
	The tour included what Yuvraj calls the hardest part of his career.         
	Yuvraj, though, remained bullish about his future.         
	I have managed to be strong.. Im sure things are going to come good soon. Its time to really push the pedal and hit peak performance, he said.         
	Fractures of his hand, a cartilage tear in the wrist, neck strains and dengue have made his tenth season in international cricket most forgettable.         
	In the past year he averaged 33 in six Tests and 23 in 15 ODIs. Its just very sad because its all come at a time when batsmen peak  youre supposed to hit your best form at 28 or 29, he said.

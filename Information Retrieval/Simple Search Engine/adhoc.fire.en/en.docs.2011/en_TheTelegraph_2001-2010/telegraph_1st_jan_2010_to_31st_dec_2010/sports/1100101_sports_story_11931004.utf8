The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengals two for joy 
                                                                                                                       7                                      East Bengals two for joy 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Vengeance was East Bengals as the red and gold brigade on Thursday extracted sweet revenge for their 3-5 I-League loss to Mohun Bagan, showing their archrivals the door in the second semi-final of the Federation Cup with a 2-0 victory at the Nehru Stadium.         
	The Calcutta giants take on Lajong FC of Shillong in the final on Sunday.         
	Both goals came in the second session as East Bengal made Bagan pay for a rather off-colour show, especially by their forwards.         
	The script might have played out differently had Jose Ramirez Barreto converted a 33rd minute penalty.         
	Referee Shaji Kurian had awarded Bagan the spot kick for a Rahim Nabi tackle on Ishfaq Ahmed inside the penalty area but Bagan failed to make that count as Barreto shot wide.         
	The match started with Bagan looking to attack right from the word go.         
	They maintained the pressure on the opponents throughout the first half when they created several openings only to be let down by the profligacy of their strikers.         
	Indeed, Barreto appeared lethargic every time he got the ball.         
	Besides, Japanese recruit Ryuji Sueoka, too, squandered two easy opportunities. In the 20th minute, Sueokas header off a Barreto ball from inside the box went straight to custodian Abhra Mondal.         
	He was also found wanting in a one-on-one with the goalie in the 22nd minute.         
	Edeh Chidi, the Nigerian, too, failed to make his presence felt.         
	East Bengal came back strongly in the second session to turn the tables on their opponents.         
	They produced better moves, and at quick intervals, to force Bagan on to the backfoot.         
	The raids soon yielded the desired result as Ghanaian recruit Yusif Yakubu used his left foot to push in a corner by Sanju Pradhan that was headed on by Subhash Singh.         
	Having conceded the goal, Bagan went all out for the equaliser and soon had East Bengal scampering to defend their lead from repeated attempts by the Bagan raiders.         
	As Bagan pushed more bodies forward, East Bengal found the space they needed to launch a few counter-attacks. Bhaichung Bhutia was introduced in the 78th and as Subhash Singh made way for the star striker, the 12,000-strong crowd made it clear who their favourite was.         
	Bhaichungs presence soon began to make a difference and he became the provider for the 89th minute goal by Mehtab Hussain who made no mistake in anticipating a pass from the India captain to hit home.         
	Bagan further intensified their attacks at the fag end but could hardly manage the desired finishing touch as almost all the East Bengal players massed in front of the goal.         
	Teams         
	East Bengal: Abhra Mondal, Nirmal Chetri, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Uga Okpara, Saumik Dey, Syed Rahim Nabi, Sanju Pradhan, Mehtab Hussain, Alvito DCunha (Budiram Tudu, 23), Subhash Singh (Bhaichung Bhutia, 78), Yusif Yakubu (B. Beokhekhei, 90+3).         
	Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee, Biswajit Saha, Deepak Mondal (Sagram Mandi, 33), Sheikh Azim, Surkumar Singh, L. James Singh, Ryuji Sueoka, Rakesh Masih (Micky Fernandes, 51, Souvik Chakraborty, 84), Edeh Chidi, Jose Ramirez Barreto, Ishfaq Ahmed.         
	Referee: Shaji Kurien

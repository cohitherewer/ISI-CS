	Polokwane: Robert Koren scored a late goal Sunday to give Slovenia a 1-0 win over 10-man Algeria and first place in Group C of the World Cup.         
	The Slovenian captain scored with a long-range shot that Algeria goalkeeper Fawzi Chaouchi misjudged and allowed to bounce into the net off his arm in the 79th minute.         
	Everyone saw what happened with the ball, and what happened yesterday (Saturday) with Englands goalkeeper, Algeria coach Rabah Saadane said. You have to adjust to the flight of the ball.         
	Algeria substitute Abdelkader Ghezzal had been sent off seven minutes earlier, picking up a second yellow card for handling the ball inside the Slovenian penalty area. It was the tiny Balkan nations first ever World Cup victory after losing all three group matches in 2002 .         
	Algeria twice came close in first half when Nadir Belhadjs 25-meter (yard) free kick forced Slovenia goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to stretch and push the ball over the crossbar, and defender Rafik Halliche headed just wide.         
	Both sides knew heading into the match that a loss would be costly, with difficult encounters against England and the US left on the program. The Group C favourites drew 1-1 Saturday after a blunder by goalkeeper Robert Green cost England the victory.         
	Saadane said Chaouchi apologised to the team for fumbling the ball when Slovenia scored Sunday. We must recover and prepare for an even more difficult match against England, which is the best of the group, Saadane said.         
	The players in Polokwane showed nerves in the first half, frequently losing possession with inaccurate passes and crosses. Slovenias only scoring chance before the break was Valter Birsas long-range attempt in the 43rd, tipped over the bar in a spectacular save by Chaouchi.         
	There was some commotion in the stands during the break when former France great Zinedine Zidane, who is of Algerian descent, was forced to climb to a higher section to get away from autograph-seeking Algerian fans who were pushed back briskly by security guards.

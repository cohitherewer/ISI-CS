            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: India entered the last 16 of Asian Games football, when they thrashed Singapore 4-1 in their concluding Group D match, at Guangzhou, on Thursday.         
	Coach Sukhvinder Singh started with Gurpreet Singh Sandhu at the goal, as Laxmikant Kattimani was yet to recover from the injury he suffered during the match against Qatar. Fanai Lalrorama was brought at the defence in place of Robert Lalthlamuana, who was suspended after a double booking.         
	India opened the scoring in the 13th minute though Jewel Raja and Balwant Singh, who made it 2-0 with a long ranger early in the second half.         
	While Jibon Singh scored the third goal in the 66th minute, Manish Mathani thundered home a shot in the 74th minute.         
	Substitute Eugene Luo scored Singapores only goal in the 82nd minute when Gurpreet spilled a Shahdan Sulaiman free-kick. The boys played sparkling football to make this win possible, said a delighted Sukhwinder.         
	We were distinctly unlucky to return empty handed in the first two matches against Kuwait and Qatar. Fortunately today (Thursday) the players were able to convert the chances, the coach added.         
	India, who finished third in the group with three points, qualified for last 16 on the basis of being one of the four best third placed teams.         
	The final six group matches of the competition will be played on Saturday but India have secured a place in the knock-out round as Uzbekistan and Maldives, the third-placed teams of Group E and F, respectively, were eliminated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilip: Council to blame, too
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dilip: Council to blame, too
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Dilip Vengsarkar                           
	Mumbai: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar Tuesday said that the Indian Premier League Governing Council collectively, and not chairman Lalit Modi alone, needed to take responsibility for the recent controversy surrounding the lucrative T20 league.         
	The Governing Council has to take equal blame. They are the ones who ratify the decisions taken by (Lalit) Modi, Vengsarkar said on the sidelines of a promotional event here.         
	All these allegations have tarnished the image of the game. We have become laughing stock for the world. Now it is up to the BCCI to restore the reputation of the game, he said.         
	Modi was Monday suspended from taking part in any activities of the IPL and the BCCI after being showcaused by the cricket board.         
	But not everything about the IPL was a cause for concern, according to the former chairman of selectors.         
	Vengsarkar believes the T20 tournament has been a good preparation for the Indian squad for the World T20 in the West Indies.         
	The IPL was a good platform ahead of the World T20. A lot of our youngsters played in the IPL, so it must have provided good match practice to them. We should do well, he said.

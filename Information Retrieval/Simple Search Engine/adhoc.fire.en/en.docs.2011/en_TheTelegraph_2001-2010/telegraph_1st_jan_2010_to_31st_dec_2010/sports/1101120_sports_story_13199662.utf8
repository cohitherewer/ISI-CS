  - Ranji Trophy Sriram unbeaten on 89 as Assam reach 293 for three       A STAFF REPORTER            Assams S. Sriram on way to his unbeaten 89, during the Ranji Trophy match against Bengal, at the Eden, on Friday. (PTI)                                       
	Calcutta: Experience came to good use for Assam as Sridharan Sriram and skipper Amol Muzumdar bolstered the visitors innings by stitching a 126-run 3rd wicket partnership on the third day of their Ranji Trophy Super League match against Bengal, on Friday.         
	At stumps, Assam were 293 for the loss of three wickets, with Sriram and Arlen Konwar at the crease. The day negated any claims of superiority by Bengal bowlers null and void as they struggled hard in search of a first innings lead only to be rendered toothless by a flat Eden track.         
	Ranadeb Bose, Sourashish Lahiri, Laxmi Ratan Shukla bowled their hearts out but didnt manage a breakthrough. However, debutant pacer Shami Ahmed was an exception.         
	Despite missing the start of the day due to high fever, he came in the post-lunch session (46th over) and claimed his first victim in his second over, in the form of Shib Shankar Roy (89). He followed the good work up by dismissing Dheeraj Jadhav before finally getting the better of Muzumdar.         
	Apart from bowling, Bengals porous fielding once again came across as a concern.         
	Looking at the colossal target ahead of them, it was expected that Assam would play a direct action day. However, the minnows seemed to be in no great hurry as Jadhav and Roy lingered at the crease and played the slow and steady game, while belting occasional boundaries.         
	When on 37, Roy had a reprieve when Writam Porel dropped him at short-leg, off Saurashish. He, however, took his time to notch up 89, which included 18 boundaries. After his exit, Sriram came in and tried to increase the pace of the game.         
	However, the partnership between Jadhav and Sriram was shortlived, as Shami castled Jadhav (62). Assam were 167 for two, when captain Muzumdar came in to partner Sriram.         
	The duo played a speedy game sending the Bengal fielders on a leather hunt. To Muzumdar (44) and Sriram goes the credit of enhancing the pace of the match as they employed some brilliant shots. Shami was successful in breaching Muzumdars defence too. While a visibly disappointed Muzumdar walked back to the pavilion, Sriram continued manning the post along with Konwar.         
	I was not looking at the scoreboard, said Sriram. We needed to maintain the momentum So, I kept playing. Commenting on the Bengal bowling and the lack of movement, Sriram said: It is a two-day old wicket. You cannot completely blame them. We got early success with the ball because the strip was responding to the seamers. But, at the end of the day, it remains a very good batting track.         
	The former Tamil Nadu batsman was also happy with his first season for Assam. It has been good We (Assam) have a good bunch of boys and the pace bowling is great.         
	The Bengal camp, meanwhile, were plagued by health concerns. While, Shami bowled despite being not his hundred percent, captain Manoj Tiwary stayed away from the action with high fever. Wriddhiman Saha donned the captains cap in Tiwarys absence.

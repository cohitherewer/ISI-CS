                    Serena Williams   on Saturday                
	London: Second-seeded Rafael Nadal survived a huge scare from 33rd-seeded German Philipp Petzschner to move into the fourth round of Wimbledon, Saturday.         
	Nadal, battling injuries to his left arm and right thigh, needed more than three and a half hours to defeat Petzschner 6-4, 4-6, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3.         
	The Spaniard made the decisive break in eighth game of the final set before holding serve to love to close out the match.         
	Nadal will play unseeded Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu for a berth in the quarter finals.         
	Defending champion Serena Williams put on a serving clinic Saturday, hitting 20 aces in a straight-sets win over Dominika Cibulkova that set up a fourth-round matchup with former champion Maria Sharapova.         
	The top-seeded American had at least two aces in each of her eight service games and overpowered the 46th-ranked Slovak 6-0, 7-5 on Centre Court.         
	Serving that well feels awesome, Serena said. I serve well at Wimbledon for some unknown reason. I want to keep doing it. I wish I could serve like this every tournament.         
	Serena won 37 of 43 service points and held at love five times. She won 19 of her first 20 service points, with Cibulkova putting only four returns in play in that stretch.         
	The 20 aces matched Serenas total from last years semi-finals at Wimbledon, the highest number on record by a woman at the All England Club.         
	The first set lasted just 18 minutes, with Serena winning 25 of 31 points, serving six aces and hitting 12 winners. It was the third match in a row that Serena won the first set 6-0.         
	Cibulkova, a semi-finalist at the French Open last year, finally got on the scoreboard when she held serve for 1-1 in the second set. From then on, she kept the match competitive by holding serve, although she couldnt cope with Serenas serves. Cibulkova saved a match point while serving at 4-5 with a crosscourt backhand winner, but Serena broke in the 12th game to close out the match.         
	Serena, chasing her fourth Wimbledon title and 13th Grand Slam crown, will face Sharapova on Monday in a rematch of the 2004 final won by the glamourous Russian.         
	Sharapova served an ace on match point to beat Czech player Barbora Zahlavova Strycova 7-5, 6-3. It was an uneven performance by Sharapova, who overcame 35 unforced errors and six double faults.         
	Sharapova is coming back into top form after right shoulder surgery in 2008. Because she is seeded 16th, she and Serena are meeting in the fourth round rather than the later stages.         
	Despite her easy run through the first three rounds this week, Serena said she didnt feel she is playing as well as last year when she beat sister Venus in the final.         
	Sharapova said she was looking forward to the showdown with Serena.         
	I love playing against her, Sharapova said. Shes the defending champion. Shes great on this surface. .         
	Also Saturday, third-seeded Caroline Wozniacki made it to the fourth round by beating Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-4. Shell face unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova, who upset 14th-seeded Victoria Azarenka 7-5, 6-0.         
	Seventh-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska advanced with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Sara Errani of Italy. Other women winners were 9th-seed Li Na and Klara Zakopalova         
	In mens play, sixth-seeded Robin Soderling beat the 24th-ranked Thomaz Bellucci 6-4, 6-2, 7-5, his third straight victory without losing a set. Mens winners included 9th-seeded David Ferrer and Frenchmen Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Paul-Henri Mathieu and Julien Benneteau.         
	In another development, Victor Hanescu has been fined $15,000 by Wimbledon officials after a spitting incident in his third-round match.         
	The Romanian was fined $7,500 on Saturday for unsportsmanlike conduct after swearing and spitting in the direction of hecklers in the crowd. He was fined the same amount for not using best efforts at the conclusion of Fridays match against Germanys Daniel Brands.         
	Following a review conducted by the Championships referee in association with the Grand Slam supervisors into the incident on Court 18 Friday evening, the player Victor Hanescu has been fined $7,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct and a further $7,500 for not using best efforts at the conclusion of the match, a statement from event referee Andrew Jarrett said.         
	The Romanian foot-faulted and served a series of double faults in the final game of his match before retiring while trailing 0-3 in the fifth set. He said he had a leg muscle injury. The fine will be deducted from his prize money of $46,780 and he has 10 days to appeal the decision.

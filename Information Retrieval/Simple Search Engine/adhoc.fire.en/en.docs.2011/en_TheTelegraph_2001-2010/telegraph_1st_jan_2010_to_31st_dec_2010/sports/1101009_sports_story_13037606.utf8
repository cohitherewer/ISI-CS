	Pune: After suffering a narrow defeat against Hong Kong on Monday, India were right on target with Sunil Chetri scoring a fluent hattrick to guide India to a 3-1 victory over Vietnam in an international friendly played at the Balewadi sports complex here Friday.         
	Chetri opened the scoring in the 25th minute. He made no mistake completing his brace in the 49th minute and putting India in the driver seat. He followed it up with his third goal in the 72nd minute, before Vu Nhu Thanh pulled one back for the visitors from the spot in the 62nd minute.         
	Vietnams fight-back ear-ned them a goal in the 62nd minute as Dao Van Phong was brought down by Surkumar Singh inside the box.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Pretoria: Jonas Gutierrez is the latest member of the Diego Maradona fan club in the Argentine squad after Juan Sebastian Veron, Lionel Messi and Martin Palermo.         
	The Newcastle United player said that against Mexico, on Sunday, he would do everything to see his manager happy. He did so much for me when I was down and out, said Gutierrez. I want to repay him back by winning the match against Mexico, he added.         
	When Newcastle got relegated, I thought my place in the Argentine team would be in danger. But Maradona assured me that I would be judged by my form in the national team. You need not worry, he told me. That was a big gesture on his part, said the defender.         
	Similar sentiments were expressed by Veron and Martin a few days back. Veron said he would not have been in the team without Maradonas backing.         
	They all wanted me out but the manager thought I was good and included me in the squad. I must do everything to honour his judgement, said the seasoned campaigner.         
	Palermo is another player, who owes it to Maradona for being in the team. You can say anything but he would be in the team, Maradona told the Palermo critics before the World Cup. He is a very important member of my squad, he had said.         
	Palermo was quick to repay his manager when he scored against Greece. It was an extremely satisfying performance, Palermo said.

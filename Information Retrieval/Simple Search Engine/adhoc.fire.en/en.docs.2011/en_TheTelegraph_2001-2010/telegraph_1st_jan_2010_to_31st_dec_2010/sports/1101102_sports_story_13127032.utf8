The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wouldnt write Tiger off 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wouldnt write Tiger off 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Lee Westwood insists Tiger Woods should not be written off after deposing the American as world No. 1. Westwood has been confirmed as Europes first No. 1 since Nick Faldo in 1994, after Martin Kaymer failed to produce the top-two finish he needed in the Andalucia Masters to claim top spot himself.         
	But Woods, Kaymer and Phil Mickelson could all make Westwoods reign at the top a matter of days at this weeks WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai, where all four players are in action. And Westwood knows it would be foolish to write off 14-time major champion Woods, who has struggled badly ever since a sex scandal which erupted in November last year forced him to take a long break from the game.         
	I would not write Tiger off as quickly as that, Westwood said. He has gone away and come back before.         
	He will be there or thereabouts. If anyone can put a run together its so close they could take the number one spot.         
	But its taken me a long time to reach world number one, Im not going to worry about who I am going to lose it to.         
	This week is going to be very exciting for golf, with four people having a chance to get to number one, but I like those kind of rivalries.         
	[Agencies add: I think the achievements of Indias own players in Europe, America and Asia have greatly boosted the profile of the game in the subcontinent, Lee told a sports magazine. I am sure the game will continue to grow in India because youngsters now have great role models within their own country.         
	[The 37-year-old golf pro, a huge fan of Indian food, has also expressed his wish to visit the country at some time in the future. quot;I love Indian food and Im sure Jeev (Milkha Singh) and Shiv (Kapur) know all the best places to go to, quot; he added.]         
	Westwoods achievement is all the more remarkable given the calf injury, which has hampered his season, but the 37-year-old was in confident mood as he headed to Shanghai this afternoon. It feels as good as it has for three or four months, Westwood added. Its not quite right, but its nearly there.         
	Ive been hitting balls and hitting it well and Im looking forward to getting out to China. Being world No 1 will give me that extra urge, if I needed it.         
	Its a great honour and a big responsibility. It certainly sounds and feels good right now.

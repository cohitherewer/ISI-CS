The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough task ahead of England
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tough task ahead of England
          
	Cape Town: South Africa moved into a strong position to win the third Test and level the series after England, chasing an unlikely 466 to win, reached 132 for three at the close on the Day IV at Newlands on Wednesday.         
	England openers Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook put on a century opening stand before Friedel de Wet, left-arm spinner Paul Harris and Dale Steyn claimed a wicket apiece in the final session.         
	Cook looked in fine form as he scored a fluent 55, but De Wet removed the left-hander with his third ball of his second spell.         
	Cook lashed out at a delivery outside off stump, his attempted pull shot merely skying the ball and allowing wicket-keeper Mark Boucher to take an easy catch.         
	Three overs later, Strauss was out for 45, caught at short-leg off Harris, and South Africa were on the charge.           (REUTERS)

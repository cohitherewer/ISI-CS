The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak struggle after comical run outs
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pak struggle after comical run outs

	Hobart: Pakistans ability to self-destruct came to the fore again as opener Salman Butt undermined their reply to Australias mammoth first innings total with two comical run outs on the second day of the final Test here Friday.         
	The tourists were already up against it after Australia declared on 519 for eight  captain Ricky Ponting hitting 209 and his deputy Michael Clarke chipping in with 166  but their hopes of posting a solid response were hit when they slumped to 94 for four at stumps.         
	Butt was largely responsible for the slump after being involved in the dismissals of skipper Mohammed Yousuf and Umar Akmal. The first came after Yousuf played a superb off-drive off Doug Bollinger, and after running two, called for a legitimate and easily obtainable third. Despite the fact that Yousuf was running to the danger end, Butt refused to run, leaving his captain stranded. Incredibly, Butt refused to run again a few overs later to leave Umar stranded.         
	The run-outs came after Peter Siddle had taken two wickets to leave Pakistan reeling. They ended the day, needing another 226 runs just to avoid the follow-on. Resuming on 302 for three, Ponting and Clarke, continued to humiliate the Pakistan bowlers as they eventually put on 352 for the fourth wicket before Clarke was bowled by leg-spinner Danish Kaneria shortly after lunch, without offering a shot.         
	Ponting went on to make 209, his third-highest Test score, before young pacer Mohammed Aamer finally claimed his wicket, having been responsible for dropping the local hero on the first day before he had even scored.         
	It was the second-highest fourth-wicket partnership in Australias Test history as Ponting and Clarke only narrowly missed out on wiping out one of the many records held by arguably Australias two greatest batsmen in Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford. That legendary pair still hold the fourth-wicket record of 388, set against England at Leeds in 1934.         
	But incredibly Pakistan missed yet another chance to get rid of Ponting with another dropped catch in the first session. That came when Ponting was on 167 after the Tasmanian launched a full-blooded cover drive off Kaneria which went straight through the hands of Imran Farhat at cover.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Now, Semenya withdraws
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES            Caster Semenya                           
	New Delhi/ Johannesburg: Caster Semenya will miss the Commonwealth Games because of a back injury, dealing the troubled event the additional blow of being without one of track and fields most high-profile athletes.         
	South Africas Olympic Committee chief executive Tubby Reddy said Tuesday the womens 800m world champion is not yet fit to make her return to major competition at the October 3-14 Games in New Delhi.         
	Caster has been experiencing back pain for some period of time and continued to have pain after competing in a cross-country event at the weekend, Reddy said. Our doctor has since examined her and referred her for an MRI scan. This scan confirmed that she most certainly has a back problem.         
	We are satisfied that this is a bona fide injury and as such, SASCOC and Athletics South Africa agree that we are not in a position to compromise her health by risking her competing at New Delhi.         
	South African world champion 800m runner Mbulaeni Mulaudzi also pulled out due to a nagging back injury.         
	After Semenyas pull out, the chances for Indian youngster Tintu Luka to win a medal in the Commonwealth Games brighten as seasons two top performers, Kenyans Janeth Jepkosgei and Nancy Langat have already pulled out.         
	Jamaican Kenia Sinclair, who won silver in 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, and Semenya are the next joint top performers of the season at 1:58.16 behind Jepkosgei and Langat.         
	Luka comes next to them among Commonwealth athletes participating in the Games at 1:59.17 which she clocked at the IAAF/VTB Continental Cup in Yugoslavia early this month.         
	The 19-year-old Semenya, who was cleared to run again by the IAAF in July after an 11-month layoff because of gender tests, had said that winning gold at the Commonwealth Games was her No. 1 goal for 2010 following her return. She won four of her six comeback races in Europe over the last two months, but is now facing another setback.         
	Meanwhile, England tennis player Richard Bloomfield also pulled out after failing to recover from a back injury. Bloomfield, rated as Englands fifth-best tennis player, opted out of the quadrennial event on Monday, after failing to regain full fitness from a long-term back problem which he aggravated during a tournament in France earlier this month.         
	Josh Goodall will replace the 302nd ranked Bloomfield.         
	Im very disappointed to miss out on the Commonwealth Games. I was really looking forward to representing my country, particularly given this is the first time tennis has been part of the Games.         
	Englands Commonwealth Games tennis team captain, Paul Hutchins, said inspite of leading a depleted squad, he was hopeful of a good performance in the Delhi Games.

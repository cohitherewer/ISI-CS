The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach: Will decide on Gambhir today
                                                                                                                       7                                      Coach: Will decide on Gambhir today
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Delhi DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd is still not sure whether Gautam Gambhir would be fit to play against the Kolkata Knight Riders in the crucial Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Kotla on Monday.         
	Asked whether Gambhir, who suffered a hamstring injury during the DareDevils first home match against the Mumbai Indians, was fit to resume, the Aussie coach said: He is getting close to fitness and improving rapidly. But we will take a final call tomorrow (Monday).         
	If he doesnt play tomorrow, hopefully we will get him in the next match, added Shipperd. As a captain, he is keen to play and is a vital member of the team.         
	Gambhir, along with Ashish Nehra, were flown to Sri Lanka by the DareDevils management by a chartered flight for special ayurvedic treatment. Both the players returned home last Monday but did not play the next match.         
	Shipperd said: Since Gambhir is also an important member of the Indian team, we cannot take chances.         
	Meanwhile, Paul Collingwood, one of the DareDevils foreign recruits who is yet to play a match in the third edition of the IPL, said more foreigners should be allowed to play in the starting eleven.         
	If more foreigners are allowed to be included in the playing eleven, it will make the game more exciting, though I know that some Indian youngsters would miss out. The IPL gives domestic players the opportunity to grow up.         
	The England T20 captain was hopeful of getting a chance to play against the Knights.

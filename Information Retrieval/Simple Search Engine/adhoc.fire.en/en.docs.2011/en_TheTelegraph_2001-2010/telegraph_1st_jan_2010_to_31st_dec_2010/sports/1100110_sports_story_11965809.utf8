The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICCs process continues, ODI footage sent to panel
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICCs process continues, ODI footage sent to panel
  - It rsquo;s assumed that the Ferozeshah Kotla cannot escape a 12-month ban
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: President David Morgans views on the Kotla fiasco notwithstanding, the process initiated by the International Cricket Council (ICC) has gained momentum.         
	The Kotla is one of the venues for the 2011 World Cup and is scheduled to host four games between February 24-March 9.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle and Dave Richardson, the general manager-cricket, have each been sent a recording of the December 27 India-Sri Lanka ODI which was abandoned after 23.3 overs.         
	Madugalle (a former Sri Lanka captain) and Richardson, who served South Africa with distinction for much of the 1990s, will determine the quantum of punishment.         
	Besides reviewing the footage, Madugalle and Richardson will, via a teleconference, discuss Match Referee Alan Hursts report and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s version of what happened that morning.         
	While Madugalle is on assignment in Australia, Richardson gets back to work in Dubai on Sunday/Monday, after a year-end vacation in South Africa.         
	Should Hursts opinion, that the pitch was unfit for play be upheld, the Kotla will be banned from staging cricket for a period of between 12 and 24 months.         
	Hurst, who once opened the attack for Australia, is seen as a pro and doesnt lack credibility.         
	Many in the BCCI and its Delhi affiliate are rejoicing over what Morgan said in London the other day, basically that he didnt favour a long ban, but the two judges are expected to take an independent view.         
	Less than a year ago, Madugalle and Richardson had upheld Hursts unfit certificate given to the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. Thats pretty significant.         
	The West Indies-England Test there lasted a mere 10 deliveries.         
	Morgan has gone to the extent of saying that the World Cup would be poor without matches being hosted in New Delhi, but the Kotlas status wouldnt be threatened if Madugalle and Richardson slapped the minimum ban, 12 months.         
	Its being assumed in most quarters that the punishmnent would be just that.         
	Look, a 12-month ban would send the right signal  essentially, that dangerous pitches wont be tolerated. At the same time, the Kotla would be able to host the four World Cup games, one of the sources pointed out.         
	The BCCI will, of course, have the right to appeal. However, if matters come to that, then the process already in motion is going to take time.         
	Its not official, but the BCCIs contention seems to be that the pitch was poor, not unfit. May sound strange, but for first-time offenders, a poor rating invites no more than a warning and/or a fine not exceeding $15,000.         
	Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar, the ICC vice-president, expects Madugalle and Richardson to give their verdict by next week. Thats what he told the media, in Dhaka, on Saturday.         
	A former BCCI president, Pawar is the chairman of the 2011 World Cups organising committee. Hes definitely a very interested party.

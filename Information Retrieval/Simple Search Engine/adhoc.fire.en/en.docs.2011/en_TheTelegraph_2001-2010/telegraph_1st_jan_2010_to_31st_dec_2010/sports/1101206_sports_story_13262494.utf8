The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi shines for Barca

	Barcelona: Barcelona shook off an improvised four-hour bus and train trip to beat Osasuna 3-0 to stay atop the Spanish league, while Real Madrid stayed two points back by downing 10-man Valencia 2-0.         
	Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Madrid to give him 16 for the season, one ahead of Lionel Messi, who also notched a brace for Barcelona. Lionel Messi deftly threaded a pass that led Pedro Rodriguez through the Osasuna defense in the 26th and Rodriguez gave Osasuna goalie Ricardo Lopez no chance with a sharp strike for the opener. Messi sprinted past the Osasuna defenders and beat Ricardo with a low shot for the second in the 65th and added the third from the penalty spot in the 84th.         
	The match began 45 minutes late after Barcelona was forced to use ground transport to reach Pamplona because of the sickout by Spains air traffic controllers which had grounded all flights in the country since Friday afternoon. It was difficult for us to get into the game because it has been a long day, but we earned three points in a difficult stadium, Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets said.         
	Ronaldo broke the deadlock against Valencia in the 73rd with a left-footed strike off a counterattack eight minutes after Valencia midfielder David Abelda was sent off. Ronaldo scored his second after galloping from the center line and firing from inside the area.         
	Pep Guardiolas squad extended their league-winning streak to eight games and dealt Osasuna their first loss at Reyno de Navarra Stadium since March.         
	Osasuna were not intimidated by the same starting 11 from Barcelonas 5-0 thrashing of Real Madrid last week and tried to take advantage of the visitors travel-weary legs by pressing forward from the opening whistle. After the initial push by Osasuna, Barcelona grabbed control of the ball and the scoreboard.         
	The woodwork kept Barcelona out two minutes after Pedros goal when he tried to return the favour, finding Messi on the left side for a ground strike that skimmed along the goal-line before bouncing off the right post.         
	Barcelona found the second when David Villa linked up with Messi near midfield. Ricardo denied Barcelonas third on a one-on-one against Villa with 15 minutes to play, but Sergio Fernandez fouled Messi in the area and the Argentina standout capped the win with a left-footed try.         
	Also, struggling Atletico Madrid had another disappointing performance in losing 0-2 to Levante.(Agencies)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Saturday expressed satisfaction at the initial response from Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the threat to impose sanctions if it did not take robust anti-corruption measures.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said after a meeting of the members of Pakistan Task Team (PTT), via teleconference, that the world body was satisfied by the PCBs response.         
	We are encouraged by the excellent progress reported and also the willingness of the PCB to embrace ICC recommendations. We can never be complacent in our determination to tackle corruption, Lorgat said in a statement.         
	Lorgat also said that all international players and support personnel have been advised to sign a once-off an anti-corruption declaration before participating in the next FTP match and/or ICC event.

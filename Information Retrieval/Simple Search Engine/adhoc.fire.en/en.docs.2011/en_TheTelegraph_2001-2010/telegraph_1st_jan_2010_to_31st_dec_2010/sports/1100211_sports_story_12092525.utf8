The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirsten makes   a quiet entry
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kirsten makes   a quiet entry
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Indian cricketers will get down to business from Friday but their coach Gary Kirsten isnt the one to wait that long. The Team India coach along with his family made a quiet entry on Wednesday evening, a day ahead of his wards.         
	After being comprehensively beaten in the first Test by an innings and six runs, its redemption time for India.         
	Kirsten will certainly like to get a first-hand view of the Eden Gardens strip and get a feel of what can be expected between February 14-18. The coach is expected to drop in at the stadium sometime Thursday to check out the pitch and other practice facilities.         
	The Eden Gardens strip has been a topic of discussion for the past few days as people are curious to know what kind of a wicket curator Prabir Mukherjee prepares.         
	During the last Test match at the Eden, former Bengal cricketer Kalyan Mitra was in charge of preparing the wicket. All he presented was a flat track where both India and Pakistan scored 616 and 456, respectively in their first innings.         
	Over the years, Eden Gardens wicket has not been a result-oriented one. Curator Mukherjee has always stressed that the Eden strip will have firm and even bounce, but normally it has been a batsmans paradise.         
	Definitely, Kirsten will prefer a pitch that will allow Harbhajan Singh and his spin partner (Amit Mishra or Pragyan Ojha) to make life miserable for the opposition batsmen.         
	Meanwhile, the figures on the third day of the ticket sales (first for general public) reached Rs 25 lakh (all three days included), an indication that the demand for tickets havent yet reached the expected levels.         
	Due to renovation work near D Block, the organisers have decided to reduce the area outside the boundary rope. This will give the ground an oval-shaped look. However the distance of the boundary ropes in front and square of the wicket will remain the same, informed joint secretary Biswarup Dey.         
	Earlier, the area outside the boundary ropes on both sides of the wicket used to be different. However this time, as we have decided to reduce the area outside the boundary rope near D block, the square boundaries will be equidistant, he said.

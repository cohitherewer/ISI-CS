  - Indian batsmen flounder again; MoM Chris Gayle scores a 66-ball 98       A CORRESPONDENT            Keiron Pollard celebrates Rohit Sharmas wicket, in Bridgetown, on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni is quite different from illustrious predecessor Sourav Ganguly in most aspects of his captaincy. There, however, is one uncanny resemblance. It is that if they believed in a particular thing, they refuse to budge from that standpoint until they get it right.         
	Having been criticised for not playing an extra pacer against Australia, one thought that Ravindra Jadeja would get the boot against hosts West Indies on Sunday. But the captain backed his instincts and played the same XI. Alas, he got it wrong again.         
	The defeat puts India on the verge of exit with only the match against Sri Lanka left.         
	The poor team selection meant they were again a bowler short and the West Indies skipper Chris Gayle (98, 66 balls, 5x4, 7x6) knew that only too well. He waited like a true opportunist and then savaged the bowling. That saw them make 169 for six  15 short of what the Australians got. But the result was the same.         
	In order to chase 170, India needed a good start. If Gautam Gambhir is out of form, Murali Vijay, the other opener looked surely out of place.         
	The dismissal of the opening duo in the Powerplay ensured that the 2007 champions were never really in chase.         
	Occasionally, Suresh Raina (32 off 25 balls) and Dhoni (29 off 18 balls) hit a few big shots but that was never going to be enough. Another World Cup (after the 2007 ODI Cup) in the Caribbean and another heartbreak.         
	It is believed that when Gayle hits, there are no half measures. Trust them to be lusty and big. The West Indies captain took his own time to settle down. But once he had a hang of things, there was simply no stopping the big man.         
	The West Indies innings was in contrast to how the Australian openers Shane Watson and David Warner played the other day. While the Aussies attacked within the Powerplay, Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (23) made a rather sedate start by Twenty20 standards. The first eight overs fetched only 45 runs.         
	This was partly possible due another inspired spell of bowling by Harbhajan Singh. The off-spinner gave away only 17 runs in his four over spell.         
	The floodgates opened in the ninth over of the innings when Zaheer Khan was hit for 13 runs. Suddenly Gayles hits became bigger and bigger. Zaheer, Nehra and Ravindra Jadeja all were dispatched with equal disdain.         
	The best part about Gayles seven sixes was the power he generated with minimum of footwork. Most of the sixes fell into the stands.         
	After giving away 38 in two overs in the last match, Jadeja was a shade better giving away 27 from two in this match. The youngster was horribly short of confidence and, when pitted against Gayle, who was in a mood to butcher the bowler, he did look like a lamb ready for slaughter.         
	Certainly, World T20 memories are not to be taken home for this Saurashtra lad.         
	On the other hand, Gayle certainly looked good to score his second T20 International hundred before he fell a couple of runs short. Credit to Ashish Nehra who bowled a good last over dismissing Dwayne Bravo and Ramnaresh Sarwan in a space of three deliveries thereby putting a lot of pressure on Gayle.         
	With three deliveries left and Gayle on 97, he went for a second run but failed to ground his bat properly. But his innings was surely an effort worth remembering. Such was his dominance that the next best score was that of Chanderpaul.         
	In the end, it turned out to be a match-winning effort. And surely, the Jamaican giant wont mind that much on missing out on a century.

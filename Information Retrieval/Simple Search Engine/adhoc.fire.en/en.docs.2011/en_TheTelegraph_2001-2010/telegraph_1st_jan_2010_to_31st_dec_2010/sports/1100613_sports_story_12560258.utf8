                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina praises bowlers show
            A CORRESPONDENT            Yusuf Pathan in a punishing mood against Zimbabwe                           
	India captain Suresh Raina praised his bowlers in their six-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the first of the two Twenty20 Internationals for the Micromax Cup, which was played at the Harare Sports Club ground, on Saturday. At the post match presentation, Raina lauded Pragyan Ojha and Piyush Chawlas efforts.         
	The Indian bowlers dominated the proceedings right from the beginning and restricted the hosts to 111 for nine in stipulated 20 overs. Ranganath Vinay Kumar was the most successful, grabbing three for 24 in his four-over spell. Ashok Dinda (2/27) and Ojha (2/11) also bowled well. Ojhas figures were the most economical by an Indian in T20 Internationals.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Suresh Raina:I am happy with the performance of our bowlers. They gave their 100 per cent and their effort showed Pragyan and Piyush really bowled well. They kept things tight in the middle-overs and also picked up crucial wickets. 112 was never a big score and I wasnt very worried even though we lost crucial wickets. Yusuf (Pathan) and Virat (Kohli) batted very well to clinch the match. I wouldnt blame the batsmen as the ball was stopping and coming. It was good to see Piyush come for the T20 Internationals and bowl well. We hope to win on Sunday and finish on a high.         
	Elton Chigumbura: I was very disappointed with the performance of our middle-order batsmen. We did well to score 50 in the first six overs. But we lost wickets regularly and couldnt capitalise on the strong start. Had we scored around 110 in 15 overs with wickets in hand, we could have accelerated towards the end. But that didnt happen. I am however happy with the performance of our bowlers who did well to grab quick wickets.         
	Yusuf Pathan (MoM): I wasnt really worried about the fall of wickets. I knew that I had to play my natural game which is to go after the bowling. I did just that and it worked for me. The wicket was not very good for batting but I wanted to attack. Happy that we have won the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kamran mulls legal action
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kamran mulls legal action
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal has threatened to sue the teams former coaches Intikhab Alam and Aaqib Javed if they dont apologise for suggesting that he was involved in match-fixing during the disastrous tour of Australia.         
	Akmal said he wanted a public apology from Intikhab and Aaqib for raising suspicions about his performance on the tour earlier this year.         
	I want an apology from them or else they should substantiate their claims that I deliberately left a run-out in the Sydney Test. They must come up with evidence that I am linked with bookmakers, Kamran said.         
	The wicketkeeper-batsman made it clear that he was fed up trying to explain that he was not involved in match-fixing.I go out everyday and they are people passing comments on me. My family is deeply disturbed with these fresh allegations, he said.         
	Intikhab and Aaqib told a PCB inquiry committee that they had their suspicions about the performances of Kamran and all-rounder Rana Naved in Australia.         
	If they dont apologise or dont substantiate their allegations I will go to court. I wanted to go to court earlier also against a media outlet but the PCB persuaded me against do so, Akmal said.         
	But this time since both Intikhab and Aaqib are PCB employees, when I return I will talk to the board chairman about my intentions, he added.         
	Kamran said that he was surprised at the statements of both the former coaches.         
	They remained coaches since last year and if they had suspicions about my performance in Sydney why did they pick me for the one-day series that followed, he stated.         
	Intikhab, however, has denied making match-fixing allegations against Akmal.         
	Look at the video recording of my statement. I have never said Kamran or any player indulged in match-fixing, Intikhab said.         
	 I have at no stage accused him of match-fixing, it is all a misunderstanding, he added.         
	Meanwhile, PCB chairman Butt said that the ICCs probe into match-fixing allegations during the Australia tour is just a routine exercise and not much should be read into it.           (PTI)

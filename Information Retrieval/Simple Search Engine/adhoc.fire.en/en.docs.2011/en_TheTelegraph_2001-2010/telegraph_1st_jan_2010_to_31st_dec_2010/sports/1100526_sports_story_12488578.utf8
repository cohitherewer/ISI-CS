The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HI asked to keep poll plan on hold
                                                                                                                       7                                      HI asked to keep poll plan on hold
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In the aftermath of the Delhi high courts decision to revive the K.P.S. Gill-led Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), the Union ministry of sports Tuesday advised Hockey India (HI) to put election plans on hold.         
	The government directive came barely a couple of hours after HI secretary general, Narendra Batra issued a statement saying the elections for the unified body for men and women would be held before July 5.         
	In a letter to HI, a copy of which was released to the media, the ministry said: In the light of the high court judgement in the matter of Indian Hockey Federation versus Union of India and others whereby the court has quashed the suspension and disaffiliation/de-recognition orders passed by Indian Olympic Association and Union of India, you are advised not to take further action with regard to holding of elections till the entire matter is examined in consultation with the ministry of law.         
	The ministry advisory surely comes as a blow to HI who had been claiming full backing of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) as the parent body of Indian hockey.         
	FIH general secretary Peter L. Cohen has Tuesday written to HI asking it to hold the election as soon as possible. Making it clear that the FIH was disappointed with HIs failure to hold the elections before the May 31 deadline, the international body advised the Indian hockey officials to make sure the elections were held before July 5.

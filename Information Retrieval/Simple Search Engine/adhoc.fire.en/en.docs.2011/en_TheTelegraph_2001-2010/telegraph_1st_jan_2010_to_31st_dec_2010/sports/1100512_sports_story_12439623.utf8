The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ache in the neck hits Tiger plans
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ache in the neck hits Tiger plans
  - World No.1 not sure of playing in US Open; Swing coach Haney leaves       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                  
	Tiger Woods is unsure when he will play golf again after a painful neck injury forced him to quit the Players Championship in Florida on Sunday.         
	The world No.1 said he would undergo scans this week to determine the full extent of the problem.         
	A lot is up in the air still, which I dont like, Woods told a news conference in Pennsylvania on Monday. I still need to go home and get a picture of this and see whats going on.         
	Woods was non-committal about playing the US Open on June 17-20. Im trying everything I can to get back as soon as I can, he said.         
	Woods insists theres zero connection between the neck spasms playing havoc with his golf swing and the car accident he was involved in on November 27, the fateful night when it all began to go wrong for him.         
	Woods claims his neck started bothering him two weeks before the Masters, his first competition in five months.         
	He brushed it off as no big deal and believed he could play through the pain. That changed last weekend at The Players Championship, where Woodss creaky neck locked up.         
	That prevented him from making his usual forceful turn on the ball on even a routine shot, and he was forced to withdraw after six holes.         
	Im at a point now where I just cant go anymore, he said. I want to practise, I want to play, I want to compete, but this is not allowing me to do the things that I need to do on my golf swing to hit the proper shots. I need to get to where I can do that again.         
	Woods said hes been taking anti-inflammatory drugs, but they have not helped. He plans to have an MRI when he returns to Orlando.         
	In November, Woods was briefly admitted to hospital after he crashed his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his home, resulting in a sore neck and a cut lip.         
	Woods insisted he can deal with the sharp, shooting pain, which he feels in the right side of his neck, but cannot deal with the spasms that affect his ability to turn his head.         
	For me not to play all 18 holes, that was as angry and as frustrated as Ive been in a long time, Woods said of Sundays abbreviated round. It was his first withdrawal from a tournament since the Nissan Open at Riviera in 2006.         
	Woods said it wasnt until this weekend that he felt he needed more serious treatment.         
	Its possible one of the reasons I think this thing flared up is because I wasnt conditioned to it, he said. Id been away from the game for such a long time, then came back and ramped up really quickly in order to try and play the Masters. The body wasnt quite ready for that.         
	After tying for fourth in the Masters, Woods looked lost on the course as he missed the cut at Quail Hollow on April 30 with the highest 36-hole score of his career.         
	Woods has played little like the golfer who collected his 82nd title worldwide in Australia six months ago, just before his personal life became a national punchline.         
	I think its just once Im able to do the work on the range and get comfortable, then all shots are fine, he said. But I need to do the work.         
	Woods will have to work on his game without long-time swing coach Hank Haney, who stepped aside as his coach on Monday night. Haney said in a statement to the a sports channel that he enjoyed working with Woods but he thinks its time for him to step aside as his coach.         
	I will always look back upon our past half-dozen years together as my best days in professional golf, Haney said. It would be a dream of any coach to have a student like Tiger Woods and for me it has come true. Just so there is no confusion I would like to make it clear that this is my decision. I know Tiger Woods will be successful in the future no matter who helps him.         
	 The schedule that is up in the air will likely be shaped based on what the MRI reveals. Woods said he had planned to make his next appearance at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio next month, an event he won last year, then head to Pebble Beach for the US Open but his plans were now dependent on the test results.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifa sets Nigeria a deadline
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fifa sets Nigeria a deadline
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Fifa will suspend Nigeria from world football unless the countrys government overturns its ban on the national team by Monday.         
	Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot said that Fifa will contact the government by letter on Friday to tell Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan he has until Monday evening to back down on his threat to pull the Nigerian Football Federation out of international competition for two years. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of the NFF, Maingot said.         
	Fifa rules protect football from government intervention, with power to suspend members who do not manage their affairs independently. National and club teams then cannot play in international competitions and football officials are barred from attending meetings.         
	Jonathan said Wednesday that he was banning the team and dissolving the NFF management board after the countrys first-round exit from the World Cup. He also ordered a probe into alleged financial corruption at the federation.         
	Maingot said Fifa will not recognise an interim management team sent in by the government to run the federation.         
	Nigerias representative on the 24-member Fifa executive committee, Amos Adamu, also will be in his home country on Monday for last-minute mediation.

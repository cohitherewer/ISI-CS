The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Putting a problem for Tiger
                                                                                                                       7                                        Putting a problem for Tiger
- Major anxiety            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Tiger Woods                           
	World No 1 Tiger Woods has said he needs to improve his consistency as he attempts to avoid a second successive year without a Major.         
	The American finished tied for 23rd in the 139th Open at St Andrews  a venue where he had won on both his previous visits.         
	Injury and marital problems after a sex scandal have affected his game and he has not added to his tally of 14 majors since winning the 2008 US Open  after which he immediately booked himself in for surgery on a knee problem.         
	With only the US PGA to come at Whistling Straits the 34-year-old knows he has to improve if doubts are not to increase about whether he will ever overhaul Jack Nicklaus record of 18 Major titles.         
	I just have to keep building and putting things back to where they are more consistent day in, day out  which Im not doing, he said.         
	Im driving it better than I have in years but Im just not making the putts. Its ironic that as soon as I start driving it on a string I miss everything (on the greens).         
	Maybe I should go back to spraying it all over the place and making everything. I believe I had like nine three-putts for the week. So, consequently, Im pretty far down the board. No one can win doing that. Ive got to clean that up before I tee it up again.         
	That is expected to be the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in Akron in three weeks where he is the defending champion. Perhaps more important, though, hes most of the way back to being regarded as a golfer instead of a pariah  at least on the course. As his comfort level rises, so does his confidence.         
	The tabloids here did their best all week daring fans to give Woods the English version of a Bronx cheer.         
	Instead, he drew applause from every corner of St Andrews and saw nothing more provocative than three woman who shed their jackets on one tee to reveal matching Tiger-print blouses  they were hired by an Irish bookie looking for publicity  yet even they turned out to be on his side.         
	Not long ago, with Woods in the middle of a winning streak that positively spooked his rivals, Stewart Cink wondered what theyd find if they sliced him open.         
	Maybe, Cink mused, nuts and bolts.         
	But you only had to see Woods talking about his reception on this chilly, wind-swept coast to know how relieved he was.         
	Unfortunately, I wasnt in the lead, but still it was very warm. ... For them to be as warm as they were, Woods said, then let his voice trail off for a moment.         
	The question is how long the galleries will feel that way, considering how much ground hes already given up.         
	Woods at least held on to his No. 1 ranking for another week after finishing comfortably ahead of nearest rival Phil Mickelson, who had yet another disappointing Open as he finished joint 48th.         
	The Masters champion, who had not finished behind Woods in seven events since last September, dropped five shots in his last seven holes for an inward 41, a 75 and a one over par total.         
	Had he finished in the top four he would have taken over from Woods as world No. 1.         
	However, failing to break 70 on all four days extended his woeful record at this event, which has only one top-10 finish in 17 attempts  third at Troon in 2004.         
	I was disappointed with the way I played, but it didnt diminish from the experience of playing the Open Championship here at St Andrews, the left-hander, keen to make a quick exit, said.         
	I enjoyed the week very much. I think its just a wonderful place to hold this event. The people in Scotland have been very warm and receptive to everyone.

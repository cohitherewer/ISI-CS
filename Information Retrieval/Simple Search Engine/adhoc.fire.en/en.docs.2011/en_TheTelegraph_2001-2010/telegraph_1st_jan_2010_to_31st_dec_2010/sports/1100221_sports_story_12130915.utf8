	Chandigarh: Indian hockey has been rocked by yet another controversy with organisers of a charity event Saturday claiming that the players had demanded Rs 5 crore to feature in the matches, an allegation the national team members have denied.         
	Hardeep Sandhu, a member of the organising committee of the AMR foundation, claimed that hockey players, led by Prabhjot Singh, Rajpal Singh and Deepak Thakur, were demanding Rs 4-5 crore to play in the four 15-minute charity matches, each featuring film and television stars.         
	AMR foundation had roped in 22 players to feature in four exhibition matches with film and television stars. When, on Friday, one of the representatives of the organisers handed them the flight tickets from New Delhi to Chandigarh, a group of players said they didnt want the tickets as they were not gaining anything, Sandhu said.         
	Players said they were expecting Rs 4 to 5 crore from sponsorships, he added.         
	However, Prabhjot, Rajpal and Deepak rubbished the allegations and demanded an apology from organisers. (PTI)

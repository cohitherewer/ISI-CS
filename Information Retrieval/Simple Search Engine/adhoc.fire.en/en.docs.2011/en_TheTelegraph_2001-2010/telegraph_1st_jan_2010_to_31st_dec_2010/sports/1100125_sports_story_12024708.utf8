	Calcutta: The RCGC B team ruled the roost in the inaugural Vodafone Royals Trophy which concluded at the RCGC, on Sunday.         
	Asian Games gold medallist Lakshman Singh and his partner Aditya Khaitan took the advantage of playing in the home course to the hilt and tallied 38 stableford points for a two-round aggregate of 77 points. It was a superb comeback after they were placed third overnight.         
	Overnight joint-leaders Royal Perth Golf Club, comprising Bruce Shannahan and Francis James Bryant, could make only 34 points for a tournament total of 74 points to finish second.         
	The husband-wife pair of Stephen and Margie Lilley of the Royal Melbourne Golf Club finished third with 73 points. The other overnight joint-leaders Ravi and Binny Mehra of Royal Montreal Golf Club put up a dismal show and ended up 20th.         
	The final round, which was played on a scramble format, saw the players enjoying themselves yet focusing on their targets.         
	Lakshman, who was a part of the Indian team that bagged the Asian Games gold medal in 1982, had an able partner in Khaitan.         
	The duo opened with solid pars on the first three holes before making a birdie on the fourth and making the only bogey of the round on the very next hole. One more birdie on the 15th sealed the issue in their favour.         
	It cant get anything better than this. The inaugural year of the Royals Trophy, RCGC is staging it and we are the champions, a beaming Lakshman said on Sunday evening. We made the maximum of the home course advantage.         
	The greens were trickery. Its not that easy to play at the RCGC. Even professionals playing for the first time at this course faced trouble. I think our rivals have had some trouble negotiating the greens here.         
	Lakshman promised to be at the next edition to defend the Royals Trophy. The venue is yet to be announced. But Aditya and me will definitely try to be there, he said.         
	We are disappointed that we finished second after leading on the first day, said Bruce Shannahan. We will surely like to play wherever the tournament travels to during the next edition.         
	RCGC A comprising Aveek Sarkar and Ashit Luthra finished ninth with a score of 69, while RCGC C  Ranobir Sen and Partha Gupta  finished tied fourth with a score of 72.         
	Meanwhile, in the team event played for the Vodafone Invitational Trophy, the Goenka brothers Jayant and Manish took the title.

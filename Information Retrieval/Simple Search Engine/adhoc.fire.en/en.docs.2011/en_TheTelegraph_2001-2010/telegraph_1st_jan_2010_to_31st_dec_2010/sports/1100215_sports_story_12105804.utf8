The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting seals the series for Aussies
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ponting seals the series for Aussies
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Brisbane: Ricky Ponting sparkled with his 29th ODI century to lead Australia to a 50-run victory that sealed the series against West Indies. Pontings side has out-played both touring teams this summer and the captain stepped up with an outstanding 106 as his side posted a ground-record 324, according to Cricinfo.         
	Even if Chris Gayle had fired his outfit would have found the chase difficult and when he went for 34 off 27 balls the game was gone. Narsingh Deonarines maiden half-century kept the tourists going for a while before Kieron Pollard showed some muscle with a personal best of 62 and Dwayne Smith chipped in an unbeaten 58. With every dot ball the task got harder and they finished at 8 for 274.         
	The result gave Australia a 3-0 lead and continued their unbeaten home campaign in Tests, ODIs and a Twenty20. Their thoughts now turn to Monday nights Allan Border Medal before the final match of this series in Melbourne on Friday.         
	Gayle has carried around an under-manned squad and he watched his band of medium pacers receive some severe punishment from Ponting. Australia batted first again after losing the toss and Ponting entered at 1 for 43 to take control. In Sydney on Friday the same group restricted Australia to 225, but this pitch wasnt as spicy and Ponting made them pay for any lapses.         
	He warmed up by lofting Pollard for four and next ball caressed him for a delightful straight six.

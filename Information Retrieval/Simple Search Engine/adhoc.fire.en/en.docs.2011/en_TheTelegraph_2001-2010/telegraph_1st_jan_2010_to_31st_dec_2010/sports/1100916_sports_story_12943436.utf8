                                                                                                                       7                                      Ijaz Butt arrives

	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt arrived in New Delhi, late on Wednesday evening. He is supposed to meet ICC president Sharad Pawar and senior BCCI officials. However, there was no confirmation from the BCCI about his meeting with senior officials.         
	One can expect, that Butt is trying to secure support for Pakistan from Pawar after their three cricketers (Mohammed Asif, Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer) have been provisionally suspended by the ICC on the spot-fixing issue. At the same time, he would speak to BCCI officials and try to convince them to play against Pakistan at neutral venues in order to raise funds for the flood victims in Pakistan, an agency report from Pakistan quoted a PCB official.

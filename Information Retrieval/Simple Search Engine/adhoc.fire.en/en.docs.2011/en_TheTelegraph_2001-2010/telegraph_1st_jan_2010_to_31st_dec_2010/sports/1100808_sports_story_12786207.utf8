                                                                                                                       7                                      Action time for Leander, off the court
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its official! Leander Paes will soon be coming to a theatre near you! Come December, one will find the 12-time Grand Slam champion trying his luck in films.         
	Paes, last week, signed on the dotted lines for two Bollywood movies, the first of which is titled Rajdhani.         
	I have signed two movies. Shooting for one begins this December. Its titled Rajdhani. The film is about a train journey from Mumbai to Delhi, said the 37-year-old.         
	Currently en route to Toronto for the Rogers Cup, Paes, however, emphasised that films would never be his No. 1 priority. Tennis is not going to take a backseat. Ill do movies only during my off-time, he insisted.         
	Refusing to divulge any other details about his new venture, Paes claimed: Individuals are capable of having a lot of different talents. Unless I try my hand at different things, I will never find out.         
	Earlier this year, in February, there had been rumours of Paes having signed a film. But he had denied them and had said: No movie on the anvil at present No script has left me breathless When the right one comes along, I may consider it.         
	It seems Paes has finally found his dream role!

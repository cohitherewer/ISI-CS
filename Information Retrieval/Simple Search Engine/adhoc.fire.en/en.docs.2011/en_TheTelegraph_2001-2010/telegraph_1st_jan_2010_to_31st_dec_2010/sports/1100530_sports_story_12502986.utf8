The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Finn fire rattles Bangla 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Finn fire rattles Bangla 
                      
	London: Rain and bad light frustrated England on the third day of the first Test against Bangladesh at Lords on Saturday despite some high class fast bowling from Steven Finn.         
	Finn, playing his first Test in England at the headquarters of his county Middlesex, confirmed the excellent impression he had made on Friday with three wickets, including two in eight balls.         
	He finished the day with four for 75 as Bangladesh struggled to 237 for seven, in replay to Englands first innings 505, when the players left the field for the third and final time for bad light.         
	Although Lords has floodlights, they can be switched on only 12 times a year by agreement with the local government council. Officials said it had been decided not to use them during the current Test to ensure consistency with Old Trafford in Manchester, hosts of the second and final Test in the series starting next Friday, which does not have lights.

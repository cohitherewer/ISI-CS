The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tampering is nothing new: Imran
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tampering is nothing new: Imran
                  Imran Khan                     
	Karachi: Shahid Afridi is not the only one who thinks ball tampering is widespread and that all teams resort to it. World Cup-winning former Pakistan captain Imran Khan feels the same, as does another former skipper, Ramiz Raja.         
	Afridi, banned for two T20 matches for tampering with the ball in the final one-dayer against Australia in Perth, had claimed that all teams try such tactics to gain unfair advantage.         
	Now, backing Afridis claim, Imran said it was only the subcontinental teams that are punished for the offence.         
	It is nothing new, Imran said. When we were playing and developed the reverse swing we were accused of being cheats and tampering with the ball, but when the English and other bowlers did the same, it became an art.         
	However, neither former captain condoned Afridis action of gnawing into the ball with Imran insisting he had never tampered with the ball.         
	Ramiz, too, insisted that ball tampering was an ill most teams were guilty of.         
	It is nothing new but what Afridi did is totally unacceptable. He was not playing a club match. It was an international match in front of many cameras and he should have avoided that moment of madness, he said.         
	Having the will and desire to win is one thing but doing something like what he did is another thing it embarrassed all of us, he said.         
	Ramiz felt that Afridi had spoilt his own image by tampering with the ball. You certainly dont want a captain who loses his cool although he has shown all the qualities of a fighter, he said.         
	Ramiz called for the Pakistan Cricket Board to set up an inquiry committee to probe the ball-biting incident.

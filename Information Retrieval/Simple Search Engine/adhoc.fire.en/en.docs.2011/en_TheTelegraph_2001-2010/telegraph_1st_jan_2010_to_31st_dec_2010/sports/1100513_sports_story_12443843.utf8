The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John Terry allays injury fears
                                                                                                                       7                                        John Terry allays injury fears
            THE TIMES, LONDON AGENCIES            John Terry                           
	London: Chelsea and England suffered a scare on Wednesday when defender John Terry had a scan on his right foot after taking a knock in training.         
	There were initial fears the Chelsea captain had broken a bone and could miss Saturdays FA Cup final and next months World Cup finals in South Africa but the scan showed no break and Terry was confident of facing Portsmouth at Wembley.         
	I took a slight knock in training but with such an important match on Saturday the right course of action was to put a protective boot on my right foot and have a CT scan, Terry said in a statement.         
	The scan has shown there is no break and I am hoping to train Thursday if not Friday and of course play in the FA Cup final on Saturday.         
	Earlier, a Chelsea statement read: John Terry has taken a knock in training and has gone to hospital for a precautionary scan on his right foot. He left Cobham walking freely in a protective boot, and we await the results which are expected on Thursday.         
	Terrys fitness is crucial for club and country despite a season in which he suffered dips in form and was stripped of the England captaincy after newspaper revelations about his private life.         
	On Sunday he lifted the Premier League trophy after Chelsea returned to the summit following three seasons of Manchester United domination and he will be the cornerstone of Fabio Capellos defence in South Africa.         
	Terry has endured a turbulent season, in which he was humiliatingly stripped of the England captaincy following unsavoury revelations regarding his private life, but showed remarkable strength of character to recover from that setback.         
	His form has also fluctuated wildly, but despite the occasional poor performance and concerns over a loss of pace he remained an automatic selection in Capellos starting XI.         
	Manchester Uniteds Rio Ferdinand, Terrys regular England partner, missed a chunk of the season with back and calf injuries while Tottenham Hotspurs Ledley King has knee problems which mean he cannot train properly.         
	Midfielder Gareth Barry has an ankle injury while striker Wayne Rooney was troubled by ankle and groin injuries during the final weeks of the season although he is expected to be fit.

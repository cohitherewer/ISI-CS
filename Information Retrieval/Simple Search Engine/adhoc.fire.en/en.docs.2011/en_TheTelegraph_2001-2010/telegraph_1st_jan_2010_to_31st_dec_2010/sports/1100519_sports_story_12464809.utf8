	Congrats England. Well played, big tick in the box, round one to England  but when it comes to the first day of the Ashes in Brisbane, winning the World Twenty20 will count for nothing, unless MBEs are being handed out!         
	Every time Australia play England there is talk about the Ashes. We ask, has anyone gained an advantage? What we can say is that Englands mindset has changed. In the past they thought that if they played at their best they might nick a win. Now they think, We can beat this lot. That feeling of being scared of playing Australia has disappeared.         
	England will have taken a small psychological advantage from Sundays final. Australia were just starting to build a bit of momentum and find some consistency in the aftermath of losing last years Ashes. But the first time they came up against England in a final they lost.         
	That will send a message to Australia that they have to play very well to beat England now in any form of the game.         
	But the Ashes in Australia is very different. It is the hardest series to win and England were embarrassed last time around. Englands planning must be to go out there and beat them every time to keep the momentum going.         
	They have now got the right tools to do that. England have a very balanced side and in Graeme Swann they have a spinner who, when you examine every format of the game, is the best in the world right now.         
	In Kevin Pietersen, England also have, not the best, but the most destructive batsman. The Indian Premier League and World Twenty20 came at a good time for him.         
	For the last couple of months he has not had to worry about technique and building innings. He has just had to smack the ball and impose himself. To be the player of the tournament will be great for his ego.         
	It is also great for England because all the other players seem to walk a bit taller when KP is playing well.         
	That is a particular advantage for someone such as Paul Collingwood. He has improved as a player. He is now more daring and prepared not to be just a dour bits-and-pieces cricketer.         
	What is tricky for England is that Collingwood now hands that job back to Andrew Strauss. He is so well rested he should be able to come out and make hundreds.         
	I went on record to say that Strauss was not showing respect for the game by missing a Test tour for his country as captain. I think if you are captain you stand and fight with your boys whether it is hard or easy, whether you are tired or fresh. You are the man they look up to in any situation. You cannot just palm it off on someone else.         
	He has copped a backlash and he has deserved it. So he has to come out, hit form and say: Take a look at that.         
	But he does at least take over a team in which the players know their own roles. England have perhaps one or two places up for grabs in the Test side and, after the World Twenty20, Craig Kieswetter will put pressure on Matt Priors place.         
	Prior has been pretty ordinary behind the stumps. His job is to bat at seven and be a backstop. But if he is not getting runs, and the bowlers know he is going to miss a few behind the stumps, then Kieswetter, if keeping well, should get a chance.         
	Graeme Swann is adding a lot to all forms of Englands cricket. I have been very impressed. He is the most improved cricketer in the world.         
	What has struck me most is that as an off-spinner there are only certain ways you can get people out. But he has more than that, he really changes his pace well. Normally when spinners bowl faster they lose their spin. But he can bowl quicker deliveries and still turn it. It is a very good gift and he can adapt it to all forms of the game.         
	The key is knowing when to change your pace. It is not about changing your style. Swann is always trying to work out in his mind how to get wickets. That is what I like about him  he attacks.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

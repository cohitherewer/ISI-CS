	San Diego: After beating the United States at home and on the road in consecutive Fed Cup finals, the Italians really dont care if the Williams sisters were absent both times.         
	Flavia Pennetta beat CoCo Vandeweghe to give Italy their second straight Fed Cup final victory over the United States. Pennettas victory in the fourth singles match Sunday gave the Italians a 3-1 decision in the best-of-five series.         
	Venus and Serena Williams sat out last years Fed Cup final, and both missed this one due to injuries.         
	Of course, if Serena and Venus want to play, the chance to win, its less, said Pennetta, who is ranked second in the world in doubles and 23rd in singles. They are really good players. They are really strong. But we fight a lot to be here, to have this trophy. Before we play the US, we play another two important teams. All the best players in the other teams were there. Its not making any difference if they play or not play. Still, we won this unbelievable Fed Cup, and nobody can say nothing about that.         
	Pennetta won the deciding match 6-1, 6-2 after Melanie Oudin beat French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-3, 6-1 to keep the United States alive.         
	Italy beat the United States 4-0 last year. The Italians have won three titles in five years.         
	Pennetta won two matches during the weekend to carry the Italians. Vandeweghe, making her Fed Cup debut, lost twice. With the match decided, doubles werent played. I always think in Fed Cup you can beat everyone, you can lose to everyone, Pennetta said.         
	Its not easy to play for your country, to give your best for the time that you are on the court, because sometime you can be real nervous and you can have a panic attack. But I really enjoyed today for my country. I enjoyed playing for this team.

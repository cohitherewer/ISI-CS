The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maradona keeps all guessing
                                                                                                                       7                                      Maradona keeps all guessing
                      
	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona continues to keep everyone guessing about his future as Argentinas national team coach.         
	Maradona was supposed to meet early this week with Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona, whose office said last week it would offer him a four-year extension through the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.         
	On Monday, however, Maradona was planning to travel to Venezuela at the invitation of President Hugo Chavez to give a series of football clinics. The Venezuelan government offered few details.         
	Argentine football officials have suggested this may delay Maradonas decision.         
	Maradona has not talked publicly about his plans since Argentina were knocked out of the World Cup by Germany in a humiliating 4-0 loss in the quarter finals. Argentina President Cristina Fernandez has openly supported Maradona and a legislator has proposed building a monument to honour him.         
	Lionel Messi, in a recent interview, has said that he would like to leave the matter to Maradona. Lets leave him alone, he had said.         
	Argentina are scheduled to play a friendly match on August 11 against Ireland in Dublin. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crickets believe it or not!
                                                                                                                       7                                      Crickets believe it or not!

	Calcutta: Millions being put on the toss isnt anything new. However, the International Cricket Council may have to make it mandatory for both captains to take the field simultaneously as, in the illegal market, bets are also placed on which of the two will step on to the turf first!         
	That, of course, isnt all.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, money is even placed on which captain will wear his cap/hat and who will take to the toss wearing sunglasses.         
	Sounds bizarre, but thats the reality.         
	This isnt to suggest that the captains are involved, but it should give you an idea that bets are actually placed on everything... In India, money is put on every ball in an ODI or a T20 International featuring the home team, the well-placed source said.         
	In Test matches, apparently, bets are placed on (among other things) the three sessions of play each day. Again, theres money in plenty.         
	These are fancy or spot bets, which lead to fancy or spot-fixing... Its rampant and its anybodys guess to what extent players are involved. Those who are, could argue that they arent fixing a match, the well-placed source added.         
	Clearly, Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer have company. Its just that, right now, the others havent been identified.

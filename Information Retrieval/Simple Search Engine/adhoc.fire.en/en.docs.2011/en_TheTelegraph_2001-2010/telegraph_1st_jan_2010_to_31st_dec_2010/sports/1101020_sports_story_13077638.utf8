                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni hopes to get some rest
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Visakhapatnam: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is hoping he will get a break, in keeping with the rotation policy, during the next home series against New Zealand.         
	The Team India captain, who spoke at a press conference here, also backed Yuvraj Singh.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Coming back to his happy hunting ground (148 vs Pakistan in 2005, his maiden hundred)         
	That was a long way back... Its a different series. You have to start from scratch in every match. I have some happy memories of my first game here. To be on top, you have to be prepared for every game. It has now become a two-match series. We are hoping for the best.         
	If that innings changed his career         
	Next time hoga toh retirement ho jayega! (Laughs) On a serious note, of course, Ive improved in the last five-six years as a player. The stadium, too, has improved since 2005 Its a completely different stadium. There are better facilities now. This place has always something special to offer. Hope somebody, either a batsman or a bowler, will do something special tomorrow.         
	In keeping with the selectors rotation policy, if he needs some rest         
	Hopefully, in the next series I will get some rest.         
	Yuvraj Singhs form         
	Ive always said that at No. 4, our batting has always revolved around him. He is the type of player who can change gears any time and take complete control of the game. At the same time, he has played over 250 ODIs and that means he has got a lot of experience. His bowling, too, is very important for us. If we decide for four bowlers and use part-timers as the fifth bowler, he is considered a bowling option. If you do well in bowling it reflects in your batting, and if you do well in batting, it reflects in your bowling. He has got both the dimensions of the game.         
	Motivating this young side         
	The Test series has been won and weve got a young side now You dont really need to motivate anyone when representing the country. For somebody like Yuvraj, it will be a different approach of sorts. He will be one of the senior-most cricketers along with Ashish Nehra. Its a change of role for quite a few players and an opportunity for the youngsters, who will look to get a berth in the World Cup squad. I wont put extra pressure on them. Take one game at a time and give it your best shot.         
	On the pacers, Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Praveen Kumar         
	With the kind of experience he has, Ashish practises really hard. He works really well on his strengths and weaknesses. He can bowl the yorkers well. If you just see the score, its not an ideal reflection. In one of the games, he went for 60 runs in 10 overs and people said its not a good display. But youve got to remember that apart from two overs, he either bowled in the first or second powerplays or in the slog overs Praveen is a street-smart cricketer Hes played a lot of cricket, and more often than not he backs himself well. As for Zaheer, he has always done well. A different character his theories are a little different which doesnt really apply to other bowlers. I am always impressed by his execution of plans.         
	The wicket         
	It looks like a good track, but it will look different tomorrow before the start. It appears a bit damp now.         
	On Shikhar Dhawan, who is set to make his debut         
	Both of us scored in the Challenger in Mumbai. I got a chance to play for India. As a wicketkeeper-batsman, you have got to fight with five, six or at best 10 players. As an opener, you have to fight with more batsmen and have to consistently do well You have Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir all at the same level. Its good that hes got a chance finally.         
	The composition of the side going into the World Cup         
	Depends on what talent you have If you have an all-rounder, then at No. 7 try to have a big power-hitter to exploit the sub continental conditions. The preparation is going pretty well. In last few series we have not played with our strongest side and rested most players. May be injuries were a bit of a concern. We dont want our big players to get injured before a tournament, especially when its happening in India.         
	If the team require a leg spinner for the World Cup         
	It can definitely be an option to try out in the next series. Amit (Mishra) and Piyush (Chawla) have done well. A leg spinner always gives you variations.         
	Virender Sehwags birthday on Wednesday         
	I will definitely wish him... He has been given rest. We want him to be with his family But if he was here, he would have celebrated with the team

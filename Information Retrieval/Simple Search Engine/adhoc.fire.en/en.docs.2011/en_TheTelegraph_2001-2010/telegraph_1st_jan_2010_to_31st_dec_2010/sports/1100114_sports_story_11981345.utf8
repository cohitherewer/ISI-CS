The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Zone camp sans proper balls
                                                                                                                       7                                      East Zone camp sans proper balls
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The ongoing East Zone preparatory camp for the Duleep Trophy at the JU (Salt Lake campus ground) is being run lackadaisically.         
	Even the basic requirements of a camp are not being met, courtesy absence of manager Moloy Chakraborty (of Tripura), who is yet to report for the camp.         
	During the past three days, the players have not been provided with red Kookaburra balls for practice, which is a must as per rules. All the senior level matches organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India are played with Kookaburra balls.         
	In this case, CAB should have arranged for those balls. As there was nobody to address the problem, the players had no option except practising with what they had.         
	We are practising with the SG practice balls, not even SG Test balls. Were supposed to play with Kookaburra balls. The seam of the two balls is entirely different. Is it right for first-class bowlers to train with SG balls and then suddenly play a match with Kookaburra balls? a player asked.         
	The manager hasnt come. We approached the coach (Subrata Das of Jharkhand) with our problem, but he showed very little interest, he told The Telegraph.         
	The CAB, on their part, said they only need to be told about the players needs.         
	We have 25 Kookaburra balls in store. But someone from their (players) end should communicate so that we know what they need. We havent even seen the manager, so how will we know what the players need? an official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waqar: Fast bowlers need to be smart in the head, too 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Waqar: Fast bowlers need to be smart in the head, too 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Waqar Younis                           
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): With 789 wickets in Tests and ODIs, Waqar Youniss CV makes for very impressive reading. A former Pakistan captain, hes now his countrys coach. On Thursday evening, Waqar spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour at the Landings Resort.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Whats it like being a full time coach?         
	A Its a hard job... Its draining, particularly in a T20 tournament such as this... The job, of course, looks and becomes easy if the team wins. Its very challenging nevertheless.         
	Coaches keep getting changed in Pakistan...         
	(Interrupts and laughs) Worrying, isnt it?         
	So, didnt you have second thoughts?         
	I did have a discussion with my (Sydney-based) family and close friends... Its a difficult job, but somebody has to do it... If I didnt take up this challenge, somebody else would have... Look, somebody had to start trying to make a difference and that somebody happens to be me.         
	Youre confident...         
	Indeed, yes... Im trying to set things right... Im happy so far.         
	How do you go about your job?         
	Basically, Im a calm person and thats the way I function in the dressing room... At the same time, I try and instil aggression and give loads of positive energy... The dressing room atmosphere is most important... It gets reflected in the performances.         
	You have a contract till the end of 2011... Enough time, then, to set things right...         
	Does give me time... I realise Ill be judged by the results.         
	Whats your biggest challenge?         
	Being on the same wavelength as the players, the selectors and the Board... I dont just work with the Shahid Afridis, but with so many outside the team, too.         
	You were an outstanding fast bowler. Are you only focusing on the bowling aspect or do you also work with the batsmen?         
	I do spend a lot of time with the bowlers, but its not that I dont talk generally... Ijaz Ahmed, the assistant coach, spends more time with the batsmen... Actually, at the highest level, one doesnt need much coaching. Man management is a bigger issue... Im open to trying out ideas, though.         
	Soon, Pakistan will be playing Australia in England. A tough task...         
	Absolutely... Given what has happened in recent months, with players being banned and/or fined, its not going to be easy... Were in a rebuilding phase... Weve got a good T20 team, but I feel were a little behind (after the recent developments) in Tests and ODIs.         
	Dont bans demoralise everybody, not just the affected players?         
	I cant say much, because the Board has already acted. I cant say whether the action taken is right or wrong... A committee had been set up and action wasnt taken overnight... Perhaps, well have to reassess things after this tournament... I dont know really.         
	To get back to coaching, has any coach influenced you?         
	I worked with Bob Woolmer as a bowling consultant and liked his style... Hed be calm and make his point in a nice manner. He was so knowledgeable... Its not that Im trying to copy Bob, but one does try to absorb the good points of achievers. Bob certainly was one in his field.         
	A player, captain, bowling consultant and, now, coach. Which has been the most difficult role?         
	Im new to coaching... Give me some time... What I can say is that captaining Pakistan wasnt easy! I guess no job is.         
	What goes into the making of quality fast bowlers?         
	I can assure you that fast bowlers are neither dumb nor are they blank up here (pointing to his head)... They do have brains and they need to think, not be mechanical... Fast bowling isnt only about being strong physically, but fast bowlers definitely need to be smart in the head, too.         
	Among the younger lot, who is the most promising in Pakistan?         
	Mohammed Aamer... Hes got a good head, but needs to get stronger. (After a pause) I like Mohammed Asif and hes not that old.         
	Can Shoaib Akhtar make a comeback?         
	Dont know... Nobody can make a comeback on the basis of one good performance, the guy has to be consistent.         
	Your take on India exiting from the World Twenty20?         
	Disappointing for cricket... Many felt your team was capable of winning the competition... Indias bowing out is a sad story.         
	Why did India not progress beyond the Super Eights?         
	Difficult to answer... Perhaps, the players were overconfident... Perhaps, the IPL played a part... Remember, T20 takes a lot out of players... Its a short game, fine, but very high on intensity.         
	What drives success in T20?         
	(Grins) Playing fearlessly... Playing to potential. We have the bowling, but the batsmen must click.         
	Lastly... You must be disappointed that, nowadays, India and Pakistan only meet in ICC-run tournaments...         
	Absolutely... Cricket must continue, even if it means having a bilateral series in a third country... If we can play Australia in England, why not India somewhere else? Surely, Indo-Pak matches can be staged on neutral ground. Its a loss to cricket if our two countries dont play each other.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger, Elin may split in Sweden
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger, Elin may split in Sweden
                      
	New York: Embattled golfer Tiger Woods and his wife may finally decide to file their divorce in Sweden at the end of the year to avoid the media circus, according to a report.         
	An entertainment website reported that the couple are working out agreements on child custody and division of assets. Woods has reportedly hired West Palm Beach lawyer Thomas Sasser, an expert in child custody agreements.         
	Wherever the divorce is filed, the plan is to keep the custody and property settlement agreements out of the court file. Were told the quicker and quieter the divorce, the better, the report said, quoting sources.         
	It has been widely speculated that Elin decided to leave Woods once he decided to return to golf despite several public assurances to take a break from the game and mend relations with his family, after his extra marital affairs became public.         
	Shocking details of his private life have attracted worldwide attention with many of the golfers mistresses coming forward to provide information about his infidelity. After the sex scandal broke, Woods took a five-month break and then entered the Masters last month.         
	Woods affairs came to light after his wife found out about his affair with Rachel Uchitel, a New York party planner, which led to an argument and accident on November 27, when Woods crashed his SUV outside his Florida mansion, sustaining minor injuries.         
	The golfer had apologised for his behaviour, spent 45 days in rehab for sex addiction and has spoken of continuing his treatment. During his apology, Woods spoke of not returning to the game until he sorted out his personal life, but changed his mind later.

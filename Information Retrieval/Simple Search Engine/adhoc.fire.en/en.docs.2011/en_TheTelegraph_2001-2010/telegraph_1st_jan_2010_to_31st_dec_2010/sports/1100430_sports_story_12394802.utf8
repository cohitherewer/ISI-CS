The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB focus back on I-League

	Calcutta: For East Bengal, the days of multitasking are almost over. Now the players as well as their coach Phillippe de Ridder can fully concentrate on the I-League. Down in the dumps with 24 points from 20 matches, the red and gold brigade Friday lock horns with wooden-spooners Sporting Clube de Goa, a team languishing at the bottom of the 14-team table.         
	By no means should the local outfit expect an easy outing on Friday as Clube will be trying to make a last-ditch effort to save relegation. Currently on 20 points from 22 games, the Orange Brigade can still beat the drop with a couple of victories and a couple of draws from the remaining four matches, with a few other results going their way.         
	The saddest part about Clubes campaign this season has been lady luck eluding them in crunch situations. Of the 10 matches they have lost, they could have easily drawn a few; among the eight they drew, they could have won a couple if not more.         
	Had some of the results gone their way, Clube would have managed a decent position on the league table.         
	Thus, it certainly would not be a cakewalk for Bhaichung Bhutia and company as they look to log full points against Vishwas Gaonkars side. One shouldnt forget that Clube came from behind to beat Mohun Bagan 2-1 in Calcutta.         
	The home team would be expecting their non-performing assets to pull up their socks and perform; the onus is as much on a Bhaichung as on a Yusif Yakubu or a Mehrajuddin Wadoo.         
	A small piece of statistic illustrates East Bengals lacklustre run but it wont make for happy reading for the East Bengal players and their die-hard supporters.         
	Among the 14 teams in the I-League, East Bengal are the only ones to have scored less than 20 goals. They have managed 19 goals in their 20 matches so far. Which means that on an average, East Bengal have scored less than a goal per match.         
	Compared to East Bengal, who are currently placed 11th, Salgaocar, Mumbai FC and Clube have scored 27, 21 and 25 goals respectively.         
	So now one knows what has been the bane for the team this season: a lack of quality players upfront. Yakubu is no longer as sharp as a couple of seasons back. Bhaichung, coming back from an injury, will require some time to be back at his best. But with the season coming to an end, the Indian captain would ideally like to forget this one  by far the most disappointing I-League for him.

	Sao Paulo: Flamengo have changed their mind and decided not to fire goalkeeper Bruno despite his alleged involvement in the disappearance and alleged murder of his ex-girlfriend.         
	The club say they want to wait until all legal proceedings are over before making a final decision regarding Bruno, who is currently in police custody.         
	Team president Patricia Amorim said last week that Flamengo would also sue Bruno because of damage to the teams image.         
	Authorities have said they consider Bruno the main suspect in ordering the kidnapping and possible murder of his former girlfriend, 25-year-old Eliza Samudio.         
	Police say Samudio was kidnapped in early June and later killed.         
	Her body is yet to be found.           (AGENCIES)

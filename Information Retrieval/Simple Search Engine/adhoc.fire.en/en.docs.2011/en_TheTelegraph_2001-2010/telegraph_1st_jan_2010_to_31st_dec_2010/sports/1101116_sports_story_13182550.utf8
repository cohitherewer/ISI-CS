The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman: Honoured to play alongside Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        Laxman: Honoured to play alongside Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Brendon McCullum, on way to his century, on Monday                           
	Hyderabad: VVS Laxman, playing his first Test on home ground, is optimistic about Indias chances of winning the second Test. And he feels that is possible if the hosts can pick up a couple of early wickets on Tuesday.         
	Speaking at a media conference, Laxman said India can chase down anything less than 225 on the final day. He also wished Sachin Tendulkar luck on completing 21 years of International cricket.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Indias chance of winning the Test         
	We have got a very good chance to win The morning session tomorrow will be very important. We need to pick up two early wickets and then we can get into their tail. But the wicket is still not doing much for the bowlers. There is bounce, but no turn available That is why I think our bowlers did a fantastic job today.         
	The ideal target to chase         
	Ideally, anything less than 225 Even if we need to score at five runs per over, that wouldnt be much of a problem considering our batting line-up. Also, the nature of the wicket supports the batsmen.         
	On Harbhajans back-to-back centuries         
	Outstanding He has been working hard at the nets. All our lower-order batsmen work hard In fact, Gary (Kirsten) has instilled the importance of practice in the team. In Ahmedabad, he played a match-saving innings and, here, he has given us an edge with his innings.         
	Harbhajan being the leading scorer in the series so far         
	Definitely you would want your main batsmen to score runs, be among the top scorers But, at the same time, Im happy that Harbhajan has got runs.         
	Whether he is disappointed at missing out on a hundred in the first innings         
	Im quite happy with my performance We were in a difficult situation after Sachins early dismissal. So, the partnership with (Rahul Dravid) was extremely important. Of course, I would have liked to score a century at my home ground, in front of my coaches But Im happy with the way I batted.         
	If he is surprised to see the wickets not showing much turn         
	Im surprised But the Hyderabad wicket is better than the one in Ahmedabad The bounce is better. But normally, you do expect some turn on the fourth and fifth day of a Test That is not happening here.         
	On New Zealand as opponents         
	They have always been tough. They gave us a good fight in 2003 too They are good players of spin. In this series, it is their patience that is most striking. They are not giving away their wickets.         
	Whether he expects to play another match-winning knock in the fourth innings         
	If required, yes But ideally, we wouldnt want to lose too many early wickets while chasing.         
	On Zaheer Khans injury         
	I am not quite sure about the status of his injury. The team physio would be the right person to answer that.         
	Sachin Tendulkar completing 21 years of international cricket         
	A star was born 21 years ago His contribution to cricket has been unbelievable. The way he carries himself is exemplary He is so humble after so many years. I feel honoured to play alongside him. His dedication is also tremendousEven now he practices as if it is his first Test. There is a lot to learn from him. I wish him best of luck.         
	On the UDRS         
	That is not for me to decide, the BCCI has to take a call. But, personally, I feel that if technology is available, it should be given to the umpires because they do a tough job.

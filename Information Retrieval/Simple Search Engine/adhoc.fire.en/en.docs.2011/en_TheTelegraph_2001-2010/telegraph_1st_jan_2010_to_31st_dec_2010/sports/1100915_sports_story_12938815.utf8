The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bobs boys under pressure
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bobs boys under pressure
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Bob Houghton    
	New Delhi: After back to back defeats against Thailand in a span of five days, Bob Houghtons India will be under pressure to lift their performance when they take on African nation Namibia in a friendly encounter, at the Ambedkar Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	For the past three years, India looked invincible at the Ambedkar, especially after winning two editions of the Nehru Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup. The winning streak was finally broken last Wednesday when Thailand beat India 2-1.         
	Despite all the talk of spirit and discipline, the Indians were far from convincing in front of a home crowd that braved the rain for most part of the match to cheer their team.         
	Barring the defence that gave a stand out performance against a wave of attacks, neither the midfielders nor the strikers were good enough to escape criticism.         
	To overcome the disappointment, India will have to really come good against the strong and athletic Namibians. But a spate of injuries has put them in a position of disadvantage.         
	While key midfielder Steven Dias will miss the match because of a rib fracture, defenders Surkumar Singh and Anwar are also doubtful starters.         
	We will allow more players a look in since there is a need to see the options, Houghton said.         
	While Abhishek Yadav will replace Mohammed Rafi in the forwardline, Mehrajuddin Wadoo may start in the midfield.         
	Like in the match against Thailand, skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, Houghton said, may come in for the last 20 minutes.         
	The team will be in Dubai in November and we have to ensure that Bhaichung reaches peak fitness by that time, Houghton said.         
	Asked about Indias chances on the morrow, the coach said: We dont know their game, neither do they know ours... They will play in their way and we will play in ours.         
	Placed 115 in the Fifa rankings, Namibia are a better side on paper. But they have come to India without their foreign-based professionals. Known as Brave Warriors in African football, the team is being coached by Belgian Tom Saintfiet, a highly respected manager in Namibian football.         
	Saintfiet said the match would serve as good preparation for Namibia for the Casaba Cup in Angola, in November, and it would also provide the Namibians with a good opportunity to showcase their talents to scouts from the I-League, in India.         
	The I-League is very lucrative and a lot of African players are already playing there.         
	This match will provide our players with a good opportunity to possibly land themselves a contract here, hoped the Namibia coach.

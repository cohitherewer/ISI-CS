The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chile end long wait
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chile end long wait
                      
	Nelspruit: Jean Beausejour tapped in the only goal Wednesday, giving Chile their first World Cup victory in 48 years with a 1-0 win over Honduras.         
	Beausejour knocked in a cross from defender Mauricio Isla in the 34th minute to give the Chileans three points in Group H.         
	Were very happy, and we have to enjoy this triumph, Chile forward Alexis Sanchez said. But we have to move ahead and win the game against our next rival.         
	Chile came close to doubling the lead on several occasions but squandered several chances, particularly in the second half. In the 62nd, Sanchez dragged a clear-cut chance wide after he was put through by playmaker Jorge Valdivia. And in the 64th, defender Waldo Ponce saw his close-range header saved by Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladares.         
	Substitute Mark Gonzalez had three attempts on goal near the end.         
	We could have scored more goals and we were on top, Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa said. You cant foresee what will happen, but if the group is decided in that way (on goal difference) then we will rue the chances we missed.         
	Chile were on the attack almost from the start, with midfielder Matias Fernandez threatening in the second minute with a free kick that curled just over the bar.         
	Valdivia tapped one in the net in the 75th but was ruled offside.         
	Honduras found it difficult to break through a well-organised Chilean defence, which was led by Gary Medel, and was restricted to long-range efforts, primarily from lone striker Carlos Pavon.         
	Honduras best chance came from midfielder Ramon Nunez, who threatened with a free kick in first-half injury time that was tipped over the bar by goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. Beausejour said Honduras defensive tactics were tough to break down, and was happy his team had overcome the tension of their first match.         
	They were very simple. They didnt do anything complicated at the back, Beausejour said. They had no problems booting the ball upfield and, in the end, that can make the game difficult. We got over the anxiety by running, which is what we do best, and by trying to play football.         
	Honduras defender Sergio Mendoza, whose attempted clearance rebounded off Beausejour for the winning goal, said his team had been unlucky.         
	Its unfair because the goal was accidental, Mendoza said. From then on, they didnt have any clear scoring opportunities.         
	Chiles last victory at the World Cup came on June 16, 1962, when they hosted the tournament and beat Yugoslavia 1-0 for third place. This is Chiles first World Cup appearance since 1998, when the team managed to get past the group stage with three draws.         
	Bielsa said Chile needed to build on the victory. Well try to win the next game because the objective is to pass to the next round and start writing records, he said.         
	Chile play Switzerland next on Monday in Port Elizabeth, while Honduras will face Spain at Ellis Park.         
	Honduras played without midfielder Julio Cesar de Leon, who was ruled out of the tournament with a hamstring injury. Coach Reinaldo Rueda replaced him with Jerry Palacios, making the national team the first to feature three brothers in a World Cup squad.         
	We lost a bit of what Honduras needed in the middle, Honduras assistant coach Alexis Mendoza said. Were going to get better so we have a chance to qualify for the next round.         
	Mendoza was sitting in for Rueda, who served a touchline ban after having been sent off in Honduras last qualifier against El Salvador.         
	As well as De Leon, striker David Suazo was missing for Honduras after failing to recover from a right thigh injury. Bielsa said he thought the absence of those two key players had affected Honduras.         
	I felt that Honduras came into the game with lots of problems, Bielsa said.         
	That distanced the team from their normal production. Its not easy for any team to cope without De Leon and Suazo. I think thats why Honduras couldnt show the best of themselves.

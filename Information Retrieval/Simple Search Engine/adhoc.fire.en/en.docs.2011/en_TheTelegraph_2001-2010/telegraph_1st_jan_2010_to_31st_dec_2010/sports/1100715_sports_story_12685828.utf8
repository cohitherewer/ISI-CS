The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham is ready for 2012 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Beckham is ready for 2012 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	London: David Beckham wants to play for Britain at the London 2012 Olympics. The Los Angeles Galaxy and England midfielder would be 37 by the time the Olympics come to London.         
	If Im still playing and Im still considered to make a difference to the team Id love to be involved, Beckham said Wednesday.         
	A team of only English footballers is set to represent Britain. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations wont be part of the team, fearing it would jeopardise their independence and voting rights within Fifa.         
	Beckham also said that he hopes to end his career at the 2014 World Cup  and score the winner in the final in Brazil. Beckham was at the World Cup in South Africa as a member of coach Fabio Capellos support staff after being ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury. Beckham said he has been running for the last 10 days and should be back in action for the Galaxy within two months.         
	Beckham fears that the England players who flopped at the World Cup  winning just once and going out in the last-16  could be abused by fans when the new Premier League season starts next month.         
	The players know it was disappointing because we didnt perform, Beckham said. The manager can only do so much, then it has to be down to the players and when the players go on the pitch they know if they dont perform they dont win games.         
	The players are honest about that but its not about individuals, its not about how individuals play  its about how we played as a team. Its a cliche but you win as a team and you lose as a team.         
	Beckham, who was hit by an intense public backlash after being sent off at the 1998 World Cup, didnt want the current squad to face a similar fate.         
	I hope not, but we do live in a world where that happens, Beckham said. You do enjoy the good times, but when the bad times come along you have to learn from them otherwise you just crumble... in 1998 it was tough and you just have to block it out.

    - Ponting hopes for a turnaround in the final Test           A CORRESPONDENT            Ricky Ponting during a practice session in Bangalore, on Friday. (PTI)                                 
	Bangalore: Down 0-1, Australia captain Ricky Ponting faces an uphill task of levelling the two-Test series when his boys take on India, in the second tie, here on Saturday.         
	While Ponting hoped the result of the match would be different from that in Mohali, he maintained that Australia have respect for all Indian batsmen. Speaking at a media conference on Friday, he said too much cricket is taking a toll on players.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Preparations for the second Test         
	We are well prepared as were for the first Test. But I guess Mohali goes to show, perhaps, that if you dont play well for all the five days, you dont achieve the result you are after.         
	As I said, I was very proud of the way the boys played their cricket in the first Test. Unfortunately, we didnt get quite over the line.         
	Hopefully, the result will be slightly different.         
	Whether back-to-back Test series is a problem for bowlers         
	It is hard work for the bowlers, there is no doubt about that, when you have back-to-back games.         
	 We have made sure we have looked after our guys as well as we possibly could.         
	Strain on players like Michael Hussey, who had to come after playing the Champions League T20         
	It was definitely hard on Doug (Bollinger), and Mike Hussey, and even (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni for that matter.         
	I think you could see from his (Dhonis) performance in the last game that hed been feeling the pinch a little bit as well.         
	It definitely wasnt ideal preparation for those guys coming into a Test match.         
	There are a lot of good lessons that can be learnt from the last week.         
	His individual record in India         
	I obviously want to change my captaincy record I have to give myself the best chance, give my team the best chance I have always enjoyed playing in India. I dont know whether this is my last Test or series here.         
	But I have a few years of international cricket left and, hopefully, this not my last (series) in India.         
	If he would allow Laxman a runner if he comes into the second Test with an injury         
	No Learnt a lesson last week If Laxman comes with a pre-match injury, then he wont get a runner To me, hed looked pretty good with his movements in Mohali.         
	On Laxmans chances of playing in Bangalore         
	I expect Laxman to play. Look, when you have a batting order like India, I have to talk about every one of them. Sachin is foremost and first and probably then, Sehwag         
	But we play cricket with total respect for all of these stars.

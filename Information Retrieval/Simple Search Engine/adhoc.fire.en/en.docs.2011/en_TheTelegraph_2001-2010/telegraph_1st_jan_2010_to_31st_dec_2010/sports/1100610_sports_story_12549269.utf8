The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pawar can breathe easy now
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pawar can breathe easy now
  - BCCI tells ICC theres no conflict of interest       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has, in a communication to the International Cricket Council (ICC), clarified that theres no conflict of interest on the issue of Sharad Pawar holding shares of City Corporation Ltd, which failed in its March 21 bid for the Pune franchise.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, the clarification was emailed to Haroon Lorgat, the ICCs chief executive, on Wednesday afternoon.         
	Hell be forwarding it to outgoing president David Morgan.         
	The Pawar issue came up during a telephonic chat between Lorgat and a very senior BCCI official earlier in the day and, within a few hours, the email was sent, the source said.         
	Pawar is the ICCs vice-president and will get to head the world body in three weeks time. A former president of the BCCI, he continues to be at the helm of the Mumbai Cricket Association.         
	The BCCIs own rules dont prevent Pawar from, say, bidding for an Indian Premier League franchise, but the ICC bars members of its Executive Board from gaining commercially through cricket, unless any financial involvement has the home boards approval.         
	Specifically, there just cant be a conflict of interest.         
	Pawar, by virtue of being vice-president, sits on the ICCs Executive Board.         
	One understands that this check was introduced during Jagmohan Dalmiyas tenure as the ICC president, from 1997-2000.         
	The Pawar-related controversy started after the Union ministers family distanced itself from the failed bid for Pune, claiming that it had been made by City Corporations MD, Aniruddha Deshpande, in his individual capacity.         
	As it turned out, the Pawars got it wrong (or they misled the public, as many believe), for the bid had actually been made in the name of City Corporation. The BCCI, though, has ensured that the heat doesnt engulf Pawar, who is recovering after a surgery.         
	The picture would have been very different had City Corporation won the bid (instead of the Sahara Pariwar) and there been complete silence from Pawar.         
	Nevertheless, it still is significant that the BCCI had to email a clarification to the ICC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson vows to axe Cup flops
                                                                                                                       7                                          Ferguson vows to axe Cup flops
            THE TIMES, LONDON            Alex Ferguson                           
	A shocked Alex Ferguson launched a scathing attack on his players after Manchester United were sent crashing out of the FA Cup by Leeds United Sunday.         
	Jermaine Beckfords 19th-minute goal secured his clubs first win at Old Trafford for almost 29 years on an unforgettable afternoon for the fallen giants and Ferguson promised to wield the axe before United make the short trip to Manchester City in the first leg of their Carling Cup semi-final on Wednesday.         
	Sundays 1-0 defeat means that United have failed to reach the fourth round of the Cup for the first time during Fergusons 23-year reign. The last time they were knocked out in the third round was in the 1983-84 season, when Ron Atkinsons side were beaten 2-0 by Bournemouth.         
	Ferguson was also furious at the failure to play more than the allocated five minutes of stoppage time at the end and risked a rebuke from the Football Association by claiming that the time added on was an insult to the game and the players out there.         
	The United manager has a two-match suspended touchline ban hanging over him for describing Alan Wiley as unfit to referee in October.         
	The reward for Leeds is another trip to the kind of venue to which their supporters used to be accustomed as the League One club visit Tottenham Hotspur in the outstanding tie of the fourth-round draw.         
	Ferguson took the defeat hard. I didnt expect that, he said. The preparation was very good. I was shocked at the performance. We didnt start right and Leeds did start right. They fought like tigers, but you expect that from any team coming to Old Trafford. They had a far bigger appetite than us for the game.         
	We have to get it out of our system  thats exactly what you have to do. But we have a semi-final on Wednesday and a lot of these players today (Sunday) wont be playing. You have to view that performance in the right light, but we have to get ready for Wednesday now. I had the team in mind but there may be one or two changes now.         
	Its a disappointment. Human beings can always surprise you but we didnt expect that. I dont think any of them can say they had a good day.         
	Wes Brown replaced Nemanja Vidic in the starting line-up after the Serbia defender pulled up in the warm-up. I couldnt tell you, I couldnt tell you at all, Ferguson said when asked to explain what was wrong with Vidic. His replacement was caught out by Jonathan Howsons fine pass and Beckford, despite a heavy first touch, finished with aplomb.         
	We spoke about it [Beckfords pace] before the game, Ferguson said. They were caught napping. It was a bad goal for us to lose.         
	Simon Grayson, the Leeds manager, said: Its another fantastic draw for us against another top Premier League club. We are looking forward to it. Leeds have beaten Tottenham only once in the competition, in 1972  the year of their only FA Cup success.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kakas red was unfair: Ronaldo 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kakas red was unfair: Ronaldo 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                   
	Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo insists he never felt under pressure before finally ending his 16-month goalscoring drought in the 7-0 battering of North Korea.         
	Carlos Queirozs side made the drab goalless draw with Ivory Coast in their opening World Cup Group G match a distant memory with a display of ruthlessness and verve to dismantle their spirited rivals in Cape Town.         
	Ronaldo improved following a poor first half  from which his side held only a one-goal lead  and was a key figure in a stunning second 45 minutes featuring six goals.         
	Only one of those goals was his and it was a fortuitous one at that, but Ronaldo was not too concerned.         
	I knew the goal would come eventually, he said. Its normal (to have these spells), I didnt feel under pressure about it.         
	I smiled when I scored because it was a funny goal, the way it hit me on the neck.         
	Ronaldo was happy to share the plaudits after the game and disagreed with the official decision to hand him the Man of the Match award.         
	I gave the man of the match prize to Tiago because he played better and it was only fair to give the trophy to him, he revealed.         
	Although mathematically they have yet to seal their last-16 place, Portugals performance was so impressive they can now turn their attention to beating Brazil and trying to top the group.         
	Their hopes of achieving that are boosted by the absence of key Brazilian Kaka, who was harshly dismissed against the Ivory Coast for tangling with Kader Keita.         
	Ronaldo said of his Real Madrid colleague: Its not fair because Kaka did nothing in my opinion, and now he wont play against us.         
	He didnt deserve that red card. I saw the game and I spoke with him about it afterwards.         
	He was angry at the time but after the game hes cool, he understands its part of the game.         
	Meanwhile, midfielder Deco will have an MRI scan on the right hip injury that could keep him out of the match against Brazil.         
	 He may have lost his place in the lineup, anyhow.         
	 The Portuguese football federation says Deco will undergo the scan because he still has pain in his right hip which is preventing him from training normally.         
	Queiroz wished North Korea well having inflicted such a battering on them.         
	I hope North Korea will at least win one a point at the World Cup, given their attitude and performance, he said.         
	North Korea coach Kim Jong-hun immediately deflected blame from his players following the match and believes they can still count on public support.         
	Back home I believe they will be looking ahead to the next game, he said. We have one left and they will be rooting for us to play well in that.         
	We cannot now achieve our objective, to progress, but we will reinforce our mental state and really work hard.         
	He added: Against the Ivory Coast well have to rethink our strategy and tactics. Portugal have very strong individual players and a fast passing style.         
	We did prepare for that, but it was not sufficient.

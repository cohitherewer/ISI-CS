                              Saina Nehwal      
	Mumbai: Saina Nehwal has been seeded second and given a first round bye in the womens singles, at next months Asian Games in Guangzhou.         
	The badminton events, in which seven gold medals are at stake, would be held from November 13-21.         
	Saina, who is currently the world No. 3 behind top ranked Xin Wang and Yihan Wang of China, is expected to get past either Lydia Cheah of Malaysia or Vietnams Thi Trang Vu, who are to clash in the first round.         
	The 20-year-old Indian shuttler, who made it to the Beijing Olympic Games quarter finals two years ago, has beaten Lydia when they met in the final of the Chinese Taipei Open in 2008.         
	Sainas rising stature and her recent form going into the Asian Games after winning the Commmonwealth Games gold, should stand her in good stead if she is to face the 21-year-old Malaysian girl.         
	Saina has however, never met the Vietnamese before in an international competition at the senior level.         
	A victory in Round II would pilot the world junior champion straight into a potentially dangerous clash with Hong Kongs world No. 12. Pui Yin Yip, seeded sixth.         
	They have a 1-1 head-to-head record till now, with Saina having conquered Pui in straight games last year in the French Open after having lost to the Hong Kong girl in the 2007 Swiss Open.         
	In the semi-finals, Saina is drawn to meet Chinese world No. 5 Shixian Wang, the third seed, to whom she had lost in this years World Championship.         
	As many as eight players in the worlds top 20, including world No. 1 Xin Wang, have entered the singles contest in which the other participant from India, Aditi Mutatkar (world No. 39) would be up against Thilini Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka in the first round.         
	A victory in the opener would pit Aditi against formidable Eriko Hirose of Japan, the fourth seed and world No. 8, for a place in the last eight.         
	In mens singles, Indias Parupalli Kashyap will have to overcome world No. 9 Tien Minh Nguyen, seeded fifth, in the first round while national champion Chetan Anand, ranked 18th in the world, is to line up against world No. 4, Jin Chen of China who is seeded third.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India return to Group I
                                                                                                                       7                                        India return to Group I
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Sania Mirza                           
	Mumbai: India bounced back to Asia/Oceania Group I of the Fed Cup womens team tennis competition, but the problem of finding a strong second player to support Sania Mirza is yet to be resolved, coach Enrico Piperno said on Saturday.         
	Sania (Mirza) is ranked 59 in the world and Poojashree (Venkatesha), Indias second highest ranked player, is 357. That alone tells the story, Piperno told The Telegraph after India defeated Kyrgyzstan 3-0 in the Group II play-off of the zonal qualifiers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.         
	Veteran Rushmi Chakravarthy, playing instead of Poojashree who had a sore knee, overcame Bermet Duvanaeva 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in the opening singles before Sania thrashed Ksenia Palkina 6-0, 6-2 to clinch the tie for India.         
	The rivals conceded the inconsequential doubles rubber when Rushmi and Sanaa Bhambri were leading Bermet and Nelli Buyuklianova 6-0, 1-0.         
	India did not lose a single match in Malaysia, a pleasant reversal from last year when, without the services of Sania, they were relegated from Group I after failing to win a match.         
	Piperno would not predict whether India would stay in Group I next year, leave alone qualify for the World Group. Nor would he hypothesise whether the team would have got promoted from Group II if Sania had not played this time.         
	Thats a good question. Group I will be tough as teams like Kazakhstan are really strong. They have players ranked in the top-100, he said.         
	We really need a second player to support Sania. We need to work on our second string Unless players like Poojashree get in to top-150, stand-up and be counted, its going to be difficult. But overall I am excited as we didnt lose a game this time, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inzy keen to be Pak batting coach
                                                                                                                       7                                        Inzy keen to be Pak batting coach
                    Inzamam                
	Karachi: Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq has offered his services as a batting coach for the national side struggling to score runs in England.         
	The team definitely needs a full-time batting coach and if any offer is made to me for this position, I will definitely give it serious consideration, Inzamam said.         
	Pakistans batting line-up has struggled in English conditions, when the tourists were reduced to 147 for nine in reply to Englands 358 in the first test at Nottingham.         
	In the two-test home series played in England against Australia earlier this month, Pakistan were unable to score more than 250 runs in any innings, although they won the second test at Leeds after bowling Australia out for 88 on the first day.         
	Pakistan also suffered when selectors overlooked former captains and experienced batsmen Younus Khan and Muhammad Yousuf for the tour despite public pressure to include them.         
	Inzamam, Pakistans most capped player with 120 test and 378 one-day international appearances, said that the present team was not equipped technically to handle test matches.         
	They need a batting coach to guide them and it is a responsibility I would look at accepting because Pakistan cricket has given me a lot, he added.         
	The batsmen are not playing with the required technique and temperament.         
	They lack patience and get out after scoring 20 to 30 runs which is not good enough for test matches.         
	Inzamam believes Pakistans biggest problem is that players have grown too accustomed to playing limited-overs cricket and find it difficult to adjust to test matches.         
	Even a good batsman requires a year or so in test cricket to settle down and play long innings. I would advise the selectors to try out a combination of senior and young players. And they should use Younus and Yousuf, he added.           (PTI)

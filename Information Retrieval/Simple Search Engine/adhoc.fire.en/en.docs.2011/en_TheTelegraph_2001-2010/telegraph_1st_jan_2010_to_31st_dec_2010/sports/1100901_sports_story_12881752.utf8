The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Still in a state of shock: Broad
                                                                                                                       7                                      Still in a state of shock: Broad
                            
	London: England players are still in a state of shock after the spot fixing allegations surfaced against Pakistani cricketers but young fast bowler Stuart Board says the upcoming ODI series should go ahead as per schedule. He also said that it was for the authorities to decide whether the suspected Pakistani cricketers should be suspended from the remaining tour.         
	The ODI series should go on, as far as Im concerned. We shouldnt call it off on the back of an ongoing investigation. We want to play and what about the supporters who have paid for tickets? Broad wrote his column for a British daily.         
	It is up to others to decide whether any of the Pakistan players involved in those allegations should miss those games, but we will be giving our utmost against whoever we face. And we trust the opposition will be, too.         
	Broad, who hit his maiden Test century in the Lords Test, believes that Pakistani side fought hard throughout and that he did not notice anything untoward in the series, which his side won 3-1.         
	We are still very stunned. The dressing room is in a state of shock at the allegations that now surround our Test series victory over Pakistan. I can honestly say that I never dreamt there was anything untoward about our victories, he wrote.         
	I cant accept that this series victory has been tarnished in any way. Whatever the true story is, I have absolutely no doubts that Pakistan were giving everything to try to win that match (Lords). It was proper competition, as it has been throughout the series.         
	Believe me, the (Pakistani) bowling was of a very high standard against us at Lords. Ask our batsmen, who were out cheaply as we slipped to 47 for five, whether or not that was full-blooded Test cricket out there and they will tell you that it was extremely tough going, Broad wrote.         
	The 20-year-old cricketer though favoured strict punishment for those who are found guilty of any wrongdoing. You must always trust what you are watching and the moment you feel you are not sure that someone is giving their best is the moment when sport loses its reason for being.         
	Thats why I fully agree with our captain, Andrew Strauss, who believes that anyone found guilty of match-fixing, spot-fixing or anything that stops a game of cricket taking its natural course should face the heaviest punishments, he wrote.         
	Broad hit a magnificent 169 in Englands only innings at Lords feels that no scandal can take away his achievement from him. This was the biggest achievement in my Test career so far, even bigger than my bowling spell at The Oval when we won the Ashes last year, and nothing can take that away from me.         
	Broad, who is son of ICC match referee Chris, also insisted that he was never approached by anyone for any wrongful conduct. (Agencies)

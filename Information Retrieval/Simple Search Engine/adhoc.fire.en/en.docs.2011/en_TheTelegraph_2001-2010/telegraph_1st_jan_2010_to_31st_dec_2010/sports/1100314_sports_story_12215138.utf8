            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan in the city, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan, the principal owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), would like icon and captain Sourav Ganguly to keep playing for his franchise.         
	The Sourav-KKR deal, covering the first three years of the IPL, comes to an end this season.         
	I dont think this is his last year with us... Id like Dada to play for us for the rest of his life, Shah Rukh, who arrived in the city on Saturday evening, told The Telegraph.         
	As for Sourav, he intends taking a call at the end of the season. The 37-year-old said as much in Mumbai the other day.         
	Sourav was the first KKR captain, but got sacked, at John Buchanans behest, last year. The top job then went to Brendon McCullum. Sourav got back the captaincy after the pathetic (bottom-placed finish) show was reviewed.         
	Buchanans contract was terminated. His place has gone to Dav Whatmore.         
	Whatmore, incidentally, misplaced his mobile phone on Jets Mumbai-Calcutta flight on Saturday morning. Apparently, it was located in the aircraft, on the next sector, but the coach hadnt got it back till 7.30 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan take on Mahindra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan take on Mahindra
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohun Bagan would aim to maintain their unbeaten streak against Mahindra United when the sides face-off in a crucial I-League clash at the Cooperage here on Thursday.         
	Bagan are three points behind Mahindra who are atop the standings with 20 points and a third win on the trot, following victories in Durand Cup and Federation Cup would enable the visitors bridge that gap.         
	But the scenario couldnt have been more contrasting from what it was four months ago.         
	Karim Bencharifas team are without several key players due to injury and although they had Jose Barreto in sparkling form in their 5-0 victory over Mumbai FC last week, it is not going to be a similar cakewalk against Mahindra.         
	Besides, the form that David Booths men displayed in their 5-0 demolition of Lajong FC would have served a warning for the Calcutta club.         
	Mahindra would also be bolstered by the return of Thoi Singh while Bagan would continue to miss Edeh Chidi while Rakesh Masih and James Singh are also doubtful starters.When we came to Mumbai, we wanted six points from two matches. We have achieved the first part of that goal, and hope to get the second part right too, Barreto said on the eve of the match.         
	Bencharifa said: We had a look at the table and discussed the situation. It is important to get three points.         
	His counterpart David Booth sought to down play the 5-0 victory against Lajong.         
	The most positive thing was the way we played. But Bagan will be a different cup of tea altogether.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni has handled seniors superbly
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni has handled seniors superbly
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nagpur: Very good, is how Ajit Wadekar, himself a hugely successful India captain, saluted the present incumbent, Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Wadekar is, of course, a former coach (hed been in that position during the first-ever India versus South Africa Test series) and chief selector, too.         
	A lot of people have, rightly, talked about Dhoni being calm and not getting ruffled in tight situations, but the way he has handled so many seniors stands out more. His man management has been remarkable, Wadekar told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday afternoon, he added: Sachin Tendulkar downwards, Dhoni has captained so many seniors... Even Dinesh Karthik made his India debut before him... Yet, not once have I heard anybody say anything adverse about Dhoni... He deserves the highest praise for handling the seniors superbly...         
	Dhoni, a World T20-winning captain, has been leading India in all forms since November 2008.

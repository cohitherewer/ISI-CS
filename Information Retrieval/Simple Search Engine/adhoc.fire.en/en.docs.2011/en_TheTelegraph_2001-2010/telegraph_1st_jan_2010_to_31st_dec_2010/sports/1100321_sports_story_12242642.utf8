	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans hope of winning the I-League were virtually dashed when bottom-placed Sporting Clube de Goa shocked the home team 2-1 in a 17th round encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	Incidentally, this was the Goan outfits first victory after a winless streak of 16 matches. Although they still remain at the bottom, these three points will definitely loosen the noose of relegation on the Goan outfit. It would also give some respite to their coach Vishwas Gaonkar, who might have been forced to quit had his boys not got a favourable result.         
	For Bagan, who have now lost seven points in the last three matches, it will be difficult to dream of winning the championship.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade started the match with a bang when Barretos angular flick of a low Snehasish Chakraborty centre found the net in the 12th minute. But the home team lost control after that. Clubes foreign recruits, Junior Elijah and Nathaniel Amos, started disturbing the defenders. At the other end, the Goan outfits back-four gave a solid performance, led by Man of the match Kengi Arai.         
	The equaliser came in the 32nd minute when Junior headed the ball for an unmarked A. Khan. Although the angle was a bit acute, his rasping volley beat Sangram Mukherjee to find the back of the net. The winner in the 67th minute was result of a counter-attack. Amos ran down the right flank and his low centre saw Junior dive to nod home.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Satyajit Chatterjee admitted at the post-match press conference that it is very difficult for a team to comeback after three bad matches. We are going through a bad phase. Lets hope we will be able to overcome it during our next home match against Lajong, Satyajit said.

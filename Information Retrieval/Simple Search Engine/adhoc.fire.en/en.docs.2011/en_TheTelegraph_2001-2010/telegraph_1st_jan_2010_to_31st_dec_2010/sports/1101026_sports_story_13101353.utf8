The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak aiming to stay focused

	Abu Dhabi: Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi hoped his beleaguered side is focused enough to counter a spirited South African team in the back-to-back Twenty20 matches starting here Tuesday.         
	Pakistans recent tour to England was rocked by spot-fixing allegations, which prompted a Scotland Yard investigation and the suspension of three of their players by the International Cricket Council.         
	Test captain Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammad Aamer were charged for violating the Code of Conduct during the Lords Test against England in August, a controversy which Afridi said is a thing of the past.         
	My players are professional and have put all the controversy behind them, Afridi said at the launch of the series in which Pakistan will also play five one-day Internationals and two Tests.         
	Afridi said the team has ample talent to counter the South Africans.         
	We know we are without two of our best bowlers in Aamer and Asif, said Afridi of the two suspended bowlers.         
	But we still have ample talent to counter South Africa who are a very good side in the shorter form of the game.         
	South African captain Johan Botha agreed Pakistan will miss the talent of Asif and Aamer.         
	You always miss quality players and surely Pakistan will miss the two (suspended) bowlers, but we too have injury problems in the team and when such things happen other players step in, said Botha.         
	All-rounder Jacques Kallis and fast bowlers Morne Morkel and Dale Styen were still recovering from various injuries and may not be able to play the first Twenty 20.         
	Botha hoped at least two of the three players will be available for the second Twenty 20, also to be played here on Wednesday.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button falls victim to McLarens tendency for self-harm
                                                                                                                       7                                        Button falls victim to McLarens tendency for self-harm
            Kevin Garside            Jenson Button                           
	Monaco: Another weekend of self-harm at McLaren. Any more of this and we shall have to get the doctor out. This time it was a cover left in the air cooling system of Jenson Buttons McLaren that accounted for his third-lap exit.         
	If the safety car had not been out early the heat might not have built so catastrophically behind the radiator and he would perhaps have got away with it. But this is Formula One. Winning is hard enough as it is, especially around these streets, without loading the job with ifs.         
	Buttons teammate, Lewis Hamilton, finished where he started in fifth but not without another thorny exchange with the pit wall when the engineers warned him to ease back to protect the brakes. What the hell? Do you want me to race these guys or look after the car? Hamilton yelled.         
	We have been here before, remember. In Australia Hamilton went ape at the team for bringing him in for a second tyre stop when his rivals pitted only once.         
	McLarens eternally patient team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, believed he was acting in Hamiltons best interests, an argument that meant little to the driver.         
	Instead of looking at the sky, or sticking a hand out of the garage in Malaysia, McLaren put all their trust in a GPS weather system and were washed out of the first qualifying session at Sepang.         
	At the last race, in Barcelona, Button lost his instrument function on the steering wheel. On Saturday he set out in qualifying with the remote control for his garage monitor in his cockpit. It was never life threatening and he was able to dump it around Rascasse. On Sunday the car dumped him.         
	The anguished look associated with a man used to kicking himself is becoming a permanent feature of the Whitmarsh post-race addresses.         
	It is disappointing for everyone in the team and for the person responsible. I know these things happen but it is just hard to accept when it does. Obviously he is devastated. When you are trying to do your best and you make a mistake it is devastating.         
	It is a cooling cover usually used in the garage. It was left in. The car went to the grid with no airflow and was cooked. You do what you can but you cannot recover from that. These cars dont have fans, they rely on airflow, so if you deny that you are not going to survive very long.         
	Whatever anger Button might have felt had dissipated in the two hours to the end of the race.         
	Its a mistake that you would think shouldnt happen but it does. Im sure the guy who did not pull it out is gutted. I feel sorry for the guy. We all make mistakes. We just have to make sure we dont make them again. Its done now.         
	Last week was annoying because I lost everything on the steering wheel. But this one was a race stopper. The problem was the safety car. It was the stuff behind the radiator that got really hot. As soon as I saw the smoke coming out the back of the car I knew it was serious.         
	The cock-up meant Button dropped from first to fourth in the drivers championship, eight points behind joint leaders Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, of Red Bull. Hamilton is a further 11 points back in seventh.         
	The roulette wheel that is this season has spun some unlikely results but not here. Webber made it back-to-back wins from pole followed by Vettel, who made short work of Robert Kubica off the line.         
	Poor reliability at Red Bull has kept the title race tight, until now. F1 heads to Turkey for round seven with Red Bull leading both championships. Hamilton asked the wrong question. It is not a matter of wanting to race these guys but one of being able to do so. Right now none is.

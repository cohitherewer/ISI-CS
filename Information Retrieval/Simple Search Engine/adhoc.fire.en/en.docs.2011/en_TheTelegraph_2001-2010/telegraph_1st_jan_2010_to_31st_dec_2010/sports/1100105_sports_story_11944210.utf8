The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan 204 runs ahead 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan 204 runs ahead 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Pakistan held a 204-run lead with one wicket in hand at the end of day two of the second Test after a late Australia rally at the SCG.         
	The hosts took seven for 141 in the final session to at least limit the damage after the tourists were 205 for two at one stage.         
	Pakistan, who resumed on 14 without loss in reply to Australias 127, reached 331 for nine at stumps with last pair Danish Kaneria (2) and Mohammed Asif (0) at the crease.         
	Faisal Iqbal (27) was the first to fall after tea  victim of a wonderful Shane Watson catch. He slashed at a wide delivery from Peter Siddle and Watson, back-pedalling furiously, took a terrific catch at deep point.         
	Skipper Mohammed Yousuf (46) was next to go with the score on 236.         
	The wicket-keeper stretched high and wide to his right to accept a one-handed snare, giving Mitchell Johnson his second scalp.         
	Umar Akmal was typically frenetic in clubbing nine fours in his 48-ball 49 before Doug Bollinger trapped him lbw, albeit after the decision was referred to the third umpire.         
	Bollinger soon had his second wicket as Misbah-ul Haq (11) edged to Haddin.         
	He grabbed a third scalp when Watson at deep point held onto a catch from the dangerous Kamran Akmal (14) to leave the visitors 295 for seven.

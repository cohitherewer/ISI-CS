	Rome: Rafael Nadal opened his bid for a fifth Rome Masters title with a quick 6-1, 6-3 win over Philipp Kohlschreiber on Wednesday.         
	Having withdrawn from last weeks Barcelona Open, Nadal appeared fresh and was able to dictate play with his usual combination of heavy topspin, few unforced errors and an array of baseline winners.         
	The third-ranked Spaniard improved to 6-0 in his career against his 29th-ranked German opponent.         
	Nadal has won this clay-court tournament four of the past five years and is the overwhelming favorite for another victory after top-ranked Roger Federer was stunned by Ernests Gulbis on Tuesday.         
	Federer got some consolation Wednesday when he teamed in doubles with fellow Swiss player Yves Allegro to beat sixth-seeded Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Paul Hanley of Australia 4-6, 6-3, 10-8 after a champions tiebreaker.         
	Nadal only faced one break point  at 2-3 in the second set  and saved it when Kohlschreiber missed an easy backhand wide. Nadal then broke in the next game, producing a high passing shot that         
	Kohlschreiber could barely get his racket on, and cruised the rest of the way.         
	The new 10,500-seat stadium at the Foro Italico was nearly full for the match, but Nadal gave the spectators only 1 hour, 10 minutes of action. He led 18-15 in winners and committed only 11 unforced errors to Kohlschreibers 28.         
	Earlier, 42nd-ranked Guillermo Garcia-Lopez beat former No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt 6-2, 6-3. Hewitt is still regaining his form after undergoing hip surgery on January 29, and ground out a three-set win over ninth-seeded Mikhail Youzhny on Tuesday.         
	Also, fifth-seeded Robin Soderling extended his solid form of late with a 6-1, 7-5 win over Italian wild card Paolo Lorenzi.         
	 Another Italian wild card, Filippo Volandri, eliminated Julien Bennetau of France 6-2, 6-0, and Colombian qualifier Santiago Giraldo beat Michael Llodra of France 6-3, 6-2.

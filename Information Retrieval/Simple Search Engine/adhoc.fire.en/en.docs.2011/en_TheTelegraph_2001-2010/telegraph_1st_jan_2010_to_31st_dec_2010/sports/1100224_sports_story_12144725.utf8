The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni not swayed by rankings
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni not swayed by rankings
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten and Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday                           
	Gwalior: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, isnt swayed much by rankings. Actually, not at all.         
	Rankings are just a reflection of how an individual or a team is performing... They can and do change, which is why I dont get carried away, Dhoni told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Dhoni has, of course, regained the No.1 ranking in ODIs  a position he soared to for the first time in April 2006, before the tour to the West Indies.         
	I wouldnt say theres more pressure on me because Im back as No.1... Pressure is always there at the international level... I know Viru (Virender Sehwag) is No.1 in Tests... It all goes to show that Indian cricket is really doing well, Dhoni added.         
	There are, in fact, three batsmen in the top 10 both in Tests and ODIs: Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir (fifth) and Sachin Tendulkar (joint sixth, with Michael Clarke) in Tests; Dhoni, Sachin (sixth) and Sehwag (ninth) in ODIs.         
	Where team rankings go, Indias No.1 in Tests and No.2 (behind Australia) in ODIs. Even a win in the ongoing series wont change Indias position, but a loss would lead to slipping to No.3.         
	Swayed or not by rankings, Dhoni wouldnt like that.

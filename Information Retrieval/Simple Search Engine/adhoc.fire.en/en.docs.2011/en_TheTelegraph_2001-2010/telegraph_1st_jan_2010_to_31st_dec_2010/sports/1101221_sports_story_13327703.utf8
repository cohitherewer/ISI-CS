The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith: Scoring under pressure is a feather in Tendulkars cap
                                                                                                                       7                                        Smith: Scoring under pressure is a feather in Tendulkars cap
  - Sachin-Dhoni partnership was the only time India really stood up in the game       A CORRESPONDENT            South African captain Graeme Smith and teammates return to the pavilion, after defeating India by an innings and 25 runs, in the first Test, in Centurion, on Monday.

	Centurion: South African captain Graeme Smith was happy that his team was able to put up a dominant performance as they beat India by an innings and 25 runs in the first Test. He also praised Sachin Tendulkar for his 50th Test century under pressure during a press conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	South Africas performance         
	Smith: It was a pretty dominant performance. We controlled the game throughout the four days. I think the Sachin Tendulkar-MS Dhoni partnership was the one time that we were in the back foot... The wicket flattened out a lot, it was hot and windy and the guys showed a lot of character, especially Dale Steyns spell at the end. We were ahead of the game the whole time, we played with good pace which gave us a lot of time to bowl India out.         
	Winning the toss         
	Smith: It was definitely a positive thing... I dont think the wicket actually did that much. For a wicket that was under covers for four days, I thought it would do a bit more. In my mind, I think India expected more from the wicket than what actually happened. They were tentative and were on the back foot a lot of the time. Our bowlers bowled well. When you bowl on a wicket that you think is going to do a bit, youve got to get the ball in the right place. We were very controlled and I think we did well.         
	Sachin Tendulkars 50th hundred         
	Smith: The guy has scored 50 Test hundreds so its a bit hard to rate this one. Hes scored a few hundreds before I can even remember. Under pressure, being able to score runs is a feather in his cap. I was a bit surprised that he made life for us so easy this morning. I think MS needs credit for the partnership as well If he didnt hang around, Sachin wouldnt have got his 50th. That partnership in general was the one time that they really stood up in the game.         
	Jacques Kallis double hundred         
	Smith: The change-room was very emotional. All of us scored 100 that day with him. We were pretty drained when we got out on to the field. Especially after lunch those last 15 runs, our palms were sweating. Jakes has been the one guy thats really put our country on the map in the modern era. Hes held our team together for a really long time and for the first time in two or three years theres a batting unit around him thats performing well. It was wonderful to see him achieve that.         
	Kallis: It probably still hasnt sunk in, you get caught up in the Test match trying to win and thinking about how to take wickets. . It will probably hit home when I walk out in Durban and see 201 on the scoreboard. Its something I am really proud of achieving. I realised how much it meant to myself and my teammates and all the supporters. Ive had unbelievable well wishes The ovation that I got, I had to breathe not to let the tears start flowing. It really meant a lot to me. Its something I will remember for the rest of my life.         
	The importance of having Kallis in the side         
	Smith: He gives us balance. He allows us to play five bowlers which is a big thing in Test cricket to have that extra option. We can use him in short spells and we do short, aggressive spells. In the modern era, he is the best all rounder. Its hard to compare to other eras.         
	On Kallis 200 being termed less important than Sachins 50th century         
	Smith: It tends to be a South African thing. We always seem to fly under the radar. What our side has achieved in terms of victories and achievements for us is outstanding. If we can go on to win the series, it will be another big achievement for us.         
	If India can take 20 wickets in a Test         
	Smith: Id love to say no (they cant) but no one wants to touch the money. For us, its about getting refocused. Who knows how the wicket will play in Durban, theres been a lot of rain there around this period also. Weve got to be realistic. As a batting unit, weve become a very strong top-six. The guys have had good performances for a long time and wed like to think we are a strong, powerful batting unit and we can cope with conditions wherever we go.         
	The pressure on India after losing the first Test         
	Smith: When you go 0-1 down in a three-match series, theres always extra pressure. The build-up to the next Test becomes crucial The decisions you make, how you train, the selection, how the squad moves to the next Test. They will be feeling a lot of pressure, I know the Indian team always play under pressure, but they will feel it. Theres high expectations and theyve won a lot of big series and they are No. 1 in the world. If we can go to Durban and really get in a good first few days there, it will be great.         
	Zaheer Khans absence         
	Smith: I dont personalise things too much, I prepare for Zaheer the same way as I prepare for everyone else. Hes a new ball bowler, Im an opening batsman so its a natural challenge. He has obviously bowled well to left-handers so its an exciting prospect.

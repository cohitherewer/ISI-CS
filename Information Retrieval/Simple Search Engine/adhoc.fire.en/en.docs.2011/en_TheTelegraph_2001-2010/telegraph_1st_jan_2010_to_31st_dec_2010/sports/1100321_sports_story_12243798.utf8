The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sedate Knights lose
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sedate Knights lose
  - Rajasthan Royals earn first victory in their fourth match of IPL III       A CORRESPONDENT            Ashok Dinda on Saturday. (PTI)                                 
	The Rajasthan Royals finally came up with a majestic performance, registering their first victory in the third season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The casualty were the Knights from Kolkata who fell short by 34 runs in Ahmedabad, Saturday.         
	Chasing a target of 169, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) managed a huffing-and-puffing show to put up 134 for five in their stipulated 20 overs.         
	What went wrong for the Knights in their fourth match?         
	The answer  Sourav Ganguly and his boys failed to keep up with the pace of a Twenty20 match, and played it in the manner akin to that of a one-day International, falling way behind the required run rate.         
	KKR lost the match between the fifth and the 15th over. They managed 37 in the first five, added just 28 more in the next five and annexed a meagre 34 between the 10th and the 15th. The Knights batting line-up lacks a big-hitter and its a crime if you get yourself into a situation where you need to score 70 in the last five overs. Letting the required run rate soar was inexplicable as they did not lose too many wickets.         
	Shane Warnes surprise move of opening the bowling with Yusuf Pathan clicked as he dismissed Manoj Tiwary in his second over. Cheteshwar Pujara, who replaced Rohan Gavaskar, teamed up well with Brad Hodge to arrest the fall. While Hodge managed an insipid 34-ball 36, Pujara garnered a 25-ball 29.         
	Much was expected of captain Sourav and though he threw his bat at almost everything, flies were the only ones affected. His 29-ball 33 with three fours was never going to be a match-winning effort and it didnt. Owais Shahs late effort was indeed a bit too late.         
	The day had begun on a perfect note for the Knights as Ashok Dinda, getting a look-in for the first time this season, caught Michael Lumb plumb in front of the stumps with his first delivery.                     
	Yusuf (15), the Baroda bomber, didnt provide any fireworks. As a counter, Sourav unleashed his fastest Knight, Shane Bond, aiming to exploit the senior Pathans weakness against the short balls. A Dinda bouncer, in fact, got rid of Yusuf.         
	But the best among the Royals was Man of the Match Abhishek Jhunjhunwala whose clinical 36-ball 45 was scored at a brisk pace and yet was devoid of any undue risk.         
	Australian Adam Voges (37 not out off 22) provided the final impetus to the Royals innings.         
	Shah Rukh Khans franchise, once again, seems to be heading towards a blind alley and crucial will be the role of Chris Gayle, who was not played in this match. Gayle cant afford to be anything less than the Baazigar!

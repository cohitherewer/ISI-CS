	Named after one of the renowned sons of the struggle and emancipation of South Africa against the apartheid regime, the Peter Mokaba Stadium holds much historical significance in South Africa. Peter Mokaba was born and bred in Polokwane and was renowned for his fighting spirit and for his inspirational leadership.         
	The design is inspired by the locally iconic Baobab tree, with the steel structure supporting the roof plane gathered together at each corner of the stadium and supported by giant trunk structures which accommodate vertical circulation ramps and service cores. Didier Drogba remains one of the biggest stars to play at this venue when he played for Ivory Coast in a memorable African Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa.

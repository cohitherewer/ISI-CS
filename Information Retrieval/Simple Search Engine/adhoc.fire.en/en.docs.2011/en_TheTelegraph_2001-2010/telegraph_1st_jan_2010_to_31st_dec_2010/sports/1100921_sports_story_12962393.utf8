The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fire Lorgat, fumes Butt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fire Lorgat, fumes Butt
                      
	Dubai: Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt on Monday said the International Cricket Councils handling of the spot-fixing investigation was terrible and its chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, should be fired.         
	He also accused the England and Wales Cricket Board of being biased in the investigation engulfing the Pakistan team and threatened to sue those behind the sinister conspiracy.         
	The ICC opened another investigation over the weekend into alleged Pakistani fixing on the England tour, following claims that the scoring pattern in Pakistans innings in last Fridays one-day match was prearranged.         
	Butt said the ECB had sent a letter to the ICC which he claimed suggested that the allegations of match-fixing pertained solely to Pakistan. He did not provide a copy of the letter or say when it had been sent.         
	This is biased thinking. This is biased views. This is biased action taken by some of the people, Butt said. We have started an in-house investigation and we will book everybody who has done this. They said they will sue me. I will sue them. This is something totally wrong.         
	Butt also accused the ICC of suspending players Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammad Aamer without proof.         
	London police on Friday passed their initial evidence to prosecutors to consider charges.         
	How have they come to this conclusion? Butt said of the suspension. There has been no investigation. This is not fair. This is definitely a conspiracy against Pakistan cricket.         
	Butt went on to suggest that the motives behind the suspension may be to undermine Pakistans chances in next years World Cup. Half our team is destroyed, he said. We are preparing for the World Cup. May be there are some countries that dont want us to play in the World Cup. This is wrong. We will look into the conspiracy and definitely, definitely, definitely take action.         
	He also said the PCB would call for some action to be taken against Lorgat at the ICCs next meeting.         
	I think he should resign or the ICC consider sacking him, said Butt, who called Lorgat a friend. He should apologise to me, to the players and remove suspensions.         
	Butt stood by the allegations he made previously when he suggested that the England players may have thrown Fridays match at the Oval, which Pakistan won by 23 runs.         
	Currently there is a lot of talk by bookies that some England players were involved in losing the match to Pakistan, he said. At one stage, five wickets fell for 17 runs. Asked to provide proof or the names of bookies, he said in due course of time, we will make it public.

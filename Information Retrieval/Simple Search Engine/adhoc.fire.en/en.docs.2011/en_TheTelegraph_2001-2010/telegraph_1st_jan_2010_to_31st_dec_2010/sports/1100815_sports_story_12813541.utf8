The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gay shines at Diamond meet
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gay shines at Diamond meet
    - American clocks 9.78 to become this years fastest man           Simon Hart               Tyson Gay                                 
	Conqueror of Usain Bolt and now the fastest man on the planet this year. Tyson Gay has not only emerged from the shadow of the triple Olympic champion but stands in a shining spotlight of his own after a spectacular victory at Friday nights Aviva London Grand Prix.         
	A sell-out Crystal Palace crowd rose to salute the mild-mannered American, who burst out of his blocks to win the 100 metres in 9.78sec  the fastest time in the world this season. Bolt and fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell shared the previous best mark of 9.82sec.         
	It was also the second quickest 100m time ever witnessed in Britain, with only Powell having run faster on British soil when he clocked 9.77sec to equal his own world record in Gateshead in 2006.         
	Gays achievement was all the more impressive given the cool, damp conditions in south London and the absence of any meaningful competition following Powells withdrawal with a back injury 24 hours earlier.         
	I wasnt expecting to go that fast in these conditions but I knew I was in good shape and was going to go fast, he said.         
	It was a performance that provided further evidence that the battle for global sprint supremacy is now a two-man race. It was also a sharp reminder to Bolt, who has ended season on medical advice, that he will need to be back to his physical best next year if he is to retain his superstar status.         
	Gay, never a man to indulge in idle boasts, even predicted that there was more in the tank.         
	I think theres more to come, he said. Its great to be on top of the world. Thats important to me. This is not the best shape Ive ever been in because Im still dealing with a few little injuries. My coach said that I can run 9.7 in any conditions and I think I showed that.         
	It was just as well that Gay was able to rise to the occasion after a disappointing night from a British perspective. The two-day meeting, part of the Diamond League series, had been billed as a glorious homecoming for the British heroes of Barcelona but proved instead that success on the European stage only gets you so far against world-class opposition.         
	The crowd cheered, clapped and beat their inflatable thunder sticks but were denied the sight of a single British victory just two weeks after the country achieved its biggest ever medal haul at a European Championships.         
	Even Phillips Idowu, a man who can usually be relied on to produce a big performance when it matters, was a shadow of the triple jumper who produced a lifetime best of 17.81 metres to take the gold medal in Spain.         
	On Friday night he could manage just 16.54m, which was good enough for only for sixth place in a competition won by Swedens Christian Olsson with a leap of 17.41m. Frenchman Teddy Tamgho was second with 17.27m.         
	Mo Farah, fresh from his double European triumph, was the pick of the home athletes with a battling second place in the 3,000m, though he lacked the legs to mount a serious challenge to American Bernard Lagat. Farah clocked 7min 40.75sec behind Lagats winning time of 7min 40.36sec.         
	Dai Greene, another of Britains European gold medallists, finished third in his 400m hurdles race in 49.09sec, with victory going to American world No 1 Bershawn Jackson in 48.12sec.         
	Lisa Dobriskey, the world silver medallist, also had to settle for third place in the 1500m, clocking 4min 9.07sec behind Kenyas Nancy Langat and Russian Anna Alminova.

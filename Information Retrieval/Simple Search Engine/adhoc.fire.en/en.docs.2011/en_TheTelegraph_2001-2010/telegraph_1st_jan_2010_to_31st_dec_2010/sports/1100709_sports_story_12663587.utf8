The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Klose may miss tie vs Uruguay 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Klose may miss tie vs Uruguay 
                      
	Erasmia: Germany will not hang around to take in Sundays World Cup final nor celebrate at home with fans in Berlin, a team spokesman said on Thursday.         
	And adding to the sense of gloom was the news that striker Miroslav Klose could miss the third-place match against Uruguay because of injury. Were that to happen, he would also have given up the chance to overtake Brazils Ronaldo as the top scorer in World Cup history.         
	Assistant coach Hansi Flick says Klose has a back injury and could miss Saturdays game in Port Elizabeth. Klose needs one goal to match Ronaldos record of 15.         
	The Germans plan to fly back home on Sunday evening, press spokesman Harald Stenger told reporters.         
	Although no exact time was given for their departure it is likely the squad will be in the air when the rest of the world is watching the final between Netherlands and Spain.         
	What is certain is there will be no welcome home party at the Brandenburg Gate  unlike the reception the team were given after their semi-final loss to Italy four years ago in Germany.         
	The big objective this time was to go further than third place, said captain Philipp Lahm. We know the euphoria back home, we soaked that up and used it to motivate ourselves, and we thank our supporters for everything but this time it wouldnt fit, it just wouldnt be appropriate.         
	Flick said it was likely a number of players who had been restricted to the bench would play in the third-place game given the short gap after the Spain match.           (REUTERS)

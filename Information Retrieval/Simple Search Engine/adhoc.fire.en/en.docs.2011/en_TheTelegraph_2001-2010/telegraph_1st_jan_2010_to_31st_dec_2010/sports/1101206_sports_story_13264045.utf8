The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar calls   for proper   scheduling
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar calls   for proper   scheduling
                                  
	Pallakelle: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara called for cricket officials to analyse weather patterns thoroughly before hosting Test matches, after the third and final Test against West Indies ended in a tame draw at the Pallakele Stadium on Sunday.         
	The three-Test series, which was dogged by rain, ended in a 0-0 result with the first two Tests at Galle and Colombo also drawn.         
	It will be nice to see if we can make sure the weather patterns and all of these things are properly analysed. But it is tough these days; the weathers all topsy turvy, said Sangakkara. Its probably the worst Test series Ive ever experienced. It was pretty frustrating to sit in the dressing-room and watch the rain.         
	It would have been nice to see if we had alternative venues as well to see if one failed and the weather was not great and the preparations not great, we could have gone somewhere else. But from the reports I hear that it is raining everywhere. I dont know how feasible that would have been. But its always nice to have something as a back-up.         
	Only 103.3 overs were bowled in the entire test and West Indies scored 303 for eight. The bad weather enabled West Indies to draw a Test series in Sri Lanka for the first time.

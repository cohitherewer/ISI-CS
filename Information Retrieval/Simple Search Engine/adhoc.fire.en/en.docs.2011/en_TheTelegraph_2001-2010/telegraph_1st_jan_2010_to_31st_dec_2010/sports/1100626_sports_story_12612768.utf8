The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi set to be recalled
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yuvi set to be recalled
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Yuvraj Singh                      
	Calcutta: Message conveyed, the national selectors are set to recall Yuvraj Singh. Indeed, it will be a big surprise if the left-hander isnt named in the Team India 16 for the three-Test series in Sri Lanka.         
	Yuvraj, it may be recalled, was dropped for the just-ended Asia Cup. Quite sensibly, he kept a low profile and, at a difficult time in his career, was praised sky-high by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and vice-captain Virender Sehwag.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma, whove been out of favour of late, are also almost certain to make the squad.         
	The debate, as of now, is really over two positions  that of the fourth medium-pacer (after Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Ishant) and whether to pick Murali Vijay as the specialist third opener (Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir being automatic choices) or to include all-rounder Dinesh Karthik, one of the sources said on Friday evening.         
	Eventually, the selectors could fall back on the tried and tested Munaf Patel.         
	Another source pointed out that the younger new-ball bowlers hadnt done anything spectacular to actually press for a berth. As for Ashish Nehra and Praveen Kumar, theyre being looked upon as specialists for ODIs and T20 Internationals.         
	Suresh Raina, who was in the 15 for Team Indias last Test (against South Africa, at the Eden, in February), looks good to be retained.         
	Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth and three of his four colleagues  Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat  will meet unusually early, at 8.45 am, on Saturday.         
	Yashpal Sharma wont be present in Chennai as hes in the UK, watching India A perform.         
	The meeting has been called at that hour as the Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Shashank Manohar, and secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan are to leave for the International Cricket Councils annual conference, in Singapore.         
	Moreover, Venkat is to head for England, where hell be on duty with Yashpal.   
	LIKELY 16 for test series in sri lanka  
	Virender Sehwag (vice-capt.), Gautam Gambhir, Dinesh Karthik/Murali Vijay; Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina; Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.); Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma.

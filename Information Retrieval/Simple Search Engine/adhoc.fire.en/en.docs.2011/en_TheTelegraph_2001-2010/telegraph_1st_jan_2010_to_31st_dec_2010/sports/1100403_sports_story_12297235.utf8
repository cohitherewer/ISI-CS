The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tall order for Chargers
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tall order for Chargers
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kieron Pollard during a practice session, in Mumbai, on Friday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians would be looking to carry on their scorching form and take another step towards a semi-final berth when they take on the Deccan Chargers at the Brabourne stadium here on Saturday.         
	With 12 points under their belt, a win against the Chargers would make Mumbai sides place in the knock-out stage more or less a certainty. They will also be gunning for their fifth victory on the trot.         
	From whatever we have seen in the last two years, if you have 14 points, its almost certain that you are in the semi-final, Mumbai Indians director of cricket TA Sekhar said on the eve of the match.         
	But you could be placed fourth. And if you look at the other teams, only two points separate them. So we dont want to leave anything to equations. We would like to make sure of our place with at least two-three more wins.         
	In the first-leg encounter between the two sides, a Harbhajan Singh inspired Mumbai Indians defeated the Chargers by 41 runs.         
	What might be worrying Adam Gilchrist and Co. is that they have less than 48 hours to recover from the defeat to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the Eden on Thursday. But Chargers coach Darren Lehmann disagreed.         
	I think its actually better We dont have time to think about it (the loss to KKR), Lehmann said.         
	Only four half-centuries have come from the Chargers camp so far and only two of their batsmen have aggregates of more than 200.         
	Those are not statistics that would help a team win matches.         
	The Mumbai side, on the other hand have been buoyed by superb displays from captain Sachin Tendulkar and Saurabh Tiwary.         
	On specifics, the Chargers could bring in Chaminda Vaas for Kemar Roach since the sea side venue could help swing bowlers more than the fast and furious ones.         
	Meanwhile, Tiwary, according to Sekar, had a bad tooth but would play on Saturday.

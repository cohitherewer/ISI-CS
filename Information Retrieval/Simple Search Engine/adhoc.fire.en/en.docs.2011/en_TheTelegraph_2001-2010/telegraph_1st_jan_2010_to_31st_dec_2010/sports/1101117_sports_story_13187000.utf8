                                                                                                                       7                                      After Paul, its Bo Si!
                      
	Guangzhou: First there was Paul the octopus, now theres Bo Si, the psychic panda.         
	Bo Si picked a Chinese athlete to be the first gold medal winner of the Asian Games -- and Yuan Xiaochao promptly won the wushu, boosting the popularity of the 12 giant pandas at Xiangjiang Safari Park in Guangzhou.         
	But given China are so dominant and are favourites to finish top of the medals table and have the biggest squad at the Games, critics said it hardly proved Bo Sis telepathic powers.         
	And it emerged Bo Si had been given the option to pick a bamboo shoot, which represented a Chinese winner, or an apple for a foreigner. Pandas exist on a bamboo diet.         
	The pandas have tended to favour Chinese athletes, said the China Daily of the 12 giant predicting pandas. The pandas are expected to help the park attract more tourists during the Asian Games, the paper quoted a park staff member as saying.         
	Paul shot to fame during this years football World Cup in South Africa. He died at an aquarium in Germany last month. (AFP)

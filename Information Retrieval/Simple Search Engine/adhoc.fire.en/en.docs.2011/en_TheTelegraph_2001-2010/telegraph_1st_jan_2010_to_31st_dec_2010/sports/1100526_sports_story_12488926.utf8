	Madrid: Striker Fernando Torres is confident hell be back to full fitness in time for Spains first match at the World Cup against Switzerland on June 16.         
	The Liverpool forward, who had surgery on his right knee last month after tearing the meniscus, said his recovery had gone perfectly and he might play some part in Spains three warm-up friendlies against Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Poland.         
	I am in very good shape and happy with how the injury is developing, the 26-year-old said in an interview with a Spanish sports daily, published on Tuesday.         
	I have had two operations since January and thats not easy, he added.         
	Everything was very good with the first and the aim of the second was to be ready within six or seven weeks and I am at the start of the sixth.         
	I will do some targeted work for a few more days and, God willing, be at 100 percent for the first match.         
	Asked if he felt any pressure to be the leading scorer, Torres said: No, but I know that, along with (David) Villa, Im lucky enough to be one of the strikers in a team that are among the favourites, and that brings certain privileges.         
	Aside from Switzerland, Spain have also been placed alongside Honduras and Chile in Group H. If they get through, then Vicente Del Bosques side could face a tough hurdle in the second round, with one of Brazil, Portugal or Ivory Coast their likely opponents.         
	If La Roja do manage to add the world title to their European crown, it would be a great end to what Torres admits has been a difficult season for him at club level with Liverpool. Aside from his injury problems, the Reds have struggled on the pitch and finished up seventh in the Premier League.

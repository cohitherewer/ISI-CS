The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reds looking to thwart Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Reds looking to thwart Blues
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                  Lampard will have   a crucial role      
	London: One scouse prankster this week posted a spoof Liverpool team to face Chelsea in Sundays pivotal Premier League match on a fans internet chatroom, a motley crew including singer Cilla Black and comedian Ken Dodd.         
	Various other Merseyside celebrities were included on a team sheet that lacked any actual footballers apart from Lucas, a player still to win over the Liverpool fans.         
	Chelseas visit to Anfield on Sunday has certainly enlivened debate on the streets of Liverpool where victory, or even a draw, for Rafael Benitezs side would open the door for bitter rivals Manchester United to snatch the title.         
	There is a school of thought that Liverpool fans would rather lose to Chelsea to prevent United, who are away to Sunderland later on Sunday, moving ahead of Liverpools cherished record of 18 league titles.         
	United, though, received a timely boost on the last lap with the news that Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand could return for the Sunderland match.         
	The pair have both been suffering from groin injuries, Rooney having aggravated the problem in training last week on top of the ankle injury he picked up during the second leg of the Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich.         
	Ferdinand, meanwhile, suffered his at Blackburn earlier this month and has since missed two Premier League games. United travel to Sunderland needing a win to keep their title hopes alive.         
	Ferguson said: We expect Wayne to train today (Friday) and possibly Rio Ferdinand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina runs riot vs Proteas
                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina runs riot vs Proteas
    - Left-hander hits 60-ball 101 as India win by 14 runs to enter Super Eight           A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Two wins in two matches                                 
	Swift and brutal. That is exactly how Suresh Rainas furious assault on the Proteas attack can be described. Coming at No.3 in a group league match of the World Twenty20 on Sunday, Raina became the first Indian and only the third player in the history of Twenty20 to score an international century.         
	Courtesy Rainas mayhem in the late overs, India scored 186 in their 20 overs after being put into bat by Graeme Smith. Raina raced to his century in only 59 deliveries.         
	It was a winning total on a slowish Beausejour Stadium wicket. Although Jacques Kallis (73, 54 balls, 3x4, 3x6) and AB de Villiers (31, 15 balls, 1x4, 3x6) did hit some lusty blows it wasnt enough in the end as they could only manage 172 for five, falling 14 runs short in the process. India thus moved to the Super Eight stage by topping their group.         
	Incidentally, it was the Uttar Pradesh batsmans flurry of big hits that saw India scoring 75 runs off the last five overs, including 25 off Rory Kleinveldts last which was the 18th over of the innings. The last five overs became the turning point for India.         
	No praise is enough for the manner in which Raina accelerated towards the end. His first 50 came off 42 deliveries while the next was off only 17 deliveries.         
	Earlier, the Indian innings started on a disastrous note as Saturdays highest scorer, Murali Vijay was dismissed for a duck by Rory Kleinveldt, off the second ball of the innings. Vijay, who scored 48 against Afghanistan on Saturday, showed little footwork as he pushed at a delivery that was moving away from his body. The resultant edge was gobbled up by Mark Boucher behind the stumps.         
	Dinesh Karthik (16) who replaced an ill Gautam Gambhir (suffering from diarrhoea) hit a nice off-drive to get started but simply couldnt get going. In his bid to up the ante, Karthik gave Jacques Kallis the charge but failed to clear skipper Smith stationed at mid-on.         
	Raina, one of the top run-getters in the Indian Premier Leagues third season, received a life after he was caught at mid-off as Morne Morkels delivery was ruled no-ball. However, when Kallis came in, Raina lifted him over deep mid-wicket boundary for a huge six.         
	He was well supported during an 88-run third wicket partnership by Yuvraj Singh (37, 30 balls, 3x4, 2x6). Yuvraj had shown glimpses of his old form against Afghanistan and looked comfortable against both pace and spin on Sunday.         
	He swept left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe over deep mid-wicket for six. The flicked six off Albie Morkel over backward square leg was a class act. It was followed by a short-arm pull off Kallis. Just when he looked set for a big score, Yuvraj holed out to mid-on off Kleinveldts bowling.         
	Raina, on the other hand, played some lovely shots mainly through the on-side as he reached his half-century. Once there, he launched into an attack on the bowlers.         
	A couple of his sixes off Kleinveldt stand out. The first one was over square leg. All that can be said about the second is that it was a classic. He bent on his knee to hoist the bowler over cover.         
	All Dhonis boys needed to do to defend a total like 186 was to bowl well in the Powerplay overs. By opening with off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and using his slow bowlers effectively, the Indian captain ensured that the opposition batsmen do not get off to a rollicking start. The bowlers responded brilliantly as they restricted the Proteas to 57 for one in the first 10 overs.         
	Even though Kallis and Smith added 97 runs for the second wicket, they never really got going till the 15th over and by that time it was a case of too many runs left to score with very few overs left. Indias best bowler at death, Ashish Nehra, bowled a tight line towards the end to ensure there were no hiccups as the team sealed the win.

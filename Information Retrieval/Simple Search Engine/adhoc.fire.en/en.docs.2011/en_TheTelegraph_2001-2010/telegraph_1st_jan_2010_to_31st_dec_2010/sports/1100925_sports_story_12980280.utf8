  - Australia rsquo;s tour opener against Board President rsquo;s XI begins today
                                  Pujara      
	Chandigarh: The Ricky Ponting-led Australia will be keen to get some vital match practice, while key Indian players, who are returning from injuries, would assess their fitness, when the visitors and the Board Presidents XI clash in a three-day practice match from here Saturday.         
	Captain Gautam Gambhir and pacer Sreesanth, who suffered injuries during the Sri Lankan tour, are making a comeback to competitive cricket.         
	Eyes will be on Cheteshwar Pujara, who replaced Yuvraj Singh in the Test squad.         
	The Saurashtra batsman has been a prolific run-scorer in the domestic circuit and for quite some time the right-hander was in the reckoning for a place in the national team.         
	His dominance with the bat in domestic circuit can be gauged from the fact that he has so far made 14 centuries and 13 half-centuries in his five-year first class career.         
	Sreesanth, who hurt his knee in the lead-up to the first Test in Sri Lanka, would be looking to get back his rhythm while Gambhir, who missed the second and third Tests in Sri Lanka with an injured knee, would also be keen to get some runs under his belt before the first Test.         
	The Australians who have been mostly confined to their hotel rooms and gymnasium, courtesy the inclement weather, will hope to make the most of the time they get out there in the middle.         
	Only Thursday, Ponting and his boys seemed to be getting into the groove with some serious net sessions at the indoor facility of the PCA Stadium.         
	Its been raining here earlier on. But now the sun has come out, finally. Playing against India under any condition and in any form of the game is tough. Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke said.         
	We need to be as well prepared as we possibly can be and thats why we are here so early before the first Test. To get a practice match against a quality opposition and to get that feel of the conditions is very important, he added.         
	We just havent played much Test cricket as a team in India, but we are excited about the possibilities. If we can play our best cricket, I am confident we can beat India in this series, Clark said         
	Doug Bollinger, Marcus North and Tim Paine havent played a Test in India, while specialist spinner Nathan Hauritz played his only Test in the country when he made his debut six years back.         
	If one goes by weather forecasts, there is a chance of heavy downpour Saturday.         
	Ponting admitted here earlier this week that he would like to do well on this tour, not having enjoyed much success during earlier assignments. (PTI)

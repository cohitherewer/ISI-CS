The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijender, Dinesh   win silvers   in China
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vijender, Dinesh   win silvers   in China
                                  
	New Delhi: Indian pugilist Vijender Singh Tuesday broke his bronze jinx and fetched one of Indias two silver medals at the two-day Champion of Champions invitational boxing tournament in Guangzhou, China.         
	The 24-year-old Olympic and World Championship bronze medallist, who was bestowed with the Khel Ratna award last year, lost 0-6 to Chinas Zhang Jin Ting in the in the middle weight (75kg) category final.         
	The other silver medal for India came through Olympian Dinesh Kumar, who settled for silver in 81kg after losing 2-10 to Chinese Meng Fan Long.         
	This was Vijenders second career loss to Zhang. The last time he got something better than a bronze at an international tourney was in the 2007 Asian Championships in Mongolia where he had clinched a silver medal.         
	I am a bit disappointed that I lost to him again. The last time too I lost to him in China but it was a much closer affair and Id lost by just a point then, Vijender, who also got $1,000 in prize money. The gold medallists also pocketed $3,000 in prize money.         
	But I am glad to have broken the bronze jinx. Also, it was good preparation for the Commonwealth Championship in March. It was fun to be back in the ring after a long gap, the Bhiwani boxer, who had not competed since the World Championship in September last year, added.         
	Dinesh, who was nursing a hairline fracture in his left hand before the tournament, also felt that it has warmed them up for the Commonwealth Championship scheduled in New Delhi.         
	It will help. International exposure ahead of a major tournament is always welcome, he said.         
	The short prize money event also featured Commonwealth Games gold medallist Akhil Kumar (57kg) and former world youth champion Thokchom Nanao Singh (48kg), both of them lost in the opening round.         
	Both Akhil and Nanao lost to Asian champions in their respective categories. The organisers had invited only the top four Asian boxers in each category and with just two rounds played, only the finalists were awarded medals.         
	Vijenders Olympic bronze opened a new era for Indian boxing and the countrys pugilists have enjoyed a good run of results at recent championships. Vijender is the No.1 middleweight pugilist in the world in the International Boxing Association (AIBA) rankings and the poster boy of Indian boxing had also won the countrys first bronze in the World Championships in Milan, last year.

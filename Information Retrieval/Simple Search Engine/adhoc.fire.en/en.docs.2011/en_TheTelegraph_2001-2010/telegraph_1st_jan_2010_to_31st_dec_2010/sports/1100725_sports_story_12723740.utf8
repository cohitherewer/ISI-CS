The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aamer is among worlds best: Butt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aamer is among worlds best: Butt
                      
	Leeds: Pakistan ended their 15-year wait for a Test win over Australia on Saturday, a feat captain Salman Butt put down to having possibly the best pace attack in the world.         
	Pakistan, chasing 180 to win the second Test, stuttered to a three-wicket victory on Butts debut as captain to draw the series 1-1. Australia were on the backfoot from the opening day when they were skittled out for just 88.         
	Pace trio Mohammed Asif (11 wickets), Mohammed Aamer (11) and Umar Gul (8) claimed a collective 30 wickets in the two-Test series.         
	I feel very fortunate to have them in my team, said Butt, speaking at a media conference as horns were sounded by jubilant Pakistan fans on an adjacent road. If they are not the worlds best then they are amongst the worlds top two or three.         
	Mohammed Aamer is definitely amongst the worlds best fast bowlers. And Mohammed Asif, with the new ball, is the best fast bowler Ive seen for a long time, probably since Glenn McGrath.         
	They pressurised the Australian batsmen in both Tests and not one Australian managed to reach three figures in a series where the ball moved prodigiously in the air in largely overcast conditions.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting said it was the most challenging conditions his team had ever faced. (Reuters)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Plans in place: Robin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians coach Robin Singh Saturday said that his side were confident for Sundays final against the Chennai Super Kings regardless of whether skipper Sachin Tendulkar was fit to play or not.         
	Robin said they would know about Tendulkars availability only before the match and that the decision had been left to him.         
	We will know about his injury tomorrow (Sunday). It is up to him. I think he is very keen on playing. It is his call, Robin said. We have done very well (in the tournament) and so it is really his call. The fact is its the final, and he is someone who, if he is fit, will give his best shot to play the final.         
	Robin said the team had enough options in case the captain was not fit to play. We have kept that in mind. If he is not ready to play we have alternatives as well as. We are absolutely confident whether Sachin plays or not. We have plans in place, he said.         
	Robin said the nature of the pitch would not be a cause of concern for his team. We are doing well with fast bowlers, so how does it matter whether we plays two spinners or not, he said.

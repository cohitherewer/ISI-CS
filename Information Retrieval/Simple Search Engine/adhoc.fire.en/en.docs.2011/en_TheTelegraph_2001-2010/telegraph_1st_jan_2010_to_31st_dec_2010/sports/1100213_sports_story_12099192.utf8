The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cricket gets approval from IOC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cricket gets approval from IOC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket was cleared to pursue its bid to be included in future Games after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) rubberstamped the sports recognition in Vancouver on Thursday.         
	Cricket, along with power boating and sports climbing became the latest sports to be officially recognised by the IOC, a status necessary before launching a bid to become part of the Olympic programme.         
	The session gave definite recognition to the three federations, IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters.         
	The three sports can now bid to join the 2020 Olympics as the programme is always determined seven years in advance.         
	Haroon Lorgat, the International Cricket Council (ICC)s chief executive, welcomed the development.         
	The ICC is extremely proud of the recognition given to our great sport by the IOC which we always considered to be our first step in becoming a part of the Olympic family.         
	At this stage no consideration or decision has been made regarding participation or applying for approval to participate in the Olympic Games.         
	The decision about new sports for the 2020 Games will be taken at the IOC session in Buenos Aires in 2013 where the host country will also be picked.

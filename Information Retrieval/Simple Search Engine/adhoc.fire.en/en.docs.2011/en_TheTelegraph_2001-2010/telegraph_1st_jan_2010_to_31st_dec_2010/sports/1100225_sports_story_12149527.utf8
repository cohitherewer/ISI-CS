The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ill be happy if an Indian breaks my record, says Tendulkar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ill be happy if an Indian breaks my record, says Tendulkar
    - Ive always received the support and affection of every Indian           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Gwalior: Sachin Tendulkar did look fatigued, but was game for questions posed to him during a Q amp;A session.         
	The following are excerpts from the media conference and The Telegraphs very brief chat with him:         
	What remains to be achieved...         
	(Smiles) I dont play for records... I play for enjoyment, play for fun... I play with passion... Records have happened along the way...         
	The 200 not out here         
	I dont compare one innings with the other... Every innings where Ive scored and the team has won has been special... Of course, it feels great.         
	Record dedicated to...         
	Every Indian... There have been ups and downs over the past 20 years, but Ive always received the support and affection of every Indian.         
	Having been aggressive         
	The ball was coming on nicely and I was happy with the bat swing... I was moving well, too... It was one of those days.         
	When he actually began thinking of the 200         
	Around the time I was 175-180 and quite a few overs remained... I knew Id get runs if the ball was in my area.         
	Thoughts when on 199         
	It was a matter of getting one ball... But that wasnt the only thing on my mind... By then, wed reached a terrific total... I was under no stress.         
	Getting his record against South Africa and not versus Pakistan         
	You cant pick and choose the day youll get a record... You cant pick and choose the opposition... It will happen the day its destined to happen...         
	On records         
	Records are meant to be broken... Ill be happy if an Indian breaks my record.         
	Having been very particular during the match-eve nets         
	Im human... If I need to work on some areas, I will... I didnt do anything special for this match.         
	Known to wake up at 2 am (in hot and humid centres) for a glass of water         
	Ive done it, in Chennai...         
	On enjoying his cricket         
	Credit must also go to Gary (Kirsten, the coach)... He has held the team together beautifully and himself works as hard at nets.         
	Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans announcement that a road would be named after him in Gwalior         
	I respect such emotions and such good wishes... The good wishes help when we take the field... Theyre of real help in difficult times.         
	[The pavilion at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium will also be named after Sachin.]         
	Thoughts at the break         
	We didnt think that the job was done... We knew wed come only half way and this team had chased 435 some years ago (against Australia, in Johannesburg)... We didnt relax and looked for early wickets... It was an important match, for we wanted to win the series. We did.         
	Next years World Cup         
	Oh, its too far away... Twelve months remain and thats a long time... But, yes, we need to identify the players...         
	Finally, on whether hes now targeting Brian Laras Test record of 400 not out         
	(Laughs) No... No... Not (right) now.

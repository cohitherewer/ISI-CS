The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No crisis in team, says Lippi
                                                                                                                       7                                      No crisis in team, says Lippi
                      
	Irene: Italy coach Marcello Lippi is hoping that inventive midfielder Andrea Pirlo gives the much needed creativity to the defending champions against Slovakia in Johannesburg.         
	Pirlo managed full training sessions from Monday onwards raising the prospect that he could play the Thursdays pivotal final Group F game.         
	Pirlo missed the opening 1-1 draw with Paraguay and Sundays shock 1-1 draw with New Zealand in Nelspruit with a calf injury, leaving Italy without any real creativity in the midfield.         
	Italy must beat Slovakia in Johannesburgs Ellis Park to guarantee a place in the last 16, although a draw will be enough if group leaders Paraguay defeat New Zealand.         
	Lippi hoped Pirlo could be fit for Thursday but sounded cautious. Monday is the first time he has touched the ball in 15 days. Almost recovered? Lets see, we have to make some checks. Lets hope so but... Lippi told a news conference on Monday, back at Italys base near Pretoria.         
	Pirlo would give Lippis static midfield a bit more precision passing but he lacks pace and is not the answer to all of the Azzurris ills.         
	Lippi acknowledged his side had not passed the ball as well as he would have liked against a dogged New Zealand defence but reckoned bottom-placed Slovakia would play a more open game.         
	I dont believe these problems will present themselves because Slovakia have just one result to chase, he said, adding that doom and gloom was not the right approach so early in the tournament.         
	You count the horses at the line. Theres no crisis here, theres no crisis in the team. We dont need to talk about a crisis.         
	Italy can comfort themselves with the memory that they also drew their opening two matches in 1982, when they went on to win their third title. In fact, the Azzurri drew all three of their opening games in82.         
	Meanwhile, Slovakia coach Vladimir Weiss says he is sorry for an expletive-laced outburst aimed at his countrys media after his tactics were questioned in the 2-0 loss to Paraguay.         
	Speaking Wednesday at the pre-match news conference ahead of Slovakias final World Cup group game against Italy, Weiss said he was really sorry about what happened between us, and about our relationship at the moment, but I cannot apologise because I do football for people that like the game. Some of you do this job just to bring unhappiness.

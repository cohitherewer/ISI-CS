  - NP Pradeep scores for India in 1-2 loss to Thailand       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            N.P. Pradeep celebrates with teammates after scoring against Thailand, in New Delhi, on Wednesday                                 
	New Delhi: It was a night of disappointment for the five thousand odd fans who sat through the rain at the Ambedkar Stadium to cheer the home team as Thailand defeated India 2-1 in the second friendly encounter on Wednesday. In the first match played at Bangkok last Saturday, India were tamed by a solitary goal by Bryan Robsons boys.         
	Back on the home turf, India were expected to fight better but in the end, they were lucky enough only to avoid embarrassment.         
	After a goalless first half, Thailand took the lead through Teerathep Winothai, in the 48th minute while N.P. Pradeep equalised in the 60th minute. The euphoria in the Indian camp didnt last long as Keerati Keawsonbat struck the winner four minutes later.         
	It was tough for the Indian defence in the first half. Led by central midfielder and Man of the Match Wichaya Dechmitr, who mesmerised the Indians with his superb distribution and stunning set piece moves, the Thais camped themselves in the Indian area. On at least four occasions, goalkeeper Subroto Paul was completely beaten but was relieved to see the ball hitting the crosspiece.         
	 Indian striking duo of Sunil Chetri and Mohammed Rafi failed to make an impact on the vigilant Thai defence, things were better at the rear end. Stopper Gourmangi Singh had a good game and he was well assisted by Surkumar Singh and Anwar.         
	The only time the Indian forwardline looked lively was when Bob Houghton decided to bring in Bhaichung Bhutia 20 minutes before the end. Bhutia played a series of good passes with his teammates and even fired a shot at the rival goal that had the crowd cheering for the seasoned striker. While Rafi missed an easy chance in the first session, Chetri, who didnt do any justice to his reputation for most part of the encounter, had a snap shot at the goal that was stopped by a diving Thai goalkeeper.         
	 The forward pass from Anthony Pereira had Chetri nicely placed in front of the goalmouth but the US returned players feeble header was palmed away by the goalkeeper. The rebound was slotted in by Pradeep, who otherwise had a forgettable day in the middle.

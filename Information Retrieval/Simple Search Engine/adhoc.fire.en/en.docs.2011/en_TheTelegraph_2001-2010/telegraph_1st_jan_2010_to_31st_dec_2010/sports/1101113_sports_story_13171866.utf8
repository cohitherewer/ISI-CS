                                                                                                                       7                                      Dalmiya withdraws   civil suit 
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya Friday withdrew a civil suit filed by him against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	In view of revocation of expulsion by BCCI in its last AGM, the suit, which challenged the expulsion, became infructuous and hence was withdrawn, Dalmiyas lawyer Ushanath Banerjee said.         
	The suit, which was pending before Justice Sanjib Banerjee, was Friday mentioned before his court by Dalmiyas counsels who sought its withdrawal.         
	Justice Banerjee granted the prayer. Having apparently patched up with Sharad Pawar and his group, after they fell out with his one-time foe Lalit Modi, Dalmiya withdrew the suit.         
	The process of reconciliation between Dalmiya and BCCI started at its AGM when it decided to revoke Dalmiyas suspension and also withdrew a civil suit that the board had filed against him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blatter is sorry for ref errors
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blatter is sorry for ref errors
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	Sepp Blatter was forced to apologise to England and the Football Association Tuesday over Frank Lampards disallowed goal against Germany. And in a remarkable U-turn, the Fifa president indicated he is ready to discuss introducing goal-line technology in wake of mistakes at this summers World Cup.         
	England were trailing 1-2 to Germany in Sundays World Cup second-round encounter in Bloemfontein, when Lampards effort struck the cross bar and clearly crossed the goal line.         
	The goal was ruled out by Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda and his assistant Mauricio Espinosa, leading to renewed calls for the introduction of video replays.         
	Fifa, who blocked any further experiments with technology at a meeting of the International FA Board in March, faced a barrage of questions on the subject at a media briefing in Johannesburg Monday, but refused to respond.         
	But Blatter told a media briefing in Johannesburg Tuesday: It is obvious that after the experience so far in this World Cup it would be nonsense to not reopen the file of technology at the business meeting of the International FA Board in July.         
	Personally I deplore it when you see evident referee mistakes but its not the end of a competition or the end of football, this can happen.         
	The only thing I can do is, Monday I have spoken to the two federations (England and Mexico) directly concerned by referees mistakes. I have expressed to them apologies and I understand they are not happy and that people are criticising.         
	We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have first opportunity in July at the business meeting.         
	Sunday nights match between Argentina and Mexico had also thrown up a controversial incident, with Carlos Tevez scoring the opening goal from a blatantly offside position.         
	Fifa had blocked any further experiments with technology at a meeting of the International FA Board, the games rule-making body, in March.         
	The technology is already in place, with HawkEye Innovations, behind the use of technology at Wimbledon, insistent it would work.         
	Meanwhile, the referees (of the two matches) at the centre of controversy have not been retained for the remainder of the tournament, Fifa said in a statement on Tuesday.

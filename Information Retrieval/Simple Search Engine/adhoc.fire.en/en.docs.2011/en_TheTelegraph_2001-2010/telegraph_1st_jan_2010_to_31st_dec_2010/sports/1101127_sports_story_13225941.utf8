The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cancer scare for Andy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cancer scare for Andy
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                Flower      
	Brisbane: England coach Andy Flower missed Fridays play at the Gabba to have a cancerous lesion removed from under his eye.         
	Flower spent the day in hospital in Brisbane having an operation to remove a melanoma, a version of skin cancer.         
	He is expected to spend Saturday recuperating at the team hotel with fielding coach Richard Halsall placed in temporary charge.         
	Flower is expected to return on Sunday, which might turn out to be the deciding day of this Test.         
	Flower, a Zimbabwean, is believed to have travelled to the hospital to have a suspicious growth analysed but it was removed and confirmed as a melanoma.         
	Early removal of a lesion is normally almost 100 per cent successful in the treatment of the disease. Preventing skin cancer is widely promoted in Australia, and Flower could not be in a better country to have the problem treated promptly.         
	In his absence Englands bowlers had a mixed day, with Steve Finn and James Anderson taking two wickets, but Mike Husseys unbeaten 81 has left the match in the balance.         
	An ECB spokesman confirmed the procedure. He said: He was not at the game today (Friday), because he had a melanoma taken out  which was successful.         
	At this stage, he is expected to be fine.         
	He went off for a routine check, and they said they felt it prudent to take it out.         
	He may well be back on deck tomorrow (Saturday), or most definitely the following day. It is business as usual.         
	Flower found evidence that in his absence his team had proved themselves worthy Ashes contenders.         
	Flower is not the sort to accept such assurances without seeing it for himself, but when he got back to the England team hotel, it was to discover an England bowling attack that had joined battle in what, irrespective of the outcome of the first Test at the Gabba, smacked of being a closely fought Ashes series.         
	Mike Hussey belted 81 not out on Friday to drag Australia within 40 runs of Englands first innings tally before play was called off early on Day II of the first Ashes Test with the match finely poised.

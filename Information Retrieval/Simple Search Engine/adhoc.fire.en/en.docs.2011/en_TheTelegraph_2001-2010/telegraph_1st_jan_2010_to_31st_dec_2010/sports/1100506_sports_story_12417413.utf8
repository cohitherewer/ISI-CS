	Berlin: Bayern Munich keeper Hans-Joerg Butt has been included in Germanys preliminary World Cup squad, a day after Rene Adler pulled out with an injury, a German newspaper said on Wednesday, citing federation sources.         
	The German soccer federation could not be immediately reached for a comment. The 35-year-old will be the third choice behind Manuel Neuer and Tim Wiese, who are locked in battle for the starting spot.         
	Meanwhile, Ruud van Nistelrooy has been left out of the Netherlands 26-man training squad, dimming his hopes of playing in the World Cup.         
	The Hamburg striker has been hoping to return to international play for the tournament in South Africa, but coach Bert van Marwijk chose to leave him out of the group that will begin a training camp next Monday.

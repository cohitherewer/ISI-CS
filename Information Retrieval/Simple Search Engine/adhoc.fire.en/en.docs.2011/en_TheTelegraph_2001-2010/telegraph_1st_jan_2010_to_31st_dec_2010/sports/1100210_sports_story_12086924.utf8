The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim likely to join Salgaocar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Karim likely to join Salgaocar
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: If everything goes right, discarded Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencherifa may join Goas Salgaocar Club in the next few weeks.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph Tuesday, Karim, who guided Bagan to title triumphs in the Federation Cup and the Super Cup last season before being relieved of his position early this month, said: Yes, negotiations are on with Salgaocar though nothing has been finalised yet.         
	Karim said that apart from Salgaocar, he was also in touch with a couple of foreign clubs and a local club. I am yet to make up my mind where I should be joining. I will only announce it once the deal is sealed.         
	I have spent four years in India and would like to remain attached with the country for some more time, said the Moroccan coach.         
	When I look back, I feel happy to have contributed to Indian football in my small way.         
	There were at least half-a-dozen boys in the SAFF Cup squad who were my favourite students at both Churchill (Brothers) and Bagan, he said.         
	Karim, however, made it clear that the negotiations with Salgaocar began only after Bagan showed him the door.         
	Lets make it very clear that I didnt talk to Salgaocar officials till the time I was removed by Bagan.         
	The day after Satyajit Chatterjee was appointed in my place I started talking to several clubs, including Salgaocar, said Karim.         
	When contacted, Salgaocar secretary R.A.J. Gomes confirmed that the Goan outfit, fighting to stave off relegation in the I-League, were currently in talks with the former Bagan coach.         
	Although Karim is still in Calcutta, we are constantly in touch with him, he said.         
	It will be too early to say the deal has been finalised. There are many things which have to be sorted out before both parties can sign on the dotted line, he said.         
	Last week, Salgaocar removed American coach Tim Hankinson after the team failed to perform as per expectations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We have to blame ourselves: Stanley
                                                                                                                       7                                      We have to blame ourselves: Stanley
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Defensive errors once again let down Mohun Bagan and like previous years, the green and maroon brigade got off to a poor start in the I-League this season. After their draw against Pune FC, where lapses in defence blew their lead, the city giants lost 2-1 to new entrants HAL on Wednesday.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Stanley Rozarios worst apprehensions came true when his defenders were once again caught ball watching in defeat. It was a disappointing performance. We have to blame ourselves. But it happens in football. I have said that teams like HAL, ONGC are unpredictable. They can collapse and can trigger a collapse for the big clubs any day. But today HAL played better, Rozario said after losing three points at home.         
	The first goal was a blunder, I can say. It shouldnt have happened was all Stanley could mutter when asked to comment on Sangram Mukherjees lazy kick at the ball in the 22 nd minute.         
	The Bagan coach felt Edeh Chidis absence and said there wasnt much he could do with limited sources at his disposal. Chidis absence is a worry for me. I hope he should be well before the Churchill match, he said.

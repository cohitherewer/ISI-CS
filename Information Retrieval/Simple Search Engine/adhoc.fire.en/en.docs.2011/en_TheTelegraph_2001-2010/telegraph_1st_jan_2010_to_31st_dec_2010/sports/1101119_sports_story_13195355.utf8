	Guangzhou: Indias star shuttler Saina Nehwal crashed out of the singles quarter final, after losing 8-21, 21-8, 19-21 to Hong Kongs Yip Pui Yin, on Thursday. Aravind Bhat and mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju too bowed out of the badminton competition of the Asian Games.

	After missing the team event due to an ear infection, Indias best tennis medal hope Sania Mirza breezed into the singles second round with a straight-set demolition of Hong Kongs Chan Wing Yau Venise at the Asian Games.

	In the golf event, a spectacular second round of four under 68 by Rashid Khan brought India firmly into the medal contention in both mens individual and team competition. The 19-year-olds superb display that also equalled the best round for the day helped India make a big leap in the team event.         
	In taekwondo, Latika Bhandari and Y Shantibala Devi entered the quarters of womens 53kg and 57kg, respectively, while P Anand and Sandeep Kundu made it to the last eight in mens 80kg and 87kg.

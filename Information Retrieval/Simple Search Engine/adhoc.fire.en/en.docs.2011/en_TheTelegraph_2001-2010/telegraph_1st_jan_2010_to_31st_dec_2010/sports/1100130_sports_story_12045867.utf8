	Calcutta: Waking up a day after Arindam Das, Bengals highest scorer in Ranji Trophy, was surprisingly excluded from the probables list for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, East Bengal authorities decided to protest against the decision of the senior selection committee of the CAB.         
	The CAB brass are in a spot of bother as a senior East Bengal office-bearer called up joint secretary Arun Mitra demanding a clarification about the reason behind the selection committees decision to drop the player who scored 519 runs (two centuries and 57.66 average) for Bengal in the Ranji.         
	East Bengals cricket secretary called me up and has sought an appointment with president Jagmohan Dalmiya in this regard. They want a clarification on the part of the CAB, Arun Mitra said Friday.

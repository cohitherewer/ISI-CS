The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | OP carries Indias hopes
                                                                                                                       7                                      OP carries Indias hopes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Om Prakash Singh    
	New Delhi: Fifty-two years ago, when flying Sikh Milkha Singh won a nail-biting 440 metres race in Cardiff, it was the only time the Indian national anthem was played in an athletics event at the Commonwealth Games (CWG).         
	Though Indian performance in athletics has always remained below par in CWG, there is a strong possibility that shot putter Om Prakash Singh may finally break the jinx in the Delhi Games.         
	Already an Asian champion at the age of 23, Om Prakash, or OP as his friends call him, is a hot contender for the title in a four-way battle.         
	While the Indian coaches feel it could be Indias hour of glory in the track and field event, OP himself does not rule out facing competition from Canadian Dylan Armstrong, Jamaican Dorian Scott and Aussie Scott Martin.         
	All three foreigners have done better than me this season, but I have prepared myself well for this particular meet. More than the Asian Games, I want to win gold in the CWG because the field is more competitive here, Om Prakash said, who has 19.99 metres as his seasons best. OPs career best is 20.02 that came in the inter-state meet in Chennai.         
	Armstrongs best in the season is 21.58 m, followed by Scots 20.55 and Martins 20.10. Om Prakash feels that all three have already achieved their best this season and may not be able to recreate their performance in the CWG.         
	The fact remains that October is not the right month for staging international athletics meet as by then the athletes normally wind up the season rather than trying to attain the pick.         
	Moreover, I have been doing well in training and returning a distance of 20.60 to 20.70, Om Prakash claimed. If I continue this way, the gold medal could be mine.         
	Om Prakash is only the third Indian shot putter to breach the 20m mark, the others being national record holder Shakti Singh (20.60) and Bahadur Singh (20.40).         
	OP had recently been to the US to train under John Godina, a former three-time World championships gold medallist.         
	I went to World Throw Centre in Sacramento State to train under Godina. It was of immense help. I did a lot of power training that would help me in future, he said.         
	A few days ago, in a function in the capital, Milkha Singh had said he was sad that Indian flag wouldnt fly at the Nehru Stadium during the athletics events.         
	As of now, only OP has the ability to prove the legend of Indian athletics wrong.

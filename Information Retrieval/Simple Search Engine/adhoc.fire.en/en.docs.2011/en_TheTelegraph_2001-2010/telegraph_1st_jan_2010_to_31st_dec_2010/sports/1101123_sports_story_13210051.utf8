The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin doesnt need advice, says Sunny
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin doesnt need advice, says Sunny
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Sachin Tendulkar walks back to the pavilion, on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Nagpur: Sunil Gavaskar, who needs no introduction, spoke to The Telegraph on Monday  exclusively on Sachin Tendulkar, who was unable to post his 50th Test hundred, in neighbouring Jamtha.               
	The following are excerpts:                 
	Whether Sachin has become very conscious about being one short         
	Perhaps, yes, because everybody is talking about the impending hundred... Surely, having played so much, Sachin wont be nervous... Hes been in this situation before  when he was one short of equalling my record (34 hundreds) and when he needed one to get past me... So, its a situation he has dealt with in the past.         
	His own thoughts when he was one short of Sir Don Bradmans record of 29 Test hundreds         
	I didnt want to be conscious about it, but the whole country was talking nevertheless (in 1983-84) and there was nothing that I could do... The hype was just too much.         
	Equalling Sir Dons record, at the Kotla, against the West Indies         
	Id been upset by a remark, that I should retire, from somebody on the eve of that Test... As for my innings of 121, I tried to stay focused and never looked too far ahead...         
	Whether he would track his innings on the scoreboard         
	(Grins) No... The way I approached batting was that the minimum value each batsman ought to put on every innings was a hundred... I believed in doing my job and, well, there was no need then to look at the scoreboard.         
	If he believes in destiny         
	Yes, in the sense that something will happen when its time has come... Sachin, therefore, will get his 50th Test hundred when its destined.         
	Milestones...         
	I wasnt focused on milestones.         
	Finally, if he has any advice for Sachin         
	No... He doesnt need advice.         
	Footnote: During New Zealands second innings, Sachin appeared to be wearing a black belt, suggesting the back needed support. Later, The Telegraph learnt that hed, in fact, folded his trouser around the waist and the black bit was actually the lining! For a while, even coach Gary Kirsten had been alarmed.

	Cuttack: Defending champions East Bengal fought back from an early setback to beat Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) 2-1 in a Group-A quarter final league match of the Federation Cup at the floodlit Barabati Stadium, here on Thursday.         
	Down by a seventh-minute goal, the Calcutta giants struck twice quickly to post their second successive victory and inched closer to the last-four stage.         
	The five-time champions play their last league match against Pune FC on Saturday and a draw will be for them to advance to the knockout round.         
	HAL stunned their fancied opponents by taking the lead through Jagaba Hamza Amaba. The Nigerian recruit sprinted into the box to head home the goal off a cross from the left flank. But the red and gold brigade fought back in style, striking twice in the space of 20 minutes.         
	Penn Orji scored the equaliser, booting home a long pass in the 14th minute. His right-footer was powerful enough to slip past HAL goalkeeper Pramod. Aussie striker Tolgay Ozebe put East Bengal in the lead seven minutes later, deftly sending a rebound into the net.         
	Going into the breather with a 2-1 lead, East Bengal played safe in the second half. Only once did they come close to scoring, but Robin Singhs shot was saved by Pramod on the second attempt.         
	The second half witnessed some rough play, which forced referee Mohammad Kamil red card HAL defender R Srikanth in the 66th minute and show yellow cards to RC Prakash and J Murali. But despite being reduced to 10 players, the Bangalore outfit did not allow East Bengal increase their lead further.         
	TEAMS         
	East Bengal: Sandip Nandy, Naoba Singh, Nirmal Chetri, Uga Okpara, Saumik Dey, R Vashum (Sanju Pradhan 90+1), Mehtab Hossain, Harmanjot Singh Khabra, Penn Orji, Robin Singh (Budhiram Tudu 75), Tolgay Ozebe (Ekene Ikenwa 75).

	Earlier, Pune Football Club returned to winning ways by outplaying Air India 2-0.Attacking from the word go, the Pune side took an early lead when striker Reisang Pemmis left-footer off a cross from the right hit the upright and deflected into the opposition net, leaving goalkeeper Arup Debnath spread-eagled, in the third minute.         
	Left-winger Paresh Shivalkar consolidated the lead, scoring the second goal in the 16th minute.         
	He chested down an Izumi Arata cross from the left and bulged the net with a powerful 20-yarder.         
	Pune FC could have gone 3-0 up by the lemon break but Brazilian Edmar Figueira failed to connect a rebound after his shot was punched away by Debnath. After the change of ends, Pune FC continued to assert their supremacy by bombarding the airmens citadel. But the Air India defence refused to wilt.

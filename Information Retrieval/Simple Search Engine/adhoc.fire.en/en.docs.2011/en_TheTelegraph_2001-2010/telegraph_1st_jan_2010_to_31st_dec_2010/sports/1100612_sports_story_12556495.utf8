The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A pleasant surprise, says Sourav Ganguly
                                                                                                                       7                                        A pleasant surprise, says Sourav Ganguly
    - Former India captain begins preparations to lead MCC XI against Pakistan           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Sourav Ganguly                            
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was up early and running on Friday. All thanks to being named captain of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) XI for the T20 match against Pakistan, at Lords, on June 27.         
	The news came as a pleasant surprise... I got the call from John Stephenson (MCCs head of cricket) on Thursday and decided to straightaway start preparing, Sourav told The Telegraph, before getting down to business in his rather basic office at Souravs, off Park Street.         
	It will be the first T20 staged by the MCC at Lords, inarguably the home of cricket, and is part of the agreement inked between the Pakistan Cricket Board and the MCC, which is sponsoring the Pakistan-Australia fixtures (two T20 Internationals, two Tests) in England.         
	Pakistan have a handy pace attack and, so, I need to be fit! I havent trained after the IPL, which ended in April, and there arent many days left, Sourav added, grinning.         
	Shoaib Akhtar, Souravs one-time mate in the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) has made a comeback, and is one of those expected to go flat out in crickets shortest version.         
	Yeah, Shoaibs there for the Asia Cup, but let him survive (the upcoming tournament in Sri Lanka) first, Sourav quipped.         
	Sourav, in fact, had hand-picked Shoaib to spearhead the KKR attack, in 2008, but the script didnt unfold the way he wanted. So much so that KKRs management released Shoaib even before the controversy over players from Pakistan gained momentum.         
	Indias most successful Test captain, Sourav got back the KKR captaincy in IPL III. So, hed been in the thick of things (and among runs  493 to be precise) pretty recently.         
	Asked how hell be approaching the job of captaining the MCC, Sourav replied: Wont complicate things... Ill just do whats expected of me... You must, however, remember that T20 is a tough form of cricket... Today, with most of the players back in the team, Pakistan have to be rated good... Id say formidable...         
	Sourav is excited that Brian Lara (a fellow-southpaw whom he admires a great deal) will be playing under him. Im definitely looking forward to catching up with Brian... The great man himself... I wonder if hes put on weight...         
	The MCC XI hasnt yet been finalised, though Chaminda Vaas, Chris Harris and Ian Harvey have confirmed participation. As also the Middlesex keeper, John Simpson, Victorias T20 specialist Aiden Blizzard and an MCC colts player, Glenn Querl.         
	Well have all the names within a week, informed Stephenson, who is hoping for an excellent response.         
	Lords is, of course, dear to Sourav, who got a brilliant hundred there on Test debut, 14 summers ago.         
	Indeed, yes... Lords is and will remain very special, Sourav, who turns 38 next month, signed off, as yet another call came on one of his two cellphones.         
	Nineteen months after retiring from international cricket, Sourav remains in demand  on and off the field.         
	The June 27 appearance, incidentally, will be Souravs third for the MCC. The earlier ones were in the Diana Memorial game (versus Rest of World), in 1998, and the Tsunami Relief match, against an International XI, five years ago.         
	Both were 50-over fixtures and Sourav scored 14 on each occasion.         
	The MCC XI lost to Rest of World, but beat the International XI. The captaincy had been in the hands of Mike Atherton and Stephen Fleming, respectively.         
	However, unlike in 1998 and in 2005, theres no charity connection this time.

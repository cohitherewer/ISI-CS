The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran advises Afridi not to retire
                                                                                                                       7                                        Imran advises Afridi not to retire
                  Imran Khan                     
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has advised Shahid Afridi not to retire from Test cricket and continue to lead the side in England.         
	Imran, who is in London, spoke to Afridi over phone and asked him to reconsider his decision to retire from the five-day format.         
	Imran told Afridi that he should convince the board to recall Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan to the side immediately for the Test matches and drop Danish Kaneria, a report in a daily said Sunday.         
	But Afridi, the report added, politely declined Imrans advice. Afridi told Imran that he was not fit enough to play Test cricket.         
	A report in another daily says that Afridi had informed the PCB chairman in advance that if he didnt feel comfortable playing Test matches, he would not carry on.         
	When Ijaz Butt offered him captaincy, Afridi told him that if, at any stage, he felt he was not good enough for Test matches, then the Board should appoint someone else in his place. So, Afridis decision was not unexpected, the report said.         
	Apparently, Butt was not surprised when he was told by Yawar Saeed and Waqar Younis about Afridis retirement.         
	But it is true that the manager and coach were not aware nor taken into confidence by Afridi before he announced his decision at the end of the Lords Test, the report stated.         
	The flamboyant all-rounder faced a lot of criticism over his sudden decision to retire immediately after the first Test defeat against Australia with many former players insisting Pakistan cricket has been turned into a joke by the current set of officials and players.         
	PCB chairman Butt, meanwhile, has not ruled out the possibility of former captains Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan returning to the national team for the Test series against England next month.         
	Butt said both would first have to inform whether they were available for national duty before the board and the selectors decided upon their next line of action.         
	He also confirmed that he had spoken to Yousuf on the phone but declined to divulge any details.         
	The issue of both these players (being called-up) was discussed at our meeting in London yesterday (Saturday), Butt said. It was felt that since there is little time left before the start of the second Test against Australia at Leeds, it would be difficult to judge their fitness and form.         
	Since we have tour games before the Test series against England, they can be considered.         
	But, obviously, first the selectors and the team management must feel satisfied that they are fit and ready to return to top-class cricket, Butt added.

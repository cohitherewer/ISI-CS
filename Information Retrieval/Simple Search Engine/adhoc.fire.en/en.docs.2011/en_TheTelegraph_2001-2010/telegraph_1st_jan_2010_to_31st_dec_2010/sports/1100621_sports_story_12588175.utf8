	Basseterre: The West Indies was 126/2 at lunch on the third day of the second Test against South Africa after losing Chris Gayle in a stop-start first session at Warner Park Sunday.         
	Resuming on 42 with his team on 86/1, Gayle added eight runs before he played a leaden-footed drive to a delivery from Morne Morkel and dragged the ball back onto his stumps.         
	Fellow left-hander Narsingh Deonarine was unbeaten on 50 at lunch, with Shivnarine Chanderpaul (9) having joined him at the crease. On Saturday, Kallis became the sixth man to score over 11000 runs in Tests.

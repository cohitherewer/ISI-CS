The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tim: Weve been very competitive

	Margao: After a Test whitewash, Australia are faced with a do-or-die game to square the one-day International series against India on Sunday. While the present performance doesnt bode well for them before the upcoming Ashes, Tim Nielsen believes the series has been a huge learning curve for the visitors.         
	Speaking at a media conference here on Friday, the Aussie coach said his team has been competitive despite missing key players like Ricky Ponting and Mitchell Johnson. He also confirmed Callum Ferguson will replace Michael Hussey for the final ODI as the latter has returned home to play in the Sheffield Shield.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His views on the series         
	Its been good, especially for our bowlers. We had both (Mitchell) Starc and (John) Hastings making debuts in the Vizag game and (Clint) McKay has played only once (at Vizag) after a gap of 10 ODIs. Its been an excellent experience for our young bowling group. It was nice to see our senior players (captain Michael) Clarke, (Mike) Hussey and (Cameron) White giving us a competitive total (in the ODI). We think we can defend 290 more often than not. It was needed a wonderful innings from (Virat) Kohli to get India across the line. Its harsh. We played just one game (ODI). We made 290 and we just got beaten. We lost the first Test match at Mohali when one ball could have made the difference.         
	If the results of this tour will affect their World Cup preparations         
	We are not panicking at all. We understand we havent got the result what we would have liked to, but we have been very competitive. If you add the loss of (Ricky) Ponting, (Mitchell) Johnson, (Shane) Watson, (Mike) Hussey, (Shaun) Tait, (Brett) Lee to this one-day side, we have performed really well.         
	On Nathan Hauritz form         
	Nathans performance is better in Test cricket than what he has done here, in India. We have talked quite a bit since the end of the second Test match. Hes started getting used to the conditions. Probably because of the slowness of the wickets here and lack of bounce he could not get the assistance he gets in Australia. The Indian spinners put a lot of top spin on the ball to try and get the ball to bounce. In Australia, the wickets are harder and we probably concentrate more on side spin. Its a big difference when you play in these conditions, something Nathan has to do to get adjusted to the playing conditions here.         
	His views on the teams fast bowling attack         
	If anything we are lacking, it is the experience in fast bowling group. When we won the Champions Trophy in South Africa last year we had (Peter) Siddle, Lee and Johnson as our first three bowlers. That makes it a lot easier when bowlers like four and five come into the attack. We have Starc, Hastings and Mckay who have played very little international cricket. It puts pressure on our middle bowlers. Probably, it was a little bit evident the other night when we did not take early wickets. But, I still think Hauritz is a very good one-day bowler and has done very well for us in the last couple of years.         
	On the wicket for the final ODI         
	I had a quick look. Looks like it has rained quite heavily in the last couple of days and Im not sure if it has seen sunshine. I dont think it will be a hard, fast, bouncy wicket. Still (there are) two days to go. Tomorrow, if the sun comes out they can roll a bit more. Though the wicket may be a bit slow, this could be a good batting wicket.

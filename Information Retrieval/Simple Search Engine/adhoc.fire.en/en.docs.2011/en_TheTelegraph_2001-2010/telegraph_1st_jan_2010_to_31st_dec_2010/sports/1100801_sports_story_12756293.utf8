	New Delhi: After four postponements, Hockey India (HI) has finally decided to hold its much-awaited elections in the capital on August 5, said HI secretary general Narendra Batra.         
	The International Hockey Federation (FIH) has agreed to send its observer Antonio von Ondarza for the elections to be held at Delhi on Thursday, 5th August 2010, Batra said, in a statement on Saturday.         
	The elections were supposed to be held on July 28 but were postponed at the last moment after stay orders from Bombay and Delhi High Courts.         
	The HI, however, moved Supreme Court to vacate the stay.

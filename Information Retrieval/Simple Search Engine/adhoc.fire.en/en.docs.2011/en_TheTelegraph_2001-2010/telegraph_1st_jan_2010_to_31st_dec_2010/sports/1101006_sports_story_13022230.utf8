	Melbourne: With a packed international schedule awaiting them in the next few months, Australian captain Ricky Ponting, pacer Mitchell Johnson and all-rounder Shane Watson were rested on Tuesday from the 14-member squad for the ODI series against India, starting October 17.         
	Player workload management is particularly important over the course of the next seven months as we prepare a squad to defend the World Cup in India and the subcontinent and to win the Ashes back from England, Australias National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement .         
	Hilditch said all the players would be rotated during the next few months to ensure that there is no burnout.         
	THE SQUAD: Michael Clarke (captain), Cameron White (vi-ce-captain), Doug Bollinger, Callum Ferguson, Nathan Hauritz, James Hopes, Mike Hussey, Shaun Marsh, Clint McKay, Tim Paine, James Pattinson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, David Warner.

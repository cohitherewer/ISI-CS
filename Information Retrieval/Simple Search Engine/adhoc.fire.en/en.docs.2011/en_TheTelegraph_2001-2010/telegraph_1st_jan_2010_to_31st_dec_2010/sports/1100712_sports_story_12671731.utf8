The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Klose call defended by coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Klose call defended by coach
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	Germany coach Joachim Loew deprived striker Miroslav Klose the chance of setting a World Cup scoring record but said he had no option but to leave the flu-stricken player out of the third-place play-off.         
	Klose, who came down with the virus after Germanys semi-final defeat by Spain on Wednesday, was a goal away from equalling Brazilian Ronaldos record of 15 goals and at 32-years old is unlikely to play in the next World Cup.         
	Loew said clinching third place was Germanys priority and Kloses inclusion could have damaged his side against Uruguay in the third-place play-off.We needed 100 per cent from everyone so we couldnt afford to use players who are not fit, Loew said after the win.         
	This is why we didnt field injured or ill players. It would have been irresponsible. He simply couldnt play, he failed the fitness test, he added.         
	The coach said he empathised with Klose.

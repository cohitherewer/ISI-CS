	New Delhi: Rifle shooter Tejaswini Sawant created history Sunday at the Olympic Shooting Range in Munich-Hochbrueck when she became the first Indian woman to win a world championship gold medal.         
	A month away from her 30th birthday, the five feet two inch tall girl from Kolhapur was in roaring form in the 50-metre rifle prone event which she won gold with a world record equalling score of 597. Before Sunday the sole owner of that record was Marina Bobkova of Russia who hit her high in 1998.         
	Only the second Indian woman after middleweight boxer MC Mary Kom to win a world title, Tejaswini was tied with Polish shooter Ewa Joanna Nowakowska but was declared winner with a better perfect score tally of 41. The Indian girl, however, has to wait for a shot at an Olympic gold since 50-metre rifle prone has yet to feature in the quadrennial event. Olga Dovgun of Kazakhstan won bronze with a score of 596.         
	This is, perhaps, the most memorable day of my life. I dedicate the victory to my late father, Tejaswini told The Telegraph from Germany. An ex Naval officer and a 1971 war veteran, Tejaswinis father passed away early this year while she was taking part in the Commonwealth championships in the capital.         
	Had he been alive, my father would have been the happiest man on earth today, said Tejaswini, whose mother, Sunita, was a fine state level cricket and volleyball player in her youth.         
	Tejaswini said she had been confident before the start of the event but admitted that the thought of a world record score had not crossed her mind.         
	I went there with good planning. The coach (Stanislav Lapidus of Kazakhstan) also gave me some extremely useful tips. Everything worked out well, she said.         
	Some of the credit for Tejaswinis achievement also goes to former India coach Laszlo Szucsak. Originally a 10-m air rifle shooter, she was persuaded to take up the 50-metre prone and 3-position event by the Hungarian coach. The results were almost immediate as the Maharashtra girl made rapid progress in these events.         
	Szucsak had great hopes for Tejaswini from the very beginning. Four years ago, he predicted Tejaswini was the emerging star after she defeated Asian Games gold medallist Anjali Vedpathak Bhagwat and world record holder Suma Shirur in the national championships to qualify for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.         
	Tejaswini did not disappoint her coach and bagged two gold medals in the 10-m air rifle singles and 10m air rifle pairs with Avneet Kaur Sidhu.         
	Tejaswini made it clear that she was looking for a few more medals at the Delhi Commonwealth Games. Since the Games will be held in our own country, I would like to do my best in front of home fans, she said. That would truly be a great experience.         
	She has had her share of disappointments, though. Tejaswini failed to win a medal in the rifle 3-position, an event that could have given her a ticket to the 2012 London Games.         
	National coach Sunny Thomas said he was hoping to see Tejaswini win a medal in the 3-position. She was in fine form and was very much in line for a medal. She was pipped at the end, but she made up for it in the prone, said Thomas.

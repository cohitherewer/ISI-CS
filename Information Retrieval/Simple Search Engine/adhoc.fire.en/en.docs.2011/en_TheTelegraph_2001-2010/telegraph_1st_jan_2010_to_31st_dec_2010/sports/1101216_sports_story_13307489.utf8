            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Saurashtras lanky Jaydev Unadkat, one of the two rookie quicks (Umesh Yadav of Vidarbha being the other) in the squad, will make his India debut if Zaheer Khan is actually ruled out of the first Test, in Centurion.         
	As things stand, its not looking good for Zaheer... He hasnt recovered from a hamstring injury sustained in the fourth ODI against New Zealand (in Bangalore)... So, Unadkat is probably a few hours away from his maiden India appearance, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Johannesburg, on Wednesday evening, the source added: Talk that Sreesanth, too, is doubtful just isnt correct... Hes fit and available for selection.         
	It looks as if the three-one attack will comprise Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Unadkat and Harbhajan Singh. Virender Sehwag and Suresh Raina could, of course, be called upon to help with spin bowling.         
	The wicket in Centurion, some 45 minutes drive from Johannesburg, is among the quickest and with the most bounce, in South Africa.         
	Till late on Wednesday, though, the bigger worry generally was over the weather. Centurion, Johannesburg... It has been raining all over.

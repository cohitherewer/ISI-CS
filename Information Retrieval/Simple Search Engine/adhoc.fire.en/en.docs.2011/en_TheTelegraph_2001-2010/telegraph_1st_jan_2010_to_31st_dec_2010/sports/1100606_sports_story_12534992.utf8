	New Delhi: Former India cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin said his decision to run for the post of president in the Badminton Association of India (BAI) elections was inspired by his desire to work for the improvement of the game.         
	Addressing a news conference in the capital on Saturday, Azharuddin said: Although Ive been a cricketer, I always wanted to do something for a different sport. Since Ive remained a keen follower of badminton throughout my life, I decided to join this sport.         
	The BAI elections are scheduled for June 13 in Chennai. A surprise contestant, Azhar is likely to be pitted against V.K. Verma, the BAI president for the last 12 years.

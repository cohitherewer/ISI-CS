                                                                                                                       7                                      Sanam happy with the switch
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Sanam Singh believes he has made the right decision by following the footsteps of Somdev Dev Varman. Like Somdev, Sanam also opted to play collegiate tennis instead of turning professional early.         
	I wanted to get myself good education which was the main reason why I went to the US. When I went there and spoke to Somdev, it wasnt difficult for me to make the decision, said Sanam, who incidentally studies at University of Virginia, the same institution which Somdev played for.         
	The 21-year-old Chandigarh lad was ranked as high as fourth in world junior rankings and had won an ITF Futures title at 17 when he decided to shift base.         
	Sanam, who was also a key member of the Indian juniors team at the Asia-Oceania championships in Korea in 2005 where he won both the singles and doubles titles, has come close to matching Somdevs reputation at the university.         
	In his second year in 2008-09, Sanam reached the semi-finals in singles. He also won the 2008 ITA Summer circuit national singles and doubles championships besides compiling a 28-7 win-loss record in singles.         
	Playing in the same college where Somdev studied helps a lot. In fact, I have the same coach, Brian Boland, said Sanam, who is partnering Somdev in doubles as a wild card at the Chennai Open.         
	The duo made a rocking start as they ousted fourth seeds Rik de Voest of South Africa and American Scott Lipsky 6-2, 7-5 in the opening round on Monday.         
	Even in his singles loss in the opening qualifying round, Sanam showed potential in the way he made a fight of it before going down to Ilhan Marsel of Turkey in three sets.         
	Somdev heaped lavish praise of his teammate. He is unbelievable and certainly going to be a part of the Indian Davis Cup team. The problem is there are only four spots in the squad and with the way Leander and Mahesh are playing, they could be playing for another 20 years. So that leaves only two spots. But I am sure Sanam is going to be there soon, Indias top singles player said.

	Cincinnati: Sania Mirza and Monica Niculescu stunned Wimbledon doubles champions Vania King and Yaroslava Shvedova to storm into the quarter finals of the Cincinnati Open here.         
	The unseeded Indo-Romanian pair shocked their fifth-seeded rivals 6-3, 1-6, 10-6 in the second round of the hardcourt event.         
	They had beaten Melanie Oudin and Jamie Hampton 6-4, 7-6 in the opening round.         
	In singles, second seed Caroline Wozniacki suffered a shock third-round exit after falling to Frances Marion Bartoli 4-6, 1-6 on Thursday.         
	In another upset, Russian sixth-seed Vera Zvonareva went out in straight sets, losing 4-6, 3-6 to Italian Flavia Pennetta.         
	Dane Wozniacki was 4-3 up in the first set but then Bartoli rallied to claim the opening frame and then dominated the second where she won 14 of 16 first-serve points.         
	Serbias Ana Ivanovic again looked in good form as she confidently defeated Russias Elena Vesnina 6-0, 6-3.         
	Late on Wednesday, Russias Elena Dementieva lost 1-6, 3-6 to compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round, but both Maria Sharapova and Kim Clijsters advanced to the third round.         
	Fourth seed Clijsters comfortably defeated another former world No. 1, Dinara Safina of Russia, 7-5, 6-2 in a match that was delayed by almost two hours by heavy showers.         
	But it was the early exit of third seed Dementieva that was the major surprise of the second round.         
	I was not feeling well and I think I was affected by the weather, she said after her loss.           (AGENCIES)

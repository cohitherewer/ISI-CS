	Bangalore: The imminent closure of the Bangalore race course by September 22, following the Karnataka High Courts verdict, to vacate the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) premises by that date, has left the local trainers and owners a frustrated lot. To add to their woes, the BTC has cut down on stakes and incentives to the tune of Rs 3 crore. The club has done so in view of the uncertain future. But their decision was greeted by a boycott of trainers and owners  cancelling the seasons scheduled start on May 15.          
	The BTC has been having regular meetings with the infuriated Karnataka Racehorse Owners Association (KROA) and the Karnataka Trainers Association (KTA) since then. The aggrieved parties are further demanding that the outstation horses should not be allowed to run and also the stakes were not enough.           
	The BTC, on its part, has been defending the cut down on stakes to fulfil their statutory obligations towards employees and other payments in the eventuality of the racing coming to a halt on September 22. The BTC has, however, promised the KTA and KROA that the club could pay the incentives with retrospective effect if racing continued to thrive after the High Court deadline. But KROA and KTA has been insisting that the stakes should be restored to the original level.           
	Late on Wednesday evening, the BTC is learnt to have came down a bit on its stand and has announced a hike to the tune of Rs 1.25 crore. With big owners intervening, all seemed to be settled now. The delayed start has cost the club a loss of close to Rs 70 lakh, said a BTC source.

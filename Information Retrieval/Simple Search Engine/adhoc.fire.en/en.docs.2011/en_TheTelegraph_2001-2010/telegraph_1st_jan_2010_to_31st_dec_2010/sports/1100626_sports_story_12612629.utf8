  -As Cannavaro leaves, Azzurris are in a state of disgrace

	Irene: Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro is leaving international football with the Azzurris in a state of disgrace after the defending champions unexpected first-round exit from the World Cup.         
	This is a black page in our history, but it cant erase what we achieved in 2006, Cannavaro said on Friday, a day after escorting crying teammate Fabio Quagliarella off the pitch. Im not ashamed to say that I cried last night after 14 years in Azzurro.         
	Having drawn 1-1 in their opening two games with Paraguay and New Zealand, it marked the first time Italy had exited the World Cup without winning at least one game. It was also the first time the four-time champions finished last in their group.         
	With four stars on your chest, you feel obligated to win. Its only natural to feel pressure but we were too afraid. I saw it in the faces of my teammates, Cannavaro said.         
	At 36, Cannavaro often appeared a step too slow in this tournament, and was responsible in part for the two goals Italy allowed against Paraguay and New Zealand.         
	Its time to go, he said, accepting his critics. Ive had a lot of good games and a lot of bad games  thats all part of a footballers career.         
	Cannavaro also struggled this past season with Juventus, which declined to exercise an option on his contract. The centre back will end his club career in the United Arab Emirates, having signed a two-year deal to play for the Dubai-based Al-Ahli before the World Cup.         
	His Italy career is over, though, after a national record 136 appearances, and Cannavaro is handing over the captaincy to goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.         
	Buffon wore the leaders armband at the 2008 European Championships, which Cannavaro missed due to injury.         
	Cannavaro acknowledged that it would have been easier to retire after winning in 2006.         
	But the national team has always represented something different to me. Ive never been able to say no, he said. And my injury at Euro 2008 left a bitter taste in my mouth, so I wanted to continue.         
	With Cannavaro the oldest of the bunch, nine players in Italys team were 30 or over. Its tough to explain how you can go from being world champions to being eliminated in the first round, Cannavaro said. Maybe when we won the World Cup we were already a bit too old.

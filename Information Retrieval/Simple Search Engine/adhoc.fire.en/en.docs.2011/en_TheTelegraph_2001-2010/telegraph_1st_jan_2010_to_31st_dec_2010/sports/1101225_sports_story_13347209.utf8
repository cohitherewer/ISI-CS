                                                                                                                       7                                      Arpita is the first casualty
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Asian U-8 runner-up Arpita Mukherjee was the first casualty amongst the seeds, as she was upset by unrated Shaswat Chakraborty in the first round of the Mayors Cup Fide Rating Chess Tournament on Friday. Opting for the unambitious Colle System, Arpita lost a pawn early in the game and finally blundered a piece, which cost her the game.         
	Top seed, Anjan Mallik won a pawn on the 13th move against Al Firdous Molla and had little difficulty thereafter in converting his material advantage into a win.         
	Second seed, and national U-13 champion Diptayan Ghosh completely dominated the board against Amanul Halsana in a Slav Exchange variation and won the game in 33 moves.         
	Women International Master Saheli Dhar Barua, too, faced little resistance from unrated Aneek Das as she won a piece as early as the 10th move and thereafter the game in a Ruy Lopez opening.         
	Former national U-12 champion Joydev Saha got the better of Amit Jagwani with the black pieces in an unusual opening in 50 moves. Former state champion Swapan Mitra won against K. Anand with the black pieces, after the latter erred in blocking the centre, after which Mitra got a thematic break down the f-file.         
	National U-9 champion and former Asian U-8 champion Mitrabha Guha and former U-8 Asian girls champion Khushi Dharewa, both posted comfortable victories against Rabindra Nath Mandi and Supratim Dey respectively.         
	Speaking on the occasion Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly urged the participants to enjoy the game and play it without pressure.         
	He said that such rating tournaments will go a long way in making the game popular amongst masses and help upcoming players get valuable exposure.

	New Delhi: Prasanta Karmakar is a happy man. The only Indian swimmer to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games, called on Rahul Gandhi at 10 Janpath Road on Wednesday morning.         
	I was overjoyed when he called me. He wanted to meet me and ask about my achievements, family background, training problems among a host of other things, the para-swimmer told The Telegraph. Karmakar won the bronze in the S-9 50m category clocking 27.48 seconds.         
	Rahul Gandhi was also kind enough to ask me what sector I was hoping to work in. I immediately said the Railways! Ever since I was a child, I wanted to work in the Railways. I dont know why he asked me such a question but lets see what happens, he added.         
	The Asia No. 3 in the S-9 category is yet to get employment and sponsors for his future endeavours.         
	The Asian Games in November will be tough as Im participating in seven events. Plus, a host of swimmers from other countries, like China, will be there. Once you win a medal, the responsibility grows. People expect you to keep on winning which is not easy but not impossible either, claimed Karmakar. But, my target is a medal at the London Olympics.         
	Karmakar will be felicitated by a corporate house later this month in Mumbai.         
	 There have been no talks of a sponsorship or anything but I do hope something will work out, said Karmakar before signing off.

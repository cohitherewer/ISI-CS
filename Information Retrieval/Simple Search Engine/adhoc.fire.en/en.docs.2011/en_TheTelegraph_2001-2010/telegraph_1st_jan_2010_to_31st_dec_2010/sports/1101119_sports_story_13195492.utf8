The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waqar votes for separate teams
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waqar votes for separate teams
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Waqar Younis has suggested that the national team should have separate teams for Twenty20s, ODIs and Test matches.         
	I think the time has come for us to think on these lines We must have separate teams for the different formats with specialised players for each format, Waqar said, ahead of the second Test against South Africa, which is scheduled to begin from Saturday.         
	The national coach insisted that all three different formats required a different approach from the coaching staff and the players.         
	We have a lot of talent in Pakistan and that is why I believe we should now think about having separate squads with specialists. Obviously some players can play in all three formats Or maybe in two formats, the former captain said.         
	Waqar pointed out that the forthcoming series against New Zealand would help Pakistan build their combination for the World Cup. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Finn finishes Bangladesh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Finn finishes Bangladesh
                      
	Manchester: Steven Finn took five wickets as England thrashed Bangladesh by an innings and 80 runs inside three days in the second Test to wrap up a 2-0 series victory at Old Trafford. Bangladesh, following-on, were dismissed for 123 in 34.1 overs with fast bowler Finn taking five wickets for 42 runs in 10 overs. James Anderson took three for 16 in 10 at his Lancashire home ground. Defeat meant Bangladesh have now lost 34 of their 68 Tests by an innings.         
	Anderson and Finn combined to reduce Bangladesh, whod suffered a dramatic collapse in Saturdays final session, to 37 for five in the 13th over. Only Mohammad Mahmudullah, with 38, offered much resistance.         
	As no play was possible before lunch due to rain, England captain Andrew Strauss enforced the follow-on. (Agencies)

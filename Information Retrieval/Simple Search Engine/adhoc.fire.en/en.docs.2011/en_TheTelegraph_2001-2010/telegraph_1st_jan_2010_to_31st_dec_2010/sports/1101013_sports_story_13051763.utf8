                                                                                                                       7                                        For India,   Bharat   saves day
  - Day IX Checklist: two gold, two silver and four bronze       ANSHUMAN ROY            Team members congratulate goalkeeper Bharat Chetri after India won the semi-final match against England, on Tuesday. (AP)                                             
	New Delhi: A thud! Shivendra Singhs penalty stroke, Indias fifth, had just sounded the board and there was unbridled euphoria at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	Party time and why not?         
	Shivendras goal gave India a dramatic come-from-behind 8-7 win (via tiebreaker) over England in the second semi-final to set up a Commonwealth Games gold medal match against Australia on Thursday.         
	 It was a breathtaking performance by Rajpal Singh and Company. Down 1-3 till the 57th minute, they rallied to make it 3-3 at full time. The score remained same after 15 minutes of extra time and, in the tie-breaker, the hosts found a hero in Bharat Chetri.         
	The 28-year-old goalkeeper from Makaibari near Darjeeling, who saved a sure goal in the 47th minute to keep his team in the tie, dived to his right to deny Glenn Kirkhams attempt. That was Englands third penalty stroke. The save gave the confidence to Sandeep Singh, Arjun Halappa and Shivendra, who made no mistake in converting their strokes. Five-four in Indias favour, 8-7 overall.         
	Jose Brasa embracing the Indian custodian will go down as the most poignant moment of Indias campaign on Tuesday. As a smiling Bharat waited, the Spaniard again gave his man of the moment another tight hug. He said well done, Bharat later told The Telegraph. I will never forget this day. My first save in a tie-breaker, and, it will remain the most memorable one, the goalkeeper added.                 
	India were clearly a dominant force in the second half of the regulation time and could have finished the match there itself. But then they were up against an English goalkeeper, who seemed to play out of his skin. James Fair thwarted three Indian attempts into the visitors citadel which had goal written on them. Thanks, to James outstanding perormance, England could go into the tiebreaker.         
	India took lead in the 19th minute when Saravanjit Singh scored off Sandeep Singhs penalty corner. But at the stroke of half-time, England restored parity through drag-flicker Ashley Jackson. Five minutes into the second half, it was 2-1. Soon, Simon Maxtell made it 3-1.         
	After Ashleys drag flick hit the post, Bharat pulled off an acrobatic save. Soon, India showed gumption for a fightback and orchestrated more constructive attacks. In the 57th minute, one such move saw Sandeep Singh playing it to Vikram Pillay, who steered the ball into the English goal. And then at the hour mark came Saravanjits equaliser.         
	India pushed for the winner, but James had other ideas. Even he would wonder how he managed to flick away Tushar Khandkars attempt from five metres. I dont know how he managed it, Brasa said at the post-match conference when asked about that particular save.         
	The nerve-jangling moment arrived when the match moved into the tiebreakers. Richard Smith converted the first one for England, while Saravanjit scored for India. Richard Mantell made it 2-1 and Vikram Pillay levelled it for the hosts.         
	Then came that deciding save by Bharat. Ashley Jackson and Simon Mantell next found the net and the Indians didnt fluff their lines either. Shivendra was to take the final shot and as the ball beat an athletic James, the entire stadium breathed a sigh of relief. India were through and the celebration got wilder as it ensured Indias first podium finish ever since hockeys introduction into the Games. But will it be a golden one? Wait and watch.

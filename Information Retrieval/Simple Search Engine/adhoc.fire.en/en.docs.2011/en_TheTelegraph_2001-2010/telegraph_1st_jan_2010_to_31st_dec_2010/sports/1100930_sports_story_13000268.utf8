            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Pakistan captain Salman Butt has appealed against his suspension over allegations of spot-fixing, International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat has confirmed.         
	Butt, alongside seam duo Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif, was banned from playing by the ICC after a series of allegations made by the News of the World and subsequently followed up by a Scotland Yard investigation.         
	Butt and the other two has filed detailed replies to the ICC notice, seeking a hearing into allegations that they took bribe for bowling no balls in a Test match against England.         
	Yes the three have filed their detailed replies and the next step will be a preliminary hearing in which the Anti Corruption Unit has to provide evidence to support the suspensions on these players, PCB legal advisor Talib Rizvi said.         
	All three were given a right to appeal and Lorgat has said Butt has taken up the option, which will now be subject to a new hearing.         
	We are making good progress, Lorgat said. Just yesterday (Tuesday) we received a request from Salman Butt to consider lifting the suspension. As expeditiously as possible we will conduct a hearing to consider that appeal.         
	Lorgat defended his organisations response to the claims that all but derailed Pakistans recently concluded tour of England.         
	The governing body has been criticised in the past for being slow to act on match-fixing but Lorgat is content they have moved quickly and fairly to the new allegations.

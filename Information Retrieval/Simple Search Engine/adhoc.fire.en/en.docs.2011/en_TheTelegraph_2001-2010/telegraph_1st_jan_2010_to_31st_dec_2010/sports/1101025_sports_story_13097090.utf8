  - UK paper links Raina to woman with bookie ties
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Suresh Raina                           
	Calcutta/New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), on Sunday, rubbished claims that it had received a report from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) saying Suresh Raina was seen with a woman allegedly linked to an associate of a bookie, during Indias tour of Sri Lanka.         
	BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan issued a media release which said: The BCCI has just learnt that several media outlets are claiming that Sri Lanka Cricket had submitted a report on Suresh Raina to it, and that no action was taken by the Board on the same.         
	The BCCI would like to clarify that it has received no such report from SLC. The claims being made by a section of the media are totally baseless and false.         
	Raina found himself at the centre of an unexpected controversy when British paper The Sunday Times claimed that the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) is probing why the BCCI kept quiet on a report from the SLC that Raina was seen in the company of a woman linked to an associate of a bookie during the tour of the island nation in July-August.         
	They are targeting a player who is doing well for India now, an angry Srinivasan added.         
	BCCI spokesperson Rajiv Shukla also termed the report as untrue and said the woman concerned was Rainas agent. That is untrue and baseless. Its all rubbish. No complaint had ever come to BCCI from either the ICC or SLC. BCCI had never received any complaint on this matter. Actually, the lady is Rainas agent, Shukla said.         
	Raina was with the lady to sign some papers and complete formalities. She was also the agent of some Sri Lankan players. It has nothing to do with any anti-corruption matter or any matter outside cricket, said Shukla. It is just media speculation and nothing else, he said.         
	According to the British newspaper, Raina, on more than one occasion, was seen in the company of a woman known to be an associate of a man allegedly linked to a bookmaker.         
	It said the SLC gave a report to BCCI of Raina accompanying the woman along with footages of CCTV cameras installed at the Indian team hotel in Sri Lanka.         
	But even SLC denied giving any such report to the ICC. This is news to me. There is no truth in this report, SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga said.         
	According to the newspaper, it is Srinivasans reaction that has led to the ICC investigation. Instead of acting on the report, Srinivasan is alleged to have got the Sri Lankans to withdraw it.         
	The 23-year-old Raina plays for the Chennai Super Kings, an IPL franchise owned by Indian Cements of which Srinivasan is a vice-chairman and managing director. The investigation, led by ACSU head Ravi Sawani, is believed to be looking into why SLC shared the report with the BCCI first when, under ICC anti-corruption rules, it should have gone straight to the world governing body, the newspaper said quoting unnamed ICC sources.         
	However, the daily made it clear that Raina was not suspected of any wrongdoing.         
	An ICC spokesman, when asked about the alleged investigation into the inaction of the BCCI, merely stated: We dont comment on any investigation.

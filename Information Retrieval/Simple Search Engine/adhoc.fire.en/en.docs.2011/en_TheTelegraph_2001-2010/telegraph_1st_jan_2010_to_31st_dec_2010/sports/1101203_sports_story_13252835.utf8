	Sydney: Matthew Griffin has shot a seven-under-par 65 to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Australian Open at The Lakes, on Thursday.         
	Griffin, whose long-time caddie Peter Beck died suddenly about a month ago, had seven birdies on some forgiving greens after a large amount of rain on the course the previous day. He had a one-stroke lead over John Senden and was two strokes clear of Alistair Presnell.         
	Australian Masters champion Stuart Appleby, Geoff Ogilvy, Peter Senior, Marc Leishman and Rod Pampling  all Australians  were among a group of nine players at four-under. American John Daly was in a share of 13th place after carding 69.           (AGENCIES)

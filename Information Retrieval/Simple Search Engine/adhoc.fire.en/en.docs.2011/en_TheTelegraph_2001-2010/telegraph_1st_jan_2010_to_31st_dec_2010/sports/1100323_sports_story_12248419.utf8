The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Neville says Becks will be back soon
                                                                                                                       7                                      Neville says Becks will be back soon
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	David Beckham will beat his Achilles tendon injury and be back in action within a few months according to Manchester United captain Gary Neville, Beckhams closest friend in football.         
	David Beckham is out of the World Cup 2010 and battling to save his top-level career after suffering a torn Achilles while on duty for AC Milan last week.         
	The former United midfielder underwent surgery in Finland last Monday to repair the damaged tendon, but he has been warned to expect six months on the sidelines.         
	Beckham has already been ruled out of South Africa 2010 by manager Fabio Capello.         
	Neville said: I think everyone was disappointed for David... He has done so much to be part of this World Cup and he has been part of all of Englands qualifying games and all the squads.         
	I watched the game in which he got injured and it seemed initially that hed just turned his ankle a bit, but obviously the news was far worse and it looks like he will miss the tournament. It happened to me in 2002 so I know how it feels.

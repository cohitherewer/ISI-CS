	Calcutta: Manav Jaini of the Delhi Golf Club and veteran Mukesh Kumar from Mhow are tied for the lead at six under 134 after Round II of the Aircel-PGTI Players Championship at the Tollygunge Club, here, on Wednesday .         
	While Jaini carded a solid three under 67 on Wednesday, Mukesh produced a sedate one under 69. Lucknows Sanjay Kumar produced the best score of the day, a five under 65, to be placed third at five under 135.         
	Manav Jaini (67, 67), a 10th tee starter on day two, made a decent start with pars on the first three holes. His first birdie came on the 13th where he played a good chip from 20 yards to make a tricky up and down.         
	He then converted an 18-footer for birdie on the 17th that helped him make the turn at two under.         
	Manav came up with a stupendous second shot (pitching wedge) from 135 yards on the third, which landed within two feet and led to an easy birdie putt.         
	His only bogey of the day came on the sixth as a result of a missed putt from eight feet.         
	The 26-year-old managed to pocket his last birdie with another good chip-putt on the seventh.         
	Mukesh Kumar (65, 69) made a poor start with a double bogey on the 11th and a bogey on the 12th.         
	He then turned the tide by sinking some really long putts for birdies on the 13th, 14th, 16th, 17th and sixth. A bogey on the seventh meant he closed with a one under.         
	Sanjay Kumar (70, 65) knocked-in five birdies to climb from overnight tied 19th to be placed in third position at five under 135. Sanjay thus posted the best score in Round Two.         
	Om Prakash Chouhan, Amardip Sinh Malik, Harmeet Kahlon and city boy Feroz Ali Mollah are tied fourth at three under 137.

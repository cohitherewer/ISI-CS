                  Gaganjeet Bhullar                     
	Singapore: Rising Indian golfer Gaganjeet Bhullar brightened up a gloomy day with a brilliant five-under 65 to grab a share of the second spot in the weather-disrupted second round of the $400,000 Handa Singapore Classic here Friday.         
	Bhullars 65, which included six birdies and an eagle against just one bogey, took his total to 12-under 132, six strokes behind leader Peter Karmis (63) of South Africa.         
	Among other Indians in fray, SSP Chowrasia also carded a seven-under 65 and was a stroke adrift of Bhullar at tied sixth.         
	With darkness leading to an early end to the proceedings, 19 players were left with incomplete second rounds.         
	The play was delayed for two hours earlier in the morning due to lightning and Bhullar said it was not easy to acclimatise to the course and the conditions.         
	To be honest it wasnt easy out there. It was raining and we had a two-hour delay after nine holes. I tried not to break the concentration and the tempo but I have been hitting and putting very well, he said.         
	We finished nine holes before the rain suspension and it was quite a shaky start in the beginning but after a while I started to get used to the weather and putting greens. Rain delays usually break your concentration but you have to remain focussed on your game, he added.         
	I have always hit the ball well but it has been my short game that has been letting me down. But my putting is good now.         
	Chowrasia, who struck eight birdies against just one bogey on the final hole, said it was a relief to sign a low card after weeks of indifferent form on the European Tour and credited the rediscovered form to his new putter.         
	I played well on the last five holes when I closed with five birdies (played on the back nine). I had a few long putts on the third (10 feet), sixth (chip in from 40 yards and landed three feet from the pin), seventh (20 feet) and eighth (15 feet), Chowrasia said.         
	My putting is really good. After suspension I missed a short putt on the 18th hole for bogey. That was disappointing but luckily I returned strongly. Im playing well and this week my putting is okay.         
	I changed my putter last week and now I feel better. I have changed so many putters this year and I cant remember how many. This one seems to be working the best for me. It has been a long time since I shot such a low score, he added.         
	Further down, Anirban Lahiri also turned in a creditable six-under 66to lie tied 14th with a total of nine-under 135. C Muniyappa was a shot behind Lahiri at tied 24th after turning in a 67 Friday. Himmat Rai took the tied 41st position with a four-under 68.         
	The Indians who are set to miss the cut Saturday are Harmeet Kahlon (72), Rahil Gangjee (70), Gaurav Ghei (70) and Digvijay Singh (69).           (PTI)

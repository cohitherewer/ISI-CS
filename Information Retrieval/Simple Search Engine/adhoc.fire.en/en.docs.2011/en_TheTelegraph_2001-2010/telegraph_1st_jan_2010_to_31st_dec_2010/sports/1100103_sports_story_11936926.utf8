The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England look to wrap it up 
                                                                                                                       7                                        England look to wrap it up

	Cape Town: England are not going to take nothing for granted when they look to wrap up the series against South Africa in the third Test, starting here on Sunday.         
	Although Andrew Strauss amp; Co. have a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series, Strauss said England would not repeat the mistake they made against Australia earlier this year  of thinking too much about their chances of a series victory just because they were in the lead.         
	England beat Australia at Lords but then lost by an innings at Headingley to allow the opposition to draw level, before Strausss side eventually won back the Ashes 2-1.         
	If you pat yourself on the back ... you can get beaten pretty quickly. We need to be ruthless ... when ahead, Strauss said on Saturday.         
	We shouldnt have been talking about winning the (Ashes) series, we should have been talking about winning the first half-hour (of the next match). You dont win a Test match on day one, but its very important to start well so that the opposition dont get on top of you.         
	Ive seen enough teams losing one week and winning the next, to know nothing is guaranteed.         
	England have a good chance of going into the match at Newlands with a team unchanged from the one which beat the hosts by an innings in Durban.         
	Paul Collingwood, who dislocated his left index finger in Durban, batted without apparent discomfort in the nets on Saturday, and barring last-minute complications, should bat as usual at No 5.         
	Looking ahead, Strauss said: Its one of the great occasions, playing a Newlands Test.         
	Its a wicket that offers the bowlers something, whether its the seamers on day one or the spinners at the fag end of the match.         
	Its a result wicket ... we will have to bat well.         
	For South Africa, the most likely change will be in the bowling ranks, where veteran Makhaya Ntini could be dropped for Friedel de Wet, who took five wickets on debut, in the first Test, in Centurion.         
	Dropping the iconic Ntini would be a controversial move, as he has been a key member of the team for a decade, and is vital to the transformation of the game in South Africa.         
	South Africa have a fine record in Cape Town, only losing to Australia at Newlands since their readmission to international cricket in 1991.         
	The last time South Africa lost a home New Year test was in 1967.         
	We feel ready and excited because a New Years test at Newlands is always a special five days for us, quot; Smith said.         
	In terms of on-field performance, though, Ntini had a below-average 2009, taking only 13 wickets in six Tests at an average of 57.00.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith insisted the team were behind him as they prepared for a potentially decisive contest.         
	Yes, no doubt. If I didnt feel that, I would walk away. Ive seen two England captains walk away in my time.         
	Im very comfortable in the job ... if someone felt otherwise, so be it.         
	Im pretty comfortable with what weve achieved in the past couple of years, and I continually reassess my position even when we are winning, the big left-hander said.         
	Included in the list of recent achievements are away Test series wins in England and Australia, in a six-month period in the second half of 2008. As for his own performance, Smith reckoned it would not be affected by the high stakes at Newlands.         
	It took me two or three years to get a grasp of the job, he said.         
	I cant say Im feeling any extra pressure in terms of the job ... Im just focused on being the best captain I can be. (Agencies)

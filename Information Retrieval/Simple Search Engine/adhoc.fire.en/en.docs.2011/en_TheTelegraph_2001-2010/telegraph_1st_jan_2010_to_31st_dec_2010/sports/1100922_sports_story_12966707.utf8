	Cuttack: Defending champions East Bengal started their campaign on a rousing note, outplaying Air India 3-1 in the opening group A quarter final league match of the 32nd Federation Cup Football Tournament at Barabati Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	In the absence of star striker Bhaichung Bhutia, who is now busy in the National camp, Australian recruit Tolgay Ozebe emerged as the architect of the win, scoring twice in the 21st and 55th minutes.         
	The third goal was netted by fellow striker Robin Singh in the 63rd minute. After trailing 0-3, the airmen found some consolation when Vijith Shetty scored off a penalty kick in the injury time.         
	Five-time champions East Bengal took some time to develop the co-ordination and also gauge the strength of the opponents. But after Ozebe drew the first blood, there was no looking back. Loose marking cost Air India dear as Ozebe opened the scoring off a long pass from near the centre line.         
	He controlled the ball efficiently, darted a couple of yards before beating a desperate defender and goalkeeper Kunal Sawant with a booming left-footer to the left side of the net. Ozebe completed his brace off a penalty kick, which was awarded by referee Dinesh Nair when the nimble-footed Aussie was pulled down by Air India custodian Sawant.         
	The offence also proved another blow for Sawant as he was shown the yellow card.The hapless Air India conceded the third goal when Robin Singh tapped home a measured cross from the left flank.         
	The deep defence of the Air India side seemed too weak to counter the opposition onslaughts, which occurred in regular intervals. Sawant added to their owes as he often fumbled to grab the goal-bound shots.         
	TEAMS         
	East Bengal: Sandip Nandy, Naoba Singh, Nirmal Chetri, Uga Okpara, Saumik Dey, R Vashum, Mehtab Hossain, Harmanjot Singh Khabra, Penn Orji, Robin Singh, Tolgay Ozebe.         
	Air India: Kunal Sawant, Napoleon Singh, Collin Abranches, Eduardo Chacon, Samson Singh, Manjit Singh, Darren Caldeira, Vijith Shetty, Amritpal Singh, Praneel Mendon, Dharamjit Singh.         
	Meanwhile, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Bangalore created a flutter as they edged past Pune FC by a solitary goal, on Tuesday. Nigerian Jagaba Hamza Amaba scored the all-important goal in the 17th minute.         
	Pune FC, however, turned out to be unlucky as its players failed to translate two successive opportunities into goals.

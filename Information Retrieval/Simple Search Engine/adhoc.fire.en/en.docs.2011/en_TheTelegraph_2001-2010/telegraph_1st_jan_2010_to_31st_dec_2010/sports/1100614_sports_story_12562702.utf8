The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Toure is all praise for Eriksson 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Toure is all praise for Eriksson 
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has instilled a sense of teamwork in the players since taking over and can lead the African side out of a tough Group G , according to defender Kolo Toure.         
	Eriksson was hired in March and has a strong international pedigree after taking England to the World Cup quarter finals in 2002 and 2006 and the same stage of the 2004 European Championship.         
	Sometimes we, instead of thinking about the team, we are thinking about ourselves, Toure said. I think Mr Eriksson came and he just said to us, if you want to be one of the best teams in this World Cup, we need to work together.         
	Ivory Coast opened their first World Cup four years ago with a 2-1 loss to two-time champions Argentina. It then conceded two early goals to lose by the same score to the Netherlands, before rallying with a 3-2 win over Serbia and Montenegro that restored some pride but was not enough to take the African side into the next round.         
	Ivory Coast plays their first match Tuesday against Portugal at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. The African team will likely be playing without Didier Drogba, who broke his right arm in a friendly against Japan on June 4 and had surgery the next day.         
	The African side then must play Brazil on June 20 in Johannesburg and North Korea on June 25 in Nelspruit.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina comes of age
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raina comes of age

	Gros Islet (St Lucia):Greg Chappell often spoke about three cricketers, in the most positive way, during his 23 months as the Team India coach.  
	 He regarded Suresh Raina and Sreesanth as ldquo;special rdquo; and praised Dinesh Karthik rsquo;s ldquo;leadership qualities. rdquo;  
	 Karthik, the senior-most, keeps getting in and out, while few cricketers in India have been more temperamental than Sreesanth. Raina alone has taken great strides.  
	 In fact, with the seniors being rested, the national selectors have chosen him to captain India on the forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe.  
	 Raina hasn rsquo;t played a Test, but has been playing a ldquo;leadership role, rdquo; as a well-placed source of The Telegraph put it, in the ODI and T20 teams.  
	 The best way to do so is by contributing and Raina did exactly that in the World T20: 18, 101 (against South Africa), 5, 32 and 63 (versus Sri Lanka).  
	 Raina rsquo;s innings on Tuesday couldn rsquo;t help India qualify for the semi-final, but the left-hander can rsquo;t be faulted on the effort-scale.  
	 Clearly, the ldquo;special rdquo; one has definitely come of age. Not that the learning process has ended.   
	 Incidentally, both captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten have plenty of time for the 23-year-old.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Bayern All Stars too hot to handle 
 - German veterans thrash East Bengal All Stars 10-3            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The difference in sporting culture of Germany and India came to the fore, and, how! A 59-year-old World Cup winner, who responds to the name of Paul Breitner, said after the 90-minute show that he was ready for 30 more minutes of action, whereas our veteran footballers were exhausted.         
	That they did not thank the referee for blowing the final whistle and saving them from more ignominy could not be verified, but that there was a fervent plea not to score more than 10 goals was confirmed by the Bayern Munich legend.         
	The final score of the charity match between Bayern Munich All Stars XI and the East Bengal All Stars XI at the near-empty Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday, was 10-3, and it could have been 17-4.         
	The Bayern stars turned the clock back and showed glimpses of the legendary German dedication and discipline. They got down to business without a fuss and ensured the job was done. As Breitner said the other day, In Bayern dictionary, the word loss is not there.         
	Paulo Sergio scored four goals, Markus Muench and Carsten Lakies netted a brace each while Harold Cazny and Wolfgang Dremmler found the net once. For East Bengal veterans, Kabir Bose pulled one back after Bayern had scored four and then Amit Das and Sanjay Majhi scored one each after conceding 10 goals.         
	It was just that we dont keep ourselves fit enough. Look, the difference in class will always be there. But even after quitting the game the likes of Breitner and Brehme have kept themselves so fit is just amazing. Here in lies the difference in sporting cultures. The Germans are just amazing, East Bengal skipper Sudhir Karmarkar said after the match. They were so serious about this tie whereas most of us took it as a fun game, Karmakar added.         
	Indeed, Bayern were serious about this match. And they shot into lead as early as the fourth minute through Sergio off a trademark Andreas Brehme delivery from the right. As the floodgates opened, goals started coming thick and fast. Fifteen minutes later, Cerny made it 2-0 with a neat placement and in the 27 th minute Muench made it 3-0. Four minutes later, it was Sergio again. At the stroke of half-time, Kabir Bose pulled once back with a grounder. In between, Dulal Biswas failed to tap one home with not even goalkeeper Walter Junghans in front of him.         
	Sergio got his hattrick in the 55th and his fourth and Bayerns sixth came in the 59th from a penalty. Muench then scored his second off a Lakies cross and then Dremmler made it 8-1. Lakies then joined the party scoring two. As the crowd braced for more goals, Amit Das reduced the margin and minutes before the final whistle, Sanjay Majhi got his name in the scoresheet.         
	As East Bengal coach Trevor James Morgan said: It was a learning experience for these veterans.         
	Very true, the chasm is so wide that even age could not narrow it down.

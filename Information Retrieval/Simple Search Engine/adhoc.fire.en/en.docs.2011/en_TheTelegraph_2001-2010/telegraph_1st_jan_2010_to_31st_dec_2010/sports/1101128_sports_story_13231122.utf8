	London: Dimitar Berbatov scored five goals to send Manchester United roaring back to the top of the Premier League with a 7-1 rout of Blackburn Rovers at Old Trafford, on Saturday.         
	The Bulgarian, eclipsing teammate Wayne Rooney in the England strikers first league start since the beginning of October, put in a five star performance after wrapping up his hattrick two minutes after the break.         
	In the absence of champions Chelsea, who can reclaim the lead at Newcastle United on Sunday, Arsenal had earlier enjoyed a brief spell in first place after beating Aston Villa 4-2 in the days early match.         
	Unbeaten United now have 31 points from 15 games to Arsenals 29.         
	Carlo Ancelottis misfiring Chelsea, who have lost three of their last four Premier League encounters, fell to third overall with 28 points from 14.         
	Manchester City, held 1-1 at Stoke City after conceding a late equaliser, stayed fourth on 26 points.         
	Berbatov wasted no time in getting his name on the scoresheet, taking his first from close range in the second minute and his second in the 27th.         
	The fourth, again lashed in from close range, came in the 62nd and the fifth eight minutes later.         
	South Korean forward Park Ji-sung had made it 2-0 in the 23rd while Nani scored Uniteds fifth in the 48th with Blackburn, taken over this month by Indian poultry giant Venkys, taking a roasting.         
	Chris Samba took a late consolation goal with a header seven minutes from time.         
	West Ham United remain bottom of the table despite a 3-1 home win over another relegation-threatened side Wigan Athletic.         
	Arsenal missed a fistful of chances at a freezing Villa Park while youngster Ciaran Clark scored twice for the home side in the second half to turn what should have been a comfortable afternoon for the Gunners into a nervy final 20 minutes.         
	The first half was all Arsenal, with Villa flattered to stay on level terms for 39 minutes before a defensive howler allowed Andrei Arshavin to scamper into the box and beat the outstretched Brad Friedel.         
	Samir Nasri could have made it 2-0 a minute later after being played through and rounding Friedel only to see his tightly angled shot hit the side netting.         
	Friedel had to make another crucial save from a powerful Marouane Chamakh header in the 44th before Nasri finally got on the scoresheet on the stroke of halftime.         
	The Frenchmans volleyed shot off a floating Arshavin corner took a deflection off Villa defender Luke Young with Friedel diving in vain to keep it out.         
	Villas French manager Gerard Houllier took off former Arsenal midfielder and compatriot Robert Pires at half time and they were a changed side after the break.         
	Clark chested the ball down on the edge of the area in the 52nd minute and lashed it past Lukasz Fabianski to pull a goal back, although team mate John Carew appeared to be in an offside position.         
	The Villa joy was short-lived, with Chamakh restoring the two goal advantage in the 56th with a right-footed prod at full stretch past Friedel as the American rushed in desperately to smother.         
	Clark restored their hopes with Richard Dunne nodding on the ball from a corner for him to head home in the 70th.         
	Teenage midfielder Jack Wilshere, who signed a new long-term contract only this month after making his England debut in August, then made sure of all three points with a diving header three minutes into stoppage time.

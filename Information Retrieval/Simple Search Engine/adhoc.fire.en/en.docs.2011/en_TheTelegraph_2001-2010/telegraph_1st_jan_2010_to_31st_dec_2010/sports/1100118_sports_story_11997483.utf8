The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh prove a point
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bangladesh prove a point
    - Indias best move comes after days play, in the form of Sachin           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Sachin Tendulkar on way to his unbeaten 76 on the opening day of the first Test against Bangladesh, in Chittagong, on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	Chittagong: The Indian cricket teams best move on a truncated day came off the field, when senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar was sent to face the media.         
	Anybody else would probably have been taken apart by the Bangladeshi press corps, thanks to stand-in captain Virender Sehwags somewhat insensitive ordinary side comment directed at the home team, but Sachin is God in these parts too.         
	It was, after all, Bangladeshs day on Sunday and Sehwag was left with egg on his face. He didnt follow tradition at the toss, as well, turning up in a sweater and not the India blazer.         
	The buzz is that he hasnt brought his blazer to Bangladesh!         
	Sehwag said it and you should ask him... Im not answering for Sehwag, Sachin responded, when asked to give his views on the ordinary side bit.         
	There was a feeble attempt at throwing a follow-up, but Sachin stood firm: Lets move to the next question... A lesser cricketer would almost surely have been shouted down by the desi media.         
	With fellow-batsmen scripting an appalling show, which saw India end Day I of the opening Test for the Idea Cup on 213 for eight, a milestone  13,000 Test runs  sadly became a non event.         
	Later, speaking to The Telegraph at the Peninsula Hotel, Sachin said: Frankly, it was only when the screen flashed that I was four short of the landmark did I realise I was so close... Because of the situation we were in, other things had been on my mind, not 13,000 Test runs...         
	Sachin, who began his 163rd Test 30 adrift of that figure, was dropped on 16, but finished on an unbeaten 76. It hasnt been one of his best innings, but may still be remembered as special should the remainder of the match go Indias way.         
	The Milestone Man is himself quite optimistic. The game is not over as yet, theres a long way to go... Wait and see... Hopefully, it will go into the fifth day... I expect the wicket (at the Z.A. Chowdhury Stadium) to get better... There was a lot of moisture in the morning, though it got less as the day progresed...         
	But what about the poor shot-selection from some of his teammates?         
	To an extent, Sachin defended them: Nobody plays shots in order to get out... One had to be patient and be careful with the shot-selection...         
	Its not that the conditions werent challenging, with the ball stopping and coming on to the bat and, then, often turning prodigiously, but a star-studded line-up is expected to counter effectively.         
	Sachin, for his part, didnt forget to compliment the Bangladesh bowlers, whod been dismissed by Sehwag, on Saturday, as incapable of taking 20 Indian wickets.         
	Actually, had Sachins catch been taken by Imrul Kayes, Bangladesh couldve been batting before the premature close. Zaheer Khan was also dropped, but that didnt prove costly.         
	The Bangladesh bowlers exploited the conditions quite well (after Shakib-al Hasan won the toss)... They did so throughout the day and Id say all of them bowled well, Sachin pointed out, in a tone which suggested admiration.         
	Of course, awful shots (from Sehwag and Dinesh Karthik, for example) and indecision from Yuvraj Singh helped Bangladesh in no small manner.         
	Rahul Dravid, however, fell to a superb yorker from Shahadat Hossain, while V.V.S.Laxman was quite unlucky, as Sachin put it.         
	Shakib, who bowled 25 overs unchanged, and Shahadat each picked up four wickets. With both in control, at one point, India had been six down for as little as 150.         
	No wickets were lost in the opening session, which began 90 minutes late owing to fog and insufficient light, but Bangladesh claimed six in the period between lunch and tea.         
	For now, at least, Sehwag has been taught a lesson.         
	Shakibs response, by the way, was mature when asked if Sehwags comment had fired up his team. No... We didnt really discuss it... We wanted to bowl a good line and length and succeeded... Its for you (the media) to judge whether were an ordinary side...         
	Point made, tellingly.         
	Footnote: There were shouts of go back directed at Team India, from the stands, all because of Sehwag.

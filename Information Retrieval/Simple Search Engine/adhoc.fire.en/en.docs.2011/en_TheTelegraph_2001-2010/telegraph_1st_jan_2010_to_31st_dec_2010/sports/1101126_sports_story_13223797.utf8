	Mumbai: Mumbai seized the early initiative as they reduced Assam to 81 for three in the rain-curtailed Ranji Trophy Super League match, on Thursday.         
	After the visitors successfully negotiated the new ball on a damp wicket, all-rounder Abhishek Nayar (2/17) struck twice in the space of seven balls to justify Wasim Jaffers decision to bowl. After no play was possible on the first day, the second days play started only after tea.         
	Ajit Agarkar and Dhawal Kulkarni bowled a tidy opening spell but with the ball coming slow off the pitch, taking wickets wasnt easy.

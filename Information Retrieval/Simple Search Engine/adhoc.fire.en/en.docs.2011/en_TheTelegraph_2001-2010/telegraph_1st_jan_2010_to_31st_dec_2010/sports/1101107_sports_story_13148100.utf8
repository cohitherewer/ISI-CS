The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag hope to burn brightly against JCT
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag hope to burn brightly against JCT
  - Durand Cup City team win away from maiden title triumph       JAYDEEP BASU                                            Chirag defender Chika Wali       
	New Delhi: The Durand Cup final, at the Ambedkar Stadium on Sunday, will be a battle of unknowns.         
	Neither Chirag United nor JCT boast of any big name in their ranks and are mainly dependent on a bunch of juniors.         
	Only one player  Daljit Singh of JCT  has the experience of playing the Durand final before.         
	Considered one of the senior most footballers in the circuit, Daljit won the cup for JCT in 1996 before ending up on the losing side against Dempo in 2006.         
	JCT are five-time winners of the Durand Cup while Chirag are hoping to become the first Calcutta team after East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting to win the coveted trophy.         
	Yet, the final is expected to be a close contest as both the teams have tight defence and like to concentrate on counter attacks. So well knit is their back-four that Chirag are yet to concede a goal and JCT allowed just one, in the group league against Garhwal Heroes.         
	Foreign recruit Chika Wali is definitely the leading force in Chirag defence. He played exceptionally well in the crucial game against East Bengal and covered a big area against Pune FC. JCT, too, have a foreign defender in Omolaja Kareem but Rahul Kumar and Daljit Singh are also playing their parts with perfection. To add to it, goalkeeper Pawan Kumar proved exceptional in the semi-final against Churchill Brothers.         
	Like most other Indian teams, the attacking departments of Chirag and JCT are led by foreigners. If Joshimar is Chirags trump card, Bidemi Daniel would be the man to watch out for in the Phagwara team.         
	Standing on the brink of history, Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya said his boys have a chance to become the stars of the future. I am not trying to predict the result but we can beat this JCT team. No one should underestimate players like (Mohammed) Rafique or Asif (K). They have the ability to become big players.         
	Bhattacharya was right. In 1975, two rookie players, who answered to the names of Subroto Bhattacharya and Prasun Banerjee, became stars almost overnight in their first season with Mohun Bagan when they guided their depleted side to a historic Durand Cup triumph with memorable wins over East Bengal and JCT.             road to final      
	Chirag United  Group league: Drew Pune FC 0-0; Bt Indian Air Force 5-0. 
  Semi-final: Bt East Bengal 1-0.  
	 JCT  Group league: Bt Sporting Clube de Goa 3-0; Bt Garhwal Heroes 2-1;
  Semi-final: Bt Churchill 1-0 (extra time).      
	The present JCT coach Parminder Singh is a staunch believer in team game and has no love for the star system.         
	Previously, JCT had lot of stars but equal contribution from other players made it possible to win matches.         
	There are five players in the present team, who played Santosh Trophy final for Punjab in Calcutta recently. They know what a final match is all about and will play accordingly.         
	None of the two coaches has any injury worry but Chirag goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal is running slight temperature. He did not practice on Saturday but is expected to be fit for the final.         
	The kick-off is at 5.30 p.m.         
	Likely teams         
	Chirag United: Abhijit Mondal; Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, Chika Wali, Justine Stephen and Narugopal Hait; Mohammed Rafique, Denson Devadas, Subhas Chakraborty and Gauranga Biswas; Joshimar and Asif K.         
	JCT: Pawan Kumar; Daljit Singh, Rahul Kumar, Omolaja Kareem and Lal Chhuanmawia; Amandeep Singh, Parveen Kumar, Randeep Singh and Maninder Singh; Bidemi Daniel and Baoru Keke Ibrahim.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis pulls out on CSA advice
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kallis pulls out on CSA advice
                      
	Johannesburg: Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder Jacques Kallis was withdrawn from the Champions League Twenty20 on Tuesday after advice from Cricket South Africa (CSA).         
	Kallis had a neck injury and would play no further part in the tournament, RCB said.         
	Kallis is carrying a neck injury that has affected his lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.         
	As a result, Cricket South Africas medical team have advised him (to) rest to recover for the countrys upcoming international commitments, RCB said.         
	The IPL team said a replacement would be announced soon, possibly England batsman Kevin Pietersen.         
	Bangalore tried to include Pietersen before the tournament when he was dropped for Englands limited-overs series against Pakistan, but ran out of time.         
	Pietersen is due in South Africa early next month to play two domestic four-day games to prepare for the Ashes.         
	Kallis starred for RCB in their first game at the Champions League, taking three for 16 and scoring 43 not out to earn the man of the match award in a one-sided win over Guyana.         
	A back injury ruled him out of the second match, where RCB lost to South Australia, and he played a subdued role in the loss to Mumbai Indians on Sunday.           (AGENCIES)

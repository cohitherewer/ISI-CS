The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowling changes worked: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bowling changes worked: Sourav
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly was satisfied that the bowling changes worked well in the last 10 overs against the Deccan Chargers on Friday. His opposite number, Adam Gilchrist, was disappointed that his boys didnt play smart cricket.               
	The following are excerpts               
	SOURAV GANGULY: The bowling changes worked in our favour. We bowled pretty ordinarily in the first 10 overs but did well in the last 10. However, there is room for improvement. Especially in fielding, where we dropped Adam (Gilchrist) twice. We also need to work on our top-order batting.         
	When we lost four wickets cheaply, the message from the dressing room to Owais (Shah) was to play full 20 overs as Angelo (Mathews) was playing his shots at the other end. Basically, we wanted one end to be tied up. They (Angelo and Owais) batted extremely well and we got 160.         
	While bowling, we needed wickets. This wasnt a wicket where you could hit through the line due to spongy bounce. So, once the asking rate is around eight or nine, it becomes difficult. This is the character of the Bombay wickets as its red soil Now, after winning the first match, we will take one game at a time.         
	ADAM GILCHRIST: We were in the box seat. We had great starts with both bat and ball. However, we couldnt finish it off. We panicked a little bit towards the end. It wasnt smart cricket from our side 162 was definitely achievable but our shot selection was poor. We didnt make full use of the chances that KKR presented us.         
	Full credit to them as they never gave up. They played with the right spirit. They were on the back foot for the most of the night but showed character. Last year too they did that but in 50/50 situations didnt do so well. Today they hung in there. They were intelligent in using the ball late in the innings. They outplayed us in big moments.         
	They consolidated without panicking, and then bowled really well. Whereas they scored in boundaries towards the end, we couldnt. They didnt give us much room, bowled in the right areas. It was poor batting by us and clever bowling by them. I believe there is a lot of room for improvement. This is only the first match. There is still a long way to go.

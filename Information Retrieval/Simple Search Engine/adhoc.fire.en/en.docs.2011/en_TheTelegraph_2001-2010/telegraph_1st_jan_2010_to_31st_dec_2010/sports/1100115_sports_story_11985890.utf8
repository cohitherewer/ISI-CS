	Mumbai: The Bombay High Court, on Thursday, set January 28 as the date for further hearing of a Public Interest Litigation case against the renovation of the Wankhede Stadium.         
	Thursdays hearing witnessed the defence counsel, Additional Solicitor General DJ Khambata, arguing that the central government had the powers to give clearance for revamping of the stadium, which falls in the coastal regulation zone.         
	Khambata, however, seemed to be caught in a fix when the judges, Justice F.I. Rebello and Justice J.H. Bhatia, wanted to know whether a separate proposal from the stadium authorities was submitted to get clearance from the environmental authorities and whether an impact assessment report was prepared.         
	The ASG then pointed out that for the kind of project under consideration, an environmental assessment report was not required.         
	The Wankhede Stadium is scheduled to host matches during the 2011 World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawson fears bleak future for Aamer
                                                                                                                       7                                        Lawson fears bleak future for Aamer
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Geoff Lawson                           
	Mumbai: Former Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson fears a bleak future for tainted teenager Mohammed Aamer. I dont how he will be able to handle if he is given a tough punishment. I dont know what he will do, how he will exist in the next five years (if handed a five-year ban), Lawson said, here, on Tuesday         
	Cricket in the subcontinent has a lot of talented youngsters coming from the villages. What will a guy like him do in such circumstances?         
	Lawson, who coached Pakistan for three years after the tragic death of Bob Woolmer, refused to make a direct comment on the spot-fixing scandal. He also refused to comment when asked whether Aamer, because of his young age, deserved leniency, as suggested former England captain Mike Atherton.         
	He deserves sympathy and empathy, and there is already a lot of sympathy for him. But personally, I dont know him, was all that the 52-year-old Australian would say.         
	Lawson, who is rumoured to be in India to negotiate a coaching role with the Kochi IPL franchise, strongly believed cricket would be less affected by the scandal. Cricket is a very resilient sport. What is needed urgently is a tough, hard series of Test cricket. And the game will move on, said the former New South Wales player.         
	He said Indias upcoming series against Australia and the Ashes would provide the right opportunity for the players to bring the fans back to the game. This Australia-India series is very important. People in Australia are already looking forward to the Ashes. A good, tough and hard series before the Ashes will do a lot to regain peoples faith in the game, he said.         
	Australia were originally scheduled to play an all-ODI series but the itinerary was changed to make it two Tests and three one-day Internationals. Lawson welcomed the change and said it would be a good preparation before the Ashes for Ricky Ponting and Company.

	New York: Kim Clijsters put a quick end to Ana Ivanovics run at the US Open, winning her 18th straight match at Flushing Meadows with a 6-2, 6-1 wipeout of the former No. 1 in their fourth-round match Sunday.         
	Twice champion Venus Williams came through a testing match to beat Israels Shahar Peer 7-6, 6-3 and reach the quarter-finals .         
	Williams struggled with her own serve in the blustery conditions and that of her opponent, the tournaments 16th seed.         
	The American third seed, bidding for an eighth Grand Slam title, had plenty of opportunities to break in the first set but converted just two of 10 break-point chances as it went to a tiebreak.         
	There the power of Williamsground strokes proved too much for Peer, who remained an obdurate opponent in the next set, which the American won with greater ease.         
	Ivanovic, who fell to as low as No. 65 after a couple of injury-plagued years, is back to No. 40 and was trying to move higher. She won three matches at the US Open and was getting her biggest test  and opportunity  against the second-seeded defending champion. It wasnt much of a contest.         
	After regaining an early break to pull to within 3-2 in the first, Ivanovic got overpowered, losing seven straight games to turn the match into a rout. Clijsters, moving as well as anyone in the tournament, used heavy, deep groundstrokes to pressure Ivanovic into 28 unforced errors. She fought through the wind, which blew hard across the Billie Jean King tennis center for the second straight day.         
	Trailing 4-1 in the second set, Ivanovic served a game that went seven deuces, but double-faulted to end the game. Eight points later, the match was over. It lasted 59 minutes.         
	Also winning Sunday was No. 6 Francesca Schiavone, 6-3, 6-0 over 20th-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.         
	Schiavone won in straight sets for the fourth consecutive match, beating 20th-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to advance to quarter finals.         
	The sixth-seeded Italian won 6-3, 6-0 to reach the last-eight stage for the first time since 2003.         
	Pavlyuchenkova, who needed medical attention on her right arm, was in the fourth round at a Grand Slam for the first time.         
	On, Saturday, the man for all occasions, Roger Federer provided a masterful demonstration of skill and precision in gale-force winds to breeze into the fourth round.         
	On a day when the swirling gusts teased and tormented the worlds best players, the Swiss master showed exactly how and why he has been able to overcome the obstacles to win 16 Grand Slam titles on all surfaces and conditions in beating Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.         
	I kind of felt comfortable, Federer said. I knew what I could do and what I couldnt do.         
	Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki also blew their opponents off the court to set up a dream fourth-round meeting at a championship bereft of surprises but bubbling towards a grand finish next week.         
	Sharapova was aced by American teenager Beatrice Capra when taking an undignified swing at a ball swept out of her reach by a gust of wind.         
	Wozniacki was gifted a winner after a seemingly harmless forehand bounced over the head of Chan Yung-Jan and into the stands.         
	Serving was a lottery as players were often forced to re-toss, while umbrellas, towels and litter blew around the court and forced several points to be replayed.         
	In the first round of the mixed doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi and his Slovakian partner Daniela Hantuchova lost 2-6, 4-6 to Estonian Kaia Kanepi and Robert Lindstedt of Sweden.         
	For most of the top players, the wild weather made no difference to their results and Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling joined Federer, Sharapova and Wozniacki by winning in straight sets.         
	The lone major casualty was Serbias Jelena Jankovic, a finalist in New York two years ago and the fourth seed this time.         
	She was beaten 2-6, 6-7 by Kaia Kanepi of Estonia after enduring the worst of the conditions.         
	On one of her serves, Jankovic only managed to catch the ball with the frame of her racket.

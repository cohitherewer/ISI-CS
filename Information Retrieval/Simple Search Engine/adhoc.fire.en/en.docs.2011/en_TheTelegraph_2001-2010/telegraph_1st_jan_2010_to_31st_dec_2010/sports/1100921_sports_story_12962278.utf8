	Chandigarh: Saurashtra batsman Cheteshwar Pujara Monday said the selection for the two-Test series against Australia did not come as a surprise but it was a dream-come-true moment of his career.         
	Its a dream-come-true for any cricketer. I was expecting the call after my recent performances. I am really happy at my selection, said Pujara, who is currently playing in a tournament here.         
	Pujara made his way into the Indian Test squad in place of out-of-form Yuvraj Singh, who was dropped from the two-Test series starting October 1, in Mohali because of his poor form and fitness.         
	Pujara, the lone new face in the team announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India selection committee in Chennai, said making his debut against Australia, would be great challenge.         
	Its going to be a challenge. They (Australia) have been the worlds best team for years. I will try to deliver my best, he said.         
	Pujara has been a prolific run-getter in the domestic circuit and also for India A in the last couple of seasons.         
	I owe it to my parents and want to thank them, especially my father, who is my coach... It was my mothers dream that I play for India and after getting selected in the national side I am delighted to fulfil my mothers desire, he said.         
	The right-hander said that he would like to fine-tune his skills and learn more tricks of the game from his seniors in the national team during the Australia series.         
	I will try to deliver my best and perform according to the best of my ability and to my teams requirement, Pujara said.         
	Australias scheduled to play a three-day practice match against the Board Presidents XI here followed by the opening Test to be played at Mohali from October 1.           (PTI)

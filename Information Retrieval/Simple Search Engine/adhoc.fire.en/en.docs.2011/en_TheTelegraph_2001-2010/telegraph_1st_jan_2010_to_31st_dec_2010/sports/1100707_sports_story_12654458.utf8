	Uruguay striker Diego Forlan has ruled out ever returning to the Premier League, although he insists he has fond memories of his time with Manchester United.         
	Forlan, was an integral part of the Atletico Madrid side that won the Europa League, scoring a vital goal against Liverpool in the semi-final before his late strike secured the trophy for the Spanish side in the final against Fulham.         
	However, he endured a turbulent two-and-half-year period in England, when he took 27 games to score for Manchester United, and he left for Villarreal in August 2004.         
	Now Forlan maintains he will never return to play in England despite being linked with Tottenham.         
	He said: Tottenham are a club who are going in the right direction but I have no interest in joining the Premier League with any club. For a start, Spain is much hotter and also it is my home now. We have some very exciting young players and I am excited for the season.         
	I will never play in England again but I still actually look back with fond memories at some moments.         
	Of his time at Old Trafford, Forlan believes he could have struck up a good partnership with Wayne Rooney, who arrived at the club when Forlan departed.         
	I was very young at Manchester United and I feel that I was just starting to find my feet when I was sold and Rooney was brought in. If we had been paired together, I think we could have formed the most devastating strike partnership in Europe but it wasnt to be.

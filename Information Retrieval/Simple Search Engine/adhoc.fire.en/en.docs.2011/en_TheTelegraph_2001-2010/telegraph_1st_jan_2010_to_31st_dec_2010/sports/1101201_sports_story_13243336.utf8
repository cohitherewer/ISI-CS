The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mary Kom stumped by Games tactics
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mary Kom stumped by Games tactics
                      
	New Delhi: Adjusting to a higher weight category was no big deal for M C Mary Kom, but what stumped the five-time world champion Indian woman boxer at the Asian Games was the never-seen-before fouls and she plans to take tips from Suranjoy Singh to deal with them in future.         
	The 27-year-old fought in the 51kg category, one of the three divisions in womens boxing that were included in the Games roster after getting the Olympic nod  a significant jump from the 46kg and 48kg divisions she had been competing in previously.         
	Adjusting to the weight was not at all a problem... What took me by surprise were the tactics. My opponents would hold me and then use the shoulder to hit me on the chin, something that would escape the referees eye. But when I would try to break free, it would seem that I am using my elbow to hit them and the referee would caution me, she said, adding, I lost stamina while dealing with these tactics and that reflected.         
	To deal with the new defensive tactics, Mary Kom plans to take a few tips from star male boxer and fellow Manipuri Suranjoy, who incidentally also returned with a bronze from the Asian Games, his first since 2009.         
	Even before the semi-final bout, Suranjoy had taught me a few tricks to deal with holding and clinching in the ring, but what I actually saw and experienced took me by surprise. I will take tips from him and learn to deal with these tactics better, she said.

	New Delhi: Suspended IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi Wednesday lost his cool when surrounded by the media at the Delhi airport.         
	Modi arrived in the capital on Wednesday morning. With television microphones surrounding him, Modi merely stated, nothing, nothing at first before losing his cool. Why arent you letting me reach my car? Why are you blocking me? Cant you be gentlemen? he fumed before being escorted to his car by his bodyguards.         
	There was speculation that he was exploring legal options and had met eminent lawyers Harish Salve and Ram Jethmalani during the day.         
	Neither Modi nor Salve were willing to divulge anything. I have nothing to say now. Nothing... You may wait outside my hotel room, but I am not going to say anything, Modi, who seemed quite annoyed by the media presence, said.

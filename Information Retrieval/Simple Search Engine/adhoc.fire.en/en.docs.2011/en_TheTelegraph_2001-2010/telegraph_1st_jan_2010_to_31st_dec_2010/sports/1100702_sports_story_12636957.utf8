The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bindra to stay in ICC post 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bindra to stay in ICC post 
  Former BCCI chief to skip SGM
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Bindra                           
	Calcutta: Inderjit Singh Bindra, a former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), is understood to have accepted the offer to continue as principal advisor to the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	Bindras two-year contract ended with the conclusion of the ICCs annual conference week, in Singapore, on Thursday, and the fresh offer (for another two years) came from the new chief, Sharad Pawar, also a former president of the BCCI.         
	Term No.2 of Bindra will, therefore, run concurrently with that of Pawar at the helm.         
	Its worth noting that Bindra had been an active behind-the-scenes player when Pawar, a senior member of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs government, became the ICC vice-president, two years ago.         
	From what I know, only the terms and conditions have to be negotiated afresh... That may take a fortnight or so... Last time, when the offer came from (David) Morgan, Bindra took almost a month before signing on the dotted line, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Bindra himself wasnt available for comment.         
	Few anywhere in cricket have Bindras experience and the ICC is using his expertise to drive the sport in areas such as the US and China. Of course, Bindras friend-turned-foe Jagmohan Dalmiya had started focusing on China during his years (1997-2000) as the ICC chief.         
	Significantly, the BCCI, which is gunning for Lalit Kumar Modi from all sides, hasnt objected to Bindra being offered a fresh contract. It could have, as hes known to be close to the suspended Indian Premier League chairman and commissioner.         
	In fact, within days of Modis suspension, in the early hours of April 26, Bindra had called for a fair trial.         
	Bindra, by the way, wont be representing the Punjab Cricket Association (of which hes the president) during Saturdays Modi-specific Special General Meeting of the BCCI, in Mumbai.         
	Mohinder Pandove, the BCCI treasurer, will be Punjabs man.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but one learnt that Bindra has commitments to keep in Dubai, where the ICC is headquartered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murithala gives credit to Booth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murithala gives credit to Booth
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Nigerian striker Subair Murithala Ali does not hold any grudge against Calcutta and is happy to return to the City of Joy where he would be donning the Mohun Bagan jersey next season.         
	Murithala, 26, was released by Chirag United following an ordinary season in 2008-09. One year later, the tall striker would be back with a bang, forming a lethal combination with Brazilian Jose Barreto and another Nigerian, Chidi Edeh.         
	At Chirag I was the only foreign striker. Its difficult to show ones quality in such a situation. I cannot blame them for not keeping me but they have seen me at Mahindra (United) this year and know what I am capable of, Ali told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Murithala, the second highest scorer in the I-League with 16 goals with one match remaining, gave credit to Mahindra coach, Englishman David Booth, for bringing the best out of him. The coach, played me in a good formation. He conditioned my game, he said.         
	Murithala was looking forward to play with Barreto and Edeh. Of course, many European clubs play three strikers. But it will depend on the coach. For me, it will be no problem. If we all three can work together, it would make for great, attractive football, he said.         
	Other players might resent the ultra-competitive nature of the Calcutta system, but not Murithala.         
	Its the only place where you get huge crowds. There is a lot of criticism but there can also be great support from the fans for the players. You know you cannot relax at any time, so you are always working hard and hard and hard, and that makes you better, he said.         
	Murithala was also positive as he compared Calcutta and Goa as football bases.         
	In Goa, the rains dont disturb the pitch, which makes for good football. In Calcutta, everybody wants to be the best, to be in top class. Its very good because when you are fighting for yourself, the team also improves, he said.

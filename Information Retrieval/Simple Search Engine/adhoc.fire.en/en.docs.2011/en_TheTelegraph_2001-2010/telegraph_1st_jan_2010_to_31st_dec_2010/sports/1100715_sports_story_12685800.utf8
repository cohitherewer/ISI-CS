            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Legendary former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, became the fourth Pakistani cricketer, to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame at Lords, on Wednesday.         
	According to an ICC media release, the former captain received his commemorative cap from ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat, who was accompanied by PCB chairman Ijaz Butt, Cricket Australia chairman Jack Clarke and the MCC President John Barclay.         
	Imran joined Hanif Mohammed, Javed Miandad and Wasim Akram as Pakistans fourth representative in the initial intake of 55 players into the Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony was held during lunch break of the first Test match between Pakistan and Australia.         
	I achieved many things during my cricketing career, including winning the World Cup in 1992 but to be named amongst the initial 55 inductees, alongside Hanif and Javed makes me very proud, Imran said after receiving his cap.

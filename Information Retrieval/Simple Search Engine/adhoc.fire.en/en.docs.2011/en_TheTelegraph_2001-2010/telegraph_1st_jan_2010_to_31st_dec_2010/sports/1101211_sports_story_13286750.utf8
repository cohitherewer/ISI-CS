The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SGM to decide on new probe panel today 
                                                                                                                       7                                      SGM to decide on new probe panel today 
                      
	Mumbai: The BCCI has convened a Special General Meeting Saturday to reconstitute the disciplinary panel probing charges of financial irregularities against former IPL chairman Lalit Modi.         
	Its (SGM) with regard to the technical point raised by Lalit Modis counsel. Its a minor thing, BCCI secretary and president-elect N Srinivasan said.         
	Modis counsel, Mehmood Abdi, had pointed out last month that the three-member disciplinary panel (Chirayu Amin, Arun Jaitley and Jyotiraditya Scindia) did not have the BCCI General Bodys mandate.         
	Abdi said that BCCI has forgotten to re-constitute the committee for the year 2010-2011 at its AGM held in September.         
	We are in a peculiar situation as of today. As per 1(Q) of BCCI by-laws various committees have to be freshly constituted.         
	In its AGM, they did not form a fresh disciplinary committee, Abdi had said on November 22.         
	Modis camp had consistently opposed the nomination of Amin and Jaitley, citing bias.         
	It would be interesting to see whether the Boards SGM nominates the same trio as the new panels members.           (PTI)

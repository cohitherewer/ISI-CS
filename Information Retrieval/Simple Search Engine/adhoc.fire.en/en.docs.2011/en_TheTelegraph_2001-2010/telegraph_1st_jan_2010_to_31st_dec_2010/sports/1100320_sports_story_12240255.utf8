The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mongoose gives a lot of power: Hayden
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mongoose gives a lot of power: Hayden
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mathew Haydens Mongoose bat, which the Chennai Super Kings opener used on Friday to hammer the Delhi bowlers all over the ground, was the topic of discussion at the Kotla.         
	The bat certainly did a lot of magic as was evident during Haydens smashing knock of 93 off 43 deliveries against the Delhi DareDevils.         
	On Friday, the Australian batsman opted for the bat after 3.1 overs. He was batting on 19 at that time. In the fifth over, he hit Rajat Bhatia for three fours and one six and then slammed Tillekaratne Dilshan for three sixes in the eighth over. In all, he hit six fours and seven sixes in the next 35 deliveries with the bat.         
	It is always good to try out new products, said Hayden later. The Mongoose bat is a good product as its gives you lot of power to hit the ball a long way. It is very much like a normal bat, but surely gives a great deal of power to a batsman, he said.         
	The Chennai Super Kings stand-in captain, Suresh Raina said: Hayden knows how to play with that bat, he practised two hours with it. I tried it for a while but it didnt really suit me.         
	But then, Hayden was really great today (Friday). He was too good It was mainly because of him that I could begin my captaincy with a victory, said Raina.         
	Raina said it was necessary for him to use five bowlers in the first five overs. When Sehwag is batting, you have to do it, he said.         
	The Delhi DareDevils stand-in captain Dinesh Karthik was obviously disappointed by the defeat but refuted suggestions that Dilshan and AB de Villiers had failed completely.         
	We have seen what they (De Villiers and Dilshan) can do in T20 cricket. They are top players in the world. Not everyday you can play the same way, said Karthik.         
	On Haydens Mongoose bat, the Delhi DareDevils skipper said the bat did not make much of a difference. He plays the same way. He is too good a batsman and has the ability to score anytime.         
	We have a couple of areas to work on. I think we lost quite a lot of wickets in the middle.         
	I mean, once a batsman gets out, he is followed by two or more batsmen. We have to stop this thing so that we can push the run rate higher in the end in the coming matches, Karthik said after the DareDevils lost their second consecutive match at home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi does the trick
                                                                                                                       7                                        Messi does the trick
    - Striker scores second hattrick on the trot in 4-2 win                 Lionel Messi celebrates one of his goals, on Sunday                           
	Madrid: Lionel Messi Sunday netted a superb hattrick for Barcelona in their 4-2 away win at Real Zaragoza to keep them neck-and-neck with Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.         
	The Argentine forward headed the opener after only five minutes at the Romareda, and scored a stunning solo effort for the second in the 65th.         
	He won the ball in midfield, accelerated past one tackle, turned a defender twice in the area and then fired low into the corner.         
	He completed his second successive La Liga hattrick 12 minutes from time, before Zaragoza substitute Adrian Colunga grabbed two late goals for the visitors.         
	Once again it was Messi who steadied the ship, winning a penalty at the end which an out-of-sorts Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored to put the gloss on a tough encounter.         
	The champions moved on to 68 points from 27 games, level with Real who beat Sporting Gijon 3-1 on Saturday, but stayed second on goal difference.         
	Its a team effort. Everyone works hard and fights hard, Messi said after them match. I might be the one who scores the goals, but it is a result of everyones work.         
	Missing injured midfielder Xavi Hernandez and with Andres Iniesta on the bench, Barcelona still enjoyed the best first-half chances  Ibrahimovic headed a clear chance wide in the 30th and struggled on his return to the starting line-up.         
	Ibrahimovic then shot wide from two clear chances with only goalkeeper RobertoJimenez to beat. Soon after, Colunga scored twice on the break. But Messi again drove into the area, eluding several players, before Contini dragged him down for the penalty.         
	He needs goals after this tough streak hes been on, Messi said of the penalty from Ibrahimovic, who hadnt scored in the league since February 14.         
	Earlier, David Silva set up the first and scored the second as Valencia overcame a stubborn Almeria 2-0 to strengthen their hold on third place with 50 points.         
	They moved four points clear of Real Mallorca, who moved into Spains fourth Champions League qualification spot by crushing 10-man Atletico Madrid 4-1.         
	Improving Almeria were unbeaten in seven when they arrived at the Mestalla, and it took a clever turn and defence-splitting pass from Silva to set up Juan Mata for Valencias opener in the 63rd minute.         
	The Spain midfielder then grabbed the second soon after, scoring despite lying on the ground in the area after being tackled.         
	Cash-strapped Mallorca, who have won all but one of their home games this season, took the lead through Victor after only 10 minutes against Atletico but Diego Forlan levelled for the Kings Cup finalists in the 25th.         
	Aritz Aduriz restored Mallorcas advantage almost immediately and Atletico faded after midfielder Raul Garcia was sent off early in the second half.         
	Luis Perea sliced the ball into his own net at a corner and then Felipe Mattioni volleyed a spectacular fourth for the islanders in the last minute.         
	This win makes a point to all those rivals who thought off-field problems would take their toll on us, Mallorca coach Gregorio Manzano told reporters.         
	In Italy, a frustrated AC Milan missed the chance to seize top spot in Serie A when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Napoli at the San Siro on Sunday.         
	Faltering leaders Inter Milan drew 1-1 at Palermo on Saturday to give second-placed Milan a glimpse of the summit for the first time this term but instead they lie one point behind. Sampdoria climbed level on points with fourth-placed Palermo in the race for the final Champions League qualifying spot after the returning Antonio Cassano embarrassed Juventus reserve goalkeeper Antonio Chimenti from 40 metres in a 1-0 home win.         
	Napoli, who have slipped to seventh after a poor run, produced waves of attacks in the first half and went ahead thanks to a defensive error by Milans Massimo Oddo.         
	The right back collided with his own goalkeeper Christian Abbiati and left Napoli defender Hugo Campagnaro free to slot Ezequiel Lavezzis pass into an open goal on 13 minutes.         
	The day got immediately worse for Milan, already hampered by a string of injuries, when forward Alexandre Pato limped off on what was meant to be his comeback from a thigh problem.         
	Napoli could easily have doubled their advantage before Ronaldinho, celebrating his 30th birthday, revived Milan, as he has done so often this season, by floating over a cross which Filippo Inzaghi headed in for a 26th-minute equaliser.         
	Leonardos side pushed for a winner in the second-half but winger Mancini spurned the best chance as the Rossoneri again showed they can lack a clinical edge.           (REUTERS)

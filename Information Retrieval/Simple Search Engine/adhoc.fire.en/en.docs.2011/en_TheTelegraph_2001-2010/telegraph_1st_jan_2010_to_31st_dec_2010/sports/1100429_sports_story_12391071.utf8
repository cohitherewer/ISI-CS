                                                                                                                       7                                      Chetri rues lack of infrastructure
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sunil Chetris learning process has just begun. Only the third Indian to play professional soccer abroad, Chetri is slowly making the transition to life as a member of the Kansas City Wizards. He made his first official appearance for the club in the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup against the Colorado Rapids, but is yet to make his Major League Soccer (MLS) debut.         
	The striker said adapting to American climate was a problem for him when he landed in the United States but he had adjusted now. He also rued the lack of infrastructure back home.         
	I think initially when I came it was difficult because of the 12-hour gap and the cold climate. Now its quite a bit warmer. The only thing for me now is to settle down, and try to improve Chetri told the MLS website.         
	Chetri, the third Indian after Mohammed Salim and Bhaichung Bhutia to play professional football outside the country, hoped his joining KC Wizards would pave the way for other Indians to play abroad. For football to prosper, the infrastructure is not there (in India). I hope me coming to MLS is going to pave way for a lot of players to go abroad, he said.

	Mumbai: Rain played spoilsport in more than one Ranji Trophy Super League ties which were scheduled to begin on Wednesday.         
	The first days play of the Gujarat-Bengal match was called off without a ball being bowled due to rain.         
	The umpires  R.M. Deshpande and S.D. Ranade  inspected the ground four times in the day and decided to call off the days play at 4pm. The toss is yet to be held.         
	Gujarat have collected nine points from one win and two draws while Bengal are on five from three draws.         
	The opening days play in the Mumbai-Assam and the Delhi-Saurashtra ties, too, were washed off due to unseasonal rain.         
	In Mumbai, showers overnight and early morning rendered the outfield wet, causing the delay of the start. There was more rain and the sky remained overcast during the day, rendering a prompt start on Thursday doubtful as well.         
	In Chennai, rain affected the Tamil Nadu-Railways match, as only eight overs were possible on the first day. Put into bat, Tamil Nadu were 26 for one at the close of play, losing opener Anirudha Srikkanth (1) in the second over to medium pacer JP Yadav.         
	In Vadodara, J.A. Kolsawala and C. Williams shared an 80-run opening partnership as Baroda reached 94 for one against Punjab at stumps, on the first day of the match.         
	Kolsawala slammed six boundaries in his 129-ball innings to give Baroda a positive start after Punjab skipper Pankaj Dharmani won the toss and decided to field at the Moti Bagh Stadium.         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Bangalore: Orissa 191. Karnataka 18/2         
	 In Chennai: Tamil Nadu 26/1 (A. Mukund 19n.., JP Yadav 1/13) vs Railways         
	 In Kanpur: Uttar Pradesh 197. Himachal Pradesh 9/2         
	 In Vadodara: Baroda 94/1 (J. Kolsawala 43, CC Williams 33; MS Gony 1/23) vs Punjab         
	All matches to continue

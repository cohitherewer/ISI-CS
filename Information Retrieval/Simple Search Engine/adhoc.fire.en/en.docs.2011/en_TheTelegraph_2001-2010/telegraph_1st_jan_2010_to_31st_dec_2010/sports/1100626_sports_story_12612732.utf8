The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson: Lions under pressure 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ferguson: Lions under pressure 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Rustenburg: Sir Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, believes there is a terrible pressure on England players to perform in the World Cup but praised their terrific display against Slovenia and thinks they will trouble Germany in Sundays Round-of-16 game in Bloemfontein.         
	Stressing that Wayne Rooney was fully fit, Ferguson argued that some of Englands problems had been more to do with the weight of national expectation. The whole country was adamant they were going to win the Cup and thats a terrible pressure to take on for players, none of whom have really got to a latter stage of a World Cup, he said.         
	You have to go back to 1990 for the last time they were in a semi-final. They were unlucky to lose on penalty kicks to Germany. None of them have that experience of doing very well at a World Cup final. There are big, big expectations for these players and thats difficult to carry.         
	Germany are a young team and thats an advantage for England, added Ferguson, who was talking to Riviera Radios Rob Harrison yesterday while holidaying in Monaco. Germany had a fantastic start, beating Australia, but showed when they lost to Serbia they are not infallible. Last night they squeezed through. Theres nothing there that suggests it will be easier for Germany. Its a very difficult game.         
	Ferguson is experienced at picking up the pieces when his players are involved in World Cup fall-outs, notably David Beckham after France 98, and he was keeping an eye on Frances meltdown and particularly on Patrice Evra. Ive texted him, said Ferguson. Hes going for a bit of a holiday.         
	Ferguson has long believed that the World Cup winners will hail from South America and nothing he has seen has made him change his mind. That was my prediction: that a South American team would win it, particularly Brazil. I always said Paraguay were a big danger. They dont lose goals and have strength and pace.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Baghdatis is best
                                                                                                                       7                                      Baghdatis is best
                      
	Sydney: Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus overcame the distraction of a lengthy rain interruption to beat Frances Richard Gasquet 6-4, 7-6 in the final of the Sydney International on Saturday.         
	Baghdatis, who burst on to the world stage when he made the Australian Open final in 2006, regained his composure after a lapse in concentration to claim his fourth ATP title in the final lead-up event before the first Grand Slam of 2010.         
	The 24-year-old made a flying start at the Sydney Olympic tennis centre, breaking Gasquets opening service game then taking the first set, but lost his way after a 75-minute delay early in the second set.         
	Gasquet quickly established a 5-2 lead and served for the set but Baghdatis broke back and eventually sealed victory in the tiebreak.         
	I felt pretty good on court, Baghdatis said. (Ive) just won a tournament, confidence is up, feeling pretty fit... I think everything is positive.         
	I have some things to work on still... My serve, first serve percentage. I think thats all. Its the only thing that worries me a bit.         
	Baghdatis had been plagued with injuries over the past two seasons and was reduced to playing on the Challenger circuit last year.           (REUTERS)

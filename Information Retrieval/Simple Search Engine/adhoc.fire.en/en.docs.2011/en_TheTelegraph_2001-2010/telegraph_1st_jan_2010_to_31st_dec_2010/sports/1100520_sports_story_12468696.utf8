	Englands bid for glory at the World Cup will be hurt by the exhaustion of their players after a long season of fast-paced Premier League football, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said, in New York, on Tuesday.         
	The intensity of the English game is so great that it makes it more difficult for those players to perform well in the World Cup, Ferguson told reporters at a news conference promoting Manchester Uniteds four-game North American summer tour.         
	You have to say the number of games, particularly at our level, is exhausting. Every game Manchester United play is a Cup final. We have to win, and teams playing against us are motivated to play against Manchester United.         
	Ferguson said his players competing in the World Cup will be in urgent need of the 28 days of rest they are given before returning to training with United for next season.         
	They must have that or they wont feature next year, theyll just collapse. Exhaustion will get them, which makes it difficult for English players to perform well in the World Cup, he added.         
	Uniteds leading striker Wayne Rooney, who carries the weight of the nations expectations every time he pulls on an England shirt, struggled with injury towards the end of the season but Ferguson said he would be fit for the finals.         
	... if he wasnt (fit), there would probably be headlines all over the papers. Im sure hell be all right. Im sure hes OK.         
	Asked who would win the tournament in South Africa which starts on June 11 Ferguson went with the form books. My general view is that Brazil are very strong favourites with Spain following them, Ferguson said.         
	...I think that France will do better than people think. They are underdogs, which is not normal for them, and Italy will probably get to the semi-finals.         
	Meanwhile, in Graz, Austria, Joe Hart has been told he has an equal chance with David James and Robert Green of being first-choice goalkeeper.         
	Fabio Capello will inform all three of his goalkeepers that he has a completely open mind who he will choose to face the United States in Rustenburg on June 12.         
	James, at 39, would appear to have the experience and is favourite to be selected, although Green also had a run of games during the qualifying campaign and impressed Capello. However, the England manager is also mindful that Hart has had an outstanding season on loan at Birmingham City and is, arguably, the most in-form of the three.         
	Capello earmarked either Hart or Ben Foster  who is set to replace Hart at Birmingham  as the two strongest young goalkeepers when he took the job. Indeed, he had hoped that one of them would become his first-choice in time for the World Cup but Foster has struggled to get games for Manchester United and Hart had to leave Manchester City.         
	Although Hart, 23, has just one cap  he came on at half-time to replace James during the friendly against Trindad amp; Tobago in June 2008  he has been a regular in Capellos squad even though he has not played. He had hoped to start the March friendly against Egypt but Capello decided to stick with Green.         
	It means that if Hart were to be selected ahead of James or Green it would represent a surprise, given his lack of previous opportunities. England would also be the only nation going into the finals with a goalkeeper who, at most, can have three caps.         
	Capello only has the friendlies against Mexico  on Monday at Wembley  and Japan, the following Sunday in Graz, before he whittles down his 30-strong provisional squad to 23 and will consider whether to start Hart in either or both of those games. Given that he has only selected three goalkeepers it means, barring injury, that all three will go to South Africa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will advance despite loss: Cristiano
                                                                                                                       7                                      Will advance despite loss: Cristiano
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo said its not unexpected to suffer in the Champions League after a 1-0 loss at Lyon, leaving the Spanish team in danger of failing to advance from the first knockout stage for the sixth straight year.         
	The record nine-time European Cup champions were beaten by Jean Makouns goal at Stade Gerland on Tuesday.         
	In football, everything is possible, Ronaldo said Wednesday. In this competition you have to suffer, but Im sure well give a great response in the next game and well win it.         
	Ronaldo said playing the return leg at Santiago Bernabeu stadium on March 10 will provide a boost. The team has won all but one of their 15 home games this season  a 3-2 group-stage defeat to AC Milan.         
	Well have to be ready from the first minute, the Portugal international said. The tie isnt lost. We need to show on our home ground that we can do it.         
	Us players are at fault, especially the 11 that were on the field, defender Alvaro Arbeloa said. (Agencies)

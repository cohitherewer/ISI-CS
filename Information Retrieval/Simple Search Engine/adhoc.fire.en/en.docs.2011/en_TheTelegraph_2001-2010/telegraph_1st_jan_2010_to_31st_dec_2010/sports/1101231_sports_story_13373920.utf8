                                                                                                                       7                                      Sehwag out of ODIs 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag has been ruled out of next months one-day series against South Africa due to a shoulder injury.         
	Sehwag will be replaced by Rohit Sharma for the five-match series, starting on January 12.         
	Virender Sehwag has been advised to withdraw from the ODI series against South Africa to tend to his shoulder, the BCCI said.         
	Murali Vijay will stay back in South Africa for the ODI series, as the 17th member.         
	The move seems to be more of a precautionary measure, keeping in mind the forthcoming World Cup, as he is still available for the third Test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina   to get Khel Ratna
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina   to get Khel Ratna
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Saina Nehwal                                 
	New Delhi: Star shuttler Saina Nehwal was selected for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, nations highest sporting honour, by a 15-member panel headed by former track-queen P.T. Usha, in the capital, on Friday.         
	The 20-year-old Hyderabad-based world No. 2 also became the youngest woman to receive the prestigious award that was constituted in 1991-92.         
	Sainas selection was made based on her string of impressive performances that saw her win the Indian Open Grand Prix, the Singapore Open Super Series and the Indonesian Open Super Series titles. She also reached semi-finals of All-England and bagged the Badminton Asia championships bronze medal.         
	Receiving the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna is definitely a great honour but it also brings in a lot of responsibility, Saina told The Telegraph. I have done well in international meets and the nation has acknowledged it. Now, it is my duty to win more laurels for the country.         
	The star shuttler said seeing her parents happy was her biggest pleasure. I know how my parents struggled to bring me at this level. If I am happy today, that is not because of the titles I have won, it is because I could live up to the faith that my parents had in me at the start of my career, said Saina.         
	According to a member of the selection panel, Saina was the unanimous choice for the Khel Ratna award. Last year there were lots of controversies after three sportspersons were jointly named for the award. This time we were strictly instructed to pick up only one But there was no objection from anyone when Sainas name came up for discussion, said the member.         
	Interestingly, it was not the Badminton Association of India that recommended the shuttlers name for the award. The move, it is believed, had been initiated by the ministry of sports itself which wanted to honour the athlete for rising to No.2 in the official badminton world rankings.         
	I am really happy, said Saina, who received the Arjuna award last year. Its unbelievable, a dream come true for me to get another (award) within a year.         
	National awards give you a lot of motivation and it definitely has inspired me to achieve bigger glories for my country.         
	The award committee, meanwhile, has selected national captain and Bengal woman cricketer Jhulan Goswami for the Arjuna award. Footballer Deepak Mondal has also been named among the list of Arjuna awardees.

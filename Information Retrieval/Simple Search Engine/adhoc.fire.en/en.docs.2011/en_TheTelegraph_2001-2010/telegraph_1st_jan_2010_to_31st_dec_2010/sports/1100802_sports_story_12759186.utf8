                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI-Modi stalemate continues
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The disciplinary committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which met here on Sunday to probe into the alleged financial irregularities against Lalit Modi, reserved its order on the suspended Indian Premier League commissioners application for recusal of two members of the committee.         
	The three-member disciplinary panel, comprising Chirayu Amin, Arun Jaitley and Jyotiraditya Scindia, heard both the parties, but did not pass any order immediately.         
	We reserve our orders on the recusal application. Both parties would be informed of the order as soon as it is pronounced, said the disciplinary committee in a press release.         
	At the second hearing of the disciplinary committee here last Tuesday, Modis lawyers pressed for the inclusion of a retired Supreme Court judge and recusal of two members  Amin and Jaitely  from the disciplinary panel.         
	The release also said that at the start of the meeting, Modis lawyer, Venkatesh Dhond brought to the notice of the BCCI a certain document (regarding granting extension to WSG Mauritius) dated March 17, 2009 in which certain corrections were made by Dhond himself.         
	Dhond wanted to know whether these documents would be relied to say at some point of time and whether he would be required to be present as a witness and whether BCCI has any objection to him appearing for Modi in these proceedings, the release added.         
	BCCI said it did not intend to call Dhond as a witness in this case since he had admitted the document had been written by him.

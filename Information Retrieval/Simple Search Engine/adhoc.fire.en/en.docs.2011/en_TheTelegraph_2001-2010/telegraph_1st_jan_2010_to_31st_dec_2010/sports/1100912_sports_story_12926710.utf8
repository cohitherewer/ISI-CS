The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapur hits two-under
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kapur hits two-under
                      
	Hilversum: Shiv Kapur put himself in contention for his maiden European Tour title after jumping into joint lead with a steady two-under 68 in the second round of the KLM Open golf tournament here.         
	Overnight joint third, Kapur slotted in three birdies against a lone bogey in a fine performance to total eight-under 132 and share the lead with Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts (70).         
	I thought I played quite well yesterday (Friday) and was keen to bring this form into today(Saturday)s play. I started slowly with pars on the first seven holes and constantly improved from there. If I can carry this form into the next two days then I will be in a good position for a strong finish, Kapur said after the round.         
	Kapurs only professional triumph has come at the 2005 Volvo Masters of Asia. The Delhi-pro has been in good form after the mid-season break and was leading at one stage in the Czech Open which took place last month.         
	Among other Indians, Jeev Milkha Singh was tied for the sixth spot after returning a brilliant five-under 65, which included six birdies against a bogey, in the second round. Jeevs overall total stood at six-under 134.         
	However, it was curtains for Jyoti Randhawa, who missed the cut despite an improved card of two-under 68, which comprised four birdies and two bogeys.         
	Randhawa, who turned in a 74 in the opening round, finished with a total of two-over 142. (PTI)

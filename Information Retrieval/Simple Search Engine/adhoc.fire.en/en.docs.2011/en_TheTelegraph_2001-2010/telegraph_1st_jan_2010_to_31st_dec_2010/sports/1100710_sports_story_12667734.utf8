The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Success is in playing wide
                                                                                                                       7                                      Success is in playing wide
            Henry Winter                      
	Those with most thunder in their boots are five-goal men such as Spains David Villa and Hollands Wesley Sneijder, who grace the World Cup final and highlight a theme of the tournament, of danger flowing from those lurking out wide and behind the front man.         
	Centre forwards have found the mark, four-goal strikers such as Miroslav Klose, Diego Forlan (although often deeper-lying) and Slovakias Robert Vittek.         
	However, the presence of Germanys right-sided Thomas Mueller as the other attacker on four goals confirms that much damage is inflicted from out wide.         
	In all the games we have played we have had more space on the sides, reflected Dirk Kuyt, who operates on the left for Holland. The players on the wings have scored the goals.         
	Even Landon Donovan, of the United States, has chipped in with three. Other wide men, such as Lukas Podolski and Arjen Robben, have hit two apiece.         
	Luis Fabiano recorded three through the middle, but this has not been the World Cup of the rampant centre forward. Premier League stars such as Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Fernando Torres have managed one between them.         
	It is very difficult, continued Kuyt. Teams are well organised. Everyone knows Van Persie, Rooney and Torres. But everyone is struggling.         
	If you see Villa, he is playing on the left and cutting inside and scoring a lot of goals. It looks like it is easier for players on the side to create chances and score.         
	With Torres dropped by Spain for the World Cup semi-final against Germany, Villa played through the middle but failed to score. For Holland, Van Persie has borne his lone-striker role willingly, allowing Sneijder in particular to plunder the spoils.         
	Robin is a quality player, Kuyt said. We saw some things against Uruguay, but in this World Cup it is very difficult for strikers to score goals, get some space and create chances.         
	But one thing Robin does is work really hard. He is a team player. It is just difficult to create chances. People expected him to score five or six goals. He hasnt done that but the way he is playing he is still very important for us.         
	Especially for Sneijder, whose sustained prominence this season with Inter Milan and Holland has inevitably stirred talk of a move to clubs such as Manchester United. I have a very good feeling at Inter and I dont want to let them down after winning everything and losing Jose Mourinho, Sneijder said.         
	My goal is to be as successful this year with the new coach (Rafael Benitez). Im not surprised by the interest because Ive been playing well but my intention is to stay at Inter. I want to talk with them later this month about extending my contract. Inters president, Massimo Moratti, has invited Sneijder in for a chat.         
	Under Benitez, Kuyt endured a disappointing time at Liverpool. It is really satisfying to end the season like this, said the Dutchman, anticipating the final, his 63rd game of the campaign.         
	It was a really long season at Liverpool and mentally it has been tough. You play for Liverpool to win trophies and it did not happen.         
	Kuyt has yet to speak to Benitezs successor, Roy Hodgson. I spoke to people at the club and I know he wants to speak with me, said Kuyt, who stressed he wanted to stay.         
	Of course. Liverpool is a great club with a great history. Unfortunately, in my four years I havent won anything with Liverpool. Hopefully, in the future I still have a chance to win something. Hopefully, the manager wants me to stay.         
	Kuyt then explained the new inner strength of Holland.         
	Dutch football is always very good. In every tournament we have played we have shown we have quality. In this tournament we have shown we have more than quality. We also have belief. We believe we can beat every opponent.         
	We have the patience to do it. Against Brazil we were 1-0 down but we still had the belief we could win. We were 1-0 up against Uruguay and they equalised. Sometimes, in tournaments that have gone before we have lost it at that point.         
	This time we stayed focused. We believed in our own quality. We kept our positions.         
	Kuyt stressed that Holland were not afraid of Villa and company.         
	You could see the Germans were afraid of Spain. They didnt try to attack. We are going to attack and then you will see weaknesses coming to the surface. If you play like the Germans you are definitely going to lose.         
	We dont have players who are afraid and we dont have players who feel small against the big opponents. There is respect but not fear.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

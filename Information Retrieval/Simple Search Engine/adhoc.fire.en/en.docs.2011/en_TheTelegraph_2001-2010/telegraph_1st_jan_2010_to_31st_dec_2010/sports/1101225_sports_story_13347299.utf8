The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An easy decision: Wright
                                                                                                                       7                                        An easy decision: Wright
                  John Wright                     
	Christchurch: His appointment as the coach of the New Zealand cricket team may have been sudden and unexpected, but former India coach John Wright says it was an easy decision to make in the end.         
	Wright, who coached the Indian cricket team from 2000 to 2005, said it would be a pretty demanding job to coach the New Zealand team.         
	I thought once Mark (Greatbatch) got the opportunity thats probably it. My appointment was very sudden and unexpected. But it wasnt that difficult a choice, said Wright, who got just 36 hours to take a decision after getting the unexpected call from the New Zealand Cricket.         
	To be honest a day into the job you think, given the track record of some of our coaches, its a pretty demanding task. You get a honeymoon period when people say nice things, and then you hope results go your way, he added.         
	Wright had his hands full with coaching offers following his stint with the Indian cricket team when he helped them to improve the sides overseas record, and also saw them reach the 2003 World Cup final.         
	However, the 56-year-old former opener, who retired in 1993, did not take up any job until he decided to coach New Zealand, who recently returned from a disastrous tour of India and Bangladesh.         
	When I finished in India I was pretty burnt out, Wright said.         
	I needed a spell (away from the game). I had quite a few offers in that period and there were a couple I thought a lot about, but they just werent right. Then I started working for New Zealand Cricket putting together a replacement structure for the academy, and a winter programme for our promising kids coming through the ranks, he said.         
	During their tour of Bangladesh and India, New Zealand lost 11 straight ODIs, including clean sweeps in Bangladesh and in India, which left their World Cup preparations in tatters.

	Chennai: Holding the BCCI responsible for the mess that the IPL is in today, former president A. C. Muthiah Tuesday demanded that all the officials having a stake in the IPL franchises should no more be a part of the Board.    
	Muthiah claims he had raised the issue of the BCCI insiders having commercial interests in the IPL but his suggestions were not heeded and instead rules were changed to help certain people.    
	I feel to a larger extent the members of the BCCI have failed in their responsibilities and they had consciously allowed themselves to be exploited by certain groups by amending the bye laws of the Society. BCCI should ensure all those who have some stake or interest either directly or indirectly should be kept away from BCCI, so that BCCI shall perform independently, Muthiah said in a statement.

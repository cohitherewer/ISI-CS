The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashwinis London dreams
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ashwinis London dreams
                      
	New Delhi: Indias new track sensation Ashwini Akkunji Friday rued lack of corporate sponsorship even after winning two gold medals in last months Asian Games, but still remains upbeat about a podium finish in the 2012 London Olympics.         
	Ashwini wants to become the first Indian woman athlete to win an individual gold in the Olympics but for that to happen she said she needs money to compete in the European circuit and top IAAF events.         
	I want to become the first Indian woman athlete to win gold in Olympics. I have switched on to 400m hurdles just six months ago and my timing is very good. I can only improve from here. With some improvement in my technique I think I can cut down my timing by another two seconds at least and that should put me in medal contention in London, Ashwini said.         
	I need to compete in the European circuit, in big events like Diamond League of the IAAF to improve upon my timing before the London Games. For that I need financial support but corporate sponsorship is not coming. I am looking for that, said Ashwini, who won gold in 400m hurdles and helped the 4x400m relay team to win yellow metal in China.         
	There is a bit of relief because Ashwini has been offered a Rs 15 lakh deal by Infinity Optimal Solutions (IOS). They have also asked her to become their brand ambassador.         
	The 23-year-old from Siddapura village of Udipi district in Karnataka is upbeat that she can cut down a few seconds from her 56.15 effort in Guangzhou by reducing the number of strides between the hurdles and using both the legs to clear them.         
	Ashwinis leading leg to clear hurdles has been the left one since she first ran in a 400m hurdles in Kochi in May and she will work out along with her coaches to use right leg also to cut down her timing.

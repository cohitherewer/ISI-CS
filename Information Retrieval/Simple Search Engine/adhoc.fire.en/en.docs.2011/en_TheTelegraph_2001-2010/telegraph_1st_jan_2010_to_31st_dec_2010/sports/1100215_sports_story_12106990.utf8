    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Indias 1st hat-trick man in Tests on his most special matches             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Harbhajan Singh        
	Calcutta: It was at Eden Gardens, nine years ago, that Harbhajan Singh became Indias first (Irfan Pathan is the only other) to record a Test hat-trick. The other day, the 29-year-old veteran of 83 Tests spoke to The Telegraph and listed his most memorable matches.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Match No.1         
	India vs Australia, at Eden Gardens, in March 2001: The most special for a number of reasons... My hat-trick, the massive partnership between (V.V.S.) Laxman and Rahul (Dravid), our stupendous win after being made to follow on... It was an incredible performance, ending Australias winning run of 16 matches... At one stage, having conceded a lead of 274, it seemed the Test would get over in three-and-a-half days, but it went the distance and we won by a huge margin ... Pehle baar dekha cricket aisi bhi ho sakti hai... Most special for me from the point of view of my career and very special for Indian cricket as well... That Test and series will be remembered as a turning point... Made us believe we can pull it off from any situation... I cant forget the emotional crowd either... Its quite something to be cheered by 85,000-90,000 fans...         
	Result: India won by 171 runs.         
	Captain: Sourav Ganguly.         
	MoM: V.V.S.Laxman.         
	Match No.2         
	India vs Australia, at the Chepauk, in March 2001: This Test began just three days after the one at the Eden and the momentum was with us... However, with so much at stake, one knew the Australians under Steve (Waugh) would leave no stone unturned... Thanks to Almighty, I took 15 wickets and helped in our winning that match and the series... It went down to the wire, as expected, and I remember those last few minutes... With only a few runs remaining, Id been nervous taking guard... Thankfully, I played the ball in the point region and got the winning runs... That brought the curtains down on an exceptional series and I got the MoS award... All the more reason why I wont forget that series, which saw my comeback.         
	Result: India won by two wickets.         
	Captain: Sourav Ganguly.         
	MoM: Harbhajan Singh and Matthew Hayden.         
	Match No.3         
	India vs the West Indies, at Sabina Park, in June-July 2006: I have fond memories of my fiver (five for 13) in the first innings... I was hit for two fours, otherwise my figures wouldve read five for five! Getting (Dwayne) Bravo for a duck, caught by Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh), is something I remember instantly... Winning that Test gave us the series, so is somewhat of a landmark in our cricket history... Actually, theres nothing like winning overseas.         
	Result: India won by 49 runs.         
	Captain: Rahul Dravid.         
	MoM: Rahul Dravid.         
	Match No.4         
	India vs England, at the Chepauk, in December 2008: It was quite an amazing Test as England dominated for the first three-and-a-half days, but still lost... I didnt make a major contribution, but Sachin (Tendulkar) got a brilliant hundred (103 not out) and Yuvi posted a very fine 85, on the last day... Their partnership helped us turn the tables on England... It didnt matter that the wicket had become dual paced... Wed been set a target of close to 400, but still won big... Of course, Viru (Virender Sehwag) set it up with a blistering 80-odd.         
	Result: India won by six wickets.         
	Captain: Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	MoM: Virender Sehwag.         
	Match No.5         
	India vs England, at Headingley, in August 2002: Despite conditions being overcast and the possibility of the ball doing quite a bit, Sourav (Ganguly) chose to bat and the batters responded superbly... Sachin got a great 193, Rahul 148 and Sourav himself got 128... (Opener) Sanjay Bangar, I remember, made a crucial 68... We totalled over 600 and the pressure was on England... Anilbhai (Anil Kumble) finished with seven wickets... In fact, all of us bowlers made some contribution...         
	Result: India won by an innings and 46 runs.         
	Captain: Sourav Ganguly.         
	MoM: Rahul Dravid.         
	Special Mention         
	India vs Australia, at the Waca Ground, in January 2008: I didnt play there, but that didnt stop me from feeling as if Id won that Test single-handedly... To win in Perth was absolutely awesome... I felt so proud and remember running on to the field with the Tricolour... The Australian media had suggested we would be bounced out at the Waca, but we won with a day to spare.         
	Result: India won by 72 runs.         
	Captain: Anil Kumble.         
	MoM: Irfan Pathan.         
	His top three Test cricketers         
	Sachin, Anilbhai, Brian Lara...         
	Finally, on the ideal Test wicket         
	(Laughs) Like the one we had at the CCI, against Sri Lanka (last December)... Even on the last day, there was something in it for everybody.

  - Delhi DareDevils top-order flops once again         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Irfan Pathan (right) and Mahela Jayawardene celebrate the fall of a wicket                                 
	New Delhi: In the end, the biggest losers were the crowd of 40,000, who defied the unbearable heat to gather at the Kotla on Sunday. All they were hoping to see was some flamboyant batting from the Delhi DareDevils, but were disappointed to find the home team making a mess of the match even before the spectators could settle down for this Indian Premier League (IPL) match.         
	After killing another IPL giant, the dimple was back on Kings XI co-owner Preity Zintas cheek. Were not spoiling anybodys party, but are trying to make one of our own, she said after the victory.         
	The DareDevils widely acclaimed batting could manage only 111 in 19.4 overs on a slow track after winning the toss for the sixth time in a row on their home ground. The Nelson score proved too little for their bowlers to even make a match of it.         
	Kings XI Punjab notched up their fourth win in 12 matches in the competition in 18.4 overs with seven wickets to spare.         
	The Punjab side now have eight points while the DareDevils remain on 12 to slip to the third position on the table. Though Kings XIs Sri Lankan recruit Mahela Jayawardene said his team were still in with a chance for a semi-final berth, it looks improbable for the time being.         
	Jayawardene, however, once again dished out a fine performance with the bat, scoring 38 in 35 deliveries with the help of four boundaries, and one six, off Farveez Mahroof, clearing the long off. Kumar Sangakkara (33) and Yuvraj Singh (21 not out) were the other scorers.         
	On Saturday, DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd said he wants to win the next two matches to ensure a spot in the semis. But the hosts lost their first three wickets in less than five overs and could never recover from the shock.         
	The quick departure of Virender Sehwag (0), Gautam Gambhir (26) and David Warner (6) created a kind of void that couldnt be filled by the late-order batsmen. Sehwag was out off the first ball he faced from Irfan Pathan, caught at mid-wicket by Reetinder Singh Sodhi, while both Gambhir and Warner were run out.         
	Running between the wickets once again proved to be a problem for Gambhir as he was run out for the third time in the tournament. He looked solid till then, hitting five well-timed boundaries in his 12-ball knock of 26.         
	He was definitely good for much more before a Juan Theron throw from short thirdman beat him at the strikers end. He was trying to steal a single that was never there.         
	Once the top order was back to the pavilion, the DareDevils batting looked pedestrian. Even the normally reliable lot of Dinesh Karthik, Paul Collingwood and Daniel Vettori could do very little, and the Kings XI bowlers took advantage of a slow pitch to knock off the rival batting rather cheaply.         
	So poor was DareDevils batting on Sunday that they couldnt hit even one six, normally a familiar sight in T20 cricket. Only eight boundaries came in their innings with Gambhir alone hitting five of them. Once he was out in the fourth over, the Delhi batsmen could sent the ball past the rope only twice in the 10th and the 18th over.

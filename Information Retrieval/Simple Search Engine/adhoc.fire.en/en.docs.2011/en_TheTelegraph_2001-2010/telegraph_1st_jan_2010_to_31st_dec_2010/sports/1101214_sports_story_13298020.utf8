The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sayantan wins, Diptayan held
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sayantan wins, Diptayan held
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: Nine-year-old Mitrabha Guha of South Point emerged as one of the leaders with full points after the fourth round of the 22nd The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, at Gorky Sadan, on Monday.         
	The Championship is being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chyawanprash and is organised by Alekhine Chess Club.         
	Former Asian U-8 champion Mitrabha Guha arrived at the playing venue almost one and a half hours late as he had a test in school.         
	As the school didnt make any concessions, the current national U-9 title holder sat for his exams and, later on, shattered his opponent Swapnil Biswas kingside with a blitzkrieg attack by sacrificing a piece.         
	His schoolmate and national U-13 champion, Diptayan Ghosh, however, survived a scare against Suvradeepta Das of Aditya Academy. Diptayan, playing black, overextended his pawns leaving his king in the centre.         
	He wriggled out of his precarious position by offering a draw on the 20th move. His opponent, taken aback and probably scared of his reputation, happily accepted the offer.         
	Top seed and defending champion Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School made short work of Subhasis Barik of OD Public School by a combined onslaught of his queen and minor pieces on the kingside.         
	Prince Bajaj of DPS, Ghaziabad, exploited the weak pawn islands of Deep Dutta of Jodhpur Park Boys School in a Sicilian Defence and won without much effort.         
	Chandrashish Majumder of St Xaviers Collegiate School showed his prowess in handling the French defence with the black pieces against Sayantan Kundu of Aditya Academy and won in just 23 moves.         
	Aubhropratim Manna of Don Bosco, Park Cicus obtained space advantage against Kumar Gaurav of Bihar in a Pirc defence.         
	His active pieces and opponents cramped position ensured material gain and the point in the latter part of the game.         
	Young Kushagra Mohan of Andhra Pradesh, barely reaching the table, outwitted higher ranked opponent Prashanta Thapa of Nepal in a long Bishop versus Knight ending.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Two titles have been secured and East Bengal will hope to add the third when they lock horns with I-League champions Dempo SC in the Super Cup, in Gurgaon, Wednesday.         
	The red-and-gold brigade are riding high on twin triumphs of the Federation Cup and the Calcutta Football League. The team have impressed all with their well-oiled display under the guidance of Trevor Morgan. They will thus be the favourites, going by the current form.         
	However, ruling out the likes of Ranty Martins and Beto will be too dangerous.         
	East Bengal might have to without their star Australian striker Tolgay Ozebe, who is injured.         
	While East Bengal have won the Super Cup twice, Dempo have been crowned champions once.         
	The two sides had met in the Super Cup in 2007-08 when Dempo edged out the Calcutta outfit by a solitary goal.

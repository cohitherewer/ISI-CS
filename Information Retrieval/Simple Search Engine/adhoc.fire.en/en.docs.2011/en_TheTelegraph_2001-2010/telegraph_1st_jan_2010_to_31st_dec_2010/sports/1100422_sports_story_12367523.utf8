The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time to do something for society: Bindra
                                                                                                                       7                                        Time to do something for society: Bindra
                  Abhinav Bindra                     
	Chandigarh: He won the countrys adulation by becoming the first-ever individual gold medallist at the Olympics and is eager to give something back. Ace shooter Abhinav Bindra has decided to support talented athletes through his Foundation.         
	I have got so much love and affection from the people of India (after winning the Olympic gold). I always wanted to give something back to the society, which is why we set up the (Abhinav Bindra) Foundation in the first place, Bindra said.         
	He was interacting with the mediapersons after donating blood at a donation camp organised here by the Abhinav Bindra Foundation in association with the Red Cross Society and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).         
	Speaking about his Foundation, Bindra said: We have just started and it is our endeavour to try and serve the society and try to give something back.         
	At the moment, we may not be doing anything major, but we will try to start with basic things and try and make a difference in another persons life, he said.         
	Sports being close to his heart, he said one of the aims of this Foundation is to help those sportspersons who have talent, but lack resources. To start off the biggest goal is to help the people get into sport and help them with basic things like getting equipment. At the moment, the Foundations focus is not on elite athletes or producing Olympic gold medallists because that requires a lot of funding. However, as the Foundation grows that will also be a priority, but not at this juncture when our resources are limited, he said.         
	Bindra said the Foundation would welcome if corporate houses also come forward and get involved. We seek maximum support from everyone in our cause, he said. (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak ready for English challenge 
                      
	Nottingham: Pakistan begin the four-Test series against England Thursday with the belief that their young side is about to start a new era in the game. Five days ago, the young guns from the team made sure they secured a three-wicket win over Australia at Leeds, which squared that Test series 1-1.         
	Its a new beginning for Pakistan cricket, and especially for a young side, Butt said as the team prepared for this Test series.         
	To win against the worlds best is always an achievement. We would have loved to have done it in front of our home crowd, but we need to tell them that we love them and we hope we will be playing in front of them soon. The bowling attack in particular attracted lavish praise from Butt.         
	Mohammed Aamer is definitely one of the best bowlers in the world at the moment, Butt said, adding, Asif is the best bowler with the new ball Ive seen since Glenn McGrath.         
	Butt, who has been responsible for transforming Pakistan from underdogs into genuine contenders, said, I take advice from everyone, its important for me to keep the players going, he said.         
	There are few mysteries concerning the England line-up, with Pakistan set to run into Graeme Swann, the spinner with the most wickets in the world in 2010. While Stuart Broad is also certain to play, James Anderson, Steven Finn and Tim Bresnan are now competing for spots in the squad.         
	Bresnan was drafted late into the squad as Ajmal Shahzad is unlikely to feature in the match, following an ankle injury. (Agencies)

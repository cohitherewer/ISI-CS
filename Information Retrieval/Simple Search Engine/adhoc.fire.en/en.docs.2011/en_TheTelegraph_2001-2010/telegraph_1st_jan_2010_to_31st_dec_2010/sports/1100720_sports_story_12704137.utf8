The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pep keen to sign Fabregas
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pep keen to sign Fabregas
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has insisted that he remains desperate to sign Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas, but has said the final decision rests with the north Londoners.         
	The Fabregas transfer saga appeared to have reached an impasse last week when their president, Sandro Rosell, conceded that the Catalan giants may have to wait until next summer to sign him.         
	But Guardiola, who guided Barca to a second consecutive La Liga title last season, has re-ignited the fires with his admission at a press conference Monday.         
	I think bringing in Cesc will cost a lot, said Guardiola. We want him to come, but if Arsenal dont want to negotiate, he wont come.         
	The club had a reported 25 million bid for the Spain international turned down by Arsenal earlier this summer.

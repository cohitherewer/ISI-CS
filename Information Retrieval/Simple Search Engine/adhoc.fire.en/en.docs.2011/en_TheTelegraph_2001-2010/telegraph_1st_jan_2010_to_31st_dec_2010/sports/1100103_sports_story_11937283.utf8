  - Test squad for Bangla by Wednesday       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Fourteen of the 15 players who featured in the India squads during the recent Test series against Sri Lanka, are certain to be retained for the two-match affair in Bangladesh.         
	The Tests across the border will be held after the tri-series there, which begins on Monday.         
	Middle-order batsman Subramaniam Badrinath is the only one who may miss out, if the Krishnamachari Srikkanth-chaired selection committee decides to have four specialist new-ball bowlers.                     
	There were three  Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma  versus Sri Lanka.         
	As of Saturday, Srikkanth and three of his four colleagues (Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) would be meeting in Chennai, on Tuesday evening/Wednesday morning.         
	Yashpal Sharma wont be present as hell be viewing the tri-series in Bangladesh. Who goes there for the Tests hasnt, however, been finalised.         
	Srikkanth and Hirwani will travel to Chennai from Bangalore, after watching the first two-and-a-half days of the Karnataka-UP Ranji semi-final. Bhave and Venkat will move out of Mumbai, after viewing exactly that much of the Mumbai-Delhi clash.         
	Confirmation, though, is awaited.         
	Fourteen of the 15 who were there in the last Test series are absolutely sure of being retained... If another seamer is needed, then it could be a toss up between the experienced Munaf Patel and the very promising Sudeep Tyagi... In that case, Badrinath will have to miss out, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirstens views will also count.         
	As the squad will have 16 players, its taken for granted that the additional slot would go to all-rounder Dinesh Karthik. Besides being the second keeper, he may be used in any position in the batting order.         
	Significantly, for the first time, India will be starting a Test series as the worlds No.1-ranked team. The opening match is in Chittagong, from January 17; Dhaka hosts the second and final Test, from January 24.         
	The last Test series between the two countries, too, had been in Bangladesh  in the summer of 2007. Test No.1 was hit by bad weather, but India won the next, making it 1-0.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly Tuesday threw his weight behind Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. ahead of Wednesdays Idea Cup tri-series final against Sri Lanka, in Dhaka.         
	Sourav, speaking after the Kolkata Knight Riders practice at the Eden, said India were the favourites to win the final but was quick to add that the team winning the toss will have a definite advantage.         
	India are of course the favourites for the final. However, the toss will also be an important factor. Whoever wins the toss will start from an advantageous position, Sourav said.         
	Sourav rejected suggestions that the Team India bowlers were out of sorts. He instead pointed out that India were able to restrict the islanders to 213 in the last league match between the two countries.         
	I dont think there is any problem with Indian bowling. In their last match against Lanka, Dhonis men did a praiseworthy job to restrict the opponents to 213. That shows they are doing their job well, the Knights captain said.         
	About youngster Virat Kohli, who has struck a rich vein of form, Sourav said that he would have to prove himself against tougher opponents.         
	He is playing great cricket. Theres no doubt about it. However, its too early in his career to say anything. He will have to prove himself against tougher opponents like Australia and South AfricaBut he is certainly in good form at present, Sourav summed up.

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford is the one to follow in Wednesdays six-event card. Alford has five rides but three of them  Washington Irvine, Glorious Knight and Royal Dance  have potential to land the prize in their respective events.          
	Washington Irvine for instance, may down the hot-favourite, Spectacular Style, in the afternoon feature event, the 2,000m Republic Cup. The Razeen son was very impressive in his debut run but disappointed in his subsequent two starts against good horses like of Local Warrior and Accessor. The Irvine may, therefore beat Spectacular Style who failed to do anything worthwhie in the citys classics. Glorious Knight and Royal Dance are Alfords other winning hopes. After recovering from a training setback, Glorious Knight was a good second to Aksinya in his last start, while Royal Dance has returned to the scurry he relishes most.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

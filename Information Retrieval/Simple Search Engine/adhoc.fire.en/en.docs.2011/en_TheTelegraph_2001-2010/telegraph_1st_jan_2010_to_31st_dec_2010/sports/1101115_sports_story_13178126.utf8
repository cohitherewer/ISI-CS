The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunderland stun Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sunderland stun Blues
                      
	London: Chelseas sensational home record went up in smoke as goals by Nedum Onuoha, Asamoah Gyan and Danny Welbeck gave Sunderland a shock 3-0 victory over the Premier League leaders on Sunday.         
	The reigning champions hadnt conceded a goal at Stamford Bridge all campaign before their match against the Black Cats but a defence missing first-choice centre halves Alex and John Terry fell apart.         
	Nedum Onuoha put Sunderland ahead in the 44th minute with a stunning individual effort before Gyan scored his fourth goal in three games to make it 2-0 in the 52nd. Welbeck then took advantage of a careless back pass by Ashley Cole to slip in the third with three minutes left.         
	Chelsea barely threatened Sunderland goalkeeper Craig Gordon and now lead Arsenal by just two points.         
	Earlier, goals from Bacary Sagna and Cesc Fabregas gave Arsenal a 2-1 win at Everton on Sunday to lift them above Manchester United into second place in the Premier League.         
	Fullback Sagna opened the scoring when he fired past Tim Howard at the near post after 36 minutes. Fabregas added the second goal three minutes into the second half.         
	Arsenal dominated for much of the game but had to hang on at the end after Tim Cahill scored for Everton in the dying minutes.         
	It was Evertons first defeat for eight League matches. They had plenty of chances of their own with Cahill missing a good opportunity with an early header and Jermaine Beckford thwarted after coming on as a 69th-minute substitute for Phil Neville. Evertons late rally had Arsenal rocking but goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski also saved well from Steven Pienaar and Louis Saha to prevent the home side equalising.

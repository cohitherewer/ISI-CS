The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India is on brink of history

  - Heavy rain threatens to disrupt final one-dayer against Australia today       MARIA BILKIS                            
	Margao: Heavy rain on Saturday night put an even bigger question mark over the third and final one-day International between India and Australia.         
	The stars were already missing from the ODI series. The rain is threatening to spoil the show further. After a downpour had washed out the series opener in Kochi, heavy showers appeared to nearly damage all possibilities of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, in Fatorda, hosting its last international match, on Sunday.         
	As both teams come close to the last leg of their coastal cruise, chances are that the finale might be turned into a damp squib.         
	However, following a heavy spell of rain in the morning, Saturday had developed into fairly sunny and cloudless look to dispel doubts over the match.         
	Earlier in the day, the Goa Cricket Association (GCA), at a media conference, had confirmed that match would proceed as planned. Thanks to the dedicated ground staff, despite the poor drainage system of the ground, any serious damage was averted, and all seemed ready for the big day.         
	Dayanand Narvekar, the GCA president, had been confident that the match would start on time if the weather remained clear and rainless. If it does not rain and the sun comes out shining tomorrow (Sunday), the match will start on time. The wicket is in very good condition Not a drop of water on it, he said.         
	With the day looking upbeat, both teams spent a substantial amount of time at the nets, in the evening.         
	India stand on the brink of history, of a Test and ODI clean sweep against Australia. With a 1-0 lead and the young lot spitting fire, it does seem plausible.         
	The other day, Virat Kohli s blistering knock of 118 off 121 balls not only steadied the initially wobbly Indian innings but also gave a glimpse into the future of India s cricketing prowess.         
	 However, the openers, Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay, will be expected to do better.         
	India s bowling department has a few issues to look into. Captain Dhoni has expressed concern over the bowlers conceding runs aplenty in the last ten overs.         
	The last ten overs have always been a big concern for us. It s not a worry we have had (only) over the last 2 or 3 months. We have been bothered by the last ten overs for a long time now. We had done well in between but have not been really consistent. It s still an area where we can definitely improve. We are putting in a lot of effort but haven t achieved the desired result. We have not been consistent with it, the skipper said.         
	Australia on the other end look off-colour and hapless. With back to back losses, their confidence has taken a beating and with two of their mainstays  pacer Doug Bollinger and batsman Michael Hussey  missing from the team, the tough tour will just be tougher.         
	Stand-in captain Michael Clarke would have to repeat his last performance and, may be, better that by a notch or two.         
	It has been a tough tour. We have not got the results we would have liked, in the one one-day match as well as the Test series. We are looking forward to win the match tomorrow and draw series, Clarke said.

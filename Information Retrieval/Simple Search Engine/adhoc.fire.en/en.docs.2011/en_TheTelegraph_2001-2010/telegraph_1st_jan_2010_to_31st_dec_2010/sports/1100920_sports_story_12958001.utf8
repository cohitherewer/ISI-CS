The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serbia to meet France in final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Serbia to meet France in final
                      
	London: Serbia will host France in an all-European Davis Cup final in December after the Serbs rallied to beat the Czech Republic 3-2 on Sunday.         
	Serbia, trailing 2-1 after Saturdays doubles, were able to level the best-of-five series when Novak Djokovic defeated Tomas Berdych 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in Sundays first singles match.         
	Janko Tipsarevic then secured Serbias first appearance in a Davis Cup final by beating Radek Stepanek 6-0, 7-6 (6), 6-4 in the deciding match.         
	France had already qualified for the December 3-5 final by taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in Saturdays doubles. They completed a 5-0 rout on Sunday. In Lyon, Gilles Simon beat Eduardo Schwank 7-6 (5), 6-7 (6), 6-3 and Arnaud Clement enjoyed a comprehensive 7-5, 6-1 win against Horacio Zeballos.         
	Tipsarevic proved to be Serbias key player, winning both of his singles.         
	Djokovic, the US Open runner-up, had a lethargic start but rode the support of his hometown crowd of 15,000 in the Belgrade Arena that even used vuvuzelas to fire up their team.         
	He dropped his serve in the seventh game to lose the first set.         
	Djokovic, No. 2 in the world, skipped the opening singles Friday because he was still tired from Mondays final against Rafael Nadal and only returned to the Serbian capital from New York two days before the match.         
	He returned to play doubles on Saturday in a losing effort that left Serbia trailing 2-1 and Djokovic had to beat Berdych to keep Serbias hopes alive.         
	Djokovic came into the match with a 2-1 career edge over Berdych but the seventh-ranked Czech had won their Wimbledon semi-final. Berdych then lost the final to Nadal.         
	There were two scary moments for the Serbian team in the second set.         
	Djokovic was 30-0 down before recovering for a 3-2 lead. In the next game, Djokovic tried to reach a smash from Berdych but slipped and fell heavily. He needed a medical break but returned with a bandage on his right knee.         
	Djokovic appeared to have no problems, however, and had one break point as he continued the game.         
	Berdych held but hit a backhand into the net to go down 5-3 and Djokovic served out the set to level at 1-1.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Korea make a winning start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Korea make a winning start
  - Greece have a mountain to climb
                      
	Port Elizabeth: South Korea eased to a 2-0 win over a lacklustre Greece side in Saturdays first Group B match of the World Cup. Lee Jung-soo tapped in unmarked to open the scoring in the seventh minute at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and captain Park Ji-sung doubled the lead in the 52nd with a slick solo goal.         
	The Manchester United midfielder collected a misplaced pass from Vassilis Torosidis and skipped past two defenders before slipping a shot across goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas and in at the far post.         
	Striker Park Chu-young had another three chances to score for South Korea and Fanis Gekas had a shot saved with 10 minutes left for what was Greeces first clear effort.         
	If we had been a little bit calmer, we could have had an even better result, South Korea coach Huh Jung-moo said. In terms of scoring goals, it could have been a little bit better for us.         
	Greece coach Otto Rehhagel stood on the touchline at the end of his teams fourth straight World Cup finals defeat, his hands on his hips and a fierce scowl on his face. We really have to get our act together, Rehhagel said. Weve got to improve a couple of things and be brave and courageous enough.         
	The Greeks, who next face Nigeria, now have a mountain to climb in Group B.         
	In the two-thirds full 45,000-seat stadium, South Korea spent much of the opening minutes giving the ball away to the former European champions and defending desperately. But they scored from their first real chance.         
	Ki Sung-yong curled in a free kick with his right foot from near the left corner flag and the ball brushed the top of Konstantinos Katsouranis head before reaching Lee at the far post, where the central defender easily tapped into an unguarded net.         
	Youve got 18 people in the penalty area and there is a hard hit cross, anything can happen if the defender doesnt head away the ball properly, Rehhagel said.         
	Rehhagel took off captain Giorgos Karagounis at the interval but South Korea continued to dominate despite Greeces adventurous three-man attack and Park Ji-sung made it 2-0. Torosidis gave the ball away to Park midway inside his own half.         
	Park surged forward and beat two sliding tackles before coolly scoring with a low shot. We said we shouldnt sit on our laurels and we should attack, Huh said. I said at halftime that we would have more opportunities and we should take advantage.         
	Greece mustered only a couple of blocked shots and appealed desperately for a late penalty when Gekas shot hit a defender. The South Korean had his arms raised but replays showed the ball hit his body. Gekas then unleashed a shot from about 12 metres but goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong punched it over the bar.

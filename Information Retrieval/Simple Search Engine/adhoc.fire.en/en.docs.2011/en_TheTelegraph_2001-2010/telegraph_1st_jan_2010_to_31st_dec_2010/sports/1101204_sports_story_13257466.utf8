The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods puts up a good show
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods puts up a good show
                      
	Thousand Oaks: Tiger Woods opened with a seven-under 65 to take the lead in the Chevron World Challenge, on Thursday, only the second time all year his name has been atop the leaderboard.         
	In one of his most complete rounds of the year, Woods missed only two greens and putted for eagle four times for a one-shot lead over US Open champion Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy.         
	Woods made it all the way until the 18th hole before an old flaw crept into his new swing. He popped up his tee shot, forcing him to pitch out from behind a tree and two-putt from 50 feet to escape with bogey. Even so, he matched his best score of the year, and was atop the leaderboard for only the second time in his troublesome season.         
	About the only club that didnt cooperate was his new putter, although thats nothing new. If anything has held Woods back from at least having a few chances at contending, its not making many putts.         
	Great iron play made up for that at Sherwood Country Club.         
	Its not too often you can say I shot 65 and only made one putt, but thats kind of what I did today, Woods said. I only made one putt and it was on 9. The rest were either two-putts or kick-ins. It was a good ball-striking day.         
	The putt on the par-4 ninth was from about 15 feet with significant break. Equally impressive were some of his shots into the par 5s, particularly the 3-iron into No. 2. Woods hit it so clean that he twirled the club, a sure sign of a good shot.         
	He hasnt done much twirling this year.         
	I have not, Woods said. Usually, its point which way the ball is going to go  incoming somewhere.         
	McDowell and McIlroy, the Northern Ireland duo who lost only one match at the Ryder Cup, would have been tough to beat in fourballs at Sherwood. They were paired together had would have had a best-ball score of 61. On their own, each settled for a 66.         
	A lot of birdies out there between us, McDowell said, and that includes a pair of eagles on the par-5 11th.         
	Dustin Johnson faltered on the back nine and shot a 69, along with Stewart Cink, who is trying out a new putter and a new putting grip with an eye toward 2011.         
	Luke Donald and Camilo Villegas each had a 70, and no one else broke par.         
	With warm temperatures and a clear sky, the greens were quicker than usual. Sherwood has its share of trouble that is not hard to find, and that accounts for a few high scores. Anthony Kim is bringing up the rear at 79.         
	This is Woods last chance to win a tournament in 2010, but it looks more like he is geared toward next season. It was his second straight 65, having closed with that score in the Australian Masters a few weeks ago.

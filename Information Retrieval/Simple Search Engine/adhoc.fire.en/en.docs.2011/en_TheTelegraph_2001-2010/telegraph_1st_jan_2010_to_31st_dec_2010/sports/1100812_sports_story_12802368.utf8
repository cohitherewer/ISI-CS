The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazilians hail return of verve
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazilians hail return of verve
                      
	Sao Paulo: One game was enough to get Brazilians excited again about their national team. Brazil beat the United States 2-0 in the debut of coach Mano Menezes on Tuesday in New Jersey, and fans and local media praised the return of the Jogo Bonito, or the beautiful game.         
	Welcome back Brazil, read a headline in a Rio de Janeiro newspaper.         
	With a defensive-minded style under controversial coach Dunga, Brazil failed to impress in the World Cup in South Africa and was eliminated 2-1 by the Netherlands in the quarter finals.         
	Dunga, this is what happiness looks like, the paper added.         
	Dunga achieved significant results with the national team heading into the World Cup, but many fans were unhappy with the pragmatic style imposed by the former defensive midfielder.         
	Mano adds flair and wins, said a conservative daily. Led by talented young players including Neymar, Alexandre Pato and Paulo Henrique Ganso, Brazil easily outplayed the United States, which included several players from the team that lost to Ghana in the second round in South Africa.         
	The Brazilian squad had only four players who were at the World Cup  Robinho, Thiago Silva, Ramires and Daniel Alves.         
	Without a doubt this team is better, said 27-year-old gardener Leandro Lopes. With Neymar and Ganso, Brazil are much better than they were in the World Cup.         
	Neymar and Pato scored a goal each for Brazil in the first half on Tuesday. The Brazilians had plenty of other chances to add to their advantage but failed to capitalise on them.         
	Brazilians campaigned for Dunga to summon Neymar, Ganso and other up-and-coming players for the World Cup, but the coach preferred to stick with players known for their hard work and efficiency in defense.         
	Menezes is going the opposite way, betting on the young talents as he prepares the team to the ultimate goal of winning the World Cup at home in 2014.         
	It was a good start, getting the win and  maybe more importantly  bringing fans to his side.         
	We are optimistic again, Lopes said.           (AGENCIES)

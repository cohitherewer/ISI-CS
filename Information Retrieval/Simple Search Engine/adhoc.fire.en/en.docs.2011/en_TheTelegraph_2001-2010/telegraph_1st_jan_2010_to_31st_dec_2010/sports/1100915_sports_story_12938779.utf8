	Centurion: After notching up a thumping win in their tournament opener, Chennai Super Kings would be favourites to register another victory when they take on Sri Lankas Wayamba Elevens in the Champions League Twenty20 match here Wednesday.         
	The Chennai Super Kings have had a fantastic start to the tournament by thrashing Central Districts by 57 runs.         
	Big-hitters such as Matthew Hayden and Suresh Raina are crucial to the teams chances of posting big totals or chasing stiff targets and the duo will look to strike form early when they step on the pitch Wednesday.         
	If they can give the team a strong start, Mahendra Singh Dhonis side has enough firepower in the lower half to take the team to a good total. The hard-hitters in the lower half include Albie Morkel and Dhoni himself.         
	Their bowling is no less impressive with Aussie pace star Doug Bollinger and Muttiah Muralidharan leading the attack. Wayamba, on the other hand, put on a decent batting effort in their opening match but fell short with the ball against South African domestic champion side Warriors.         
	Arguably the biggest star of the line-up, skipper Mahela Jayawardene, was off-colour in the lung-opener and was dismissed for a duck, but lesser known faces such as Jeevantha Kulatunga and Kushal Perera rose to the occasion.         
	And the side would need to put up another spirited show to have any chance of upstaging the star-studded Chennai team.         
	In the other match, Central Districts will face off against Victoria Bushrangers at the same venue with both the teams hoping to open their account in the tournament.           (PTI)

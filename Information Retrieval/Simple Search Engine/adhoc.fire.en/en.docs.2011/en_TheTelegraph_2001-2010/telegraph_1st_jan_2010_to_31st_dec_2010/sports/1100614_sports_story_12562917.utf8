	Chennai: The high-voltage build-up ended in an insipid climax with former India captain Mohammed Azharuddins last minute back-out paving way for V. K. Vermas re-election as the Badminton Association of India (BAI) president for a fourth successive term here on Sunday.         
	Verma was re-elected unopposed at the BAIs AGM in which the body nominated national coach Pullela Gopichand and former shuttler Ami Ghia as players representatives to its executive committee with voting rights.         
	Azharuddin, a cricketer-turned-politician, failed to present his nomination papers and was reportedly not even in town. Talking to reporters, a jubilant Verma said he won unopposed and said no one badmouthed Azharuddin for his no-show after promising a tough fight.         
	Nothing bad was spoken about him. Our aim is to make players win the World Championship. We are more focused on that than these issues, Verma said.         
	Apart from Vermas re-election, the AGM also put its stamp of approval on Hemant Biswas Sharma as the vice-president named three Secretaries  Dr Filha, Omar Rashid and Punnaiah Choudhary.         
	Three government units  Railways, Services and Universities  reportedly boycotted the election claiming that the process was not transparent.         
	Azharuddin, who was rumoured to be backed by the sports ministry, had earlier approached the sessions court in Andhra Pradeshs Rangareddy district seeking a stay on the election but his plea was rejected.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke hits century
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clarke hits century
                      
	Wellington: Michael Clarke has had to display a lot of patience over the past fortnight and he applied an unflappable, measured approach as his century steered Australia into a strong position against New Zealand here Friday, according to Cricinfo.         
	Clarkes timing was so good he brought up his hundred in the last over of the day as he swung his side to 316 for four.

	Argentina         
	Despite a tortuous qualification campaign, Argentina are travelling to South Africa with serious designs of winning the title for the first time in 24 years. To achieve that goal, the twice world champions have pinned their faith on coach Diego Maradona, the countrys most famous son. His task is made easier by a star-studded squad featuring the likes of Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Diego Milito and Sergio Aguero.         
	Road to South Africa         
	The Argentinians made extremely hard work of qualifying for the finals and, after a series of setbacks, eventually made it with narrow victories in their final two games, against Peru and Uruguay.                 
	Star player         
	The Argentina fan would be chanting one name as if that was the magic word, Messi. Widely regarded as the best footballer in the world, South Africa 10 could be where the Barca striker finds immortality.         
	Coach         
	2010 gives Maradona the opportunity to repeat as coach his finest achievement as a player. Straight-talking, impulsive and a born competitor, Maradona retains the aura that made him such a revered figure during his playing days.         
	Record         
	Argentina have played in the title round at four Cups. They won in 78 and 86 and were runners-up in 30 and 90. La Albiceleste will be appearing at their 15th World Cup and in the 10th consecutive edition.

	Nigeria         
	The Super Eagles were once seen as the most likely African nation to finally reach the last four of a World Cup. And although they missed out on Germany 06, the continents most populous nation looks likely to be a dangerous dark horse with little to lose against the worlds best. The side that came to USA 94 had become synonymous with the next generation of explosive African football. This time, the Nigerians would be looking to take it to the next level.         
	Road to South Africa         
	The west Africans had been staring elimination in the face at one stage in the final round of qualifying. But with other results going their way and them twice coming back from a goal down to win 3-2 in Kenya, the ticket to South Africa had been booked.                   
	Star player         
	More than veteran Nwankwo Kanu, it will be Chelseas attacking midfielder John Obi Mikel the Nigerians would be looking to for ideas.         
	Coach         
	Lars Lagerback, the former Sweden co-manager, took up his duties in February and has the raw material at his disposal to create more than just a ripple in South Africa. The 61-year-old took Sweden to the 02 and 06 finals and knows what it takes to get the job done.         
	Record         
	This is Nigerias fourth appearance in the finals. Before missing out on the World Cup in Germany 06, thay had qualified for three straight World Cups, from 94 to 02. Nigeria won the 1985, 1993 and 2007 Fifa U-17 World Cup as well as the 1996 Olympic football gold.

	south Korea         
	Asias most frequent visitors to the World Cup Korea are also the continents most successful team at the showpiece event. The Taeguk Warriors will be hoping to replicate their regional dominance on the world stage in Africa. Victory at the competition remained elusive till 02, when the co-hosts defeated Italy and Spain to advance to the semi-finals, eventually losing to Germany. So, the Koreans know the high of doing well at the World Cup and would be looking to go one better this time.                   
	Road to South Africa         
	Korea had a tough ride in qualifying but got their act together when it mattered most.         
	Star player         
	Park Ji-Sung has played a key role during qualification and the Manchester United winger is quite indispensable to the team with his ability to create space and chances.         
	Coach         
	Huh Jung-Moo put an end to the Dutch influence under the likes of Guus Hiddink and Dick Advocaat and the former Korea midfielder silenced his critics by guiding an experimental side into the finals with two games to spare.         
	Record         
	Korea are set to make their eighth appearance in 10. The best result the Taeguk Warriors have achieved so far was in 02, where they swept past European powerhouses Portugal, Italy, and Spain to reach the last four.

	Greece         
	After seemingly coming from nowhere to triumph at Euro 2004, Greece continue to defy the odds under wily coach Otto Rehhagel and have clinched qualification for only their second World Cup. It could be the German coachs last tournament in charge after nine years because the 71-year-old German is rumoured to be leaving after the tournament. But before that King Otto has to make amends for failure to reach Germany 06 and a limp group-stage exit at Euro 2008.         
	Road to South Africa         
	Greece began in great style but after stuttering in between found themselves pitted against Ukraine in the play-off. After a 0-0 draw in Athens, they grabbed a 1-0 away win in Donetsk to go through.         
	Star player         
	Former Inter and Benfica midfielder Giorgios Karagounis is the captain and the man who can win the battles at the centre of the park and rally his team in times of crisis.         
	Coach         
	South Africa 2010 will be coach Rehhagels first finals, where he is set to be the oldest strategist in the dugout. He has led this team to glory in the past and it is undoubtedly his genius that makes the Greeks tick.         
	Record         
	USA 94, where they headed home at the first hurdle, was the Greeks first and only previous appearance at the finals. The Greeks crowning glory was victory in Euro 2004.

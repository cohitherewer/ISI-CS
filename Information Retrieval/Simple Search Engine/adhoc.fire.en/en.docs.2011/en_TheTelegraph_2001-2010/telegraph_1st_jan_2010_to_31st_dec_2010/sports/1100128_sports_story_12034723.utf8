    - Turmoil in South African cricket. Corrie Van Zyl named interim coach             A STAFF REPORTER            Did differences between Graeme Smith (left) and Mickey Arthur contribute to the coachs exit?                                 
	Calcutta: Days before Graeme Smith amp; Co. embark on a tour of India which would go on to determine who rules world cricket for the next few months, a dramatic turn of events saw South Africa coach Mickey Arthur resigning and the national selection committee disbanded.         
	Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced at a media conference on Wednesday that Arthur, under whose stewardship Proteas became world No.1 in Tests as well as one-day Internationals, has resigned. CSA named high performance manager, Corrie van Zyl, the interim coach.         
	Although the Board announced the resignation Wednesday, Arthur had quit Tuesday.         
	Elaborating on his decision, Arthur said: I have decided to resign as national coach of the Proteas with immediate effect as I feel that it is in the best interests both of the team and me. Differences of approach on how to get the Proteas back to the top of world cricket have arisen between CSA and me, and I dont believe I can take the team forward under the present circumstances. There comes a time when you have to move on and I know in my own heart that I have taken the right decision.         
	Even though Arthur didnt say it, it is being assumed that the coach and the captain had differences, which could not be ironed out, leading to Arthurs resignation.         
	The media conference in East London was attended by Arthur, CSA CEO Gerald Majola, South Africa captain Graeme Smith, Van Zyl, and team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee.         
	It was also announced that as part of the restructuring process, the national selection committee has been disbanded, and replaced by Majola (convenor), a former member of the national selection panel, Van Zyl, and former captain Kepler Wessels.         
	Majola said: It is with much regret that the Board of Directors of Cricket South Africa has accepted Mickey Arthurs resignation as the Proteas coach.         
	His resignation came through the normal stock-taking process which followed the England home series and against the backdrop of the disappointing results of 2009. As this process unfolded and remedies were sought, Mickey expressed the very honest and humble view that he did not believe that at this stage he could continue as coach of the Proteas.         
	Under the circumstances, he tendered his resignation, and with much regret, CSA accepted it. The Board wishes to thank Mickey for his great contribution to the advancement of the Proteas to the point where in 2008-09, they had their best season ever and finished on top of the Test and ODI rankings.         
	They have slipped down both logs since then and CSA is determined to get them back to the top. We have accepted Mickeys view that a change at the coaching helm is needed... We are confident that the new management and Proteas will go forward from here, as part of CSAs strategy to take Proteas to the top and keep them there. This starts with the forthcoming tour to India.         
	CSA is hopeful that Mickey will find a way to continue to work within our structures in another capacity because of his expertise and his passion for the game.Mickey said: It is never a bad thing to have a fresh pair of legs running the show and I wish my successor all the best in his endeavours.         
	I have thoroughly enjoyed my five years with CSA, and I feel that we, as a team, have enjoyed considerable success, including being the No. 1 ranked team in the world for a period of time in both Test cricket and the limited-over formats.         
	The year 2008 was the finest in the history of South African cricket either before or since unity, when we went unbeaten in Test series in three tough away tours to India, England and Australia in the space of nine months. To be part of the series-winning world record 438 game against Australia was also a memorable moment.         
	In conclusion, I would like to wish Corrie, Graeme and the team all the best for the future and particularly for the forthcoming tour of India.         
	The Proteas leave for their tour of India on Saturday morning. They will play two Test matches and three one-day Internationals against the Mahendra Singh Dhonis.

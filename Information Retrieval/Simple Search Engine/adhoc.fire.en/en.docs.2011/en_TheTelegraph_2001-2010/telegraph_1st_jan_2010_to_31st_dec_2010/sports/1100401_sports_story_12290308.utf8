The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Whatmore ducks tweet; focus on the desi ones
                                                                                                                       7                                        Whatmore ducks tweet; focus on the desi ones
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                           
	Calcutta: When the principal owner of a franchise lets the world know that the time for excuses is over, its time for those on his payrolls to actually deliver with a capital D.         
	In this case, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).         
	With captain Sourav Ganguly staying away from the pre-match media conference, on Wednesday evening, coach Dav Whatmore had to get into the ducking-act.         
	Asked about Shah Rukh Khans tweet, posted after the big loss to the Delhi DareDevils, Whatmore said: I havent read the report (in these columns) and havent gone on to Twitter...         
	Its unlikely that he could have responded very differently.         
	To be fair to Whatmore, theres only so much that a coach can do and, clearly, he has begun to feel the heat. His focus has been on creating the right environment and, as important, juggling to get the balance of the XI in order.         
	By Souravs own admission, he and the coach spend hours trying to work out who should fill the four slots available for overseas players. Perhaps, they need to spend as much, if not more, time determining the remaining positions.         
	Indeed, the common belief is that KKR just didnt get it right in recruiting the domestic players. That Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, to take one name, wasnt snared (hes with the Rajasthan Royals) continues to baffle.         
	A study of the franchises in IPL III reveals that the domestic players have been striking gold across the tournament.         
	To give an example, the top three run-getters for table-toppers Mumbai Indians are all Indians  captain and icon Sachin Tendulkar, Saurabh Tiwary (who should have been roped in by KKR) and Shikhar Dhawan. Where the franchises bowling is concerned, Sri Lankas Lasith Malinga has been the most successful, followed by two Indians  Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh.         
	Surely, theres something to learn from that.         
	With the game capable of throwing up surprises, will a desi player take it upon him, on Thursday, to prove that KKR do have some ammo?         
	Opponents Deccan Chargers have the same points as KKR, but have played a match less.         
	The spotlight now is on the movers and shakers, like the DareDevils. Its to be seen whether this scenario will make it a bit easier for the under-pressure teams.         
	Footnote: For much of the evening, the buzz was that Shah Rukh could stay away from the KKR-Chargers clash. Hes scheduled to come, yes, but his coming isnt guaranteed, an associate pointed out. Around 11 pm, though, a confidante messaged The Telegraph: SRK coming for sure...

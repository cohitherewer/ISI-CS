The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All is hearty with Brazil
                                                                                                                       7                                      All is hearty with Brazil
                      
	Johannesburg: Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo said Monday that there is no animosity between him and Kaka after a misunderstanding during practice led to speculation that the two were not talking to each other.         
	Some Brazilian media reported that Kaka was upset with Felipe Melo after a hard challenge during a practice at the teams camp in South Africa, but the Juventus player said that he had nothing to do with the play and was unjustly accused.         
	The misunderstanding occurred after a photograph was published showing Kaka apparently not wanting help from Felipe Melo to get up after the tackle. It was actually Robinho who went in hard on Kaka.         
	Felipe Melo was upset with newspapers and websites that published the story, and said he is considering a lawsuit. A Brazilian newspaper ran the story and the photo, which were later picked up by some Italian and Brazilian websites.         
	Im not a bad person, Felipe Melo said. The way they had it, it seems like Im a bad person. If I go hard in a challenge, its because thats the way I play, but not because Im a bad person. I have family, they see this and they will come to me asking why Im doing this to Kaka.         
	The Brazilian football confederation said in a statement on its website that the incident between Felipe Melo and Kaka, who are expected to start in Brazils midfield, did not take place.         
	Felipe Melo felt he was unjustly blamed for something that never happened, the confederation said. He is Kakas friend.         
	Felipe Melo said he later talked to Kaka and explained what happened. (Kakas) only word to me was, unfair, the defensive midfielder said.         
	After Mondays practice it was clear there were no hard feelings. When Kaka went down hard after a challenge from Daniel Alves, Felipe Melo quickly approached the playmaker and gave him a hug. Laughing, both players turned to the journalists to make sure they were watching.         
	The Brazilians have been practising hard since arriving in South Africa last week. Kaka and Luis Fabiano are coming off injuries, but coach Dunga has not asked players to go easy on them or any others.         
	On the contrary, striker Luis Fabiano said. He is asking us to play hard and dedicate ourselves. Its a tough competition and it will require a lot from us. We need to be ready.         
	Brazils opening World Cup Group G match is against North Korea on June 15. It will then face the Ivory Coast on June 20 and Portugal on June 25. They will play a warm-up against Zimbabwe on Wednesday. (Agencies)

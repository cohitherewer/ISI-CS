The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav, Dav not taking the Royals lightly
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav, Dav not taking the Royals lightly
    - Shah to make way for Gayle today; Rookie Harpreet set for debut           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Chris Gayle in Ahmedabad, on Friday                                 
	Ahmedabad: The Rajasthan Royals have been playing more like paupers, but the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) dont wish to court trouble by taking Shane Warnes team lightly.         
	Ive always maintained that all eight sides are more or less evenly matched... Im not changing that view... T20 is such a short game that anything can happen... On its day, any team is capable of running away with the match, Sourav Ganguly, the KKR captain, told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Chatting at The Courtyard Marriott, a majestic property, Sourav added: The Royals may have lost all three games, but we wont be taking our match lightly.         
	The coach, Dav Whatmore, said much the same thing.         
	Nothing comes easy... The Royals havent been winning and everybody expects us to beat them... However, I dont expect easy games, Whatmore maintained, speaking exclusively.         
	While the Royals, for whom Ahmedabad is like home, havent opened their account in IPL III, Sourav and Co. have won two of their three matches.         
	For the Royals, then, nothing matters more than ending this losing run. Where KKR is concerned, the priority on Saturday, in adjacent Motera, will be to get back to winning.         
	Its a boost that Chris Gayle has reported for duty and is available for the remainder of the tournament.         
	Late on Friday, it became clear that Owais Shah would sit out, making way for the West Indies captain. After all, only four foreigners can feature in the XI.         
	Asked if hed overcome the Kingston-Miami-London-Mumbai-Ahmedabad jet lag, Gayle answered grinning: Im feeling pretty good and Im looking forward to tomorrow (Saturday)... Hopefully, my presence in the side should do good... Well soon get back to winning ways...         
	Having burnt his fingers last year, Gayle declined to compare T20 with Test cricket. Im not going back to the past... I dont, at this point, wish to create a controversy.         
	Gayle ducked when a question was posed on the change in the management team within KKR. Youre trying to put me in a spot... Ive just come... Lets see what happens in the long term... The environment, though, has always been good in the dressing room...         
	There was talk that Cheteshwar Pujara, who is from the region, would make a comeback, taking Rohan Gavaskars place. However, Sourav and Whatmore are understood to have decided to cap Madhya Pradeshs Harpreet Singh Bhatia, an U-19 World Cupper.         
	So, two changes in the XI which lost to the Chennai Super Kings, on Tuesday.         
	Rohan hasnt come to Ahmedabad as he (and six others) have, for now, been relegated to the non-travelling party.         
	Others left behind in Calcutta include Mashrafe Mortaza and Ajantha Mendis. Both will probably be praying that they dont end up being passengers in the side.         
	Granted it was a day of travelling, from Bangalore, after the thrashing there on Thursday, but the Royals showed they are poor losers: Nobody from the team management bothered to interact with the media.         
	That, too, on the eve of a home game.         
	Conditions were very different, but for purposes of record, if not anything else, KKR beat the Royals the last time they faced each other  in Durban, last May.         
	Match starts: 4 pm.

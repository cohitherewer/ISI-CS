	New Delhi: Plagued by too many injuries, national coach Bob Houghton has requested the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to send two more players to the preparatory camp in Dubai.         
	According to AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, the coach wants East Bengal goalkeeper Sandeep Nandy and Dempo midfielder Joaquim Abranches to be sent as likely replacements for two injured players  Arindam Bhattacharya and Anthony Pereira.         
	We have received a communiqu from the national team in Dubai. I have already written to both the clubs requesting them to release the players in the national interest, Das said.         
	However, Sunil Chetri has recovered from his ankle injury and Bhaichung Bhutia is expected to be fit very soon.         
	In another development, Indias friendly match against Syria, which was supposed to be held on December 26, has been cancelled. AIFF sources said the decision to call off was taken after it was found that hosting the match would not be financially viable for the national federation.

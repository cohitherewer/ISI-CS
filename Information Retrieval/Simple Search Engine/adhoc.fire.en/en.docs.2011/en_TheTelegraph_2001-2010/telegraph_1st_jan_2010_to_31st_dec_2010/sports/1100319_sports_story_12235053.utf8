The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav sees no reason to panic

	Ahmedabad: It was close to 40 degrees C when flight 6E 409 from Calcutta touched down around 1.30 pm on Thursday. Some, including possibly a few from the Kolkata Knight Riders bowling party, gasped.         
	One had to sympathise with them, for the Shane Bonds have little time to acclimatise before Saturday afternoons IPL clash against the Rajasthan Royals, in Motera.         
	The first real test for physical trainer Adrian le Roux and physio Andrew Leipus is at hand.         
	While the Royals poor run is good news for the Knights, the high temperature is cause for concern. Its going to be a T20 face-off, alright, but in awfully hot conditions.         
	For the Royals, its home.         
	After two wins in as many days, the Knights lost to the Chennai Super Kings, on Tuesday, but captain Sourav Gangulys message is simple  dont panic.         
	Look, the IPL is a long tournament... Each franchise has to play a minimum of 14 matches... Yes, we lost the other night, but winning and losing is part of the game... Next time, we could be the ones to really turn the heat on the opposition, Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on arriving in Ahmedabad, Sourav (whod been greeted with a round of clapping on entering the aircraft in Calcutta), added: I have faith in my boys... Im happy that Chris Gayle has joined us.         
	The West Indies captain reached Ahmedabad on Thursday morning, after flights from Kingston to Miami to London to Mumbai. No surprise that he skipped the practice session in the evening.         
	Chris spent the day sleeping... He needed to rest after all this travelling, pointed out team director Joy Bhattacharjya.         
	Gayle, who was among the runs (273 at an average of 54-plus) in the just-ended ODI series against Zimbabwe, should be available for Saturdays match.         
	Ajit Agarkar, meanwhile, is better. A right calf muscle injury has kept him out so far, but hes expected to recover fully in the next four-five days.         
	I dont have an issue running... Now, its a question of going flat out at nets, Agarkar said.         
	Charl Langeveldt is also recovering, from a backside problem.

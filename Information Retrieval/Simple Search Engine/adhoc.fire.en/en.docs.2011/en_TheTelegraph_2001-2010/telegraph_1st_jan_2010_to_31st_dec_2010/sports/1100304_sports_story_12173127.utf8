	Calcutta: When Mohun Bagan take on Chirag United in their 14th round I-League encounter at Salt Lake Stadium Thursday, expect a duel within the battle.         
	This match will also be a face-off between Bagans most loved home-bred (ghorer chele as they are known in Maidan circles) footballers as coaches. In the Chirag dug-out, you will find the extrovert Subrata Bhattacharya  a shrewd tactician and a battle-hardened veteran who never forgets to mention the number of years he spent in the green-and-maroon jersey and the number of trophies he won as a player and the coach of the century-old club.         
	In the Bagan dug-out will be the introvert Satyajit Chatterjee  still raw as the independent in-charge of a big club. He had been a tireless warrior for Bagan for a decade and a half as a player. But on Thursday, the real test of Satyajits coaching abilities will start.         
	The duo, on Wednesday, tried to play down the Subrata versus Satyajit factor.         
	Mohun Bagan are a strong side and the players will have to push themselves hard in order to win, Subrata said, after his teams training session at the Central Park.         
	His opposite number Satyajit presented a dead bat to questions.         
	Subrata is a seasoned coach and Chirag are a good side. They beat us 3-2 in the first leg. So theres no way we can take them lightly, Satyajit remarked after an hours training.         
	The mindset of the two teams will be entirely different on Thursday. While Bagan will look to field a full-strength side for the first time in the season, Chirag will like to establish that they are not in the second spot on the table by chance.         
	Deepak Mondal, back from national duty will be at the heart of the green and maroon defence, partnering Shiekh Azim. Surkumar Singh and NS Manju will be the two wide men. James Singh and Ishfaq Ahmed will be the two wingers with Japanese Ryuji Sueoka and Brazilian Marcos Pereira manning the central midfield.         
	Prolific striker Edeh Chidi will be playing up front with Jose Ramirez Barreto. The Bagan coach, however, admitted that Chidi is still not hundred per cent match fit.         
	Im fielding Chidi because hes keen to play tomorrow (Thursday). There are two aspects of a player a coach looks at before fielding him  physical and mental. Mentally, he is more than 100 per cent fit. So Im taking a chance, Satyajit said.         
	Subratas team is on a high after winning the EK Nayanar Trophy in Kannur recently. The coach would want his players to keep the momentum so that they can finish among the top-five in the I-League.         
	Much will depend on how Subratas strike force, comprising Edmilson and Joshimar, perform. It was Joshimar who scored two goals during their first-leg victory.         
	Australian defender Mathew Grbesa may play as a defensive screen with Shylo Malsawmtluanga and Gouranga Biswas operating from the flanks.         
	A lot will depend on skipper Denson Devadas, who will be the chief provider for the Brazilian strike duo.         
	While Bagan will look to stamp their authority, one can only take Chirag lightly at his own peril.

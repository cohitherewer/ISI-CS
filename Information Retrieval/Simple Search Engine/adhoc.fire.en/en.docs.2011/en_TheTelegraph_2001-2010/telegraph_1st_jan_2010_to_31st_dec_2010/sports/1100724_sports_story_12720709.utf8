  - Butt amp; Co. need 40 more for victory with seven wickets in hand; Aamer claims 4/86             Pakistans Imran Farhat drives one en route to his 67 as Australias Tim Paine looks on, at Headingley, on Friday                           
	Leeds: Pakistan are on the verge of their first Test victory over Australia in 15 years, requiring 40 runs to level the two-match series, with two days remaining following impressive performances from Mohammed Aamer and Imran Farhat.         
	Aamer claimed four for 86 as Australia were bowled out for 349 to leave Pakistan requiring 180 to win, Farhat scored 67 to steer his team to 140 for three at stumps on the third day at Headingley.         
	Farhat hit nine fours in 95 balls, while Azhar Ali is unbeaten on 47 with five boundaries in 104 deliveries.         
	Australia opening bowler Doug Bollinger was the pick of the attack, taking two for 37 from eight overs.         
	The management told us to play positive cricket no matter whatever happens, Farhat said. All the bowlers and the batsmen are very keen. The atmosphere is very positive.         
	Earlier, a belligerent 77 from all-rounder Steven Smith allowing Australia to set Pakistan a tricky target that would have seemed unimaginable after their first innings of 88.         
	Smiths innings lasted 100 balls and included two sixes and nine fours, as Australias last three wickets added 103 runs.         
	It was good to get in amongst the runs, Smith said. I was lucky enough to hit a few over the fence, but weve got to believe in ourselves, bowl well tomorrow (Saturday) and hopefully come out and take a few wickets.         
	Michael Clarke hit 77 from 143 balls, including seven fours, while Ricky Ponting made 66 from 116 balls, with seven boundaries.         
	Australia began the day on 136 for two and, after surviving a series of appeals on Thursday, Pontings good fortune continued when he edged a delivery from Mohammed Asif just wide of second slip at the end of the second over of the day.         
	But the captains luck finally ran out in the next over, when Ponting slashed at a wide delivery from Aamer and was caught by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal.         
	Michael Hussey was Aamers next wicket, nicking the third ball of the 48th over to Umar Akmal at second slip for 8.         
	In Aamers next over, he bowled Marcus North for 0, to leave Australia five wickets down and still trailing by six runs.         
	That left Clarke as Australias sole specialist batsmen and he brought up his 50, from 99 balls, in the 52nd over with a single from Aamer.         
	A power failure in Leeds meant the players had to continue without a scoreboard or the services of the television umpire.         
	Clarke and Tim Paine survived to lunch only for Clarke, having batted for four hours, to perish in the second over of the afternoon session, caught behind off Asif.         
	Danish Kaneria claimed his first wicket of the Test with one of the worst balls of the match, a rank long hop that Paine chopped straight to Umar Gul at cover in the 75th over while on 33.

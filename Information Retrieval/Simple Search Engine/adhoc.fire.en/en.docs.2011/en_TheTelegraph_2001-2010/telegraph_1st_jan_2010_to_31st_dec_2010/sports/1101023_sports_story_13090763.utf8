                  Hamilton                     
	Yeongam: Life is looking up for Lewis Hamilton, despite a nightmare sequence of races and one of the most difficult years of his life on and off the Formula One circuit.         
	McLarens 2008 world champion, 28 points off the lead with three races remaining, said at the inaugural South Korean Grand Prix that he was confident things could only get better.         
	Its not been the greatest year for many, many reasons, said the Briton. Not just in Formula One but outside of Formula One. But things are on the up. I think they are. Everyone has times like this in their careers.         
	The battles not yet over, were still fighting for the championship, surprisingly, and its great to see the spirit within the team. I think they are all very energetic and committed, so thats good to see.         
	Since the season started in Bahrain in March, Hamilton has distanced himself from his father Anthony  previously his manager and a constant presence at races  and split and then reunited with Pussycat Dolls pop singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.         
	He was hauled over by police for reckless driving on city streets in Melbourne in March, earning a fine but escaping a conviction. He has also moved home from Geneva to Zurich.         
	There have been some memorable wins, such as in Canada and Belgium, and notable failures such as Monza and Singapore as well as a stint as championship leader.         
	Just the whole year has been difficult, family-wise, said Hamilton.         
	Of course things are better than they were back then, but nonetheless that still took a massive toll on my dad and my mum and my team. And its been different not having them here.

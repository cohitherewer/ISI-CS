    - Comfortable victory for Serena; Mankad-Bozoljac ousted             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Rafael Nadal celebrates after defeating Kei Nishikori in the first round, at Wimbledon, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                 
	London: There were few alarms and no dramas for Rafael Nadal on Centre Court Tuesday as he marked his first appearance at Wimbledon since his famous Championship win over Roger Federer in 2008 with a blissfully routine first round 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 victory over young Japanese player Kei Nishikori.         
	After Roger Federers travails 24 hours earlier, a capacity crowd wondered if they were in for another Wimbledon thriller but Nadal, the new world No. 1, imposed his authority on Nishikori from the start, slamming the door shut whenever his opponent threatened.         
	It was a very special moment coming back to the nicest centre court in the world and it was lovely being back in my favourite tournament, said a delighted Nadal afterwards. The crowd makes me feel very at home.         
	Indias Harsh Mankad with Serbian partner Ilija Bozoljac lost 3-6, 4-6, 2-6 to Argentinean duo Juan Ignacio Chela and Eduardo Schwank in the first round of the mens doubles.         
	Serena Williams began the defense of her Wimbledon title with a comfortable first-round win, relying on an overpowering serve to beat 17-year-old Michelle Larcher de Brito 6-0, 6-4.         
	Serena won all 27 points on her first serve and hit 15 aces, the last on her final shot. As the crowd applauded her victory, Serena curtsied, mindful Queen Elizabeth II is expected to visit Wimbledon for the first time since 1977 on Thursday.         
	She plays her second-round match that day and has been practising her curtsy.         
	I want it to be more natural, she said. Right now it feels really forced. Seems like Ive never done a curtsy before, which may be true. But Im looking forward to nailing it.         
	Neither French Open womens finalists survived the first round. Runner-up Samantha Stosur, ranked a career-high sixth, lost to Estonian qualifier Kaia Kanepi 6-4, 6-4, while Roland Garros winner Francesca Schiavone lost on Monday.         
	No doubt its a quick turnaround, Stosur said. The champions of the game can do it back to back. Thats the kind of pedestal that you want to try to look up to and try to get to yourself.         
	In other matches, two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova edged Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-4, No. 7-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska defeated Melinda Czink of Hungary 6-3, 6-3 and No. 10 Flavia Pennetta of Italy beat Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain 6-4, 6-0. Maria Sharapova advanced beating fellow Russian Anastasia Pivovarova 6-1, 6-0 in 54 minutes.         
	In mens play, No. 9 David Ferrer beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-4, 6-2, 6-3, and No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Robert Kendrick of the United States, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (8), 3-6, 6-4.         
	Britains Andy Murray comfortably beat Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic to move into the second round. Fourth-seeded Murray trailed 2-4 in the first set but reeled off 17 of the last 21 games to win 7-5, 6-1, 6-2 in just under an hour and three quarters.         
	American Sam Querrey, who won his first career grass-court title at Queens Club this month, advanced when Ukraine opponent Sergiy Stakhovsky retired because of illness trailing 7-6 (4), 6-3, 2-1.         
	Stakhovsky won the grass title this month at Den Bosch, Netherlands. No. 13 Mikhail Youzhny defeated Dudi Sela of Israel 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (2), while No. 19 Nicolas Almagro lost 7-6 (4), 7-6 (7), 6-2 to Andreas Seppi of Italy.         
	Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco lost to Italian Fabio Fognini in a first round upset. Verdasco was beaten 7-6 (9), 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-4 by the 80th-ranked Fognini, who sits 71 places below the 2009 Australian Open semi-finalist.         
	Serena played first on Centre Court and remained unbeaten in opening Grand Slam matches. Shes 43-0 in the first round at major events.         
	For her return to Wimbledon on a warm, sunny afternoon, the three-time champion wore a cream dress with red trim.         
	Strawberries and cream, she said.         
	Larcher de Brito, ranked 148th, has three wins over top-20 players but was overwhelmed at the start, needing 33 minutes to win a game. The teenager then began to play better.         
	She definitely packs a punch, Serena said. It was good for me, because most people that do play nowadays hit really hard. It was good to get someone that hit really hard early on.         
	Nishikori was no rabbit and worked Nadal hard in some of the rallies but Nadal was always able to produce the big shot when needed as he cruised to victory in just a touch over two hours.         
	A product of the Bollettieri Academy, Nishikori was voted ATP newcomer of the year in 2008 but is having to rebuild his game and confidence following the injury, after which his confidence dropped to 420 although he has now recovered to 189.         
	The Spaniard, whose 26 match unbeaten streak was broken at Queens earlier this month when he lost to Feliciano Lopez, started as he meant to continue by coming back form 40-0 to break Nishikori in the first game of the first set, demonstrating to his opponent that there would be no gifted games or points.         
	There was not let up and in no time at all Nadal had taken the first set 6-2 and after a very decent work out in the second set on a baking centre court he struck again at 4-4 to break and serve out for that set as well.         
	Nishikori kept battling gamely and even broke Nadal in the third set at 3-3 but Nadal, going through the gears, immediately broke back and was in no mood to allow thoughts of a fourth set.         
	The end was nigh and soon he was signing autographs in the sun and heading for the changing room.

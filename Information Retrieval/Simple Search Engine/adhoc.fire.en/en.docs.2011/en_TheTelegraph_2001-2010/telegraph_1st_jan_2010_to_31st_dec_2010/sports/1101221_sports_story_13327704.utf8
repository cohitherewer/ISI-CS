	Chennai: Former India captain and chairman of selectors Krishnamachari Srikkanth will use a Sachin Tendulkar straight drive to explain Newtons third law through online lessons that will teach science and maths to school kids using sports.         
	In his latest business venture Edustrokes.com, Srikkanth will use cricket, tennis, football, golf and F1 racing as examples to make the concepts of science and maths easy to grasp and interesting to follow. Cricket is one language that the whole of India understands and what better medium to teach complex and boring maths and physics than cricket? he asked while launching the portal.         
	The website will combine video, audio and text elements with Srikkanth  an electrical engineer himself  teaching maths by comparing pie charts to the wago-wheel about a batsmans stroke play. While the real learning will still happen in schools, what we are offering is value addition to make learning fun and interesting, he explained.         
	The former opener also launched his cricket coaching website  Cricketstrokes.com  for online coaching of cricketing skills. The coaching will happen in nets with me and NCA accredited coaches offering batting, bowling and fielding lessons, Srikkanth said.

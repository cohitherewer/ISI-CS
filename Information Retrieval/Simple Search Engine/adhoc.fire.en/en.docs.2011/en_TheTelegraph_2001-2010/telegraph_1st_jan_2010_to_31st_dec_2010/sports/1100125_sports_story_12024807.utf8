The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag United pay for profligacy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag United pay for profligacy
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United paid for their profligacy as JCT held the home team to a 1-1 draw in a 11th round I-League encounter at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	With 20 points from 11 games, Chirag held on to the fourth position in the league table, while JCT remained at ninth with 11 points from as many games.         
	Chirag should have gone three up within the first 20 minutes but for Joshimar whose lack of ideas continues to hurt his teams chances. Having lost four points from two home matches, Subrata Bhattacharya would definitely be a worried man before his team hit the road.         
	Chirag could have gone one up in the eighth minute when Jayanta Sen sent long ball for Edmilson but the Brazilian couldnt control it and the rival defence averted the danger. However in the 15th minute, skipper Denson Devadass inswinging free-kick was headed home by Joshimar. This was his eighth goal in the championship and is now on level terms with Chidi Edeh and Okolie Odafe.         
	JCT soon started coming out of their shell and in the 36th minute, Balwant Singhs innocuous cross from the left spelt doom. First, it was defender Arnab Mondal who failed to clear the ball and it landed to an unmarked Penn Orji whose powerful shot touched a diving Somnath Khanras hand to enter the net.         
	Two minutes later, Joshimars full-blooded drive was parried away by JCT goalkeeper Karanjit Singh. The easiest chance was wasted by Denson when Karanjit was at his mercy but his feeble shot went straight to the goalie.         
	With Bhattacharya replacing Edmilson in the 68th minute, the fizz was as good as gone from the Chirag attack.         
	In another match in Margao, Demp beat Sporting Clube de Goa 3-1 to move to the top of the standings.

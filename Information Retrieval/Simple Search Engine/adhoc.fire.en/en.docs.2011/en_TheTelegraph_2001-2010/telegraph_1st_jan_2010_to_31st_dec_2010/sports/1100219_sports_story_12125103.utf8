            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Graeme Smith was happy with his teams performance despite losing the second Test against Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co., on Thursday. At the news conference, he also credited Team India for bouncing back.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The failure at the Eden         
	At the end of the day, it was a terrific series. After winning the first Test, we had the opportunity at tea on Day I here. Going by where we were sitting, the game could have been easily over just after tea on that day. If anything, we created pressure on India In this series, they had everything to lose and we had everything to gain. So we have come up with our heads above the water in terms of what we have achieved. India really took the opportunity with both hands. We know, in the subcontinent its very difficult to play catch-up cricket.         
	Determination shown by the middle-order         
	I think the grit and determination was there the whole day. Some guys just got stuck in and it worked for them and some didnt. Hashim (Amla) was brilliant and guys like Morne (Morkel) and Wayne (Parnell) stuck in there.         
	Mark Bouchers absence         
	Maybe, that is where we lacked someone with experience, someone like Mark, who has played a huge amount of Test cricket. We just never had anyone who could stop the momentum that India gained in that last period.         
	If losing this Test will be a deterrent         
	This Test side has achieved some incredible results in the last two years... Achievements that other teams have not done in 16-20 years. We need to look at that. You must give credit to India for the way they performed today (Thursday). The fact that we could able to draw a series in India is a credit for our players.         
	Whether a two-Test series to judge the No. 1 spot is fair         
	We have come to India twice recently and have played five Tests. We have to wait when India tour South Africa at the end of the year We will take it from there.         
	His finger injury         
	I am just going to take rest when I get home. Its the medical team that take these decisions. Bones need some time to heal. Hopefully it heals quicker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil are trying to overcome anxiety 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazil are trying to overcome anxiety 
                      
	Johannesburg: Brazil still have two weeks left before making their World Cup debut, and players are struggling to find ways to overcome their anxiety.         
	The Brazilians have been focused on the World Cup since arriving in South Africa last Thursday, but it wont be until June 15 that         
	the tournament officially begins for the five-time world champions.         
	 As each day passes, the anxiety increases, midfielder Felipe Melo said. Its inevitable.         
	Brazil have been preparing for the World Cup since May 21, when nearly all players reported to the national team in the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba. The team is already immersed in the World Cup atmosphere, but the opener against North Korea in Johannesburg seems in the far distance.         
	Every day we are thinking about the World Cup, Felipe Melo said. Things start going through your mind, you start dreaming about whats going to happen.         
	Players will have a first taste of action in a friendly against Zimbabwe in Harare, and Brazil also will face Tanzania on Sunday in Dar es Salaam.         
	So far the players have been trying to get their minds off the World Cup by playing video games and other pastimes such as table tennis. In their only time off last week, some played golf near the teams hotel and others visited a shopping mall.         
	Brazil are trying to win their sixth World Cup title, the first since 2002 in South Korea and Japan. The players want to leave behind the bad impression of the elimination in Germany four years ago, when they fell to eventual runners-up France in the quarter finals.         
	Its a lot of responsibility, you are playing for your country, for millions and millions of people, Felipe Melo said.         
	Brazil enter the competition a favourite again even though Dunga left out from his squad stars such as Ronaldinho, Adriano and Ronaldo. He brought a revamped squad, with lesser-known players who helped the team achieve significant results since the coach took over after the 2006 World Cup.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Johannesburg: Uruguay reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1970, beating Ghana 4-2 on penalties after a1-1 draw Friday.         
	Asamoah Gyan had a chance to win the match for Ghana with the final kick of extra time, but he hit the crossbar with a penalty after Luis Suarez was sent off for handling the ball on the line. Sulley Muntari gave Ghana the lead with a 35-metre left-foot strike seconds before half-time at Soccer City, but DiegoForlan equalised from a free kick in the 55th minute.         
	Uruguay will play the Netherlands in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Cape Town. It was a superbly taken goal by Muntari that gave Ghana the lead at the breather. Muntaris strike, that came seconds before the half-time whistle, had the Uruguayans stunned and the capacity crowd ecstatic.         
	Muntari was not on the best of terms with coach Milovan Rajevac in the last couple of months. Although the Inter Milan player found a place in the squad, he did not make the starting XI in the last four matches.         
	On Friday, Muntari was sent in from the beginning and he grabbed the opportunity to showcase his talent. It was a brilliant goal as he cut in from the right to shoot home from around 25 yards out, giving Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera no chance. On a day when hot favourites Brazil crashed out of the World Cup, Ghana stepped on to the Soccer City pitch carrying all of Africas hopes on their shoulders. It was no less a man than Nelson Mandela who led the South Africans as they rallied behind the only team from the continent left in the World Cup.         
	We join everybody in the continent and of the diaspora in wishing you success in going forward, Mandela said in a letter to Ghanas football association.         
	Ghana began well against a Uruguay side that seemed determined to get past the round of eight for the first time in 40 years. In the 25th minute, Luis Suarez hit a cracking volley from the edge of the box but Ghana goalkeeper Richard Kingston displayed great agility in tipping the ball over.

	Karachi: The three-member committee, appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to probe the sudden disappearance of Zulqarnain Haider from the team hotel in Dubai earlier this month, submitted its report on Monday.         
	The PCB said in a statement that it has received the report of the fact-finding committee but would not comment any further on the matter.         
	The three member fact-finding committee formed by the PCB to establish the facts surrounding the incident of Zulqarnain Haiders disappearance from the team hotel in Dubai during the recent Pakistan vs South Africa series held a meeting at PCB headquarters today. The committee has finalized its report and submitted the same to PCB, the board said.         
	The PCB has no further comments to make on this matter at this stage, it added. According to sources, the finding of the committee was not in favour of Haider and its main concern remained that why he didnt contact the team management when he got threats.         
	Haiders wife, Iqra said she wants to leave the country and join her husband in London as she got threatening calls from unknown persons in the last few days.         
	She said she was scared for the safety of herself and her children and has reported the matter to Liaquatabad police station on Sunday.         
	I dont think the circumstances are right for me or my children to remain any longer in Pakistan, Iqra told a television channel.         
	We are getting daily threatening calls, we are told that even my children are not safe.         
	In these circumstances, how can I even send them out to play or to school. I just want to get away and join my husband in London with our children, she said.         
	Haider had written on his facebook page that he would expose people in five days time and sources close to him confirmed he was planning to hold a press conference on December 3 in which he could make some startling disclosures.

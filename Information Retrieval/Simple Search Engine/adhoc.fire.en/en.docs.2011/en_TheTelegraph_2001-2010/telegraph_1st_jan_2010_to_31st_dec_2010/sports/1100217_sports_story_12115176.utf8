	Calcutta: South Africas batting coach Kepler Wessels is confident that they will be able to hold on for a draw in the second Test.         
	Its a pretty good pitch. I think you can still bat on it for extended periods of time, he said, after the close on the third day. Clearly, were going to be under more pressure than India, so itll be more difficult. The ball should spin a little as the game goes on.         
	South African batsmen have had many such challenges over the last two years, and come through those quite well. This will be a difficult one, but thats what experienced top international batsmen are for. Theyve coped with it well in the past and will hopefully do so again tomorrow (Wednesday), he added.         
	The approach, he felt, was going to be crucial.         
	We cant just play the survival game. Weve still got to look to score runs and play a normal game  form partnerships and bat for long periods. Were in a position where we have to save the game to win the series. Theres two days of tough Test cricket ahead and well fight as hard as we can. In the first innings here, we were very loose. I think that was the problem, the former captain said.         
	In Hashim (Amla)s case, you can understand it because he batted for such a long time and so well in Nagpur. He was always going to go through phases where it was tough to concentrate for as long again. For Alviro (Petersen) in his first Test, reaching a milestone was quite an emotional thing. I think the guys all accept that there were too many loose shots and that got us into trouble.         
	Wessels blamed the fielding for their plight in the Test.         
	If you dont take your opportunities against a good side, youre going to pay the price, he remarked.         
	You cant drop good players and expect to get away with it, particularly on good surfaces like this. Its always difficult when you have to reinvent your slip cordon. Weve got an experienced keeper, but he is not playing. Even our most experienced first slip fielder wasnt there either. Its challenging but you have to adapt and take the opportunities that come your way.         
	Asked about their approach in the morning session on Tuesday, he said: We wanted to bowl well this morning, get some wickets and finish India off. We would have been happy with India getting a lead of 100 or so. But they played well, and we just couldnt get the breakthroughs.         
	I thought Dale Steyn bowled well with the second new ball. Morne Morkel came in with one good spell as well. But consistency is an issue for us, he said.         
	But Wessels wasnt surprised by Indias reply. We expected India to come back strongly, he said. Theyre a very good team in their own conditions. We certainly expected them to put up this sort of fight

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No match for Bolt 
                                                                                                                       7                                      No match for Bolt 
    - Carmelita Jeter beats veronica Campbell-Brown to gold           Simon Hart                                  
	It may not have been the very fast time he had confidently predicted, but Usain Bolts 100metres victory in 9.86 sec in Daegu was still comfortably quick enough to propel him to top of the world rankings on Wednesday.         
	The triple Olympic champion, competing in his first 100m race of the season, showed his rustiness with a poor start but, once into his giant stride, scorched away from his rivals to set the fastest legal time in the world this year by almost a 10th of a second.         
	Fellow Jamaican Michael Frater was a distant second while American Mike Rodgers was third.         
	Bolt, who smashed his own 100m world record with a time of 9.59 sec in Berlin last summer, has already run the fourth fastest 200m in history this season and the ease with which he triumphed in Daegu suggests he is in superb physical shape as he prepares to make his Diamond League debut over 200m in Shanghai on Sunday.         
	He has also lost none of his playfulness, hamming it up for the cameras in his customary style before the race as a crowd of 40,000 roared its approval in the stadium that will play host to the World Championships next year.         
	That race was really wonderful, Bolt told South Korean television network MBC. I really loved it and Im looking forward to next year because it was full of energy.         
	He said he came to South Korea to run in Daegu Stadium and determine what he should work on when he returns to the venue for next years worlds.         
	There is a high possibility of me improving on the world record next year, Bolt said.         
	American Carmelita Jeter, the second fastest woman in history, was also an impressive winner of the womens 100m, beating Olympic 200m champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, of Jamaica, in a time 11 seconds dead  the third fastest in the world so far this season.         
	Lolo Jones, the world indoor 60m hurdles champion, was upstaged by fellow American Ginny Powell in the 100m hurdles.         
	A poor start left Jones with too much to make up and though she was closing on Powell in the final strides, she finished a hundredth of a second outside Powells winning time of 12.77 sec.         
	Kenyas Pamela Jelimo, who won the Olympic 800m title in 2008 but who was a shadow of her old self last year, had a steady start to her international season, finishing her 800m race in second place behind Jamaican Kenia Sinclair.         
	Jelimo, who faces Britains Jenny Meadows over the same distance in Shanghai on Sunday, crossed the line in 2min 1.52 sec, with Sinclair triumphing in 2 min 0.51 sec.

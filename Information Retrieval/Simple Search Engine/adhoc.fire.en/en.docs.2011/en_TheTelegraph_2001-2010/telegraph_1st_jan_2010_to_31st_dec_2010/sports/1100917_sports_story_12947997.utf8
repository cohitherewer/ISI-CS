	Calcutta: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori believes his sides upcoming tours to Bangladesh and India are the perfect preparation for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011.         
	Speaking on this weeks edition of the ICCs weekly audio show, ICC Cricket World, Vettori says the experience of playing in the three host countries in 2010, ahead of next years showpiece ODI event, will provide his team with a competitive advantage over other teams.         
	I think we are pretty lucky to experience Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India before the World Cup, says the 31-year-old left-arm spinner.         
	We are going to get the best possible warm-up and any game time in the sub-continent is going to make a huge difference to our chances in the World Cup.         
	The all-rounder is excited about the prospect of captaining his side in the tournament and potentially becoming the first New Zealand player to lift the trophy.         
	I think its every cricketers dream to play in the World Cup and throw in the fact it is going to be in the sub-continent on the biggest possible stage. So the guys are excited about it, Vettori said.         
	For the New Zealand team to win the World Cup would be the ultimate achievement. I know the preparations are going on pretty well. The fact we have been to Sri Lanka, were going to Bangladesh soon and then we play some one-dayers in India gives us the best preparation leading into such an important tournament.

	New York: Mikhail Youzhny, the 12-seeded Russian, reached the quarter finals at the US Open, beating Tommy Robredo of Spain 7-5, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, on Tuesday. The 2006 US Open semi-finalist faced just three break points, but Robredo converted his only one in the third to win the set.         
	Robredo was the lowest-ranked man left in draw at No. 41. He won his matches in the second and third rounds when his opponents retired. Robredo has advanced to the fourth round in seven of his 10 trips to the US Open - and has lost that match every time. He was one of a record six Spanish men to reach the fourth round.         
	On Monday, the easy part was over for Roger Federer. The tournament is about to get a lot harder for the Swiss master. The 16-time Grand Slam champion is through to the quarter finals and in majestic form, but most of his main rivals are too. Only Andy Murray has made an early exit.         
	He booked his place in the last eight with a 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 win over Jurgen Melzer at the Arthur Ashe Stadium without ever having to play at his best. It will take a mighty performance from his rivals to stop him capturing a sixth title at Flushing Meadows but there are some willing challengers ahead.         
	His next opponent is Robin Soderling, the big-hitting Swede who ended Federers French Open defence earlier in the season. If he gets through that, Federer could then face Serbias Novak Djokovic, who beat him in the semi-finals at the Australian Open in 2008.         
	There is also Rafael Nadal, as always, lurking on the other side of the draw if they both reach the final. Federer may be the greatest player of all time but nothing is ever assured. Soderling and Djokovic also moved through to the quarter finals by winning on Monday.         
	Soderling overcame Albert Montanes, one of six Spaniards who made the last 16 of the mens draw, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. It was a workmanlike performance but Djokovic was all class and looks the more threatening. The world No. 3 demolished the improving American Mardy Fish 6-3, 6-4, 6-1.         
	Caroline Wozniacki cleared one of the major hurdles in her bid to win the womens title when she eased past an error-prone Maria Sharapova, who is still battling to regain her best form after struggling with injuries for the past two seasons.         
	Sharapova was soundly beaten 6-3, 6-4 but contributed to her own downfall with 36 unforced errors and nine double faults, including three in successive points. Her shrieks echoed around the centre court.         
	She was one of two former US Open champions from Russia that were beaten in straight sets. Svetlana Kuznetsova also departed, losing 7-5, 7-6 to diminutive Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova, leaving Vera Zvonareva to fly the flag.         
	Djokovic, getting better with each match after a shaky start to the tournament, provided a reminder of the form that saw him reach the final in 2007 then capture his maiden Grand Slam in Melbourne the following year with his best performance of the championship. Next in line for Djokovic is Gael Monfils who overpowered his countryman Richard Gasquet 6-4, 7-5, 7-5 to become the first Frenchman in a decade to reach the quarter finals.         
	Soderling has developed a reputation of a giant-killer after beating Nadal at the French Open last year the Federer this season. The odds are stacked against toppling Federer on the super-fast courts in New York but he holds no fears.         
	Estonias Kaia Kanepi recovered from a horrendous start to wear down Belgiums Yanina Wickmayer 0-6, 7-6, 6-1 and reach the last eight against Zvonareva after the latter beat Germanys Andrea Petkovic 6-1, 6-2.         
	Leander Paes and partner Cara Black bowed out of the mixed doubles event, where they had been runners-up last year. Paes and his Zimbabwean partner Cara, fell to Anna-Lena Groenefeld of Germany and Bahamas Mark Knowles 3-6, 4-6 in the quarter finals. With this loss, Paes US Open journey ended as he had earlier lost in the mens doubles with Lukas Dlouhy.

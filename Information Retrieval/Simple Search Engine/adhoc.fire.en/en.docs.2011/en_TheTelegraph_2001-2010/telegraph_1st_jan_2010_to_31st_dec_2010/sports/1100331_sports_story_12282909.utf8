The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia close in on sweep
                                                                                                                       7                                        Australia close in on sweep
                  Mitchell Johnson                     
	Hamilton: Mitchell Johnson took out his frustration at a first Test pair by hurting New Zealand and putting Australia on track for a comfortable clean sweep here Tuesday.         
	Johnson stung the hosts in their impossible pursuit of 479 with three for 39, and left a few physical bruises as well during hostile spells either side of tea, according to Cricinfo.         
	New Zealand need a world record to successfully chase the score and level the series. But there is little chance of that after another modest top-order performance left them at 185 for five. While the pitch is still excellent and the forecast is for another sunny day, they still require 294 runs, with only Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum capable of staying at the wicket for a long period.         
	They will do well to make it to lunch if Johnson repeats the effort he produced after Marcus Norths 90 rushed Australia towards their lunch-time declaration of 511 for eight. Johnson removed Tim McIntosh and Bradley-John Watling before tea, and after the break, delivered the crucial blow when Ross Taylor edged a ball angled across him.         
	There was no respite for the batsmen when Johnson was involved as he operated around 150kph and moved the ball teasingly at times. New Zealand had to open with a century stand or more to have a chance and they did well until Johnson came on as second change.         
	In his second over, he bowled McIntosh with an off-cutter that darted between pad and a diagonally defensive bat. Johnson quickly made Sinclair wince, hitting him in the back with a short one that deflected for four leg byes.         
	Four overs later, Watling pushed Johnson through cover for a boundary, but departed going for a repeat and edging to Brad Haddin.

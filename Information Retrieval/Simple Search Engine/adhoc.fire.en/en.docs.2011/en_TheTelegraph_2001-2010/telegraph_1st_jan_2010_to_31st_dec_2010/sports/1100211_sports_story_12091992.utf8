	Calcutta: East Bengal pumped in four goals in the final 14 minutes, whipping Peerless SC 5-0 in an eighth round match of the CFL Premier Division at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. The glamour outfit led 1-0 at half-time.         
	However, with the double substituition of Alvito DCunha and Abel Hammond in the second half, the intensity of the red and gold attack suddenly increased. As a result, the Peerless defence lay in tatters.         
	It was Harmanjyot Singh Khabra who opened the account in the 18th minute when he was allowed a free header off a Sanju Pradhan flag-kick. Goalie Surabuddin Chowdhury failed to save the goal despite being near the ball.         
	Peerless got a chance to equalise in the 34th minute when Arup Singhas pile driver was tipped over by East Bengal custodian Avijit Ghosh.         
	It was after Alvito and Hammonds introduction that East Bengal suddenly looked more dangerous.         
	With Sanju Pradhan operating from wide right, the red-and-gold brigade started creating more openings. Budiram Tudu, another substitute, headed home an Alvito free-kick to make it 2-0 in the 76th minute.         
	Within a minute, the score was 3-0 when Hammond took his marker in the stride and unleashed a powerful right-footer that dipped at the time of entering the net.         
	Alvito then unleashed a cracking left-footed grounder to get his name on the scorers list.         
	The final goal was scored in the 89th minute when Poibang Poshna was freed on the left side of the box by Sanju. The youngster coolly slotted it past a surging Surabuddin to complete the rout.         
	Phillippe de Ridder looked a content man after the match. His team has now scored as many as eight goals in the last two encounters. East Bengal now have 17 points from eight matches and have moved up to the third position on the league table after Mohun Bagan and Chirag United.         
	Peerless are 12th, with nine points from 12 games.         
	In another match, Kalighat beat Eastern Railway 2-0 at Khardah with Bikram Singh scoring both the goals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Novak, Andy in Round III
                                                                                                                       7                                      Novak, Andy in Round III
                      
	Paris: World No. 4 Andy Murray came from a set down to sink Argentine David Nalbandian 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the Paris Masters second round on Wednesday.         
	There were also straight-sets victories for second seed Novak Djokovic and No. 8 Andy Roddick.         
	In the doubles, Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy advanced to the quarter finals of the Paris event after registering a tough three-set win over the American pair of John Isner and Sam Querry.         
	The third-seeded Indo-Czech pair came from behind to beat unseeded rivals 6-7(3), 7-5, 10-6 in an hour and 32 minutes in the second round of the euro 2,750,000 ATP event.         
	Paes and Dlouhy saved seven breakpoints in the pre-quarter finals match, but also squandered six chances in their rivals serve.         
	The only time they broke the Americans was in the second set, which helped them draw parity, having lost the opening set.         
	Murray made an early exit in Valencia last week and looked sluggish again as he lost serve in the third and fifth games, like many of the players this week struggling to adapt to the fast court.         
	Nalbandian, though, visibly tired after having his serve broken at the end of the second set.         
	At 2-2 in the third the Briton called for the trainer to massage his right wrist and that galvanised him to take four of the last five games.         
	Murray next plays 13th-seeded Croatian Marin Cilic who beat Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.         
	Cilics 15th-seeded compatriot Ivan Ljubicic will be packing his bags after losing 4-6, 4-6 to Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka.         
	Serb Djokovic was also in trouble early on against Argentine Juan Monaco before recovering to win 6-4, 6-3.         
	Its a very fast court ... a lot more different than last year and its quite a change that you have to adjust to, said defending champion Djokovic.         
	Its rare to find a very fast court these days.         
	Djokovic next faces Frenchman Michael Llodra or American John Isner.         
	Roddick breezed past Finnish qualifier Jarkko Nieminen 6-1, 6-4 to set up a meeting with Latvian Ernests Gulbis.         
	The big-hitting American is trying to qualify for this months ATP Tour Finals in London and holds the last remaining spot ahead of Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who won his second-round match in Paris on Tuesday.         
	Every match I win is significant at this point ... it puts pressure on the guys behind me, said Roddick.         
	The last thing you want is to be at home cheering against somebody hoping that something bad happens to them.         
	Roddick fired nine aces as his serve and volley game prevailed on the quick surface.           (AGENCIES)

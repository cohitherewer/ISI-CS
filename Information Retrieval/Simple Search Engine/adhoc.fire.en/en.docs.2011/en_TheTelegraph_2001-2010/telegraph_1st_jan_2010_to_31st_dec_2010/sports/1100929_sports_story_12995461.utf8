	New Delhi: After days of uncertainly and uneasiness, normalcy seems to have been restored to the Commonwealth Games.         
	On Tuesday, probably for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (OC) didnt receive any serious complaint from foreign athletes over the facilities at the Games Village and several training venues.         
	On Tuesday, around 850 athletes arrived in the capital, including Canadian Susan Nattrass, a six-time Olympian and seven-time world trap shooting champion. She has two silver and three bronze medals in the Games to her credit.         
	The Jamaican contingent, comprising Allodin Fothergill (mens 400 metres), Lerone Clarke (mens 100m), Oshane Bailey, who held the No.1 position for 100 metres at the Reebok Grand Prix in 2009 and Ricardo Cunningham, an 800 metres specialist has also arrived.         
	The side also has some surprises, including IAAF World Junior Championships 100m bronze medallist Remaldo Rose. Kenia Sinclair, national record holder in the 800m and IAAF Continental Cup double gold medallist hurdler Nickesha Wilson are also in the fray.         
	Also in Delhi are the Australian womens hockey team, winners of three Olympic gold medals, five World Cup titles, three Commonwealth Games medals and 12 Champions Trophy titles.         
	The Aussie coach Frank Murray identified India as a major threat in this Games. Competition this time is going to be tough, he said. England and New Zealand are also very good sides.         
	To add to the delight of the OC, most of the visiting delegations had nothing but fulsome praise for the facilities and the latest to join the chorus was Steve Moneghetti, the chef de mission of the Australian squad.         
	A bitter critic of the Games organisation only a few days back, Moneghetti, a former CWG marathon gold medallist, said: We are pleased and happy with facilities at the Village. We will do everything to top the medals tally in the Games.         
	He, however, however, said that the Aussies would abide by the security restrictions over the movement of the athletes till the Commonwealth Games are over.         
	Moneghetti said the Games security advisory is not to wear their team jerseys outside the venues to avoid being possible terror targets. Athletes from England, Canada and New Zealand have also similarly been advised not to go out sporting their colours.         
	We have not got any official word from ACGA (Australian Commonwealth Games Association) on the security advisory, but security in general here is perfect and the agencies are not taking any chances with the athletes. It is too dangerous to leave the Games Village. They have some strict security procedure in place, Moneghetti said at the Village.         
	We cannot move around freely. The athletes have to come back to the Village after finishing the events and can only go to cheer their fellow compatriots at other venues. They will be allowed to move freely only after the Games are over, he said.         
	Sensing the positive buzz, OC chairman Suresh Kalmadi asserted that all the 71 participating nations have reposed full faith in them to pull off a spectacular show.         
	Three thousand athletes and officials have already entered, many (visitors) are coming and returning home satisfied. Let me tell you that all the 71 participating nations have full confidence that we will do it well.         
	Notwithstanding the controversy and all the bad publicity that has come out, I want to make it clear that the Commonwealth Games infrastructure is fully ready the Games Village is in place, Kalmadi said.         
	Also, to check into the Village were the South African athletes in two different batches.         
	The Village is very comfortable and we are happy with the developments, said the South African contingents media spokesperson Mark Keohane.

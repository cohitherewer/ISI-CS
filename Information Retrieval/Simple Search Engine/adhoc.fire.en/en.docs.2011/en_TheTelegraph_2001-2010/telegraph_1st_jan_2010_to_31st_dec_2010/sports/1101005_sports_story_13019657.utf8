The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boxers stumped by faulty machines
                                                                                                                       7                                      Boxers stumped by faulty machines
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Boxing continues to be plagued by various problems in the Delhi Commonwealth Games.         
	In a farcical situation on Monday, the weigh-in session became a nightmare for Australian boxers after the scales at the venue started showing incorrect readings.         
	According to Australian boxing officials, the scales at the venue were showing erroneous readings prompting the boxers to work out more to make the cut for their respective categories. The Aussie boxing contingent was miffed so much so that their captain Luke Woods accused the organisers of putting the boxers health at risk because of faulty weighing machines.         
	The Australians are right. The scales were definitely faulty, an Indian boxer told The Telegraph. During the weigh-in session, all our weights were coming more. We were afraid and went for runs and then sauna baths. Still, the machine displayed faulty weights, he added.         
	A few days back Akhil Kumar complained of being allotted a broken bed in the Games Village. The incident created ripples forcing the Indian Boxing Federation to ask the pugilists not to talk to the media during the Games.         
	While the Indians did not register any complaint, the Aussies were livid with anger. That the scales were really faulty was found out when a 50kg weight brought in from the gymnasium read 51.4kg in the weighing machine.         
	Boxers, all over the world, drop four or five kilos of their natural weight just to make the division and they are already dehydrated and havent eaten or drunk in 24 hours, Woods said.         
	But the Technical Delegate for the event, Ray Silva said the entire weigh-in session took place peacefully.         
	Everything was OK. Today was not the competition weigh-in. It was a general weigh-in in which the boxers are put into their respective categories. The competition weigh-in is Tuesday morning when the bouts will start and it is here that the boxers have to weigh according to the category they are in. It is routine stuff, Silva said.

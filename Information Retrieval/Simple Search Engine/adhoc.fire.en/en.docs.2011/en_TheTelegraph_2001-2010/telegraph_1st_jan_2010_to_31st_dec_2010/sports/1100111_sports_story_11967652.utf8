            A STAFF REPORTER            Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly, flanked by coach Dav Whatmore and consultant Wasim Akram, at the Eden, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Wasim Akram has been a royal addition to the Knights camp and he is confident that the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will be third time lucky in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The former Pakistan captain, donning the consultants cap for the KKR, felt that theres enough talent in the franchises rank to improve from their woeful showing during the last two editions.         
	The morale of these youngsters is high. With the skipper determined to do well, theres no reason why KKR shouldnt do well in the IPL, Akram said at a media conference at the Eden Sunday.         
	Last year they faltered as the conditions (in South Africa) were different. This time, they only have to look up to their captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Dav (Whatmore).         
	He seemed impressed with the current batch. They were very impressive. Particularly (Manoj) Tiwary and (Laxmi Ratan) Shukla were excellent. I had first seen Shukla 11 years back (India vs Pakistan 1998-99 series) and he has come a long way from then. He can be match-winner for us.         
	The former pacer, revealed that a bowlers success in the shortest format of the game depended on variations.         
	I dont agree that T20 is a deathbed for bowlers. After all, its just a game. To succeed in T20s, variations are important. The bowlers should read the batsmen and accordingly use variations. The period between 6-13 overs is vital in T20s and matches are won or lost according to strategies you take during that period, he said.         
	I have been working on the slowers and yorkers in the camp as they are the key in this format.         
	Among the bowlers who attended the camp, he picked Varoon Aaron and Eklah Ahmed for special praise. Speaking on Sri Lankan Ajantha Mendis, who joined the camp Sunday, Akram said: Nothing is lost with Mendis, I have been talking to him. All he needs is a little confidence. When Saqlain Mushtaq came to the international arena, it took time for the people to recognise his talent. Mendiss is a similar case. He is an excellent prospect for the KKR.         
	Meanwhile, in a practice match among the Knights, at the Eden, on Sunday, Murali Kartik XI defeated Sourav Ganguly XI by 4 runs.

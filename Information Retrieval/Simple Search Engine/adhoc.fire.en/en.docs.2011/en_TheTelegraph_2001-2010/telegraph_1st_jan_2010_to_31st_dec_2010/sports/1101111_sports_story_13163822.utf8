	New Delhi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Aamer, one of the prime accused in the spot-fixing scandal, Wednesday said that he doesnt expect people to forgive him because he didnt do anything wrong.         
	Aamer feels that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) left them in the lurch after the ICCs suspension but said he is still waiting for justice.         
	When it all started, the Board was with us But after the ICC ruling, the PCB has gone on the back foot, he said.         
	If I havent done any wrong, then why should I hope that people will forgive me because I am young, he said.         
	Aamer, along with Mohammed Asif and Salman Butt were provisionally suspended by the ICC after their names cropped up in the spot-fixing scandal.         
	While Asif withdrew his appeal against the suspension, Aamer and Butts appeals were dismissed earlier this month by the ICC code of conduct commissioner Michael Beloff.         
	Beloff will now form an independent anti-corruption tribunal that will look into the actual charges and give a verdict.         
	Aamer said he is still hoping that justice will be done. I still hope We are first waiting for the ICC to give us a date for the final hearing. Only the hearing can decide whether we will play or not, he said.           (PTI)

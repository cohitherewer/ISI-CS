	Hamilton: Spinner Nathan McCullum took four wickets to bowl New Zealand to a 39-run win over Pakistan in the second Twenty20 International and to an insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	After New Zealand had made a competitive 185 for seven having being sent in to bat in damp conditions, McCullum raced through the Pakistan middle order to finish with four for 16 from four overs.         
	Pakistan were left 146 for nine after their 20 overs, conceding the series ahead of the final match in Christchurch on Thursday.         
	Earlier, Martin Guptill made 44 and James Franklin 40 to lead New Zealands recovery after they lost opener Jesse Ryder to the first ball of the match.         
	McCullum dismissed Younis Khan for 3, Asad Shafiq for 6, Abdul Razzaq for 14 and Umar Gul for 0, then took two catches to provoke the collapse of the Pakistan innings.

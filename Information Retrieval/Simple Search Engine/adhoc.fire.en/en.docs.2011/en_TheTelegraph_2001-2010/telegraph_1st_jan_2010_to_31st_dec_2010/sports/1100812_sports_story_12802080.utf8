The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Emergency exit at the Eden
                                                                                                                       7                                      Emergency exit at the Eden
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) brass has been instructed by the police authorities to construct an emergency exit door at the Eden Gardens, for security reasons during next years World Cup. The CAB officials along with the architects met police authorities at Lalbazar where a detailed assessment of security of the renovated stadium was discussed.         
	The meeting was addressed by joint commissioner of police Javed Shamim and was attended by CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey and treasurer Subir Ganguly along with the architects.         
	The emergency exit door will be constructed at the High Court End. Normally, the players and match officials use the main entrance to the Dr BC Roy Club House. However, in case, a security problem arises, the players can safely leave the venue through the opposite entrance of the stadium, a senior official informed.         
	The police authorities also want six permanent watchtowers around the stadium, which will help them monitor the proceedings minutely.         
	The other suggestion is to provide basic facilities to the spectators in each of the tiers. Normally, during breaks, the spectators of the upper tiers come down in search of refreshment and drinking water. The police has instructed that there should be food and water stalls (selling pouches) in upper tier as well so that they dont face problems while controlling the spectators during breaks, he added.         
	Meanwhile, the Bengal probables will be selected in the last week of August and the training camp will only commence once coach W.V. Raman arrives. Physical trainer Chinmoy Roy, in all likelihood will be back with the senior team after he was appointed the trainer of the junior team last year.         
	The CAB is also planning to retain Shyam Sundar Jaypalan as the physio.

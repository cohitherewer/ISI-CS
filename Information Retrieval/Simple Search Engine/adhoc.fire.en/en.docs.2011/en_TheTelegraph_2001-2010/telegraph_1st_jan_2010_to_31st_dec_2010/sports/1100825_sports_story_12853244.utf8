                                                                                                                       7                                      Damani in Asian Games squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Brijesh Damani will be representing India in snooker, in the Asian Games, later this year. The snooker squad comprises Pankaj Advani, Aditya Mehta and Damani. Yasin Merchant is the reserve. The billiards squad consists Advani and Geet Sethi.         
	Indias No.2 in 6-Red snooker, Damani made the squad after finishing overall third, after four preparatory camps. Indias top nine players competed in a league format over 60 days. I ended eighth in the first camp, then came first in the second one.         
	Overall, I ended third after four camps. The last camp was held in Bangalore, said Damani, who will leave for the National Snooker Championships in Pune, next week. Before they leave for China, the squad will participate in a conditioning camp in Bangalore, in October.         
	Damani, Mehta and Manan Chandra had won the gold in the Asian Indoor Games, in Vietnam, last year. The same participants will be playing at the Asian Games this year. The Chinese are very good but UAE players are always the dark horses. Thus, it will be anybodys game, he said.         
	The Asian Games are a very important meet for us. So, we will try to do our best, he added.         
	Damani had represented India in the World Snooker Championship last year but lost in the top 64. Along with Advani, he will represent India next year, in the World 6-Red Championships.

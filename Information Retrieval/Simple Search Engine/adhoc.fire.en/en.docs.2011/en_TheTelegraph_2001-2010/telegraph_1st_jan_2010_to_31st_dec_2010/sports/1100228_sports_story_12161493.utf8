	New Delhi: Although all eyes are on Sundays face-off between India and Pakistan, it is three non-Asian nations  Australia, Germany and the Netherlands  that remain the actual contenders for the title in the hockey World Cup.         
	Germany, winners in the last two editions, in 2002 and 2006, would surely be gunning for a hattrick but captain Maximilian Muller said that, this time, they would be happy with a semi-final spot.         
	We are a young team and have no pressure on us, said the German captain.         
	The Australians, on the other hand, have sent a full team and are considered by many, including the German skipper, to be the favourites for the title.         
	The Aussies are led by striker Jamie Dwyer, the 2009 World Player of the Year and a 2004 Olympic champion.         
	As for the Dutch, they will be hoping to recapture the form that saw them win three major titles between 1996 and 2000  two Olympics and a World Cup.

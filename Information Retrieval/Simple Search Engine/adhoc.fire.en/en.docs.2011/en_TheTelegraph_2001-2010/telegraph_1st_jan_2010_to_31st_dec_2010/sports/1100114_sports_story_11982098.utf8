The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lankans have the last laugh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sri Lankans have the last laugh
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Dhaka: Team Indias final blues returned to haunt them at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium on Wednesday.         
	The Indians were made to pay for their top-orders recklessness and, although Suresh Raina brought them back in it with a fine century, there was no stopping the Sri Lankans in the Idea Cup. In keeping with the track record at the tournament, the team batting second won.         
	The target of 246 was never intimidating and the Lankans exacted revenge for their loss in the one-day series in India.         
	Upul Tharangas dismissal in the first over did raise Indian hopes but Kumar Sangakkara (55) and Tillekaratne Dilshan (49) led the recovery with a 92-run stand.         
	Things did look up for India once the pair was dismissed in quick succession with Thilan Samaraweera and Thilina Kandamby following suit, but Mahela Jayawardene held fort.         
	At 189 for five, it could have gone either way. Jayawardenes unbeaten 71 off 81 balls though, put paid to Indian hopes.         
	The former Lanka captains experience and cool demeanour made their four-wicket victory look easy.         
	Man of the Match Nuwan Kulasekaras four-wicket burst, too, played a crucial role.         
	India were always a bowler short once Ashish Nehra was forced to limp off after 1.2 overs. Sreesanths profligacy added to their woes once he had given away 37 runs in his first spell of four overs.         
	Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh tried hard to maintain a grip on the proceedings but Jayawardene wasnt ready to let the advantage drift.         
	The off-spinner was superb with a probing line and was getting the ball to spin and bounce. The absence of dew on the day, though, made it slightly easier.         
	It was a pity that Suresh Rainas 106 off 125 balls proved came to nought in the end.         
	The match was as good as over in the first 40 minutes once the Indians were reduced to 60 for five.         
	Sangakkaras decision to put India into bat must have been led by the expected dew factor but the overcast and chilly conditions also worked in Sri Lankas favour.         
	A combination of indiscreet shot selection and disciplined line and movement by the new-ball bowlers led to the disaster as Kulasekera and Chanaka Welegedara held centre stage. The top-order showed a lack of application and temperament during a period of chaos that ultimately decided the course of the game.         
	Gautam Gambhir was bowled off his pads round the leg trying to glance Kulasekera off the third ball of the match. That sparked the decline as wickets fell in a heap.         
	Last-match centurion Virat Kohli left in the next over chasing a wide delivery while Yuvrajs poor run continued when he flirted with a rising delivery. Mahendra Singh Dhoni paid the penalty for failing to hold back his drive without getting to the pitch of the ball.         
	Virender Sehwag, fresh from a two-match break, seemed unperturbed by the mayhem around as he went about the job in his carefree style and approach. He drove and cut with disdain as boundaries came in a flurry.         
	After reaching 42 off 27 balls, Sehwag could no longer restrain the upper cut as Kulasekera dug in short for Sangakkara to hold on to another edge.         
	It seemed like a losing cause in the 11th over as Raina and Ravindra Jadeja got together.         
	The senior pro took the responsibility of rebuilding the innings as Jadeja played second fiddle. They were alert in taking their singles and waited for the loose delivery.         
	After living dangerously in the initial stages, Raina grew in confidence as he responded to the challenge with maturity. He never let the pressure affect him and picked the gaps with deft placement and timing.         
	The pair put together 106 runs for the sixth wicket. Jadeja was content to rotate the strike and his 38 off 64 balls didnt feature a single boundary.         
	Rainas third ODI century  his previous two were against Hong Kong and Bangladesh  reaffirmed his position in the middle-order. More importantly, he di not appear overawed by the circumstances and played his natural game.         
	Once Jadeja departed, the late-order failed to keep up the good work. It was perhaps in utter desperation that Raina tried to be over-ambitious in the closing stages only to pay the penalty.         
	The Indian innings didnt last long and folded in 48.2 overs.

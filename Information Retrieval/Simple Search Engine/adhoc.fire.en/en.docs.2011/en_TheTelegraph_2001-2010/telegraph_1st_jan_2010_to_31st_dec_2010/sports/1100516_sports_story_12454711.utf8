                                                                                                                       7                                        Modi files 12,000-page reply
                  Lalit Modi                     
	Mumbai: Suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi Saturday responded to the first show cause notice served to him for alleged financial irregularities with a staggering 12,000-page reply which was carried into the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters in six large cartons.         
	Modi, who had got an extension of five days from the May 10 deadline, submitted his reply through his lawyers, who brought in the papers in four cars amidst the media frenzy at the Cricket Centre, the Boards headquarters.         
	The BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty received the papers and documents on behalf of the Board.         
	Modis lawyer Memmood S Abdi said the reply comprised of 12,000 pages but did not elaborate on the content.         
	According to sources close to Modi, the suspended IPL commissioner has refuted all the five charges levelled against him by the BCCI. A source said that Modis reply has run into several thousand pages as it contained detailed response to all the charges and were supported with documents and brochures.         
	Modi was suspended on April 26, soon after the conclusion of the IPL-III final in Navi Mumbai by the BCCI which sent him a show cause notice asking him to reply to a slew of charges relating to the conduct of the high-profile Twenty20 league.         
	Modi is accused of indulging in murky financial deals without the knowledge of the IPL governing council, bid-rigging and taking kickbacks from the TV rights and internet deals.         
	Modis problems were compounded when he was slapped with a second show cause notice by the Board for allegedly trying to provoke English counties to revolt against the ECB, and start a parallel T20 league.         
	Now the Boards three-member disciplinary committee, comprising president Shashank Manohar and two vice-presidents  Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin, will take a decision on the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Was a good toss to lose, says Gayle
                                                                                                                       7                                      Was a good toss to lose, says Gayle
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis comments at the post-match presentation ceremony on Sunday made it clear that he is not bothered about the mathematical possibilities that can still keep India in the hunt for a berth in the semi-finals of the World Twenty20.         
	After his teams 14-run loss against the West Indies, Dhoni said that winning against Sri Lanka (in their last Super Eight match) would be a mere consolation prize before they get back home.         
	Unhappy with the teams batting, Dhoni also didnt hide his displeasure about the abject failure of his much-vaunted batting line-up.         
	His opposite number, Chris Gayle, however, in a roundabout manner questioned the logic of fielding first on the Kensington Oval wicket stating that he considered it a good toss to lose.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Gayle: It is a good victory for us. We wanted to win this one and I am really happy with the result. Personally, I was under a bit of pressure, so I am happy that I have scored runs and contributed to the teams cause. The team was also under a bit of pressure after defeat in the last match. So it was important to come out with all guns blazing. We needed to play positive as well as good cricket in order to win against the Indians and we did just that. I believe it was a good toss to lose under the circumstances. On this track, 169 was a good score to defend. The bowlers really put in a lot of effort. (Darren) Sammy started it all with a good opening spell. Kemar Roach and Jerome Taylor also chipped in with some valuable overs. Overall, it was a fantastic performance. Hopefully, we can continue our good run and make it to the semi-finals.         
	Dhoni: It is indeed very disappointing that we have now lost back-to-back matches. Our batsmen havent been able to perform according to their potential and that has affected our performance badly. I would say that the bowlers did a pretty decent job, save a few overs here and there. But it is our batting that has let us down. I agree that 170 was a big score but the wicket was a good one to bat on. Hitting sixes on this ground isnt a difficult thing. When you have players who have played a lot more matches than the opposition, you expect them to do the job Especially, when you have a batting line-up like ours. One more match is left and it will be like a consolation prize if we could beat Sri Lanka.

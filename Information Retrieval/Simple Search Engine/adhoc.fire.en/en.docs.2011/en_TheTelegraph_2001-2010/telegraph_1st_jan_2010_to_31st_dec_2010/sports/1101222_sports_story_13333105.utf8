The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Delphi may strike again
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Delphi may strike again 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Trainer Pesi Shroffs smart sprinter Delphi is strongly fancied to lift the upper division of the 1,100m Freelancer Cup, Wednesdays main attraction in the eight-event card. The Emerald Cat-Bongusto filly won her last outing the way she liked. With jockey C. Alford in the saddle, she is expected to defy the stiff penalty slapped on her for the victory.          
	The lower division of the trophy may see a close contest between Accardo (S. Sunil-up) and Alfords another ride, Oceanaire. However, Accardo last run behind Agent Archie points to the winning chances of the Vikash Jaiswal trained horse.          
	Vijay Singhs debutante Melody Belle, may account for Shershah in the Angeles Plate.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

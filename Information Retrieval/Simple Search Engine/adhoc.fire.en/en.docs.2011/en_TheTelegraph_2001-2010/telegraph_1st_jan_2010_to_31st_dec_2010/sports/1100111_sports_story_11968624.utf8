The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Obilale is safe after surgery
                                                                                                                       7                                      Obilale is safe after surgery
                      
	Johannesburg: Togo reserve goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale went under surgery at a South African hospital after being wounded by gunfire when the Togo soccer teams bus was attacked in Angola, a medical official said on Sunday.         
	At this early stage we are satisfied with the progress of Obilale.         
	He is at present in the trauma intensive care unit where he will remain until such time as we are satisfied with his condition, Elias Degiannis, in charge of the team taking care of Obilale at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, said in a hospital statement.         
	The operation went smoothly, Degiannis added.         
	Degiannis said more will be known about the extent of Obilales injuries and future in the next day or two, when the player is again alert and breathing on his own.         
	On Saturday, there were reports that Obilale was feared dead, but the news that he is alive came as a relief to all.         
	Milpark doctors initially said Obilale had been hit by two bullets from an assault rifle, but said Sunday it was one bullet, with the second injury caused by a fragment of that bullet.         
	Ken Boffard, another trauma specialist caring for Obilale, said the player was alert and able to move his legs before the surgery, but in great pain.         
	Boffard said such a bullet is capable of causing extensive injuries.         
	Its therefore far too early to be able to assess the extent of his injuries, Boffard said.         
	Boffard added that the 25-year-old Obilale, who plays for French club Pontivy, was extremely fit and has very good resistance. So, its very much in his favour that he is an athlete.         
	Two members of Togos national soccer delegation died after the team bus was ambushed by rebel separatists in Angolas Cabinda enclave on its way to the African Nations Cup.         
	The attack, which also killed the bus driver, came five months before South Africa hosts the World Cup, the first African nation to hold the worlds biggest single-sport event.         
	Milpark doctors added that they had sent a team to transport another injured person to South Africa, but that that person had died by the time the South Africans landed.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Sehwag: We are better placed
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Virender Sehwag is feeling fresh and raring to go after the two-game break. At the news conference on Tuesday, he said that if India play good all-round cricket, nothing can stop them from winning.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Thoughts on the final         
	Were hoping to do well. We have been playing them for the past couple of months and are better placed.         
	If hes doing anything special for his batting         
	I know Im a good player. Im backing myself Not doing anything special, but giving myself a little more time.         
	The teams performance in the tri-series         
	Im happy with the way things have gone. One has to remember that we cant win all games. But we have been playing consistently for the past few months. Were doing well.         
	Importance of the toss         
	Yes, the toss is important, but weve got to play well. If we play good all-round cricket, the toss will have no bearing on the outcome.         
	Performance of the youngsters         
	Our youngsters have performed creditably. Its a good sign ahead of the 2011 World Cup. It proves that our bench strength is increasing. We have more options. Dinesh Karthik, Virat Kohli all performed creditably. It augurs well for Team India.         
	On Virat Kohli         
	Kohli has used the opportunities very well. He is in fine form and I hope he continues in the same vein in the final. The important thing is that he is making it count in the middle. Good for him         
	On what would be a good total in the final         
	Nowadays teams can chase down anything. A safe total is difficult to predict. In the Rajkot one-dayer, we got 414 and Sri Lanka very nearly got it I would say a score of around 350-360 will be a winning total if we bat first.         
	If this was due to the T20 effect         
	I would say it is because the mindset of the batsmen has changed that such huge totals are being successfully chased. Nowadays you can chase any total.         
	On missing out on the No.1 ranking in ODIs in this series         
	Were not thinking about the rankings Were taking it series by series. If we play well, the result will be in our favour. Were not thinking of being No.1 or No.2. If we play good all-round cricket we will win.

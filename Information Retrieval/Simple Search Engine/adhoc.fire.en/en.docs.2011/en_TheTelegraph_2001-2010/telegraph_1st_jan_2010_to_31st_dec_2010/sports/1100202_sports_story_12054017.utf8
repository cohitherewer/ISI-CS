The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan look to make amends
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan look to make amends
                      
	Margao: Mohun Bagan would be looking to make amends for their 1-2 defeat at the hands of Salgaocar against leaders Dempo when they meet in the 13th round of the I-League Tuesday.         
	In their last match, Dempo had to split points with the other Bengal powerhouse, East Bengal. The Goans would hate to share points with a second team from Calcutta in consecutive matches and, having emerged as one of the title contenders, would desperately try to take full points against Bagan.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said his team would have to fight to get back in contention: We have to get back on track. Playing Dempo here is always difficult but weve got some positive results in the past against them. Well have to be sharp and convert whatever chances we get to win.         
	Against Salgaocar, the Bagan defence had been shaky and Sagram Mandi and N.S. Manju did not look too convincing against the pace of the rival strikers.         
	Jose Ramirez Baretto was often left stranded upfront and with Edeh Chidi recuperating from an injury the Brazilian will have a tough task .         
	We have to compensate with a win. We did not play badly in the last match but neither could we score. Our opponents have lost their last match, so, naturally, theyll come hard at us. But we have to be prepared for that, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said.         
	The boys have shown spirit in maintaining a good run in sop far and, since were coming to a crucial stage, it will be very useful to end up with a win, Colaco added. (PTI)

  - Visitors need 341 more to make the hosts bat again       INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Calcutta: Some things dont change in sport, as in life, like Roger Federer cruising on the grasscourts at Wimbledon or Usain Bolt raising the bar everytime he shoots off the blocks.         
	V.V.S. Laxman and Eden Gardens share the same chemistry, a romance that will live forever in the hearts of cricket lovers. The only comparison could be his affair with the Sydney Cricket Ground, where he has hundreds in all of his three visits.         
	On Tuesday, the Hyderabadi scored his fourth hundred at the Eden, and along with Mahendra Singh Dhoni, drove India into a position of strength from where they should win and retain the No.1 ranking. Laxmans unbeaten 143 and Dhonis 132 not out put India 347 runs ahead when the declaration came in the final hour. Bad light, though, robbed 18 minutes of play on the third day.         
	The Indians despondency at not making the Proteas play the entire period was clear as they were keen to capture a wicket or two before the close. Graeme Smith and his men are still 341 behind, and it will be quite an achievement to make India bat again in this Test. For the record, 643 for six is Indias highest against South Africa.         
	If the Virender Sehwag-Sachin Tendulkar 249-run partnership was about giving them a firm foothold, the Laxman-Dhoni unbroken record stand of 259 provided them with the licence to go for the kill. Dont forget Amit Mishras cameo in the morning. The nightwatchmans 28, which included some daring shots, set the mood as the lead quickly swelled to 88.         
	The second new ball got him as the visitors pressed for a comeback. Dale Steyn got the ball to move in slightly overcast conditions, and with Morne Morkel, threatened to make further inroads. That was the only period during the day when they seemed like making a mark.         
	The task was not easy for Laxman. He was stuck on 21 for 37 balls, but thereafter, made things look easy. Perhaps he reserves his best for the most feared opponent or situations that demand urgency and a show of character. The only blemish was when he was dropped on 48 at backward point by JP Duminy.         
	Laxman grew in confidence and used his tensile wrists to hit the ball pitched on off and middle past cover or beat mid-wicket with a flick, leaving the bowlers clueless. When he leaned into the drives, the fielders moved along in futility.         
	The innings will serve as a perfect anniversary gift to wife Sailaja on the day. She, along with their children, had surprised him by coming over on Monday.         
	If Laxman was all about timing, Dhoni showed what power hitting meant. He walked down the wicket to counter the swing and effortlessly lifted balls into the orbit.         
	He lifted Duminy for massive back-to-back sixes, and as the pair accelerated after tea, runs came in a flourish. From 100 off 203 balls, Laxman went to 143 off 260 and Dhoni from 100 off 158 finished on 132 off 187. There was no stopping them and the South Africans were relieved when the declaration finally came.         
	So where did South Africa go wrong in a matter of days? If the bowling was ordinary, the fielding, considered to be their strong point, proved to be their undoing.         
	Specifically, the absence of Mark Boucher behind the wickets, and Graeme Smith at first slip have cost them dear. If Sehwag added 118 after his reprieve on Monday, Dhoni put on 109 after being let off on Tuesday.         
	The bowling suffered once Steyn was rendered ineffective and Harris was milked dry by the batsmen. Steyn could have possibly been a victim of the pressure that expectations bring, but his failure certainly came at the wrong time for South Africa.         
	Now, Smith can only hope for the elements to intervene, but lady luck has been on Indias side so far in this Test.                     
	The fourth days play will begin at 8.57

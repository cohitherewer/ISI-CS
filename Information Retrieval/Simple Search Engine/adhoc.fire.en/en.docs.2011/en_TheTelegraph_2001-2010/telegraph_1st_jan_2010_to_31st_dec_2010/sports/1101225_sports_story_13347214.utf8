The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Abhijeet held by Anatoly 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Abhijeet held by Anatoly 
                      
	Groningen: Former world junior champion and Grandmaster Abhijeet Gupta was held to a draw by Anatoly Donchenko of Germany in the third round of the Groningen International Open chess tournament here.         
	With back to back draws in the last two games, second seeded Abhijeet slipped to joint ninth spot in this 9-round Swiss tournament with 56 players.         
	International Master Sahaj Grover suffered his first defeat in the tournament at the hands of experienced German GM Arkadij Rotstein. The Indian was outdone in the opening itself, despite playing white and it was all over in a mere 22 moves.         
	It was more bad news for the Indian players as Shiven Khosla and GM norm holder Ashwin Jayaram also suffered reversals in their respective games against Dutch opponents. Khosla was outplayed by Robin Van Kampen while Ashwin Jayaram was surprised by lower ranked Lennart Ootes.         
	Meanwhile at the top, defending champion 14-year-old Illya Nyzhnyk of Ukraine remained on course for his second title here with a fine victory over local star Jan Werle. Nyzhnyk emerged as the sole leader with his third victory in as many games and he is now a half point ahead of a pack of eight players, including third seed Ernst Sipke of Holland, and dark horse Vahe Baghdarsayan of Armenia.         
	Abhijeet is joint ninth on two points and giving him company is top seed Vladimir Baklan of Ukraine and 13 others. Sahaj Grover remained on 1.5 along with Shiven Khosla and these two will have a lot of catching up to do while Ashwin will need a major turnaround in fortunes to stage a comeback.(PTI)

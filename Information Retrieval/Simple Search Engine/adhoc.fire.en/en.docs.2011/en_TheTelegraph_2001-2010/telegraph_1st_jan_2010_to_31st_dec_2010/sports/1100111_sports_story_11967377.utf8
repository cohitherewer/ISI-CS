                                                                                                                       7                                        Jeev wins but Asia lose
                  The European team with the Royal Trophy on Sunday                       
	Chonburi (Thailand): Jeev Milkha Singh tamed Robert Karlsson but Gaganjeet Bhullar found Soren Kjoldsen too hot to handle as Europe unseated Asia to clinch the Royal Trophy golf tournament here Sunday. Asia went into final days play one point behind Europe and while Jeev, Charlie Wie and Komoi Oda won their singles, Bhullar, Prayad Marksaeng and Ryo Ishikawa lost theirs.         
	Liang Wen-chong and Thongchai Jaidee halved their matches as Asia could not bridge that one point gap and lost the title. Jeev produced a sensational start to take the wind out of Karlssons sails, starting with a hat-trick of birdies as he won the first four holes.         
	The Indian star was still leading by a big margin on his way back when Karlsson birdied the 10th to stop it from being a one-man show. Jeev found water on the long 11th to drop a double bogey and Karlsson reduced the margin to just one hole when he birdied the 14th. Jeev, however, regained his composure soon with a brilliant tee shot to nine feet at the 17th to set up the decisive birdie for his 2 amp; 1 win.         
	Bhullar, however, was not equally lucky and his Danish opponent Soren Kjeldsen beat him 2 amp; 1 to put Europe 8-7 ahead with the final pair behind them. Kjeldsen fired five birdies in a bogey-free run to the 15th to take control of this match but Bhullar produced a magical chip-in to keep the match alive at the 16th. Kjeldesn virtually sealed it when he nailed a 10 footer for birdie at the 17th hole and Bhullar could not match him.

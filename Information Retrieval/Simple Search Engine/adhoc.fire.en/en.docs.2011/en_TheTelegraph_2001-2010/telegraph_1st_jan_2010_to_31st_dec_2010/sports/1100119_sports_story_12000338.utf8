            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Abhinav Bindra                           
	New Delhi: The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) succumbed to pressure on Monday when it decided to consider Abhinav Bindra for the third and fourth World Cup teams on the basis of his scores in recent international tournaments.         
	The decision is certainly a victory for Bindra , India s only individual Olympic gold medalist, who is against the idea of appearing for trials every time the national team is selected for major international meets.         
	The ace rifle shooter, however, wont be in the team for the Commonwealth Shooting Championships to be held in New Delhi and the first two World Cups.         
	The teams for these three championships have already been selected, said NRAI secretary Baljeet Singh Sethi. There was no way we could change the squad. The government has already approved them.         
	India s three-member air rifle team consists of Gagan Narang, Sanjeev Rathore and P.T. Raghunath.         
	While the Commonwealth championships is from February 17, the first and the second World Cups are in Sydney (March 19 to 28) and Beijing (April 15 to 28), respectively.         
	The third World Cup is in Fort Benning in the US from May 22 followed by another World Cup in Belgrade from June 23.         
	Sethi said the NRAI has asked the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to intervene and resolve the matter.         
	On Tuesday, Bindras father has been asked to come to Delhi and meet the IOA president Suresh Kalmadi, he said.         
	We will look at his (Bindra) recent scores in various international meets and then decide about his participation in the third and the fourth World Cups.         
	For the Commonwealth Games, Bindra will have to appear for the selections trials, the NRAI boss added.         
	Asked whether he was setting a precedent, Sethi said: Yes, it could be  lets see what happens, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | May blasts security
                                                                                                                       7                                      May blasts security
                      
	Melbourne: Bomb blasts outside the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore were not surprising and reflected poorly on Indias capacity to co-host the 2011 World Cup, according to players union head Tim May.         
	Obviously we were disappointed, but to a certain degree not surprised that there was an incident during the IPL, May, chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers Association, said on Tuesday.         
	It appears that the actual security arrangements were not of the level to counter this particular risk. That disappoints us significantly.         
	May said sources within the IPLhad described security arrangements by Bangalore authorities as a shambles despite assurances of safety.           (REUTERS)

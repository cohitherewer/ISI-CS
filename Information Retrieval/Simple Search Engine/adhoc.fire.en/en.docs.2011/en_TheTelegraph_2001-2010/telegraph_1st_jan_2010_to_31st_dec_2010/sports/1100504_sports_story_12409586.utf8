	Gros Islet: Zaheer Khan is enjoying his new role.         
	He has shouldered the responsibility of spearheading the Indian attack and mentoring young fast bowlers. But Zaheer is relishing every moment of his responsibility.         
	My role as senior pacer has not changed. It is always good to have youngsters coming along and share some of your experience and at the same time learn a few things from them. Learning never stops, said the 31-year-old, who has 488 international wickets under his belt, including 11 in the Twenty20 format.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB does away with the draws
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB does away with the draws
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: There will be no drawn results in the local cricket matches starting this season. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), on Tuesday, decided to do away with draws (as a result) after the working committee meeting.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya, the CAB president, said: This is the age of instant cricket. Everybody wants a result, so we thought of doing away with draw as a result.         
	However, the actual reason behind the decision is something else. Some of the smaller clubs play for a draw since draws often help them accumulate points and beat the drop to stay in the first division. The decision therefore will pose problems for those who harbour such intentions.         
	Its a move that will definitely hurt our interest, a club official said.         
	Dalmiya said that the CABs decision to pay the selectors an honorarium has been ratified by the working committee. But the amount has not been fixed and the finance committee will work out the modalities. However, we will have to work out the obligations of the selectors, he said.         
	The CAB has also decided to have a special general body meeting on October 1 to decide on the successor of joint secretary Arun Mitra who passed away in August. Pritish Ghosh Choudhury of Mitras club, Belgachia United, has been inducted in the tours committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan aim to dent Dempo chances
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bagan aim to dent Dempo chances
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ryuji Sueoka                           
	Calcutta: Dempo Sports Club have always, over the years, proved to be Mohun Bagans nemesis. Coaches have come and gone but the situation hasnt changed one bit for the green and maroon brigade. It, therefore, will be a big challenge for Biswajit Bhattacharya when his boys take on the Goan giants Wednesday in an important I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	One can expect Bagan to give tough fight to a Dempo side that are favourites to win the championship at this juncture. With 44 points from 22 games, the likes of Beto, Climax Lawrence and Ranty Martins certainly wouldnt like to fritter way the golden chance of recapturing the league after losing it to Churchill Brothers in the last edition.         
	For Bagan, this will be a match to further consolidate their position on the league table after back-to-back victories, against Mumbai FC and Mahindra United.         
	We have always done well when we have played against Bagan. The boys also know very well that we have a very bright chance of winning back the I-League.         
	We are enjoying a seven-point cushion right now. I am sure the boys wouldnt like to let go of that advantage. It will be a good match but we will definitely try and get three points, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said. Dempo players stayed indoors on Tuesday due to the bandh.         
	During their last meeting, in the first leg, Dempo won 3-1 with Sunil Chetri scoring a brace.         
	Although Chetri has since left for MLS club Kansas City Wizards, the likes of Beto, Ranty and Joaquim Abranches are good enough to see the team home. The visitors will however miss Clifford Miranda who is out with a double booking.         
	The Bagan coach, though, has to work overtime to plug the chinks in his armour. One such weak link for Bhattacharya definitely is left-back Biswajit Saha.         
	With another left-back, N. Mohanraj, missing the better part of the season with injury and poor form the Bagan management had hardly any option save Saha. But he has failed to deliver on each occasion. Most of the goals conceded by Bagan have been through the oppositions wide right.         
	Marcos Pereira played no part in the CFL derby against East Bengal but will be back in central midfield with Ryuji Sueoka. Snehashish Chakraborty will start as the left winger as there has been a recurrence of Ishfaq Ahmeds hamstring injury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bradman son wins right to litigate
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bradman son wins right to litigate
                      
	Adelaide: Sir Donald Bradmans son has won the right to go to trial with allegations that a law firm has wrongly exploited the cricket greats identity as a brand name like Mickey Mouse.         
	John Bradman and other executives of the former Australian captains estate are seeking unspecified damages against law firm Allens Arthur Robinson, alleging breach of contract and negligence in assigning the iconic name.         
	In a published complaint in 2005, John Bradman spoke against a decision to license an Australian food company to market Bradman biscuits in India, a key international market for cricket.         
	A South Australia Supreme Court judge last year ruled that the law firm had not breached its contract.         
	But the Full Court of the Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favour of Bradmans appeal against that decision, allowing him to proceed to trial at a date to be set.         
	John Bradman claims the law firm failed to follow his late fathers instructions to allow the family power of veto over decisions to use his name for commercial purposes.         
	The Bradman familys statement of claim said Sir Donald was a loved and missed family member, not a brand name like Mickey Mouse.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Limping Rooney raises concerns 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Limping Rooney raises concerns 
            Mark Ogden     The Daily Telegraph            Wayne Rooney                           
	Wayne Rooney raised concerns over his fitness on Sunday night by limping heavily as he left Old Trafford following Manchester Uniteds 2-1 victory against Liverpool.         
	The England forward helped send United back to the top of the Premier League by scoring a first-half equaliser for the champions following Fernando Torress fifth-minute opener.         
	But the 24-year-olds influential performance against Rafael Benitezs team appeared to come at a cost judging by his inability to walk freely as he left the stadium after the game.         
	Rooney sat out Uniteds 1-0 victory at Wolves earlier this month after suffering inflamed kneecap tendons following his performance for England against Egypt at Wembley.         
	And although he returned to face AC Milan in the Champions League last 16 second-leg tie, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted that Rooneys determination to play as often as possible led to him exacerbating his knee problem during the England game.         
	United were unable to confirm Sunday, however, whether Rooney had sustained a new injury or whether he was merely suffering the effects of a feisty encounter against Liverpool.         
	The temperament of Torres was called into question during a game which was marked by the Liverpool forward persistently raising complaints directed at referee Howard Webb.         
	The Spaniard, who appeared to scuff the penalty spot before Rooneys spot-kick  which was saved by Pepe Reina before the United forward netted the rebound  received his fifth booking in seven games on a frustrating afternoon for Liverpool, whose hopes of qualifying for the Champions League suffered a major blow with defeat at Old Trafford.

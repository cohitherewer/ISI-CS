The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Greece face Korea test 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Greece face Korea test 
                      
	Port Elizabeth: South Korea and Greece, two teams with their best results of the decade well behind them, meet on Saturday in a World Cup match that could have a pivotal bearing on Group B standings. South Korea were a surprise semifinalist in 2002 when it co-hosted the World Cup with Japan, while Greece emerged champions in Euro 2004.         
	Neither of the two teams have able to match those achievements, but both have a realistic chance of advancing from a group that also contains powerhouse Argentina and Nigeria.         
	South Korea started off the 2006 World Cup in Germany by beating Togo 2-1, their first victory in a World Cup match outside Asia and then drew 1-1 with France courtesy late equaliser from Manchester Uniteds Park Ji-sung.         
	But the Koreans lost 0-2 against Switzerland, preventing them from advancing to the second round in their seventh trip to the World Cup.         
	Likely Teams         
	South Korea (4-4-2): 1-Lee Woon-jae, 22-Cha Du-ri, 2-Oh Beom-seok, 4-Cho Yong-hyung, 14-Lee Jung-soo, 8-Kim Jung-woo, 16-Ki Sung-yong, 7-Park Ji-sung, 17-Lee Chung-yong, 10-Park Chu-young, 19-Yeom Ki-hun.         
	Greece (4-3-3): 12-Alexandros Tzorvas, 11-Loukas Vyntra, 16-Sotiris Kyrgiakos, 15-Vassilis Torosidis, 4-Nikos Spyropoulos, 6-Alexandros Tziolis, 10-Giorgos Karagounis, 21-Kostas Katsouranis, 7-Giorgos Samaras, 14-Dimitris Salpingidis, 17-Fanis Gekas.         
	Referee: Michael Hester (New Zealand)           (AGENCIES)

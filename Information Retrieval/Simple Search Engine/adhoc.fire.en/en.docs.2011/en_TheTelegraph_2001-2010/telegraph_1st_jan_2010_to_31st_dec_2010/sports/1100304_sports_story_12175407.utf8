The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gritty Korea stay on course 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gritty Korea stay on course 
    - The Netherlands remain on top in Pool A with 3-1 win over NZ           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Action during the Germany vs Canada match in New Delhi, on Wednesday. Germany won 6-0. (PTI)                                 
	New Delhi: In its two previous editions, South Korea have been the only Asian team to make the World Cup semi-finals, finishing fourth on both occasions.         
	On Wednesday, the gritty Koreans once again ensured they stayed in contention for a last-four berth with a fighting 2-1 over Argentina in a well contested Pool A encounter at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium.         
	The Koreans, who held defending champions Germany to a 2-2 draw in their first match, now have four points from two matches. Argentina have lost both their matches. Germany, who drubbed a hapless Canada 6-0 in the days first match, too, have four points.         
	It was the orange shirts of the Netherlands that remained pool leaders with six points from two matches after a convincing 3-1 victory over 1976 Olympic champions New Zealand in the days last clash. It was the New Zealanders who took the lead through Phillip Burrows in the opening minute but the Dutch retaliated with three goals in the next 27 minutes.         
	While Ronald Brouwer equalised a minute after New Zealand had opened the scoring, penalty corner specialist Taeke Taekema and Jeroen Hertzberger were the other marksmen for the Dutch. It was the 200th international goal for Taekema who was the highest scorer in the last edition in Germany.         
	But ask the penalty corner specialist if he wanted to end up as the all-time highest goalscorer in the World Cup and Taekemas reply underlines his commitment to the team.         
	Id much prefer to finish on top in this World Cup than be the topscorer, Taekema said. I want to be a world champion and Ill celebrate once we win here.         
	All the excitement in the Korea-Argentina match was reserved for the last minute when the Asian side clinched the match-winner in dramatic fashion.         
	With the match locked 1-1, the Koreans pressed hard and asked the umpire for a referral when the ball hit the leg of an Argentine defender inside the area a few seconds from the hooter. Granted a penalty corner by the video replay, Hyun Woo Nam blasted the ball into the goal with a clean and energetic hit.         
	No wonder Nam was ecstatic after scoring the winner, his second goal of the match. As he broke into celebrations by throwing his stick on the pitch, the umpire rushed to ask him to join his teammates so that the match could be restarted.         
	It was a difficult match we are happy to have clinched three points, said South Korean captain Jong Bok Cha. After todays win we can start dreaming about reaching the semis.         
	In the end, the Argentines must have felt frustrated as it was them that had taken the lead through Facundo Callioni in the 53rd minute. But Nam had equalised with a brilliant reverse flick nine minutes later.         
	In the days first match, Germany toyed with Canada before subjecting them to a 6-0 thrashing after leading 4-0 at the breather.         
	For Germany, 18-year-old Florian Fuchs scored twice, in the 58th and 64th minutes, while Benjamin Wess (3rd minute), Jan-Marco Motag (21st), captain Maximillian Muller (23rd) and Martin Haner (28th) found the target once each.         
	Gunning for a hattrick of World Cup titles following triumphs in 2002 and 2006, Germany forced as many as seven penalty-corners  from which they scored thrice  while Canada got just one in the entire match.

	Knysna: Despite France coach Raymond Domenechs perpetually upbeat attitude, confidence is running low among his players ahead of Fridays World Cup opener against Uruguay.         
	Following two unconvincing warm-up matches and with only a handful of days remaining, the French need to improve  and fast  to stand any chance of repeating their surprise performance four years ago, when they reached the World Cup final.         
	France were beaten 1-0 by China on Friday and were outplayed in a 1-1 draw against Tunisia prior to that. Before that, the French beat Costa Rica 2-1, coming from behind to win with a late goal in their first warm-up game.         
	Things arent perfect, as we saw against China, France midfielder Alou Diarra said Sunday. Well have to be ready on Friday.         
	Diarra said Domenechs choice to gamble on a new 4-3-3 system is the right one, although he accepted time is quickly running out for France to prove they can make the transition from years of being a defensive team to becoming an attacking one in less than three weeks.         
	I think we have the players to play in this system, Diarra said. We need some time to adapt, but obviously we dont have much time to get ready.         
	France also fell a goal behind against Tunisia, and missed numerous chances against both Costa Rica and China, highlighting problems in defence and attack. Were trying to sort out the little problems were having, and you need to talk a lot to do that, Diarra said.         
	Only the new midfield trio of Jeremy Toulalan, Gourcuff and Florent Malouda has shown any real consistency.           (AGENCIES)

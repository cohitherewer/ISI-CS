	Calcutta: In the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), only four players have featured in the first XI of the Rajasthan Royals in all the 13 matches. Three of them are skipper Shane Warne, Yusuf Pathan and wicket-keeper Naman Ojha. The fourth one is none other than Bengal boy Abhishek Jhunjhunwala. This shows the kind of faith the Aussie legend has on the 27-year-old youngsters abilities.         
	Ask Abhishek about Saturdays last league encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders, that he fired up for it will be clear.         
	I will be playing at my home ground, and its obviously a special feeling. At the same time, I can tell you that its a bit weird not to have the crowd behind me. I have grown up playing at Eden Gardens and it will be really satisfying if I can perform in front of the crowd on Saturday, Abhishek told The Telegraph on Thursday evening after arriving in the city.         
	Abhishek will definitely like to do better than Sreevats Goswami who could score only eight when he played at this ground for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, against KKR, last month.         
	Did he provide any inputs about the pitch to his captain? Not really. Definitely, there would be some discussion once we train on Friday evening.         
	Though he has not exactly set the stage on fire, having scored 183 runs in 13 matches (11 innings) at an average of 20.33, Abhishek feels that its more to do with him not batting up the order. He has been a livewire on the field, taking four catches and also saving quite a few runs.         
	I am pretty satisfied with my performance so far. Dont forget I didnt get a chance to bat in a couple of matches. In some other matches, I got not more than a handful of deliveries. I hope I get to play a few more balls, said Abhishek, who won his maiden Man of the Match award against the Knights, in Ahmedabad.         
	Abhishek did admit that the loss against the Mumbai Indians hurt them more than the defeat against RCB.The Knight Riders didnt practise on Thursday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Om Prakash takes gold in shot put
                                                                                                                       7                                      Om Prakash takes gold in shot put
                      
	New Delhi: A throw of 19.12 metres Sunday won Om Prakash Singh the mens shot put gold at the Savo Games in Lapinlahti, Finland.         
	The Asian champion was well short of his personal best of 20.02m but the effort was enough to see off the competition. The throw was also inferior to his showing at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships, where he won gold with a distance 19.87m. Om Prakash is currently training at the IAAF Throwing Training Centre in Kuortane, Finland.         
	Meanwhile, Caster Semenyas low-key return to competition continued Sunday with a win in the 800 metres at the Savo Games. The South African cruised to victory in her second race since being cleared to carry on competing as a woman, finishing in a time of 2 minutes, 2.41 seconds  almost two seconds faster than he time in Thursdays comeback race at the Lappeenranta Games.         
	Semenya always looked in control against a weak field. Britains Marilyn Okoro might have offered Semenya some competition but pulled out before the event.         
	Semenya appeared to be relaxed before the race on a blustery day in the small town of Lapinlahti, which has a population of 8,000 and is situated 450 kilometres to the north of capital Helsinki.         
	In the absence of any real rivalry, Semenya said she found it tough to stay with the two pacemakers.           (AGENCIES)

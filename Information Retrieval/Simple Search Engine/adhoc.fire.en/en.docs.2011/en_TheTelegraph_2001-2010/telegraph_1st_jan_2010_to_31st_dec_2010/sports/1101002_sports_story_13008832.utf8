	Berne: Napoli recovered from three goals down to draw 3-3 at Steaua Bucharest in the Europa League on Thursday as holders Atletico Madrid were held 1-1 by Bayer Leverkusen.         
	Juventus drew 1-1 at Manchester City and Italian teams, who failed to win in the opening round of games, produced a much better performance with Sampdoria and Palermo also claiming 1-0 home victories.         
	Porto maintained their 100 per cent record, sealing a 10th successive win by beating CSKA Sofia 1-0.         
	Moldovas Sheriff Tiraspol provided the nights biggest upset with a 2-0 win over Ukraines Dynamo Kiev, helped by a bizarre opening goal, and Sporting Lisbon got the biggest win with a 5-0 demolition of Levski Sofia.         
	Napoli made a disastrous start in Romania, falling 0-3 behind in only 16 minutes as Cristian Tanase, with a free kick, and Pantelis Kapetanos added to a second-minute own goal by Emilson Cribani, who deflected a shot into the net.         
	Napolis Uruguay forward Edinson Cavani completed the fightback by snatching the equaliser in the eighth minute of stoppage time to give the Italian side their second draw in two Group K games.         
	Liverpool lead the group with four points after an uninspiring draw at Utrecht.         
	Atletico fell behind to a goal from Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok six minutes before halftime at home to erratic Germans Bayer Leverkusen.         
	Juventus, amazingly held 3-3 at home by Polands Lech Poznan, took an early lead at Manchester City when Vincenzo Iaquinta cut inside from the left and scored with a shot which clipped Kolo Toures head and flew past Joe Hart.         
	Adam Johnson levelled before halftime in the group A match when he slotted home Yaya Toures pass. Juve nearly snatched the points when Alessandro del Pieros free kick hit the underside of the crossbar five minutes from time.         
	Lech Poznan went top of the group, ahead of Manchester City on goals scored, with a 2-0 win over hapless Austrian champions Salzburg.         
	Portos Colombia forward Radamel Falcao scored the only goal, flicking the ball in from Hulks pass, to give the Portuguese side three points and keep them top of group L.         
	Sampdorias Giampaolo Pazzini scored from the spot as they beat visitors Debrecen 1-0 in group I to claim the first win for an Italian team in this seasons competition, while PSV Eindhoven won 2-0 at Metalist Kharkiv in the same group.         
	Italys Palermo also won but it was far from convincing as they needed a goal from Giulio Migliaccio in the 79th minute to beat Swiss second division outfit Lausanne Sport.

	Lahore: The financial feud between Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif and actress Veena Malik has finally ended after a common friends intervention. The week-long saga saw both Asif and Malik file counter cases against each other in the Lahore High Court over a monetary dispute.         
	Asif and Veena ended the sizzling scandal at a joint press conference that had captured the attention of the media and the people.         
	The two appeared at the press conference with their common friend Zahid sitting between them as their was no direct interaction between the two who also declined to answer any questions, merely insisting that their dispute was over.         
	All our matters have been settled and the money issue also resolved, Veena said.         
	Veena has claimed that Asif owed her around Rs 13 million that she lent to him when they were close friends in 2008 and 2009.         
	The dispute arose soon after Asif got married to a girl of his familys choice in February. Asif said there was some misunderstanding between the two but that has now been cleared. Our common friend has got us together again and we will resolve all our issues privately and in a civil manner, he said.         
	Asif said he was now totally focused on the World T20 and wanted to help his team do well in the mega event. (PTI)

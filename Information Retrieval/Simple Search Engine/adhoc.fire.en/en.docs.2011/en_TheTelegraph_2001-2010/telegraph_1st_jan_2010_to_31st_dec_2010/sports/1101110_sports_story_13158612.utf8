The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Seema misses China berth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Seema misses China berth
                      
	New Delhi: All Commonwealth Games medallists, except discus thrower Seema Antil, were, on Tuesday, named in Indias 69-member athletics squad for the Asian Games, starting in Guangzhou, China, from November 12.         
	The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) decided to send a big squad, the largest among 36 disciplines, following the unprecedented success in the Commonwealth Games last month.         
	India had won 12 medals (two gold, three silver and seven bronze) in the CWG, the best ever performance by the country in the history of CWG.         
	The squad also has shot putter Saurabh Vij, who had tested positive for a banned stimulant, and whose case is pending before a National Anti-Doping Agency panel.         
	National record holder Antil, who had won a bronze in the CWG, missed out on the Asian Games bus, as a country can name only two athletes in an event. Krishna Poonia and Harwant Kaur, who won gold and silver respectively, in a clean sweep in the womens discus throw event in the CWG, were in the China-bound squad.         
	In the CWG, we were allowed to field three athletes in an event but in the Asian Games there is a restriction of two athletes in an event. So, Antil missed out, AFI secretary Ravinder Chaudhry said.         
	We are sending our best 69 athletes, including all the medal winners of the Commonwealth Games, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen knock seals the deal 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pietersen knock seals the deal 
                  Yuvraj Singh spills a catch, in Mohali, on Friday                     
	Mohali: Kevin Pietersen (66 not out) got three lives before notching up his maiden Indian Premier League half century and helping Royal Challengers Bangalore score a comprehensive six-wicket victory over Kings XI Punjab on Friday.         
	Pietersen, who was dropped thrice while on 36, 47 and 50, played sheet anchor with two crucial partnerships  71 off 51 balls for the third wicket with Virat Kohli and 40 from just 15 balls for fourth wicket with Robin Uthappa as RCB romped home with five balls to spare in chase of 182.                     
	Uthappa played a stunning cameo of 22 from just eight balls with two sixes and a four to take the score near finishing line at the PCA Stadium. Pietersen, who hit seven fours and a six in his 44-ball knock smashed the winning runs, cover driven boundary off Irfan Pathan.         
	Earlier, Kumar Sangakkara top-scored with a 27-ball 45 as Kings XI Punjab posted a challenging 181 for five after electing to bat. With the win today, their fifth in eight matches, Royal Challengers are on second spot with 10 points and brightened their chances to qualify for the semi-finals.                     
	For Kings XI, who slumped to their seventh loss in eight matches and faced a lot of flak for their performance, their chances for a last four berth virtually ended with their fourth home defeat.         
	Their bowlers leaked runs and fielders put up a woeful show missing catches galore. Sreesanth, Ravi Bopara and Sangakkara dropped Pietersen in succession. Shalabh Srivastava, Bipul Sharma and Irfan Pathan took a wicket apiece for Kings XI. Brett Lee continued his woeful form in the IPL-III as he bled 48 runs from his four overs without taking any wicket. It was Lees third and RCBs 17 th over where he went for 25 runs and the complexion of the match changed. Suddenly Royal Challengers required just 23 from 18 deliveries.         
	The Royal Challengers made a steady start to their run chase with Jacques Kallis and Manish Pandey not finding too many boundaries.           (PTI)

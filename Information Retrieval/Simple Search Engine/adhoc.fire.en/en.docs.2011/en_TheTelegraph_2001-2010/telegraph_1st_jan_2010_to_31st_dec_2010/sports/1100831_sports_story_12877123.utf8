            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa chief executive officer Gerald Majola, reacting to the spot-fixing scandal surrounding the Pakistan team, said in a media release on Monday that South Africas upcoming series against Pakistan, to be held in the United Arab Emirates, will go on as scheduled unless instructed otherwise by the International Cricket Council.         
	The tour of Pakistan is part of the ICC Future Tours program, which we have to honour, unless instructed otherwise by the International Cricket Council (ICC). As such, the tour will go ahead as planned.         
	We will not comment on the scandal itself, as we dont want to compromise any processes currently in place to deal with this matter, Majola said in the statement.

            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengal teammates comfort Yusif Yakubu, who broke down after the teams 3-2 win over Churchill Brothers, in the I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                             
	Calcutta: We saw it happening in Bristol and, on Friday, we saw it in Calcutta. Sachin Tendulkar and Yusif Yakubu might never bump into each other but after East Bengals 3-2 win over Churchill Brothers at the Salt Lake Stadium, the legendary cricketer and one of the most prolific strikers in the I-League will be joined by an emotional thread.         
	Eleven years ago, in Bristol, Tendulkar scored a century against Kenya in a World Cup match. That was a few of days after the demise of his father, Ramesh Tendulkar.         
	On Friday morning, Yakubu was informed of the death of his mother. In the evening Yakubu, in every sense of the term, was his teams Man Friday as he twice pulled East Bengal level before Bhaichung Bhutia eventually nodded home the winner to give the club three crucial points. East Bengal now have 16 points from 11 matches. Churchills tally remained at 18 from 11 games.         
	The match certainly has secured a place in the memories of the East Bengal fans and players. Not only did the man coming to terms with personal loss guide them to victory, Yakubu also completed 100 goals in the national league.         
	It was the visitors who went ahead, in the eighth minute, when East Bengal skipper Syed Rahim Nabi headed a Reisangmi Vashum throw into his own goal.         
	However, East Bengal had equalised within three minutes when Bhaichungs defence splitting through found an unmarked Yakubu who put it past an onrushing Churchill custodian Arindam Bhattacharya with a deft placement.         
	In the very next minute it was a defensive blooper from Uga Okpara that saw Churchill go 2-1 up. In his bid to clear the ball, Okparas shot hit Felixs head and the ball fell for Vashum who raced into the box and beat Abhra, again at the near post.         
	One saw Alvito DCunhas in his element after a long time as the Goan sent across some nice deliveries from the left and one such cross was nodded home by Yakubu to make it 2-2.         
	If Alvito was a revelation down the left, Bhaichung, who got a start after long time, too gave a good account of himself.         
	The winner in the 53rd minute met a Hammond header off an Alvito corner to ensure three points.         
	But the day was not about goals or passes. It was an exhibition of commitment of the highest order.         
	After the match, Yakubu was seen sobbing like a child as his teammates rushed to console him. As Phillippe de Ridder pointed out in the end. It was more than just a match for all of us today.         
	Yusif Yakubu, take a bow.

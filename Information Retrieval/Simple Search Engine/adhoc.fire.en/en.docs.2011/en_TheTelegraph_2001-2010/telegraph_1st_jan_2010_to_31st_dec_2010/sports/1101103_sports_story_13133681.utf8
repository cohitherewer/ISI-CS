	New Delhi: The Delhi High Court Tuesday directed the government to implement its National Sports Policy, which fixes 70 years as the upper age limit and 12 years as the maximum tenure for the chiefs of various sports federations.         
	A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Manmohan gave the direction while turning down a plea by the Indian Olympic Association and five other federations to restrain the government from implementing the policy.         
	At present, we are not inclined to direct the stay of the operation of the guidelines and also the steps taken in pursuance of the guidelines, the bench said.         
	The governement had on May 1 come out with the guidelines, fixing 70 years as the upper age limit for the heads of the sporting bodies and stipulating that they would not continue in the post beyond 12 years, with or without a break.

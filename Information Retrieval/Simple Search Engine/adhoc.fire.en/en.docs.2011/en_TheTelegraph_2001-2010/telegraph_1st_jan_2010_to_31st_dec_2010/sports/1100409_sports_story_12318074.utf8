	Chandigarh: Considering the red-hot form Sachin Tendulkar is in these days, it would have been fantastic for Indias World Twenty20 campaign if the batting legend was a part of the squad, feels Harbhajan Singh. Tendulkar does not play T20 internationals anymore hence the selectors did not include him in the Indian squad for the World Twenty20, beginning in the West Indies from April 30.         
	Tendulkar, who turns 37 on April 24, is in scorching form and has been instrumental in Mumbai Indians splendid run so far in the third season of the Indian Premier League.         
	Had Sachin decided to play in the World Cup, it would have been good for the team. But since he has decided, we know he is not going to change his decision, said Harbhajan during an interaction with the mediapersons, here, on Thursday.         
	Harbhajan, who is among the top five bowlers in IPL-III with 11 scalps, has also impressed with his batting skills and his blistering knocks have come handy for his side.         
	I have worked a lot on my batting, he said. Asked the T20 effect on the other formats of the game he said, It is having a positive effect on other versions. The game is becoming more fast now.         
	The senior pro also said the IPL has helped all the international players in T20 World Cup preparations.         
	I think now we as Indian team believe that every target can be chased down if our batting clicks. Its a good practice for T20 Cup. Other teams too will benefit because their players are playing in the IPL, he said.

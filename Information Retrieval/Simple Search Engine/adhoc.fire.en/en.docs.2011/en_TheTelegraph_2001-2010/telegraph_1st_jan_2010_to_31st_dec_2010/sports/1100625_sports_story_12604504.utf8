The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diego is a Mourinho admirer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Diego is a Mourinho admirer
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Jose Mourinho is someone to take to your bedside table and ask for advice according to Argentina coach Diego Maradona, who has been discussing tactics with the new Real Madrid coach in the build up to the World Cup.         
	Although Argentina have made an impressive start to the tournament, Diego Maradona has still said he might give new Real Madrid manager Mourinho a call if he ever felt in need of tactical advice.         
	I like Mourinho a lot [as a coach], Maradona said. On top of that, the way he received me, we spent hours talking about football, attacking and defensive tactics.         
	He seemed to me a guy to take to your bedside table and ask him each time you need something. Ive got his phone number, I might call him, Maradona said.         
	Maradona, however, said he would refrain from using the ultra defensive tactics Mourinhos Inter employed to get past Barcelona in this years Champions League semi-finals.         
	No, not that. But it worked for him, right? He won the Champions League, Maradona said.         
	Argentina face Mexico in the second round at Soccer City on Sunday after coasting through their group, winning all three games and scoring seven goals in the process.         
	Although Maradonas key player Lionel Messi, 23 on Thursday, has yet to find the net, he has had 20 shots at goal so far, the most of any player at the tournament, and twice hit the post while laying on chances for team mates.         
	No player has come within 30 percent of Messis form at the finals, Maradona said.         
	I dont know if tomorrow people will say Im arrogant but none was 30 percent of Tevez either, because Carlitos thrills you playing ... I love my team. Asked if Messis tournament would compare with Maradonas 1982 finals in Spain, when he fell short of expectations, or if he was ready to emulate his performance in Argentinas 1986 victory in Mexico, he said: I think hes there.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Shakib says he too was approached
                      
	London: Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasan revealed on Wednesday how he was once approached by an individual willing to act as his sponsor.         
	Shakib, asked about cricket corruption ahead of the first Test against England at Lords on Thursday, said he once reported an incident to the ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU).         
	Shakib told reporters at Lords that a suspicious individual approached him ahead of the 2008 one-day International series at home against Ireland, suggesting he wanted to be the all-rounders sponsor.         
	It was a long time ago Two-and-a-half years ago. Only once, he called me, and I told the guys. That was it.         
	I didnt talk to him much because we had a team meeting to go to, so I told him Ill talk to you later and immediately told a member of the board and the ICC guy (the late Colonel Noor of Pakistan who was then a member of the ACU). They took action and after that he never called me again.         
	We didnt have time to discuss all the things, and what I should do. (Agencies)

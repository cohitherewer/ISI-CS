The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We too are under pressure: Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                        We too are under pressure: Taylor
  - Loss to Sri Lanka makes India all the more dangerous, feels the Black Caps captain       A CORRESPONDENT            Ross Taylor during a practice session in Dambulla, on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	New Zealand captain Ross Taylor, at a pre-match media conference admitted that not only India, but New Zealand, too, are equally under pressure as the two teams square up for a crucial tie-series clash on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The pressure on Team India         
	I think it makes them all the more dangerous as they didnt play well against us in the first game, and then came back and played well against Sri Lanka. Obviously, they did badly against Sri Lanka in the last match. That makes them dangerous, but we cant really think about them too much. We should concentrate more on us and on things we can control.         
	Indian top-orders poor form         
	Every teams top-order has struggled, not just Indian batsmen. We have struggled at the top, Sri Lanka have had their troubles as well. They are a good batting unit. They have played a lot of cricket. Im sure with the experience they have, theyll come through. We just have to take early wickets and see how they respond under pressure.         
	The tall New Zealand pacers extracting more bounce         
	Well have to see how the pitch is like, assess the bounce. It is a fresh wicket. The first wicket we played on turned a lot more than we expected and bounced a lot under lights. But our bowlers are quite tall and does get extra bounce So, if it does bounce, well have to wait and see. If it doesnt bounce much, we will have to think of other options.         
	On NZ youngsters not doing well         
	Ive been in that situation myself. The senior players coming up and telling you to train hard. The biggest thing is trusting that you are good enough and deserve to be there. A lot of batsmen in our side havent scored as many runs as they would have liked, but they have scored runs in the past or in the warm-up games, its not all doom and gloom for them. Everyones saying its a must-win game. Its just reinforcing to the team that at the end of the day, its just a game of cricket. We play to win but we dont want to put any more pressure on ourselves.         
	If lack of experience is a concern         
	We knew coming here that we had an inexperienced line-up and that was part of the deal coming here. We wanted to give young guys exposure. Scotty and I scored runs, but we only score once, its going to be 12 days since we have actually had a bat. Obviously played SL for two days but we didnt have a bat. Theres going to be a little more anxiety over the fact that we havent had a bat for 12 days.         
	Any injury worries in the team         
	Martin Guptill is fit but Kane Williamson has got a bit of a bicep injury. Hell have a fitness test. He didnt bowl or throw on Monday. Well have to wait and see how that goes.         
	On toss being a major factor         
	The toss has played a big factor. Predominantly a team that bats first enjoys an advantage. However, at times, when a team that bowls first, is able to take three-four quick wickets. Its not only India, we are under a bit of pressure as well.         
	If weather will play a decisive role         
	Well have to wait and see. It rained here sometime back. A bit of cloud cover means that the ball will swing around. If you look at most of the dismissals, swing has been a factor but it is mostly seam that has got most of the batsmen out. So, I wouldnt rule out bowling first.

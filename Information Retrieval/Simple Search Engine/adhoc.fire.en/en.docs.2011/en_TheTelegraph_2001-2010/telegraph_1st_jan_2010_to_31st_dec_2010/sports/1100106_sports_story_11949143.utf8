The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tyagi is in Test 16, too
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tyagi is in Test 16, too
    - MAIDEN TEST CALL-UP FOR PACER 
  -   TEAM INDIA START WITH LOSS             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                Sudeep Tyagi      
	Calcutta: Believe it or not, somebody did gain despite the December 27 ODI at the Kotla being abandoned. In fact, its Sudeep Tyagi who benefited  an impressive debut that day getting him a maiden Test squad call-up.         
	The 22-year-old new-ball bowler is the only rookie among the 16 picked for the two-match series in Bangladesh.         
	That Tyagi was in the frame had been reported by The Telegraph on Sunday itself.         
	Indeed, as predicted in these columns, 14 of the 15 players who featured in the India squads during the recent Test series against Sri Lanka have been retained.         
	Frankly, its an awesome line-up.         
	Middle-order batsman Subramaniam Badrinath is the one to have missed out, as the Krishnamachari Srikkanth-chaired selection committee decided on having four specialist new-ball bowlers.         
	Sensibly, so.         
	There had been three  Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma  versus Sri Lanka.         
	Srikkanth and three of his four colleagues (Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) met in Chennai on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Yashpal Sharma wasnt present as hes on assignment in Bangladesh. Hell be there till the end of the tri-series. Incidentally, theres a good chance that no selector may go for the Tests.         
	Srikkanth and Hirwani travelled to Chennai from Bangalore, after watching the first two days of the Karnataka-UP Ranji semi-final. Bhave and Venkat did so from Mumbai, after viewing exactly that much of the Mumbai-Delhi clash.         
	With both semi-finals so one-sided, Srikkanth and Co. decided against going back to Bangalore and Mumbai.         
	According to well-placed sources, the selectors and the think tank (captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, coach Gary Kirsten) had been very impressed with Tyagis 6.3-1-15-1 show at the Kotla and decided to include him instead of recalling the experienced Munaf Patel.         
	The ODI got abandoned after just 23.3 overs, but young Tyagi did enough to convince them that he actually was worth investing in.         
	Tyagis T20 debut had been last month.         
	With the squad having 16 players, all-rounder Dinesh Karthik made it comfortably. Besides being the second keeper, he can be used in any position in the batting order.         
	For the first time, India will be starting a Test series as the worlds No.1-ranked team. The opening match is in Chittagong, from January 17; Dhaka hosts the second and final one, from January 24.         
	The last Test series between the two countries, too, had been in Bangladesh, in the summer of 2007. India won 1-0.               
	TEST SQUAD FOR BANGLADESH         
	Openers: Virender Sehwag (vice-capt.), Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay.         
	Middle-order: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh.         
	Wicket-keepers: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.), Dinesh Karthik.         
	Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha.         
	New-ball bowlers: Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Sudeep Tyagi.

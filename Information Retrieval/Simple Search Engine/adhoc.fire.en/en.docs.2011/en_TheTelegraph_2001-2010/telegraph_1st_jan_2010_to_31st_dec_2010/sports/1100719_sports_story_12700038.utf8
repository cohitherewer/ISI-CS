    - Need to dominate first two sessions on day II: kumar           A CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES            Tharanga Paranavitana celebrates his maiden century, in Galle, on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Galle: Centurion Tharanga Paranavitanas views might just be a welcome solace for the lacklustre Indians who managed little on the opening day of the first Test, against Sri Lanka, in Galle, on Sunday.         
	Paranivitana (110 batting) and captain Kumar Sangakkara (103) made merry with the bat as Sri Lanka made 256 for two on a rain-truncated day.         
	However, Paranavitana said that there was nothing wrong with the Indian bowlers and it was the pitch, which was favourable to the batsmen, that helped the Sri Lankans.         
	There was nothing wrong with the Indian bowling because it was the wicket that was in favour of the batsmen. If you do the right things in the middle, getting runs is not difficult.         
	There wasnt anything wrong with the wicket, except for the odd ball that turned, Paranavitana said.         
	He was also relieved, and happy, to crack his maiden Test century. I am extremely happy to get a maiden hundred because, prior to this innings, I had got five fifties, but was unable to convert them into a hundred. I am quite happy that I scored a hundred in Sri Lanka than in India. I received some loose balls and I made use of them as I was in a positive frame of mind, he said.         
	In domestic cricket I score big hundreds, but at the international level I couldnt do so in my first Test.         
	However, with experience, I was able to do so and I am confident that I can go forward with my game plan, he added.         
	Paranavitana said that advice from senior players helped him work on his batting.         
	I spoke to the coaches and senior players to see why I have been unable to get a Test hundred and I came to this match after correcting some of my mistakes.         
	From the time I came into the Sri Lanka side, I have been receiving lot of advice from the team members. We are playing well together as a team and I have also benefited from it, he said.         
	According to Paranavitana, a score of 350-400 would be a comfortable one under the prevailing conditions in Galle.         
	On this wicket, 350-400 will be a safe score. If there are continuous interruptions due to rain, it will hamper Sri Lankas chances of winning, provided they get into a winning situation, he said.         
	Speaking about debutant Indian pacer Abhimanyu Mithun he said: He bowled well for his first appearance He will improve with experience.         
	Captain Sangakkara said that his side would look to accelerate in the first two sessions on Monday to put up a big total and apply pressure on the Indians.         
	We had a good day today (Sunday). We are looking to dominate in the first two sessions Monday and post a big total.         
	If we do that we are going to put pressure on the Indians, Sangakkara said.         
	Sanagakkara also said that it was not a difficult decision to bat after winning the toss as the side which had done so won in the last few matches at the Galle International Stadium here.         
	The pitch was a bit soft (after rains). We discussed this before the match.         
	But the side which elected to bat had won in the previous 4-5 matches, he reasoned.         
	Sangakkara heaved praised on Paranavitana for his maiden century. I am happy that I scored a century in the first Test of this series but Para (Paranavitana) batted well and we had a big partnership, the home team captain said.         
	Para has been performing well in the domestic circuit in the last four-five years and todays century was a reward for his consistent performance.         
	I knew he needed just one innings to start making an impact in the international scene. I hope this kickstarts his international career from here, he said.         
	Asked about Muttiah Muralidharans retirement after this Test, Saangakkara said: Well, we are going to miss him. There was a bit of turn on the wicket today.         
	So we are hoping he would bow out with a fine performance.

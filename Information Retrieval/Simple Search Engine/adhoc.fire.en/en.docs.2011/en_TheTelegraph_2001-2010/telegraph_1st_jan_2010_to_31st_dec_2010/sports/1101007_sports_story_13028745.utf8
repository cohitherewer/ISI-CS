            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi: There could be a drastic fall in Indias medals tally in the next Commonwealth Games at Glasgow as the organisers are planning to drop wrestling from the list of events.         
	According to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) sources, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is actively considering a proposal to drop wrestling in both the men and womens section in the next Games.         
	Wrestling has been one of Indias main medal winning sport in the Commonwealth Games for a long time. The dominance of the Indians started in 1970 when they won five gold medals.         
	Till date, Indians have won 23 gold, 24 silver and 11 bronze medals in the Commonwealth Games. In the 2002 Manchester Games, Indian wrestlers won three gold, two silver and one bronze before the sport was dropped during the last Games at Melbourne.         
	For the Delhi Games, we managed to restore wrestling in the events list but now some of the western nations want the sport to be dropped, said a senior WFI official. We believe they dont want wrestling because these countries are not strong enough to compete against India, he added.         
	In the ongoing Games, along with the freestyle events, India have managed to introduce Greco Roman events and womens wrestling. With competition being not too stiff, India have managed to collect a rich haul of medals in the Greco Roman events.         
	If the CGF removes wrestling from the list of events, it is going to be a huge loss for India, said the WFI official. We have already requested both the CGF and FILA (International Wrestling Federation) to scuttle any such move, he added.

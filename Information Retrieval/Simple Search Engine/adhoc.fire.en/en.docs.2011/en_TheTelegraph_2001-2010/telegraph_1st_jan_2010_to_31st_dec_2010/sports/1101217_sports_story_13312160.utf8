The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raman is still positive
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raman is still positive
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Despite conceding the first innings lead, Bengal still have a chance to win the crucial Ranji Trophy match against the Railways, according to coach WV Raman.         
	The former India cricketer admitted that things could have been better for the visiting side at the end of the second day but claimed his bowlers should not be blamed entirely.         
	Definitely we could have bowled better But, the first set of mistakes happened yesterday (Wednesday) when we were batting, said Raman. At the moment, we are playing a catch-up game. The onus is on us to do our best but I am sure we can make a comeback         
	Raman did not agree that Laxmi Ratan Shukla could have been given more overs to bowl by Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary. That was not the case. He bowled well but when you have five or six bowlers, you have to make changes. Others, too, bowled well, he said.         
	In such a scenario, one has to think of the situation judiciously So, somebody will be bowling less, Raman added.         
	The Bengal coach said his team performed well throughout the season. Inexperienced cost us to some extent but still my boys did their best. You have to think of the group We were in a tough group where lots of teams possess the ability to qualify. Considering the situation, my boys did a good job, said Raman.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Tushar sheds tears of joy
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Tushar Khandkar couldnt control his tears after Indias thrilling 8-7 win (via tie-breaker) over England, in the Commonwealth Games semi-finals, at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, here on Tuesday.         
	Yeh khushi ki aansoo hey. I am too happy to react. I just cant tell what it means for me to be in the Commonwealth Games final.         
	Jose Brasa, meanwhile, pooh-poohed Englands allegation that Arjun Hallapas stroke in the tie-breaker and Saravanjit Singhs equaliser was not legitimate. I dont agree If thats the case then all three goals in regulation time were dubious. There was only one deserving winner and that was India, he said.         
	Brasa, however, said that India still had a long way to go. We are ascending slowly. This tournament has showed that we can take on the best teams in the world. But we have a long way to go, Brasa said.         
	According to Brasa, Drag-flicker Sandeep Singhs lack of form is not a concern. He is the best we have But then I cant predict when Sandeep will get his rhythm back. He is practising hard and the results will definitely come.         
	For captain Rajpal Singh, taking one match at a time is the right approach. It helps when you take one match at a time. The pressure is less, he said.         
	Speaking about the final, he said: We will not divulge our plans... You will see that on Thursday.         
	And teamspirit, says Rajpal, is the secret behind Indias success. We are rallying around each other. Thats why even when we were trailing, we never lost hope. We kept on attacking and thats why we were able to come back.         
	But England captain Barry Middleton picked Australia as the overwhelming favourites in the final. India will not be able to beat them. Thats for sure.         
	Middleton also said that the noisy crowd tilted the match in the hosts favour. The crowd support titled the balance. They were so noisy that sometimes we were not being able to give instructions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea thrash Villa 7-1
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chelsea thrash Villa 7-1
                      
	London: Chelsea thrashed Aston Villa 7-1 to keep the pressure on defending champion Manchester United, but Arsenal lost ground in the English Premier League title race by drawing 1-1 with Birmingham on Saturday.         
	Frank Lampard scored four to lift his Chelsea tally to 151 and his club to the top of the standings.         
	Samir Nasri put third-place Arsenal ahead in the 82nd minute at Birmingham, but Kevin Phillips levelled in stoppage time. Tottenham strengthened their grip on fourth place as Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar scored in a 2-0 victory against former club Portsmouth, which is bottom and doomed to relegation.         
	The other two teams in the drop zone are Burnley and Hull, which moved level with West Ham by beating Fulham 2-0 as the 17th-place Hammers lost 1-0 at Stoke. Wolverhampton went five points clear of the bottom three by drawing 0-0 with Everton.         
	Lampard netted his first after 15 minutes by turning Florent Maloudas low cross past Brad Friedel at the far post.         
	But Chelseas Yuri Zhirkov allowed John Carew to ghost into space at the far post to meet Ashley Youngs curling cross and level for Villa.         
	Zhirkov made amends just before halftime when he earned a penalty after being fouled by Villa defender James Collins. Lampard converted the spotkick and there was no way back for Villa as Chelsea added five more after the break in an ominous prelude to their FA Cup semi-final meeting in two weeks.

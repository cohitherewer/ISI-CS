	Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat has ruled out the possibility of international cricket returning to Pakistan soon.         
	Lorgat said that until teams had the confidence to visit Pakistan and were satisfied with the security environment it would not be possible to resume international cricket in the country.         
	I can only advise Pakistan to follow the example of South Africa who focused on their domestic cricket when they were isolated from international cricket and managed to return with a bang, Lorgat told a news conference on Thursday.         
	Lorgat is the first ICC official to visit Pakistan since the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore last year.         
	That is the reason why Pakistan is playing is so much international cricket at neutral venues and abroad over the next few months, he said.         
	Lorgat also dispelled the notion that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was trying to isolate Pakistan.         
	Keep in mind India has only one seat on the board like other countries. All decisions are taken collectively, Lorgat said.         
	He also dismissed suggestions that shifting 2011 World Cup matches from Pakistan on security ground was a racist decision.         
	Lorgat stressed Pakistan remained an integral part of the ICC and the cricket world would be supportive of the challenging times Pakistan faces.         
	We will do everything possible to support cricket being played in Pakistan. We have to be mindful of the realities and have to convince other members to come to Pakistan but that is a process. I would appeal to everyone to exercise patience because it cant happen overnight, he said.         
	Lorgat also dismissed reports that the ICC has supplied evidence of some Pakistani players involvement in match-fixing to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	We have a very stringent and modernised procedure in place to tackle any corruption in cricket and we at the ICC dont go by hearsay or unsubstantiated allegations against anyone, Lorgat said.

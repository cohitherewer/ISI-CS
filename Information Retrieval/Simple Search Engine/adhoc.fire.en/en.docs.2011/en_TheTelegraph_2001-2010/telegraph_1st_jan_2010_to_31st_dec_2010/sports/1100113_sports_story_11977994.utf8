The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strike is the right step: Dhanraj
                                                                                                                       7                                      Strike is the right step: Dhanraj
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Olympian Dhanraj Pillay Tuesday threw his weight behind the senior Indian players who were locked in a bitter dispute with Hockey India with their demand of better wages and rewards for performances at recent tournaments.         
	The players have taken the right step at the right time. Sure, the World Cup is a big event and it is every hockey players dream to take part in it, but there is life beyond hockey, Pillay said after leading Air India to victory in the Guru Tegh Bahadur Gold Cup tournament here on Tuesday.         
	The 41-year-old Khel Ratna awardee did not believe that the players were being instigated by others. All the 22 players have stuck together. They are old enough, physically and mentally mature enough, to understand what they are doing. I dont think anyone is instigating them, Pillay said.

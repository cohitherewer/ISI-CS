The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | From trash bags to flashbulbs
                                                                                                                       7                                        From trash bags to flashbulbs
                    Grafite                      
	Johannesburg: Not many people expected Grafite to be at the World Cup  not even the Brazil striker himself.         
	He had no idea it would happen when he played in an amateur league in exchange for diapers and food for his newborn baby girl. He had no idea it would happen when he hopped from door to door on the streets of a small Brazilian city selling trash bags as a 21-year-old.         
	Actually, he had no idea it would happen even on the day coach Dunga announced the 23 Brazilian players headed to the World Cup in South Africa.         
	Edinaldo Batista Libanio, known as Grafite, was a late addition to Brazils World Cup squad, making the team after playing only a few minutes under Dungas command.         
	Three months ago I had no hopes of playing at the World Cup, Grafite said. I knew Dunga had closed his group of players and my chances were minimal.         
	One of the least known players in a Brazilian squad already missing many stars, Grafite got his shot after regular starter Luis Fabiano was dropped from a friendly against Ireland in March.         
	Grafite was added to the team and made the most of it, impressing Dunga in Brazils 2-0 victory in London, the teams final match before the World Cup squad was announced.         
	I still thought I was a long shot to make the team, he said.         
	Grafite was so nervous the day the coach summoned the Brazilian squad that he couldnt even watch the announcement. I was in my house and just went to the garden with my dog to wait there, the 31-year-old Wolfsburg striker said.         
	My family and all my friends were in the living room watching the TV. From time to time I would just look at them from the garden to see what was going on. If they kept quiet I knew it would be bad news. All of a sudden they started yelling and celebrating. My daughter ran to me and we hugged and started crying.         
	Like most Brazilian players, Grafite comes from a poor family and had to go through many personal difficulties when he was younger. Providing for his family meant he had little time for football.         
	When I heard I was summoned to the World Cup I started getting flashes of my early days, he said.         
	Of when I was in Campo Limpo Paulista playing for diapers and groceries for my daughter, Ana Carolina, who had just been born. I had to go through a lot, nothing was easy.         
	Unlike most Brazilian players, it took a long time until Grafite was able to make it as a professional.         
	I started late, I was selling trash bags until I was 21 years old, he said. But thankfully my career progressed after that. It wasnt easy to get to where I am now.         
	Grafite was finally invited to play for the small Matonense club in the interior of Sao Paulo in 1999, and a couple of years later he was signed by traditional Brazilian club Gremio.         
	His career skyrocketed with Sao Paulo, the club he helped win the Copa Libertadores and Fifas club world championship in 2005. Grafite transferred to Le Mans in France a year later, and in 2007 joined current club Wolfsburg.         
	My trajectory hasnt been easy, like of most players, he said. This is a dream. When I got called up for the World Cup, my wife just said, You deserve what is happening to you, its what you fought for.

	Calcutta: With the challenge of a fresh season up the corner, its business time for the Big Two of Calcutta football. As the East Bengal players had their first training session of the season under British coach Trevor James Morgan, Mohun Bagan legend Jose Ramirez Barreto made a quiet entry for yet another season with the green-and maroons.         
	I am confident that with Murithala joining our squad, we will be able to score more goals. I have played alongside (Edeh) Chidi and now Murithala will be joining us. I am hopeful that Mohun Bagan will do well this season, the talismanic Brazilian told the reporters.         
	The two-month rest has also done a world of good admitted Barreto. After a tough season, your body needs adequate rest. Having got that, I am now raring to go. Its not that I have only enjoyed my holiday in Brazil, I have also done some physical training for the past few weeks. I am feeling fitter than ever before. Right now, I would be straightaway hitting the gym, Barreto said.         
	On the other hand, Morgan, after first days training, stressed on the improvement of on-field communication of the players.         
	Good on-field communication skills are of paramount importance. This is an area which will only develop with experience. The more they play together, the faster they will learn, Morgan said. The coach, however, said he is very happy with the fitness level of the players.         
	I am pleased to see their fitness level. The ground condition and the facilities are also good. We need to have a good bench strength so that they can be consistent even when the main players are away, he said.         
	The East Bengal players practised for an hour on the opening day as India captain Bhaichung Bhutia dropped in to watch his teammates train.

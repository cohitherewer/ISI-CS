The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Padraigs Ryder Cup position is uncertain
                                                                                                                       7                                        Padraigs Ryder Cup position is uncertain
                  Padraig Harrington                     
	Kohler: Former winner Padraig Harrington double-bogeyed the last to miss the cut by a stroke at the US PGA Championship on Saturday, and leave his Ryder Cup place in doubt.         
	The Irishman was three-under for the second round and level overall heading to the par-four 18th at Whistling Straits but he dumped his second shot into a water hazard after being distracted by a photographer.         
	Having taken a penalty drop, he struck his fourth 10 feet past the pin and missed the bogey putt to wind up with a one-under-par 71 and a two-over total of 146.         
	Obviously I dont feel good about taking six down the last, a subdued Harrington told reporters after completing his weather-delayed second round on a sun-splashed morning.         
	I felt I had done all the hard work at that stage. Yesterday when I got it back to level par I was thinking about winning the tournament.         
	Harrington, who won the PGA Championship at Oakland Hills in 2008, hit a perfect drive down the 18th fairway and planned to play conservatively with his approach.         
	I couldnt go for the flag and was going for the middle of the green, the 38-year-old Dubliner said. I just got distracted ... and hit it fat. But the real issue for me is I should have been four or five under coming down the last.         
	As much as it is very disappointing to double the last, I have hit the ball well enough to be in contention here.         
	Harringtons bid to compete in a sixth successive Ryder Cup is also up in the air as he does not plan to play in the last two qualifying events on the European Tour and will have to rely on a captains pick.         
	At the end of the day, nobody who doesnt qualify deserves automatically to be picked, the Irishman said.         
	My majors have been poor this year but everything else has been good.         
	I have worked hard, tried hard and if I get picked I want to be ready to play. If it doesnt happen, I will be disappointed but there is not more I could have done. It is just one of those things.         
	Harrington was among several big names to exit the PGA Championship on Saturday where 72 players made the cut.           (REUTERS)

    - Bopanna-Qureshi move into pre-quarters; easy win for nadal                 Ana Ivanovic in New York, on Friday. The Serbian beat Virginie Razzaro of France 7-5, 6-0, in the third round. (AP)                           
	New York: Jelena Jankovics U.S. Open hopes were literally blown away on Saturday when she was beaten 2-6, 6-7 by Kaia Kanepi of Estonia in the third round at Flushing Meadows.         
	The fourth seeded Jankovic was unable to control her serve and groundstrokes in the gusting winds on centre court, as Kanepi held her game together to reach the last 16 in New York for the first time.         
	Kanepi has been one of the biggest improvers on the womens professional tour this year, rising more than 100 places in the rankings since May.         
	Robin Soderling advanced to the round of 16 with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands.         
	The fifth-seeded Soderling, twice a runner-up at the French Open,needed only 1 hour, 42 min utes at a blustery Flushing Meadows on Saturday to defeat the 48th-ranked De Bakker.         
	After struggling through a five-setter in his opening round, the Swede has only dropped 16 games in his next two matches.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi lost in the second round of the mens doubles. The Indo-Belarrussain duo lost 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 to the Argentine pair of Eduardo Schwank and Horacio Zeballos.         
	Meanwhile, if you blinked, you might have missed it but Rafael Nadal gave the tennis world another look at the weapon he hopes will help him win the US Open and complete his Grand Slam collection.         
	The world No. 1 has been working hard on his serve in the belief that it holds the key to his chances of finally conquering New York. If his performance on Friday night was any guide, the wait may soon be over.         
	Playing his second round match against Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan at the Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday, Nadal produced an extraordinary display of serving.         
	It was a high-quality match of power-hitting from both players but he never once lost his serve, which flew fastest across the net at 134 mph (216kph). He won 6-2, 7-6, 7-5.         
	Nadals victory kept him on course for a semi-final showdown with Britains Andy Murray but the top professionals never like to talk about possible match-ups. One match at a time is their mantra.         
	But both are in great form and are yet to drop a set in the tournament. If either were beaten before the semi-finals it would be a surprise.         
	Murrays second-round opponent on Friday was an unorthodox Jamaican called Dustin Brown. The Briton knew little about him but was warned to expect the unexpected. It was good advice but not a great contest, the Scotsman winning easily, 7-5, 6-3, 6-0.         
	With his dreadlocked hair, sleeveless shirt and baggy shorts, Brown was an instant hit with the centre court crowd but apart from a few fleeting moments in the first set, he was blown away.         
	Murray, warned that Hurricane Earl was about to dump gallons of rain on the national tennis centre, was in such a hurry to beat the wild weather that never came, that he had to head back out to the practice courts again because he wanted another workout.         
	Meanwhile, Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi progressed to the mens doubles pre-quarter finals with a straight-set win over German-Finn pair of Michael Kohlmann and Jarkko Nieminen.         
	The 16th seed Indo-Pak pair defeated their opponents 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.         
	In the mixed doubles event, last years finalists Leander Paes and Cara Black of Zimbabwe moved to the second round after a 6-4, 7-5 win over Czech pair of Lucie Hradecka and Frantisek Cermak.         
	However, no Indian will be seen competing in the junior US Open this year as Rishika Sunkara, Sai Kartik Reddy and Rakshat Thakkar crashed out of their respective qualifying events.         
	Rishika, the 11th seed, lost her opening round 4-6, 2-6 to American unseeded Gabrielle Desimone in the girls singles. A lot was expected from Sai but he went down fighting 3-6, 5-7 against Canadas Pavel Krainik in the first round of the boys singles qualifiers. Also falling at first hurdle was Rakshat, who lost 2-6, 4-6 to Diego Galeano of Paraguay.         
	Friday was not a day for the underdogs. They gave the seeds moments of trouble but the big names in action all prevailed. It has been a tournament bereft of upsets but that has only set the stage for a crackerjack second week.         
	Venus Williams, wearing a sparkling evening dress that would not have been out of place at a Manhattan cocktail party, trounced qualifier Mandy Minella of Luxembourg 6-2, 6-1 before hamming it up with her sister Serena in a mock interview with the host television broadcaster.         
	The defending womens champion Kim Clijsters reeled off 12 games in a row to win her match with Czech Petra Kvitova while French Open champion Francesca Schiavone and Grand Slam finalists Elena Dementieva and Samantha Stosur cruised to straight-set wins.         
	Clijsters lost the first three games against Kvitova but quickly turned it all around and won the next 12 on the trot in her 6-3, 6-0 win.         
	The Belgian, who also won here in 2005, struggled with her serve in the windy conditions but still proved too much for Kvitova, the 27th seed, to handle. She has not lost a set in this years tournament and is steadily improving aspects of her game.         
	Clijsters will play unseeded Serb Ana Ivanovic in the round of 16 with Stosur or Dementieva lurking in the quarters. Ivanovic beat Virginie Razzano of France 7-5, 6-0.         
	Stosur, runner-up at the French Open in June and seeded fifth at Flushing Meadows, turned in an impressive display to defeat Italys Sara Errani 6-2, 6-3 in one hour 20 minutes.         
	The Australian came into the tournament under an injury cloud but is slowly building momentum and confidence.         
	Dementieva, a finalist here six years ago, booked her passage into the fourth round with a 7-5, 6-2 victory over Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova. The Russian won the Olympic gold medal in Beijing two years ago but has never won a Grand Slam singles title.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Do-or-die for Lanka
                                                                                                                       7                                      Do-or-die for Lanka
                      
	Georgetown: With their campaign derailed by a shock loss to New Zealand, Sri Lanka face a battle of survival against a confident Zimbabwe in their second Group B match of the World Twenty20 here Monday.         
	In their opening match, Sri Lanka had done most things right till the last over. The Islanders posted a good score on board and defended it well before Nathan McCullum stole the match with a six off Lasith Malinga in the final over.         
	That six of the second-last ball has pitched the Lankans in a do-or-die battle against Zimbabwe, who are coming into Mondays match after beating the formidable Australians and defending champions Pakistan in their warm-up games.         
	For the African team, Elton Chigumbura has done the bulk of scoring, hitting a 35-ball 76 against Australia and an unbeaten 35-ball 49 against Pakistan. Craig Ervine, Charles Coventry and opener Hamilton Masakadza have also contributed with the bat.

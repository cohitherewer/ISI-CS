The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB wants correct attitude
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB wants correct attitude
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: As it gets ready to host its first ever bowlers rectification camp (as directed by the National Cricket Academy), the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is hoping that two of its promising players  off-spinner Sambit Roy and pacer Arijit Banerjee  do not go Kalighat cricketer Amit Dass way.         
	Sambit and Arijit are, incidentally, two from Bengal among the 27 East Zone players with suspect action who will be attending the camp under the guidance of former Bihar cricketer K.V.P. Rao.         
	It seems the CAB learnt a harsh lesson in Amits case. Amit was an integral part of the Bengal U-22 squad two seasons back before he was called for suspect action during a CK Nayudu national U-22 match.         
	He was first sent to the NCA for remedial measures.         
	The then Bengal U-22 coach Ajay Verma was engaged to monitor the process.         
	Once considered a bright prospect, Amit never took the rectification measures seriously.         
	During the past one year, he has time and again evaded the remedial sessions to the extent that even his coaches lost hope of correcting him.         
	The result has been disastrous for Amit who is not even a regular now in a Kalighat club side that boasts of such names as Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Manoj Tiwary.         
	Association joint secretary Arun Mitra wants Sambit and Arijit to take this camp seriously.         
	They are very talented and should take this camp seriously. Amit took it lightly and now will never be considered for Bengal team selection until he can completely corrects his action, Mitra said.         
	The camp will be held at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Facility at CAB. After the week long camp, the bowlers will work under their respective coaches to iron out the other flaws.

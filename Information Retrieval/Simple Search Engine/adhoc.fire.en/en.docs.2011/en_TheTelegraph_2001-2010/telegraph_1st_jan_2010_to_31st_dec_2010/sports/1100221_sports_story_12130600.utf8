The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roddick out, Sharapova enters final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Roddick out, Sharapova enters final
                      
	Memphis: Sam Querrey broke top seeded Andy Roddicks serve twice in the deciding set to stun the defending champion 7-5, 3-6, 6-1 in the quarter finals of the Memphis Championships on Friday.         
	Womens top seed Maria Sharapova advanced to the final defeating fifth ranked Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-3.         
	American world No. 31 Querrey took charge of the deciding set after he battled to deuce in the second game before Roddick double faulted to gift his compatriot a 2-0 lead.         
	I played one sloppy game in the third set and that was it, Roddick told reporters. Sometimes at this level theres not much in between it.         
	Querrey said he knew he had to take advantage of Roddicks errors.         
	Youre not going to get that too many times from Andy, but Ill take it, he told reporters. When that rare opportunity comes youve just got to take advantage of it. I thought I did a good job there, and just kept the momentum going and played an unbelievable third set.         
	Querrey consolidated his advantage with another break two games later and eased to victory for the loss of just one more game.           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya had every reason to feel disappointed during his interaction with the media after his teams 1-1 draw with Dempo in the 10th round I-league encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Why?         
	The answer lay in his opposite number Armando Colacos words: Chirag were a better team and should have won the match. I am happy to have got a point.         
	Two impressive strikes from set-piece movements, by either side, were all that the 1000-odd crowd got to see.         
	The draw didnt change Dempos position in the league as they held on to their second spot with 19 points. Chirag, with same number of points, are now placed third as the Goan outfit enjoys a better goal difference.         
	The match will be remembered for a brilliant 65th minute free-kick by Chirags Brazilian striker Edmilson which help his team draw level after Peter Carvalho had put Dempo ahead in the 59th minute.         
	In the 59th minute, Peter Carvalho coolly nodded home an Anthony Pereira flag-kick. It became all the more easier as he got a free-header with none of the Chirag defenders marking him.         
	However the joy was shortlived when Pereira tripped Datta just outside the penalty box on the left side. Edmilson gauged the angle and kept a nice swerving free-kick over the human wall. It had power and dipped slightly as it evaded the pint-sized goalkeeper Abhijit Mondals reach to enter the net.         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Somnath Khanra, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, Eduardo Chacon, Arnab Mondal (Kingshuk Debnath 90+1), Dhanarajan, Gauranga Biswas (Saumik Chakraborty, 88th), Denson Devadas, Jayanta Sen (Rahul Kumar 83rd), Gauranga Datta, Ashim Biswas, Edmilson.         
	Dempo SC: Abhijit Mondal, Marcus Peixoto, John Dias, Mahesh Gawli, Samir Naik, Anthony Pereira, Climax Lawrence, Peter Carvalho, Clifford Miranda, Sunil Chetri (Jerry Zirasangha, 85th), Joaquim Abranches.         
	Referee: Dinesh Nair         
	MoM: Edmilson

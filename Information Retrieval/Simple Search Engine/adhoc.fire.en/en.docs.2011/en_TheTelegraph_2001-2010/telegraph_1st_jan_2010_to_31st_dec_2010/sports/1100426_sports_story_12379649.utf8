The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sasi, Hari draw in Asian meet
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sasi, Hari draw in Asian meet
                      
	Subic Bay (Philippines): Grandmaster K. Sasikiran was held to a draw by unheralded Vietnamese Nguyen Huynh Minh Huy while P. Harikrishna also split points with Yu Ruiyuan of China in the fourth round of the Asian Continental chess meet.         
	After losing the third round against Susanto Megaranto of Indonesia from a better position, Sasikirans chances of breaking in to the 2700 Elo rating club were further dented by Huy and the Indian will have to do really well in the remaining five games to be in title contention.         
	Playing black, Sasikiran was surprised by the solid white play and routine exchanges led to a drawn queen and pawns endgame wherein the Indian was forced to sign the peace treaty.         
	On a comeback trial after losing the first round, Harikrishnas victory run was halted by unknown Chinese Ruiyuan, who put up a sterling show in a Slav defense game with black pieces.         
	Both Sasikiran and Harikrishna have 2.5 points and have to do a lot of hard work if they want to finish among the top five  the qualifying berths to the next World Chess Cup.         
	Meanwhile 2008 world junior champion Abhijeet Gupta produced a gem of an endgame to outwit Gao Rui of China. The endgame saw Abhijeet emerging triumphant in an opposite coloured Bishop endgame after hard labour lasting 65 moves.

	Calcutta: Audi, which is a stakeholder (nearly 10 per cent) in FC Bayern Munich, plans to jointly start a school/academy for football in India.         
	We dont wish to fit into the me-too category... No disrespect to cricket, which is so huge in India, but wed like to start at the grassroots level in a sport with enormous potential, Audi India director Michael Perschke told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Wednesday, he added: Audi has a strong football DNA and India is one market where wed like to extend that association... We know theres talent and, as we move forward, wed like to have the blessings of the All India Football Federation.         
	Bayern Munich, according to Perschke, are fully committed and, as a first step, will be hosting seven youngsters from the region for a fortnight.         
	He added: The school/academy wont happen overnight, but be set up in stages... Were in it for the long haul... Audi is also a strategic partner of FC Bayern Munich and youll find us playing as a team.         
	Ravi Shastri, a former captain of the Indian cricket team, is Audis brand ambassador, and is expected to play a role in the football project.

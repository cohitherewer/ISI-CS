	Calcutta: There are a couple of inferences that can be drawn from Mohun Bagans humiliating 1-4 defeat at the hands of Lajong FC in their 18th round I-League encounter on Saturday.         
	First, the scoreline can hardly be a true reflection of Bagans performance when their players spurn chances like millionaires. Second, age is slowly becoming a factor with the marathon league set to enter its sixth month. Aged Bagan players like Jose Ramirez Barreto, Deepak Mondal, Surkumar Singh, Marcos Pereira are finding it difficult to maintain the level of form and fitness showed during the first leg.         
	That is exactly why the little-known boys from Northeast won the encounter hands down. Of course, they were helped to the memorable victory by a Bagan defence that hasnt been able to repair the chinks in its armour. Proof, the green and maroon brigade were 0-2 down by the 21st minute.         
	By the time Bagan regrouped the damage had already been done. The third and fourth goals came in the last couple of minutes with the home team players appearing out of breath. The end result  Bagan suffered the ignominy of losing back-to-back matches against bottom-rung teams fighting to beat the drop.         
	In the 10th minute, it was James Gbilee whose defence splitting through ball found an unmarked S. Tuboi who beat Surkumar Singh on sheer speed to make it 1-0 with a deft placement. In the 21st minute, Kelechi Okeyes powerful low free-kick deflected off the wall before crashing into the net.         
	Down 0-2, Bagan pulled one back; Surkumar making amends with a booming right footer that flew into the net. But, then, coach Satyajit Chatterjee made another blunder. Rather than fielding an attacker, he replaced N.S. Manju with Biswajit Saha where an Ishfaq Ahmed in place of James Singh could have made an immediate impact.         
	If Manju was bad, then Biswajit is not fit to don the green and maroon colours. Not once did he deliver a correct pass. His only contribution was being fooled by substitute Niwan--Gatphoh who dribbled past three others before slotting home in stoppage time, a minute before Anil Gurung scored the fourth past a hapless Sheikh Azim and Surkumar.         
	In between, it was the exhibition of embarrassing gaffes from Barreto and Co. which made matters worse as Lajong scripted the sensational victory of the season. Last but not the least, Satyajit is not someone who can bring laurels to the team as a coach.

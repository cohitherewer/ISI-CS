The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Padraig hopes to avoid Woods
                                                                                                                       7                                        Padraig hopes to avoid Woods
            Jonathan Liew            Tiger Woods                           
	It has been 18 days since Tiger Woods announced his intention to swap his hairshirt for a green jacket, during which time his opening tee-shot at the Masters has assumed the status of the most highly anticipated in history.         
	For the first time, the Augusta National has granted ESPN permission to break into its daytime schedule to broadcast it live. That the fixation on Woods riles many in the game is no secret. For Padraig Harrington, though, it is close to the ideal scenario.         
	The Irishman has always operated most effectively under the radar. It is no coincidence that in each of his three major victories, he has come from behind. This Masters should suit him just fine. As long, of course, as he does not find himself cast in the role of ringmaster.         
	After two weeks of platitudes, Harrington has become one of the first players to admit that he would rather not play with Woods on the first two days.         
	From the point of view of competing, the less stress I have over the week, the better, he said. The problem is that once the crowds come out on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, Im going to be continually asked about it, adding to my own stress. Ive got my own things to do rather than spending a lot of time discussing somebody else.         
	Given the number of enemies Woods has made on the tour, the organisers will take a slightly closer interest in the draw than usual, possibly leaving Woods paired with a former winner, or an ally.         
	Still, it could happen, even if Harrington would rather it did not. The key for winning a tournament is being strong on a Sunday afternoon, he explained. If, from the Monday of that week, theres interviews and questions and expectations, its hard to stay mentally strong. It doesnt change the actual playing of the golf, but it does change the stress on the golf course...

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shambazar Club have decided to pull out of the A.N. Ghosh Trophy due to inordinate delay in organising the matches. As a result, Mohun Bagan got walkover in a group league match, on Monday.         
	Club president Gautam Dasgupta said: We dont have enough players to take further part in any of the tournaments. Since we havent qualified for the P. Sen Trophy, its no point playing in this tournament also. For a small club like us, it is difficult to continue playing with such limited resources.         
	In another match, Kalighat bowled out Bhowanipore for 255 in 84.3 overs. Aritra Chatterjee scored 59. Amit Das grabbed five for 53 while Sanjib Goel took three for 78.         
	Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has paid an ad-hoc amount of Rs 4 crore to the CAB from the money they received through TV rights.

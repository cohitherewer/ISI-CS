The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Experts all praise for Paes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Experts all praise for Paes
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Naresh Kumar, Jaidip Mukerjea and Akhtar Ali showered accolades on Leander Paes for winning his 11th career Grand Slam title.               
	Here are what they have to say (alphabetically)               
	Akhtar Ali: Each and every international century scored by Sachin Tendulkar is celebrated by one and all. I guess Leander Paess achievements at the international level is at par with Tendulkar. Like Tendulkar, he is also someone who wears his heart in his sleeve. It is not easy to consistently perform at the international level for over a decade. Full credit to Leander that he is still performing brilliantly at this level. He is still a keen student of the game. Another factor worked in his favour. The top singles players dont play doubles. And among the rest, more than half dont know the art of playing doubles. In this scenario, Leander who is a formidable doubles player takes advantage of the situation.         
	Naresh Kumar: Leander played very well. It is a great thing for India when all of our players fell by the wayside, Leander kept the Indian flag flying.         
	Jaidip Mukerjea: I believe it is a phenomenal achievement. I salute his hunger to succeed. No one can ever question his grit and determination. He has once again answered his critics at a time when some people were questioning whether he should continue playing. Normally, good touch players turn out to be better doubles players. Leander possesses fantastic reflexes and is excellent at the net. All these aspects make him a force to reckon with as far as doubles and mixed doubles are concerned. I still feel he can win couple of more Grand Slams.

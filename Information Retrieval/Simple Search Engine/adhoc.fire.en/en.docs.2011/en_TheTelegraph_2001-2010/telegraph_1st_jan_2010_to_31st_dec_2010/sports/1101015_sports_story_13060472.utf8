                                                                                                                       7                                        Dilip: Sachin has been at his peak for all 21 years
  To be consistent is Team Indias biggest challenge         A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dilip Vengsarkar                                 
	Calcutta: Former India captain and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar, who is in the city on a private visit, spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday afternoon. Incidentally, hes recently been appointed chairman of the Boards cricket development committee.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Indias 2-0 Test series win over Australia...         
	Terrific... Ideally, I wouldve liked at least a three-Test series, but Im not complaining... A sweep is a sweep... I particularly liked the way Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara accepted the challenge in Bangalore... The seniors, of course, contributed in both Tests. Overall, an outstanding performance in Mohali and in Bangalore.         
	Thoughts on the MoS, Sachin Tendulkar         
	Sachins hunger and passion remains very high... Id say hes been at his peak for all 21 years of his India career... I hope hell be serving the country for some years more.         
	Having presented a bat to Sachin even before hed played for Mumbai         
	(Laughs) Yes, I gifted him a Gunn amp; Moore... I think that was after hed been picked for the Bombay U-15s. Id heard a lot about Sachin and saw him at nets.         
	Sachins reaction         
	Understandably, he was quite thrilled, but being shy, didnt really express himself... As a person, hes still quite shy.         
	Whether an established India cricketer gave him a bat when he was trying to make an impact         
	Oh, yes... (Sunil) Gavaskar presented me a Duncan Fearnley after my century for Bombay, in the 1975-76 Irani Trophy, in Nagpur... That innings proved to be a turning point in my career.         
	A little-known fact about Sachin         
	Talent apart, what stood out was his strength... I remember that except Salil Ankola, Sachin would beat everybody in panjaa! Being ambidextrous, hed win both with the right and left hands.         
	Sachin the person         
	Despite being so successful, he hasnt changed one bit... Sachin remains humble and so grounded. That has to be appreciated.         
	His take on Sachin the cricketer         
	Sachin has always been supremely confident of his abilities... I recall being the Bombay captain in his debut season (1988-89) in the Ranji Trophy... We were playing Hyderabad and, on the day in question, I decided to protect Sachin and sent Kiran Mokashi as the nightwatchman... Wed already lost some wickets and Mokashi, too, got out... Sachin didnt tell me, but told somebody else that an extra wicket (of Mokashi) had been lost unnecessarily and that he couldve played out the remaining overs... He was only 15 then, but so high on confidence. The next day, on a turner, he played Arshad Ayub, Venkatapathi Raju and Kanwaljeet Singh beautifully... I knew we had somebody special in our midst.         
	Message for Sachin         
	(Laughs) Just keep playing.         
	Thoughts on Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who got the India captaincy for the first time when he was the chief selector         
	Well, we stand vindicated... From the beginning, Ive been impressed with Dhonis calmness, his quiet confidence and his body language... Hes the positive sort... I dont need to emphasise that hes been doing such a good job.         
	Team Indias biggest challenge         
	To be consistent.         
	Finally, whether Rahul Dravid should review where he stands...         
	Dravids been around for 14-15 years... Hell know what to do... Having been there for so long, hes the best judge (of the situation)... Its not for me to offer advice.

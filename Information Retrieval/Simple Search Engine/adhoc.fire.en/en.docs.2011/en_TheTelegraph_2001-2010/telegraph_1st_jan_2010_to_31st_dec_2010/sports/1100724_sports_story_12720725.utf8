            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Despite Indias 10-wicket defeat in the first Test, against Sri Lanka, opener Virender Sehwag held on to the No. 1 spot, while Sachin Tendulkar gained a place to be seventh in the latest ICC rankings for Test batsmen issued on Friday.         
	Sehwag, who scored 109 and 31 in the two innings in Galle, has opened up a 14-point gap over second-placed Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara. Opener Gautam Gambhir, middle-order batsmen Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni have failed to retain their places.         
	Gambhir has slipped six places to the 10th position, Laxman has fallen two places to the 15th position, Dravid has dropped one place to 18 th, while Dhoni has fallen four places to the 40th spot.         
	Meanwhile, iconic spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who retired from Test cricket on Thursday, bowed out in the third position, behind Dale Steyn of South Africa and Pakistans Mohammed Asif, after climbing two spots in the latest rankings for Test bowlers.         
	Muralidharans figures of five for 63 and three for 128 helped him complete 800 wickets in Tests. The 38-year-old had first surged to the top of the bowling rankings in January 2002 after his match figures of nine for 91 against Zimbabwe made him the quickest bowler to reach 400 Test wickets.         
	He went on to spend a record 214 Tests and 1,711 days in the No. 1 position.         
	Australias former fast bowler Glenn McGrath has the second best record, having enjoyed the coveted No. 1 ranking for 174 Tests.         
	Within a year of making his Test debut against Australia at Colombo, Muralidharan broke into the top 20 when he jumped to the 19th position in September 1993 at P. Sara Oval in Colombo against South Africa and then never dropped out. The closest he came to slipping out of the top 20 was in March 1997, against New Zealand, in Dunedin, when he was briefly in 20th position.         
	Muralidharans rating was consistently above 800 and often above 900 ratings points, an indicator of sustained and outstanding performances.         
	The bowlers who slipped in the latest rankings include off-colour Indian pacer Ishant Sharma, who was down one spot to 22nd, Rangana Herath (31st, down by six places) and Pragyan Ojha (58th, down by nine places).

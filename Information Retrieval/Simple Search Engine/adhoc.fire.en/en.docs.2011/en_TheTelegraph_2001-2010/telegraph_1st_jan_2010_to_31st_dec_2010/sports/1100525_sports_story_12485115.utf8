The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda aims to make it count 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dinda aims to make it count 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashok Dinda                           
	Calcutta: Its not often that an Indian pace attack for a tri-series consists of a quartet that has no experience of playing one day Internationals. It becomes stranger still when one discovers that two of them have had experience of playing in only one Twenty20 International. But that hardly bothers Bengal speedster Ashok Dinda.         
	When you play for India, you have to put your hand up and be counted and respond to pressure situations. I know that apart from me and R. Vinay Kumar (who made his debut in the World T20), none of the other pacers have played international cricket.         
	Even we are new to international cricket but that hardly matters. I have performed well in the Indian Premier League. Now I have to repeat the same kind of consistency at the international level, Dinda told The Telegraph on the eve of the national teams departure for Zimbabwe.         
	The absolute rookies are Vidarbha pacer Umesh Yadav and Rajasthans Pankaj Singh.         
	So, what exactly will be his aim in the tri-series?         
	First and foremost will be to stick to a disciplined line and length. Its the percentage of good balls I bowl that matters. One can even end up getting wickets bowling a long hop or a full toss. But my aim is to bowl in the right areas, Dinda said.         
	For Dinda, temperament is what makes a difference at the highest level.         
	My personal coach Atal Dev Varman advised me against getting intimidated by the big names. At this level it is the ability to soak in the pressure which is the key to success.         
	Known for his big hitting lower down the order, Dinda has also been working on his batting.         
	I have always taken my batting seriously. Whenever I have batted with a top-order batsman, I have tried to rotate the strike rather than going for aerial shots.         
	It wont be any different in Zimbabwe although I hope the team do not require me to bat, he laughed.         
	Having played under Suresh Rainas leadership is also an added advantage.         
	It was under Rainas captaincy that I got five wickets in an innings against New Zealand A in a first-class match in Chennai.         
	He is a very helpful lad. I hope I wont let my captain and coach (Gary Kirsten) down, Dinda signed off.

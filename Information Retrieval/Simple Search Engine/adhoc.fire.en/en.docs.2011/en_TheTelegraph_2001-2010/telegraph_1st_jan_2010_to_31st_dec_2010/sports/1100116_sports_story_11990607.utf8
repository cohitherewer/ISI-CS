The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough route for Federer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tough route for Federer
                      
	Melbourne: Roger Federer faces a challenging path if he is to extend his record Grand Slam haul to 16 at the Australian Open, beginning his campaign next week with a first round test against Russian Igor Andreev.         
	In their last meeting, 36th-ranked Andreev took Federer to five sets at the 2008 US Open and should the Swiss continue his march to the fourth round, local hope Lleyton Hewitt or 15th-seeded Frenchman Gilles Simon could block his path to the quarter finals.         
	Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, who the world No. 1 defeated for the 2006 title, also looms as a possible fourth-round opponent, ahead of a potential quarter final against in-form Russian world No. 6 Nikolay Davydenko.         
	Rafael Nadal has a much smoother route to the last eight as he sets out to defend the title he claimed in a five-set thriller against Federer a year ago.         
	The world No. 2 was paired with Australian Peter Luczak when the draw was made on Friday but may face a third-round hurdle against big-serving American John Isner, who knocked Andy Roddick out of the US Open last year.         
	In the womens draw, four-time champion and top seed Serena Williams opens against Polands Urszula Radwanska to start what appears to be a relatively trouble-free run to the quarter finals.         
	However, Russian fifth seed Elena Dementieva will need to be on her best form early on if she hopes to match or improve on her semi-final run last year after being dealt a possible second-round encounter with Justine Henin.         
	The Belgian reached the Brisbane International final earlier this month in her first tournament back from retirement and should have too many weapons for compatriot and first-round opponent Kirsten Flipkens.         
	Should she continue through the tournament, Henin could set up a mouthwatering quarter final against either French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova or fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters, who won the US Open on her own comeback last year. Clijsters, who needed three sets to subdue Henin in Brisbane, has drawn a qualifier in the first round.         
	Indias Sania Mirza has drawn world No. 27 Aravane Rezai of France in the first round of the womens singles main draw.         
	It will be third meeting between Sania and Aravane, who is seeded 26th here, with scores locked 1-1. Both Sania and Aravane have not moved beyond third round at the first Grand Slam of the year.         
	Last time the two players clashed was at Madrid event last year with the French coming out as winner.Sania had beaten Aravane way back in 2006 in Kolkata in their first meeting.         
	Third seed and 2008 champion Novak Djokovic will open against Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver, while US Open champion and fourth seed Juan Martin Del Potro will be hoping his wrist injury does not cause him too many problems during his match against American Michael Russell.         
	The final draw will be released after qualifying wraps up this weekend and could throw up a twist in the womens draw.         
	Belgian world No. 16 Yanina Wickmayer, who was unable to enter the tournament due to a doping ban, is making her way through qualifying. The Australian Open starts on Monday.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Blanc suspends class of 10
    - New France coach hands one-match ban to entire 23-member squad           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            The 2010 French World Cup contingent in South Africa     
	The 2010 Cup squad   Hugo Lloris, Bacary Sagna, Eric Abidal, Anthony Reveillere, William Gallas, Marc Planus, Franck Ribery, Yoann Gourcuff, Djibril Cisse, Sidney Govou, Andre Pierre Gignac, Thierry Henry, Patrice Evra, Jeremy Toulalan, Florent Malouda, Steve Mandanda, Sebastien Squillaci, Alou Diarra, Abou Diaby, Mathieu Valbuena, Nicolas Anelka, Gael Clichy, Cedric Carrasso                                  
	New France coach Laurent Blanc has taken the decision to suspend the entire 23-man squad which took part in this summers failed World Cup campaign for next months friendly against Norway.         
	Frances campaign ended in failure and controversy, as they managed only one point and one goal from three games in Group A and were left in disarray when the squad refused to train two days before their final game against hosts South Africa.         
	Unrest centred around a confrontation between coach Raymond Domenech and Chelsea forward Nicolas Anelka. The player launched a foul-mouthed tirade against Domenech with the details later leaked to a French newspaper.         
	Anelka was sent home, promoting the strike by his teammates, in protest at the unpopular and erratic Domenechs position.         
	A number of senior figures had called for sanctions against the perceived ringleaders of the protest.         
	But Blanc proposed to exclude the whole party at a meeting Friday with the French Football Federations federal council, who ratified the decision. Blanc refused to speak to reporters when he left the federations headquarters. France play Norway on August 11 in Oslo and Blanc is set to announce his squad on August 5.         
	Frances disappointing performance in South Africa came after the team also failed to win a game at the 2008 European Championship, also under Domenech.         
	The French team endured days of chaos at the World Cup after LEquipe newspaper published a rant by Anelka aimed toward Domenech at half-time of a 2-0 loss against Mexico, prompting the French federation to send him home.         
	The next day, the entire squad refused to train in protest and captain Patrice Evra had a lively altercation with the teams fitness coach that was captured by television cameras. The events caused an outcry in France, with politicians harshly criticising the players attitude, legislators in parliament questioning the coach and even President Nicolas Sarkozy weighing in on the debacle.         
	Former international Lilian Thuram  Frances most capped player  even went to the extent of saying that Evra should never play for the team again after leading the boycott.         
	Outgoing federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes has launched an investigation into the players actions. The commission should deliver its conclusions to the federation by August 15.

  - Sweeping winds hit play on second day of the British Open             Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa during the second round of the British Open, at St Andrews, on Friday. (Reuters)                           
	St Andrews: South Africas Louis Oosthuizen surged to a three-stroke lead at the British Open Friday on a day when play was halted because of high winds.         
	Despite sunny skies mixed with puffy white clouds, officials decided the Old Course was unplayable because the wind was gusting to about 40 mph (64 km/h), causing balls to wobble on some of the exposed greens, especially those along St Andrews Bay.         
	Play was suspended 1 hour, 5 minutes at midafternoon, shortly after Phil Mickelson finished his second round in brutally tough conditions and Tiger Woods had teed off.         
	The last wind delay at the British Open came at Royal Birkdale in 1998, when winds reached 40 mph (64 km/h), forcing a 38-minute stoppage during the second round.         
	During the break, some players returned to their lounge near the first tee to wait for conditions to calm. Caddies lounged on a grassy knoll, munching on sandwiches and bananas. Some fans claimed a patch of ground and caught a nap.         
	Oosthuizen, a 27-year-old from Mossel Bay whose given name is Lodewicus Theodorus, shot a 5-under 67 for a 12-under 132 at the midway point of the tournament. He pulled ahead of Rory McIlroy, the 21-year-old Northern Irishman who tied the major-championship record with a 63 on Thursday. The weather made it a typical British Open roller-coaster of a day. The early starters found blue skies when they arrived, but heavy rains rolled in shortly after the start of the round. The sun peeked through the clouds again, then more showers struck just before noon.         
	 The players, it seemed, spent as much time reaching for their umbrellas and rain gear as they did for their clubs. I got up this morning and it wasnt looking real pretty at 4:30, said 50-year-old Mark Calcavecchia, who played in the first group and became the latest old-timer to contend at the Open. It was actually beautiful when we teed off. Then we saw a little bit of everything.         
	Oosthuizen wasnt worried about any of that, and he was already done when the wind started to blow around lunchtime. Im very confident with the way Im playing, he said. There was nothing to indicate he might contend at golfs oldest Major championship. He missed the cut this year at the Masters and the US Open, and did the same at last weeks Scottish Open.         
	This is only the second time hell make the cut in nine Major appearances. The other time, at the 2008 PGA Championship at Oakland Hills, he finished last among those playing on the weekend. But he did claim his first win on the European Tour this year, earning a spot at Augusta National.         
	With the wind at his back, Oosthuizen went with shorter clubs off the tee to keep the dreaded pot bunkers out of play. He got a bit wild on the back nine, starting out birdie-bogey-birdie-bogey-birdie before he settled down with a couple of pars and a 15-foot birdie at the final hole to leave him with a good feeling going to a weekend that will be like none hes ever experienced before. Oosthuizen strung together three birdies in a row beginning at the par-5 fifth, where a driver and a 4-iron left him with a chip that he left 5 feet from the flag.         
	Maybe if hes walking up the 18 th fairway with the claret jug in his grasp come Sunday, someone will break out the vuvuzelas, those South African horns that made the World Cup sound as though it was under attack from swarming bees.         
	Until then, he said, leave em at home. On the golf course? No, not on the golf course, Oosthuizen said.

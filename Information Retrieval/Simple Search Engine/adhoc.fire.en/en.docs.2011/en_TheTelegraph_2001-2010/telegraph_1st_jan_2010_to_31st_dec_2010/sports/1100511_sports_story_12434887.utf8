The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India need to lift game big time 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Team India need to lift game big time 
  - A thin win wont do for dhoni amp; Co., plus WI must lose       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Bridgetown: With captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni looking for a consolation win in St Lucia, on Tuesday, its pretty evident that Indias mindset is anything but that of a cornered tiger.         
	The contrast with Sri Lanka couldnt be more revealing.         
	Weve got to beat India... Thats going to be our approach... Well be going for it... We have everything to play for, pointed out Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain.         
	According to calculations, India must win by at least 20 runs or with a cushion of 13-15 deliveries. That alone wont guarantee a place in the World Twenty20 semi-final, though.         
	Indeed, Dhoni and Co. will have to pray that a resurgent West Indies lose to Australia in the tournaments last Super Eights fixture.         
	The ask wouldve been tougher had Sri Lanka not been thrashed, by 81 runs, by the awesome-looking Australia.         
	For Sri Lanka, even a wafer-thin margin is expected to suffice.         
	We didnt build partnerships... There cant be any justification at being bowled out for 87... We arent concerned with the India result (losing to the West Indies), were concerned about how we played, Sangakkara said, looking back.         
	Both teams shouldnt have to worry about the bounce-factor in St Lucia, as the wickets there are rather benign. Will come as a relief, of sorts, after the lively Kensington Oval here.         
	Dhoni did a bit of plain talking when he was asked about the inability of his batsmen to counter the bounce. The preparations were fine, the execution wasnt... You can keep practising, but youve still got to get it right in the middle...         
	Virender Sehwag doesnt have a great T20 record, but he has definitely been missed  thanks, once again, to an injury sustained in the IPL.         
	Given that the best available were selected, India ought to have done much better. Of course, poor decisions, like persisting with Ravindra Jadeja, havent helped.         
	Indias strength is its batting... Runs on the board wouldve been a better option, instead of opting to chase in both (Super Eights) matches... Ive been quite surprised with Indias approach, former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja told The Telegraph.         
	Hes not the only one surprised.         
	Match starts: 10.30 pm (IST).

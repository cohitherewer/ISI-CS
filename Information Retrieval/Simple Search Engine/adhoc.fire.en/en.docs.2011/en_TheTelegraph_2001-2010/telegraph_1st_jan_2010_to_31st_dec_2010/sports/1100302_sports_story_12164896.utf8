            A STAFF REPORTER            Ajit Agarkar at the Eden on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) chief coach Dav Whatmore has clarified that Wriddhiman Sahas standby will be in the squad for merely three weeks.         
	Currently theres a three-way fight between former Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta, Karnataka veteran Thilak Naidu and Saurashtra glovesman Sagar Jogiyani for the slot. Whatmore said on Monday that Wriddhimans standby would be announced in the next couple of days.         
	We all know that Wriddhiman is our first-choice wicket-keeper and it stays that way. In case anything happens to Wriddhi, we would like to have someone ready for the job.         
	So we need a competent second wicket-keeper batsman. But that particular glovesman will only remain with the squad till Brendon McCullum joins after finishing his international commitments.         
	We are very clear about that, Whatmore told mediamen after the KKRs training session at Eden Gardens. On who will be choosing the second keeper, the Australian said: Assistant coach Vijay Dahiya will assess the ones who are on trial.         
	Also we will consider Souravs opinion before taking a final call. Deep till now is the favourite as he has a fair amount of T20 experience having played 31 T20 matches for ICL team Royal Bengal Tigers.         
	On current batting form, though, Jogiyani stands a good chance.         
	Naidus case is the weakest as he hasnt been in good form after being dropped from the state squad. Although he had played well in the inaugural Karnataka Premier League (KPL) for Bangalore Providents, his keeping skills are questionable.

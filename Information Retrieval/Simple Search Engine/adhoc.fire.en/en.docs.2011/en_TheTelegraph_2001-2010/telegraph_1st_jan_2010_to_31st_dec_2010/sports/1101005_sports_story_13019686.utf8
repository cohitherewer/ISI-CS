The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy to be back in form: Yuvraj
                                                                                                                       7                                      Happy to be back in form: Yuvraj
                      
	Jaipur: Out of favour for the Indian Test team, Yuvraj Singh on Monday refused to read much into the timing of his unbeaten double hundred against Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, and said he was happy to be back in form, after an injury lay off.         
	I dont care about the timing. I wanted to be back in form after a long lay off due to injury. I am happy that I did it, said Yuvraj, captain of Rest of India against Mumbai.         
	I was just trying to play straight in initial phase and was resolute to post a big score. I was trying to play on merit of the ball. The pitch was nice and the ball was coming nicely at the bat, he added.         
	Yuvraj said he did not think that the declaration came rather late.         
	The pitch is flat and I feel it was very difficult to get the opponents out twice on such a surface. Our bowlers were too tired, so I thought of giving them a bit of rest and that is why we decided to bat again, instead of forcing a follow on, he said.         
	Mumbai player Abhishek Nair, on the other hand, tried to downplay the poor performance of his side.         
	I am not giving any excuses. The Rest of India played better than us. We could have showed more resolve and patience. It was also a bad toss to lose, and thereafter a couple of missed chances took the game away from us, he said.         
	Our batting was also not good, and instead of batting straight, we played too many cross batted shots. We know we are in dire straits, but we would try and redeem ourselves. We have learnt our lessons and one bad outing would not have much effect. We are a good side and have been doing well, he added.         
	Yuvraj, who had a lean beginning this year, had to battle with several injuries. A wonky wrist had troubled him for a long period and it stifled his scoring in all formats of the game. The hard-hitting batsman failed to create much impact during IPL-III and it was common knowledge that Yuvraj was still grappling with fitness than anything else.         
	It has been over a year since Yuvraj has scored a century in any form for India. Following a disappointing World T20, the southpaw was dropped from the Asia Cup squad. Though he was picked for the Test series in Sri Lanka followed by a tri-series, he was down with a neck sprain.         
	A poor form saw him sidelined for the Australia series and the double ton on Tuesday must give the beleaguered all-rounder some relief.

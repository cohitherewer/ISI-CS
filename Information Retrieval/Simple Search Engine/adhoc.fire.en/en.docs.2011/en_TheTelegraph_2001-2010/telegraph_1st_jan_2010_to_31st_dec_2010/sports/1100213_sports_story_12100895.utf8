The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No change in our plan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      No change in our plan 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                AB de Villiers      
	Calcutta: Talented South African batsman AB de Villiers is confident that if South Africa stick to their game plan, they can do a repeat show of the Nagpur Test. He also hoped at a press conference that skipper Graeme Smith would be available for the Eden Test.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Comparison between the current side and the 2008 squad         
	I wouldnt like to make any comparison with the team that toured India a couple of years back. The basic idea is to keep the momentum going. We are high on confidence and would like to carry on in the same manner.         
	On the pitch         
	Well at the moment it looks a lot more grassy. But I am sure that it will be shaved off in the next 48 hours. We are not unduly bothered about the pitch. We are happy focussing on our game. The main idea is to get the basics right.         
	The VVS Laxman factor         
	Obviously, it will be an advantage for the Indian team that a class player like Laxman will be back from injury. But we are not really bothered as we have done our homework and have a plan ready for Laxman.         
	Absence of Rahul Dravid         
	Rahul is an important player and the Indian team missed him in Nagpur. I am sure they will miss someone like him in Calcutta as well.         
	On his Daredevils skipper Gautam Gambhirs rare failure         
	Well, I passed on all the knowledge I had about Gautams weaknesses. (Laughs) He is a class player but I would expect that he shouldnt fire in this match as well.         
	The importance of being No. 1 in ICC rankings         
	We are not so worried about the rankings. The goal is to win the series 2-0 and continue to dominate as a team. Its the consistency that matters the most and not the rankings. As it is rankings change now and then.         
	Any changes in the game plan         
	We have done well with a set game plan in the Nagpur Test. I dont think there will be much change in the basic game plan.

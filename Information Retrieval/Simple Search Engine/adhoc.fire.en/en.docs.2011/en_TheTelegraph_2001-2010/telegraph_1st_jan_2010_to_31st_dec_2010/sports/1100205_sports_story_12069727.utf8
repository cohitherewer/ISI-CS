The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West look down the barrel
                                                                                                                       7                                        West look down the barrel
                  Dinesh Karthik scored his second century of the match                     
	Hyderabad: Rampaging Dinesh Karthik lit up the third days proceedings with his second century of the match to put South Zone in firm control of the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone here on Thursday.         
	Karthik, who had slammed 183 in the first innings, struck 150 on Thursday as South Zone declared their second essay at 386 for nine to set West a mammoth 536-run winning target.         
	Chirag Pathak (41) and Harshad Khadiwale (8) guided West to 50 for no loss at stumps but South Zone have two full days to bowl out their opponents for an outright win.         
	Resuming at their overnight 42 for no loss, South Zone suffered a mini-collapse and were at a precarious 71 for four before Karthik came to their rescue.         
	The wicket-keeper batsmans 150 runs and a massive 247-run partnership with Muralidharan Gautam (88) virtually snatched the match away from West.         
	Karthiks blazing knock came off just 162 balls and was studded with 22 hits to the fence.         
	Gautams 88 runs too came in reasonably quick time and he faced 118 balls, hitting eight fours and a six in the process.         
	West Zone bowlers, including India discard Irfan Pathan, were largely ineffective when Karthik and Gautam were at the crease.         
	Pathan eventually broke the stand when he dismissed Karthik off a wide delivery, which the right-hander cut straight to substitute fielder K Makvana.         
	Gautam departed in the very next over when an attempted six over mid-off was acrobatically caught by Bhavik Thaker off Ravindra Jadejas bowling.(PTI)

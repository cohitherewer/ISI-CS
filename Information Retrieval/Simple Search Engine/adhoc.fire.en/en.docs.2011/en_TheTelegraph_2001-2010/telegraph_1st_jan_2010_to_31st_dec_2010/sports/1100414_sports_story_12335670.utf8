The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | T20 just a matter of adapting well: Vijay
                                                                                                                       7                                        T20 just a matter of adapting well: Vijay
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                              
	Chennai: Till a month back, Murali Vijay was thought to be a misfit in Twenty20 cricket. An opener in the classical mode whos best suited for Test cricket was the common refrain.         
	The current edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), however, has opened a new phase in the 26-year-olds career. Having proved his ability to adapt to the different formats, Vijay has beaten the likes of Matthew Hayden and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to emerge as the top run-getter in the Chennai Super Kings ranks (before their match against the Knight Riders on Tuesday) with 337 runs from ten matches at a strike rate of 167.66.         
	My batting hasnt changed much. Im playing my natural game Its a different format and am batting according to the teams requirements, Vijay told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Its a myth that players suited for Test cricket cant play T20. There is more of intensity and its just a matter of adjustment, he explained.         
	Unlike others, his batting has been underlined largely by cricketing shots. There has been no hint of slog. This was best exemplified during his 78 off 39 balls against the Royal Challengers Bangalore and was followed by a 46-ball century against the Rajasthan Royals.         
	It was the fourth fastest hundred in T20 cricket before he was finally dismissed for 127 off 56 balls. Hes only the third Indian, after Manish Pandey and Yusuf Pathan, to get a century in the games shortest version. Im trying to keep it simple Its all about confidence and Im trying to go out there and enjoy. I give it my best shot, and if its your day, you have a great time, Vijay said.         
	The Tamil Nadu batsman is relishing the experience of opening with Matthew Hayden. Hes a wonderful human being. I always enjoy his company. You ask him anything on the game and hes always ready with an answer, always eager to help you out. In a way, hes an inspiration at the other end         
	Its a matter of how much you can take from him. Ive been around with the Chennai Super Kings for two years now and all the players are of immense help.         
	Is he worried that a settled opening pair in Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir will hamper his India chances? Im not looking it that way. I know that Ive got to keep enjoying my game. My chance will come. As an opener, I would always want to open but Im ready to bat wherever the team fits me It all depends on the situation, Vijay, who has played five Tests besides a one-dayer, said.         
	Vijay idolises Sachin Tendulkar and Mark Waugh, and says he fears no bowler. I go out there and enjoy my cricket That is what I like doing best. That philosophy in life has kept him going and he doesnt wish to look back. He isnt even ready to think that all this has come a bit too late as he missed out on a World Twenty20 berth. Im not thinking about World T20 Im out to play and enjoy.         
	Vijay puts the 78 against the Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of his century against Shane Warnes men. That innings gave me the confidence. Ill always put it ahead of the hundred.         
	Is T20 all about power hitting or theres room for the orthodox too? It depends on both, he said. Not all hits need to be cricketing shots all the time Most importantly, the temperament comes into play at some stage. Its a combination of all these attributes. It is this combination that has worked wonders for Vijay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Battered EB pin hopes on Yakubu
                                                                                                                       7                                        Battered EB pin hopes on Yakubu
  - i-league Winless in last six ties, Chirag United look to get their act right       A STAFF REPORTER            Yusif Yakubu at the club ground, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: For East Bengal, the adage too many cooks spoil the broth fits to the tee this season. Two coaches and more than half a dozen foreign recruits have left a sour taste for the red and gold brigade fans.         
	Lingering at the 10th spot in the I-League table, East Bengal will, once again, hope for a victory when they take on Chirag United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. But the problem is how to transform their hope into a result?         
	Their performance has gone from bad to worse and if they fail to pull up their socks against Chirag on Tuesday, it might just turn out to be worst.         
	To complicate matters, ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia is a doubtful starter for the crucial game. Coach Phillippe de Ridder did not sound too confident on the eve of the encounter as he said: He is yet to regain his full fitness. If someone is not hundred per cent fit, I dont think I should take a chance with him.         
	The India captain stayed away from the practice on Monday and that might just be the indication about his status.         
	And that is not all. Ghanaian Abel Hammond will have to sit out because of a double booking. That strikes out yet another goal scoring option for the beleaguered giants.         
	And if you think that it is already too much, think again. Striker Subhas Singh is also nursing an injury and will, in all probability, be missing the match.         
	Under such circumstances, the obvious question that haunts someone is who then will score the goals for east Bengal? De Ridder has an answer. Why just the strikers? The others should be equally responsible and should come up with goals. The second line should come up and perform, thought the Belgian.         
	Hence, old warhorse Yusif Yakubu will have to extract all his experience to bail out his club.         
	Chirag, on the other hand, have failed to live up to the promise they showed during the early stages of the I-League. Saddled by their own bag of problems (with their disassociation with coach Subrata Bhattacharya in the middle of the league), the boys in purple will look to get their act right.         
	Without a win in their last six league ties, Chirags sixth position on the points table is mainly due to their impressive run in the first half of the league. They will miss the services of Shylo Malswamtluanga and are uncertain about the availability of Brazilian Eduardo Chacon and Jayanta Sen.

                                                                                                                       7                                      South Africa smell victory
                      
	Johannesburg: South Africa took a major step toward a series-leveling victory Saturday by reducing England to 48 for three wickets after having declaring 243 runs ahead on the third day of the fourth Test.         
	Kevin Pietersen on 9 and Paul Collingwood on 0 will resume Sunday with their side 195 runs in arrears with two days to play. The Proteas have dominated this match from the first ball Thursday and its fine batting performance Saturday was underlined by a great start by its fast bowlers when England batted.         
	Alastair Cook was the first England batsman to go, caught at first slip by Graeme Smith off Morne Morkel in the fourth over of the innings for 1.         
	Earlier, South Africa had declared their first innings on 423-7. England, which leads 1-0 in the four-match series, was bowled out for 180 in its first innings.         
	Bad light and an imminent thunderstorm halted play for about an hour 12 overs into the second session Saturday, but South Africa was not deterred from building an imposing lead. After the interruption, during which tea was taken, the team added 41 more runs in 10 overs up to the declaration.

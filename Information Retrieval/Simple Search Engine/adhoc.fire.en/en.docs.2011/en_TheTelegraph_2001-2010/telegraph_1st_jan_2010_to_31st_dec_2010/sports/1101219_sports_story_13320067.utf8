                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav: Lack of practice game   hurt India
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes that losing the toss was a setback for Mahendra Singh Dhonis men, in the ongoing first Test, against South Africa, at Centurion.         
	Talking to mediapersons at the Karnail Singh Stadium, the venue of Bengals Ranji Trophy match against the Railways, Sourav also said that the Indians will have to regroup and make a comeback as soon as the possible.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On Indias poor start in South Africa         
	It is too early to come to any conclusion. Moreover, if you take the conditions under consideration, the toss was important, which India lost. Also the fact that India entered straightaway into a Test match without playing a practice game made things even more difficult A four-day game before the first Test would have made things better for India.         
	Whether the Centurion pitch was too difficult for the Indians         
	It was not easy to bat on that pitch It was a bit damp after the rain and the conditions were difficult for batting. They (India) already have their backs to the wall in this Test match So the quicker they can apply themselves and make a comeback, its better for the team.         
	Zaheers injury         
	Zaheer is a human being Every player gets injured, but you should look at it from a different perspective. If someone gets injured, it means that its an opportunity for another player to grab that chance and make a mark.         
	On his IPL plans         
	I would like to play for the Kolkata Knight Riders But its not my choice because it will be decided in the auction...         
	Bengals failure to make the Ranji Trophy quarter finals         
	Well, we could have definitely done better. But we have a team which has lot of young and inexperienced players. They will mature and I am sure the team would do well in future.         
	On his own performance in the Ranji match (vs Railways)         
	It was the first match this season in which I batted... So I was a bit rusty. Once I start playing more, I should be able to do better.

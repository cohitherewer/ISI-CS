            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Pretoria: A day before Diego Armando Maradona makes his debut as a coach in the World Cup, he seems to have taken a vow to stay polite and calm. On Friday, when the Argentine manager met the newspersons in the dingy and crowded media room at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, never for a moment he lost his temper even though he remained the target of some highly uncomfortable questions.         
	With less than 24 hours to go before Argentina start their World Cup campaign against Nigeria, the coach wore a permanent frown, yet came up with some intelligent replies whenever someone tried to probe him deeper than he would have liked to.         
	The only thing that he said repeatedly during his 35-minute interaction with the media was why Argentina should be considered favourites to win the World Cup. All my 23 players are ready and they would surely win the Cup, Maradona said. They are in top shape.         
	I like the players to be like fighters and all my boys fulfil the criteria. I get immense pleasure when I look at them. The national jersey is nothing but passion. I know my boys have that in mind. May be, they are a bit nervous, but so was I when I was a player. Now, I am much more relaxed because I know the players will do it for me, he said with a laugh.         
	The only time Maradona looked agitated when he expressed fears that Nigeria could use rough tactics in Saturdays match. Fifa should enforce Fair Play more seriously, he said. We dont expect a rough and tough match. We expect Fair Play.         
	In 1990, I got kicked in the head in the match against Cameroon. The guy who did it went unpunished. We want people to watch football peacefully and Fifa should look at it, advised the coach.         
	Maradona sounded philosophical when someone asked him about the difficult times he had gone through in his life. Looking back at my life, I see what I am. At times I had lots of souvenirs, sometimes it was ugly. Perhaps I have done something for Argentine football, so I am here. Of course others also have contributed.         
	And when legendary Liverpool goalkeeper of the 80s Bruce Grobbelaar stood up from the last row to suggest that Lionel Messi may not be able to match the deeds of his coach, Maradona laughed and said: He has all the signs of a great player. I wish from the bottom of my heart that this World Cup be Messis show.         
	Let us hope Messi be the cherry on the cake this time, said Maradona after a short pause.         
	Apart from Messi, the coach said, he had immense faith on his captain Javier Mascherano and Angel di Maria. Di Maria is a spectacular player, who is growing day by day. He faces defenders continually and thats what people pay for today in the world.         
	He is no longer a player who sticks to the left side of the pitch all the time. He can beat defenders seven times in a match. He is being paid millions by the clubs. He deserves every penny of it, said Maradona.         
	He also hoped the World Cup in South Africa would be a great show. They have worked from dawn to dusk to make it a success. The African teams are also doing well.         
	People saying Spain are favourites here. They certainly are a spectacular team. But then, the pitch is going to give the final verdict. It all depends on who can score, who can provide the best pass and so on I am sure this is going to be a great World Cup.

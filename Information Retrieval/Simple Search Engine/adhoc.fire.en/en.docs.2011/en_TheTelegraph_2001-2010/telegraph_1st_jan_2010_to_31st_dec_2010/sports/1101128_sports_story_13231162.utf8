The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal clinch 3 points
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal clinch 3 points
                  Tiwary hit 92                     
	Ahmedabad: Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary led from the front with a brilliant 92 as the visitors ensured three points against Gujarat to get their floundering Ranji Trophy campaign back on track. Bengal now have eight points from four outings as they take on Tamil Nadu in their next outing.         
	Needing 274 to get three points after rain played spoilsport for the first one-and-half days, Tiwary (92) and Anustup Majumdar (74) added 112 runs for the fourth wicket as Bengal scored 340 for seven when play was stopped. Debutant Arnab Nandi remained unbeaten on 51.         
	Resuming on 99 for two, Bengal lost Dibyendu Chakraborty (23), who was bowled by Priyank Panchal. Tiwary and Majumdar then combined well as they went to tea with a score of 211 for three.         
	The Bengal captain, recovering from a bout of viral, played a chanceless knock during his four hour stay at the wicket. Just when he was looking good for a century, he was bowled by medium pacer Ishwar Choudhary. After Tiwarys dismissal, Sayan Sekhar Mondal (0) and former captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla (13) left in quick succession as Bengal slumped to 258 for six.         
	But Majumdar ensured that Bengal safely reached the magic figure of 274. Its good that we have shown enough discipline after we managed only a point against Assam. Manoj said. (PTI)

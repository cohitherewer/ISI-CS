	Bangalore: The Mumbai Indians, already in the semi-finals, sent a strong message to their rivals by crushing second-placed Royal Challengers Bangalore by 57 runs.         
	Kumble amp; Co.s net run-rate also took a beating and they are now left anxiously tracking the rest of the results to determine whether they progress to the semis. The Mumbai outfit also brushed aside any criticism over them being overly reliant on Orange Cap holder and captain Sachin Tendulkar, whose rare failure did not prevent the table-toppers from amassing 191 on a greenish track.         
	Ambati Rayudu has been the best of the ICL returnees this season, and he added to his growing reputation with another power-hitting cameo that jumpstarted the Mumbai Indians after an unsteady start.                     
	Kieron Pollard briefly showed why he was so sought after during the auction, after which JP Duminys clinical finishing silenced the home crowd, as it had when he lashed an unbeaten 99 in the Champions League.         
	Needing to score at nearly 10 an over from the outset, the Royal Challengers were rarely in the chase, plodding to 12 after three overs and losing both openers for 34 in the Powerplay. There was still hope for their deep batting line-up, but once Harbhajan Singh removed both Kevin Pietersen and Rahul Dravid, the required rate spiralled above 13.         
	That proved too much even for the home sides biggest hitters, Robin Uthappa and Ross Taylor, both of whom were foxed by slower ones, and the Bangalore outfits focus shifted to reducing the margin of defeat and keeping their net run-rate from sinking too low.         
	Their best phase of the match was the Powerplay after electing to bowl.           (AGENCIES)

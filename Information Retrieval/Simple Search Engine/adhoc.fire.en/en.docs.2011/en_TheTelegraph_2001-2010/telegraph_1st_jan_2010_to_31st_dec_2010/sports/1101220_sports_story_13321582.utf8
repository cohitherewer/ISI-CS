The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am still the best option: Brasa
                                                                                                                       7                                      I am still the best option: Brasa
                      
	New Delhi: Jose Brasa has left India after a bitter fallout with authorities but he has still not given up hope of being called back to coach the countrys hockey team as the Spaniard feels he is the best available option for the job.         
	I think the solution for Indian hockey is not there in India. It will come from outside the country. Indian hockey certainly needs a foreign coach, Brasa said from Madrid.         
	Nobody from Hockey India or SAI has called me after my departure. I am still waiting for their call. If they say no, then I will decide about future. I can not live without hockey and coaching and can coach any international team. But my first choice is India again, said Brasa who is taking part in a coaching workshop in the Spanish capital.         
	I think there is no reason not to renew my contract. The Indian team have performed well in the last 18 months. Dont judge them on results only. Players performance graph has also gone up and up, he added.         
	Mulling whether to pick a foreign or a local coach for the team, Hockey India recently got a statement from the Dhanraj Pillay saying that he is the best person for this job.         
	But Brasa feels that he can prepare the team for Olympic qualifiers better than anyone else. I think I can help them more than anyone else since I know all the players and their capabilities better. I know how to bring the best out of them. Any other foreign coach will run away from the problems but I did manage to get results in those circumstances and will do that in future also, said the Spanish coach whose contract expired on November 30.         
	During his tenure, the Indian team clinched silver in the Delhi Commonwealth Games, a bronze medal in the Asian Games as well as the Azlan Shah title.         
	Apart from the final verdict on his contract, Brasa is also waiting for the Sports Authority of India (SAI) to clear his dues.         
	At his last meeting with SAI director general Sayan Chatterjee, he was told to wait for another couple of weeks.         
	I was told that sports minister (MS Gill) will take a call on the renewal of contract of all foreign coaches. It will take two-three weeks. I did not get my expenses for the month of November and the prize money for winning the medal, he said.         
	I have sent mails to SAI, HI and the sports ministry but did not get any reply. I cant do anything other then waiting, said Brasa.         
	He also urged the authorities to take the right decision in the interest of Indian hockey. I am repeating that this team is capable of podium finish in the Olympics but it needs proper training and facilities. Indian authorities should take the right decision keeping the larger interest of the team in mind, he said.

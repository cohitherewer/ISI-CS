                                                                                                                       7                                      I-League is deferred once again
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Lack of sponsors has forced the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to defer the start of the I-League for the second time in two months.         
	According to sources, the cash rich 14-team league, which was supposed to start from November 26, will now begin only in the first week of December. A final decision will be taken in the I-League committee meeting in the second week of this month.         
	Initially, the I-League was to begin from November 20, but it was deferred in view of the Asian Games.         
	The AIFF is yet to rope in a sponsor for the I-League which is going to cost more than Rs 10 crore, said an official. The sponsor for the last few years  ONGC  has already backed out.         
	The marketing and broadcasting agents of the AIFF, too, are not paying regularly. It has been decided to defer the league by a few more days so that we get time to find a new sponsor. The AIFF, however, have written to the marketing agents to regularise the payments, the official added.         
	Sources, however, indicated that there could be brighter days ahead, as two top industrial houses would soon be involved in running the fourth edition of the league.         
	While one of them would work for the improvement of infrastructure, the other one may come in as the sponsor. The top officials of both the companies would be given important positions in the I-League committee.         
	Two airline companies have also been approached to sponsor the air tickets during the league.         
	Despite uncertainty over the dates, the AIFF has released the rules and regulations of the league that do not carry any special provision for the federations own team, the AIFF XI.         
	While it was initially planned to keep the junior side out of the relegation zone, the rules have made it clear that no exception would be made for the Des Bulpin coached Delhi-based side.         
	As per the regulation, two teams standing last in the table will be demoted to the second division.         
	However, the final decision on demotion of teams would be taken once the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) decides the implementation of the club licensing criteria.

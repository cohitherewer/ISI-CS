            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Action during Mohun Bagans match against Lajong, on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	Cuttack: A 10-man Mohun Bagan edged past last years runners-up Lajong FC 1-0 to begin their Federation Cup campaign in a winning note. Subair Murithala Ali scored the all-important goal in the 19th minute.         
	At the Barabati Stadium, on Wednesday, Nigerian striker Murithala headed home the all-important goal off a Snehasish Chakraborty corner.         
	 After taking the lead, the Calcutta giants defended well despite being reduced to 10 men, following a red card to stopper Kingshuk Debnath in the 38th minute.         
	Referee A Rowan showed him the yellow card twice within two minutes, first for a delay in taking a free kick and then committing a foul.         
	In the absence of Debnath, captain Ishfaq Ahmed played as the right back and adapted nicely to his new role.         
	Bagan custodian Shilton Paul had a great match, effecting at least five good saves for his side.         
	The green and maroon brigade would have won the match by a bigger margin but for Muritala and Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto who wasted a couple of chances each.         
	Despite the narrow defeat, Lajong FC gave a good account of themselves, especially in the second half, during which they came close to scoring the equaliser four times.         
	The Shillong sides Nigerian recruit Kelechi Okoye alone squandered two chances, first by shooting over in the 35th minute and then heading the ball into the safe hands of Bagan custodian Paul.         
	James Giblee and Gumpe Rime wasted the other two scoring opportunities for Lajong FC by shooting over the post.         
	Despite the wet and slushy underfoot condition, both the sides played well to make the match a hard-fought affair.         
	Mohun Bagan next meet Mumbai FC, while Lajong FC take on Salgaocar FC on Friday.         
	In another match, Salgaocar registered a convincing 2-0 win over Mumbai Football Club.         
	The Goan outfit surged ahead when Yusif Yakubu scored off a corner kick in the 36th minute.         
	Leading 1-0 at the lemon break, Salgaocar SC clinched the victory with substitute Anthony Barbosa shooting home the second goal also from a flag kick in the 89th minute.         
	The match, however, was marred by rough play, which resulted in one red card to Mumbai FC goalkeeper Nidhin Lal and serious injury to Lals teammate Faizal Rehman.         
	Referee Magho Singh gave Lal the marching order for a dangerous tackle against Barbosa shortly after he scored the second goal.         
	Rehman became unconscious after an opponents kick hit him on the face in the 70th minute. He was later taken to SCB Medical College for treatment.         
	Salgaocar SC completely dominated the match by displaying attacking football. They scored twice and missed four more opportunities.

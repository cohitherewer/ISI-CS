                                                                                                                       7                                      Ministry seeks fine cut
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A day after the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) agreed to follow the government guidelines, the ministry of sports swung into action to ensure participation of Indian lifters in the Commonwealth Games.         
	Indian weightlifters, if cleared by the international body, are expected to win at least 15 medals including five gold medals in the Commonwealth Games.         
	However, IWF, which was fined $500,000 after six Indian lifters failed dope tests, will have to pay $375,000 by August 31. On Friday, the ministry of sports wrote to International Olympic Committee (IOC), Commonwealth Games Federation and IOA requesting them to talk to the international lifting body to consider a substantial cut in the fine.         
	The ministry letter said: We request you to kindly take up the matter urgently with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) for substantial reduction of the penalty amount and re-scheduling the payment.         
	IOA may also consider appropriate measures to help the federation tide over the present crisis.         
	We sincerely believe that IOA will ensure that innocent athletes do not suffer due to inaction in this regard, the letter further added.

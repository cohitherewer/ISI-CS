            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Tolgay Ozebe tries to get past a Kalighat Club defender, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal inched closer to clinching the Calcutta Football League Premier Division title with a 3-0 demolition of Kalighat Club, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Thursday.         
	Tolgay Ozebe scored a brace in the first half while Alvito DCunha rounded it off with a superb left-footed volley from 25 yards five minutes before the close.         
	Kalighat began with a bang  Ranjit Oraons freekick kissed the crosspiece before going out in the fifth minute  but faded into a whimper as East Bengal gained possession and momentum. In fact, Kalighat failed to keep pace with East Bengal forwards superior ball control, distribution and speed.         
	East Bengal always enjoyed a numerical superiority in the striking zone and that made it more difficult for Kalighat. A litany of miss passes, poor anticipation and defending added to their woes.         
	East Bengal went ahead in the 25th minute when Tolgay pounced on a Robin Singh through and placed it over the advancing goalkeeper. The duo celebrated by indulging in shadow boxing on the sidelines!         
	Six minutes later came the second goal when the Australian headed in a corner. Referee Tushar Kanti Guha, however, ignored appeals of Tolgay being offside from the Kalighat players.         
	East Bengal looked slightly disoriented at the start of the second session, and took some time to get back to their attacking ways. Substitute Alvito took the leading role in the midfield along with the hard working Mehtab Hossain.         
	Alvitos volley hit the bar after beating the goalkeeper in the 75th minute and Shambhu Mistry saved Soumik Deys header on the goalline.         
	TEAMS

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The South India challenger, Arabian Prince, demonstrated his superior class and walked away with the 1,600m Nanoli Stud Calcutta Gold Cup, on Saturday. Jockey Paul Mulrennan, partnering the Jaggy Dhariwal-trained four-year-old, sent the Burden Of Proof son into the lead within a furlong of the start and Arabian Prince never looked back, though shifting out in the stretch run, to have the measure of the course-favourite, Granados. Trainer Shafiq Khans Alienation (D. Ashish-up), also a less-fancied runner, won the 1,100m Calcutta Juvenile Stakes from Amor Amor.

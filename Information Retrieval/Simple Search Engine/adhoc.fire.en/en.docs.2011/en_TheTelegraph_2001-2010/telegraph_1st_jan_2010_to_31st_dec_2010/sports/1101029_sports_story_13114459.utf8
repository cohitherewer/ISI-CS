	New Delhi: Former champions Salgaocar Sports Club came good in the second half to beat Air India 3-1, in a group D encounter of the Durand Cup quarter final league, at Ambedkar Stadium, on Thursday.         
	Considering the fact that East Bengal are the other side in the three-team group, it was a good victory for Salgaocar. They organised themselves well to pick up all their goals in the second half. With foreign recruit Ryuji Sueoka and Tomba Singh controlling the midfield, Salgaocar took the lead in the 52nd minute through Anthony Barbosa, who collided with Air India keeper Kunal Sawant while scoring the goal and had to be replaced.         
	Nine minutes later, the Goa-side struck again. Ryuji found the target after receiving a pass from Rocus Lamare. Veteran Ghanaian striker Yusif Yakubu made it 3-0 in the 89th minute before Vijit Shetty got one for the Mumbai side two minutes into the added time.         
	Sporting Clube de Goa suffered a shock 1-2 defeat against local team Garhwal Heroes. While Ashish Pandey and Gangamlung Kamei got the goals for Garhwal, Mackroy Peixto was the marksman for Sporting in their Group B match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An eventful day for Sutil
                                                                                                                       7                                        An eventful day for Sutil

	Istanbul: Force India driver Adrian Sutil had a hectic outing on Friday, posting the 10th fastest time in morning practice after going off the track to hit a barrier and returning to clock the 11th best time ahead of Sundays Turkish GP.         
	McLarens world champions dominated the free practice with Lewis Hamilton quickest in the morning and Jenson Button lapping faster after lunch.         
	Sutils teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi was 12th on the time sheet in the morning session and 16th in the afternoon. Hispania driver Karun Chandhoks was 21st in the morning and brought up the rear with his 24th place finish in the afternoon. Force India used the two 90-minute sessions to evaluate the new developments introduced this weekend, including the F-duct system which is called the switchable rear wing (SRW).         
	The morning practice ran smoothly until the closing minutes when Sutil strayed onto the dirty, slippery part and into the barriers through turn eight.         
	I got some understeer through turn eight and went wide on the marbles and into the barriers. I was okay but the front right suspension was pretty damaged, Sutil said. The team did a fantastic job to get me out in the second session and we made a few runs to at least get some data on the option tyres. At this stage its good to get the information, well look at it and see how we can make some improvements for the race, he said.         
	Liuzzi, meanwhile, sounded upbeat about the SRW. It was quite a productive day. In the afternoon the balance of the car was not ideal, but in the morning it was good and we could get some useful data on the new SRW. I think its working pretty well, its a clever solution and not too difficult to use considering what you have to do.         
	Red Bulls championship leader Mark Webber was second in the afternoon, but stopped on track five minutes from the end with a smoking car. Sebastian Vettel, fifth in the morning, was third in the second session. (PTI)

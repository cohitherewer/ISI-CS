The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lippi drops Grosso
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lippi drops Grosso
                      
	Rome: Fabio Grosso, who converted the decisive penalty kick in Italys World Cup victory four years ago, was cut from the Azzurris squad for South Africa on Tuesday.         
	Coach Marcello Lippi also dropped midfielder Antonio Candreva, Grossos teammate at Juventus, to take only 28 players to Italys pre-World Cup training camp. Grossos penalty in the shootout against France decided the 2006 World Cup final, but the left back has struggled at Juventus this season.         
	Lippi called Grosso on Monday to explain his choice. I told him how sorry I was to make this call but that I had come to the conclusion that it was fair, Lippi said. It hurt me to exclude Grosso, but I dont choose the team based on previous relationships.         
	Nine other members of the 2006 World Cup squad are still part of the team. One of them, Gianluca Zambrotta, will likely shift from right to left back, leaving the right back position to fill.         
	Italy will begin training in the Alpine resort of Sestriere on Sunday.         
	Located at an elevation of 6,500 feet, the camp should help prepare the Azzurri to play at high altitude in South Africa.         
	Lippi was originally planning to name his 23-man squad on Tuesday with four reserves, but he changed his plans. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shakib century in vain
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shakib century in vain
                      
	Hamilton: A captivating maiden Test century from Shakib-al Hasan was not enough to deny New Zealand victory on the fifth day at Seddon Park here Friday, as Bangladesh lost by 121 runs.         
	Shakib played beautifully for his century, taking the attack to the New Zealand bowlers who were firmly on top as the final day of the Test match began.         
	Shakib battled valiantly, finding momentary support from his overnight partner, Mushfiqur Rahim, and the in-form Mahmudullah, but was ultimately left with the tail as he attempted to pull off an unlikely victory, according to Cricinfo.         
	Earlier, Shakib and Mushfiqur started patiently, negotiating the good deliveries safely and promptly putting away the bad balls. When they slashed, they slashed hard at the wide ones to send them flying over the packed slip cordon.         
	About 10 overs into the morning, Shakib exploded. He creamed his second half-century of the match in just 58 deliveries.

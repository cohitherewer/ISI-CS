            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: He was visibly happy with his teams impressive mauling of India in the first Test here. At the post-match news conference on Tuesday, Proteas captain Graeme Smith said that the victory mattered all the more because it came after a tumultuous few weeks in South African cricket.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His feelings after the victory         
	I had said before also that we have everything to gain from this tour. We know how tough it is to win over here I can just say that its a terrific feeling.         
	Did he expect such a brilliant performance from his bowlers         
	Its a little cool in the morning here So I thought that may be we had a chance. Dale (Steyn) is a quality swing bowler. If anyone could swing the ball in these conditions, it was him. It was also important to use the bowlers in short spells.         
	On Paul Harris         
	He is written off wherever he goes Were used to that. No one really gives him a chance but he does his job.         
	Where would he place this win as a captain         
	Its difficult We had so many wins In England and in Australia. This was a two-match series and it was important to win the first match. We had a tough two weeks and the credit for this achievement goes to the players.         
	If the recent crisis makes the win special         
	Personally, I was a bit weighed down with the rubbish that was being written about the whole episode back home. I would like to credit Corrie van Zyl for bringing in professionalism.         
	If the change of ball in the first innings mattered         
	The wickets in India are generally abrasive. So the balls get out of shape after prolonged use. For us, the change of the ball came at a good time.         
	On the Eden Test         
	We need a few days rest. We need to start afresh and focus on our priorities. Well get to Calcutta, assess the situation and then plan accordingly.         
	The rankings issue         
	As a team we need to focus on winning in India. The rest can take care of themselves. No team deserves to be No. 1 You need to earn that. Well love to stay at the top for a long time.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Roger, Serena get top billing
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                  Serena and Federer                           
	Melbourne: World No.1s Roger Federer and Serena Williams top the lists of seeded players for the Australian Open which begins in Melbourne on January 18, with Andy Murray seeded fifth for the first Grand Slam of the year.         
	Organisers, meanwhile, resisted giving former world No.1 Justine Henin a seeding for her first Grand Slam event back from retirement.         
	The mens seeds follow the ATP rankings from Nos 1-32. Belgiums Yanina Wickmayer is the only highly-ranked player from the WTA rankings missing out on a seeding place in the top 32.         
	Wickmayer, who won the Auckland WTA tournament last week  her first event since the one-year ban for doping violations was overturned  is ranked 16th but is playing in the qualifying tournament.         
	An International Tennis Federation spokesman has said that because Wickmayer was ineligible to play the Australian Open when entries closed, she had to enter the qualifying tournament.         
	Serena Williams is the defending champion in Melbourne, beating No.2 Dinara Safina in straight sets in last years final.         
	Safina is seeded second this year, followed by French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, US Open finalist Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, Olympic champion Elena Dementieva and Venus Williams.         
	The 27 year-old Henin, who won seven singles Majors before quitting in May 2008 while holding the No.1 ranking, made her tour comeback last week at the Brisbane International, where she lost in the final to fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters.         
	Clijsters, who won the US Open in September in only her third tournament back from more than two years in retirement, was seeded 15th for the Australian Open.         
	Rafael Nadal, who beat Federer in last years final is seeded second, followed by 2008 Australian champion Novak Djokovic, US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro and British No.1 Murray.         
	Federer won the Australian Open in 2004, 2006 and 2007, losing to the eventual champion in 05, 08 and last year.         
	After losing to Nadal last year, Federer recovered to win the French Open and Wimbledon, increasing his career tally to 15 Grand Slam singles titles, beating Pete Samprass record of 14.         
	He completed a career Grand Slam of winning all four Majors by capturing the French Open for the first time. He lost the US Open final to Del Potro, ending a streak of five straight titles at New York.         
	Del Potro withdrew from the Kooyong tournament Thursday with a wrist injury. The Australian Open begins Monday.

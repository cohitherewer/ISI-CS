The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malhotra, Raman vie for coachs job
                                                                                                                       7                                      Malhotra, Raman vie for coachs job
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tamil Nadu coach W.V. Raman and former Bengal captain Ashok Malhotra have come up as strong contenders for the Bengal coachs job for the ensuing season.         
	Raman, under whom Bengal reached the semi-finals eight seasons back, is respected in the domestic circuit as one of the shrewdest tacticians. When contacted, Raman said that his contract with the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association has ended this year. If I get a good offer, I may give it a serious thought, he said.         
	It was learnt that the CAB has already held preliminary talks with Raman. Discipline is one aspect where we have the highest regard for Raman. This team needs a tough cookie. Thats why we would prefer Raman, Malhotra, or Paras Mhambrey, a senior official informed.         
	Whether the TNCA goes for a contract renewal with the former India opener is an aspect the CAB is keeping a close watch on.         
	On the other hand, Malhotra, who dropped in at the JU (Salt Lake) ground on Wednesday afternoon to watch the CAB pre-quarter-final between East Bengal and Kalighat, said in no uncertain terms that he would like to work with Bengal if given an opportunity.         
	I am very keen to coach Bengal provided the CAB comes up with an offer. I love this place and would be only too happy to contribute for the benefit of Bengal cricket, Malhotra told The Telegraph.         
	The former national selector will be in town for next 10-12 days. It will be interesting to note whether CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who will be finalising the candidate, sounds him out.         
	Malhotras no-nonsense approach and penchant for ensuring strict discipline makes him a strong contender for the coachs post. Dalmiya himself doesnt want to make any announcement until the CAB club tournaments are over. I am not in a position to divulge anything now. Any decision taken before the completion of tournaments leads a lot of misunderstanding, he said.         
	It was also learnt that a couple of former Bengal captains have contacted CAB bosses and expressed their desire to coach the team, but the associations first choice will definitely be someone who is a proven performer.         
	In case of Mhambrey, the main problem will be the duration he will be available to coach Bengal. The former India pacer is now contracted with Reliance, and it will be difficult for him to devote around six to seven months.

	Principal owner Shah Rukh Khan didnt hide his disappointment on Twitter, on Sunday, after yet another KKR flop show. He was also disturbed with the illness of his close business associate, who happens to be the brother of co-owner Juhi Chawla. Shah Rukh tweeted thus:         
	Bad day yesterday. Friend still not well...had to take hugs from kids amp; friends to avoid being sad. KKR did little to help either.

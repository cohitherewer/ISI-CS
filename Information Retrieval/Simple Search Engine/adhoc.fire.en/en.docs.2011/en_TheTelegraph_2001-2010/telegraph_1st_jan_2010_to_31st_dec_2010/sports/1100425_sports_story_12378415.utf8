The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its going to be tough: Afridi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Its going to be tough: Afridi
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans Twenty20 squad Saturday left for the West Indies to defend their World Cup title with captain Shahid Afridi insisting that his team has the ability to overcome recent upheavals and clinch the trophy.         
	The squad left without pace bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Sami who will take separate flights to St Lucia while the team flies via Dubai.         
	Asif is banned from entering Dubai while Sami has had visa issues. It is going to be a tough tournament and I have told the players to forget about the past events as this is the best opportunity for them to make amends and win back the confidence of the people, Afridi told reporters.         
	There is no doubt that after recent events and the Australian tour, people have lost confidence in the team and we need to change that perception, he added.         
	Pakistan would be competing in an international event for the first time since their tour to Australia where not only did they lose a Test and an ODI series but infighting in the team also led to several controversies and the subsequent removal of several players and officials.         
	Afridi said that the players were prepared for the big event despite the controversies.         
	But our litmus test would be to overcome the absence of senior players and be mentally strong enough to overcome the extra pressure of being the defending champions, he said.

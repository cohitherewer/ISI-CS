The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Westwood sets sights on victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Westwood sets sights on victory
                      
	Sun City: Westwood took a five-shot lead at the Nedbank Golf Challenge with a 1-under 71 in Saturdays third round as his closest challenger faded.         
	Westwood mixed two bogeys with three birdies to reach a 13-under 203 total, while fellow Englishman and playing partner Ross Fisher had to settle for a 73 on a hot day at Sun City, made tougher by a swirling wind around the Gary Player Country Club.         
	Fisher was tied for second with South Africas Tim Clark, who shot 68, one of only two sub-70 rounds on Saturday in the 12-player invitational event.         
	Fisher trailed Westwood by three shots overnight but had two bogeys and a double bogey in four holes from No. 14.         
	Three ahead (yesterday), now five ahead, Ill take that, Westwood said. It was tricky out there today. To come out five shots ahead is a big bonus. Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez was 7 under and alone in fourth.         
	Anders Hansen of Denmark, whose 68 matched Clark for the days best round, is tied for fifth at 6 under with Ernie Els and Padraig Harrington  who had a second successive 72 to fall further off the pace after having taken the lead with a first-round 66.         
	Westwood didnt come close to his second-round 64, but he shrugged off his two slips late on and is in sight of just a second tournament win of 2010.         
	Ive made three bogeys in 54 holes so thats pretty good going, he said. Its a nice position to be in but its by no means over. It can change pretty quickly.         
	Edoardo Molinaris challenge also faded with a 73 to fall from a tie for third to eighth on 5 under.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights bow to might of the master
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights bow to might of the master
  - Sourav amp; Co. crash to their third defeat in a row sachin hits unbeaten 71       K. KUMARASWAMY                            
	Mumbai: Kolkata Knight Riders batting woes continued as they slumped to a seven-wicket loss, their third defeat in a row, against the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium here on Monday.         
	The Knights, who failed to chase a competitive target the other evening against the Rajasthan Royals, continued to lack the right ammunition as they posted 155 for three.         
	Chris Gayle, whose inclusion was expected to provide the Knights with the much needed firepower, made a somewhat subdued 75 from 60 balls with seven fours and three sixes.         
	In contrast, the hosts got off to an explosive start and led by Sachin Tendulkars unbeaten 71, his second half-century of the tournament, and reached the target with nine balls to spare.         
	The third win from four matches sent the Mumbai Indians back to the top of the standings. The Knights made three changes with Brad Hodge making way for Gayle and Harpreet Singh and Mandeep Singh coming in place of Manoj Tiwary and Ashok Dinda.         
	But that seemed to have little effect on the teams batting which struggled to break the shackles for the most part of the innings.         
	Gayle, playing his first match of IPL 3, was probably still recovering from the fever that kept him out of the clash against the Royals. Whatever the cause, the result was that the first five overs  except for Sourav Ganguly creaming Ryan McLaren for three boundaries in a row  saw few pyrotechnics.         
	With only 67 on the board after 10 overs, someone had to step on the accelerator. Sourav made room to cut Harbhajan Singh and saw his timber rearranged. It was not until the 16th over by Zaheer, which cost 16 runs with Gayle slamming two fours and a six, that some sort of urgency crept into the Knights batting.         
	Gayle hit McLaren for two more boundaries and Owais Shahs improvised shot off Zaheer to beat the short fine leg fielder brought up the 150 in the last over.         
	For Mumbai, Shikhar Dhawan, replacing the out of form Sanath Jayasuriya, set the tone by smacking Shane Bond for three boundaries in the opening over.         
	And Tendulkar took charge from there on. The maestro was particularly severe on Ishant Sharma, plundering six fours from his first two overs. The second set of boundaries in particular exposed the predictability of the lanky pacer. The 50 came in just 4.2 overs and although Murali Kartik lured Dhawan into an uppish drive, the momentum was well set. The arrival of Saurabh Tiwary ensured there was no respite for the Knights.         
	The left-hander whacked Angelo Mathews into the sight screen and then turned his attention on the slow bowlers before perishing to a brilliant diving catch by Sourav. Tiwary miscued his shot and Sourav, standing at extra cover, flung himself to his right before bringing off a one handed catch.         
	However, that gallant effort by Sourav couldnt halt Mumbais march. Tendulkar raced to his fifty with two more boundaries off Sharma. Kieron Pollard did not last long, but R Sathish made sure there was no further damage for the hosts.         
	I felt comfortable with Sachin at the other end. I played my natural game and it worked, Sathish said about his 11-ball 21 not out.         
	In the end, the first five overs of either innings made the difference between the two teams.

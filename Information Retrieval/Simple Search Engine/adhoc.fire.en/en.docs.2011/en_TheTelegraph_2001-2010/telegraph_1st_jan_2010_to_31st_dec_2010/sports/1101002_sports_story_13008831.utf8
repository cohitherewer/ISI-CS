	Cuttack: A keen tussle is on the cards when East Bengal take on Mohun Bagan in the Federation Cup final at the Barabati Stadium, in Cuttack, on Saturday.         
	On paper, it is East Bengal who appear to be the better side. Their midfield and the frontline is working in tandem and that has been one of the most significant factors behind their nine-game unbeaten streak so far this season.         
	Barring the defence, which tends to get sluggish at times, as was evident against Churchill Brothers in the semi-final, the team have gelled as a unit.         
	For Bagan, they need to be careful of the Penn Orji and Tolgay Ozebe combination that has played a leading role in almost all of East Bengals matches so far.         
	Mehtab Hossains part at the centre of the park too would be vital for East Bengals cause as he not only has to create moves, but also negate those intended for the in-form Bagan upfront.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Stanley Rozario is yet to decide on whether to give Edeh Chiddi a start or continue with Diamondstar as the blocker.         
	If Diamondstar gets a start it will be interesting to see how he nullifies Penn, whose role as a roaming midfielder has caught most of the team off guard.         
	Bagan captain Ishfaq Ahmed, who is nursing an ankle sprain is doubtful starter and if fails to make the cut Snehasish Chakraborty will take his place.         
	East Bengal, on the other hand, are unlikely to make any changes despite concerns over Nirmal Chetris hamstring. Coach James Trevor Morgan looks confident of the centre defenders presence.         
	Mohun Bagan are ahead of their opponents, winning three out six meetings in the final so far.         
	The two outfits finished joint winners twice, while East Bengal won once in 1985.         
	When the two teams met each other in the final in 1998, Mohun Bagan won 2-1.         
	However, irrespective of the result, the floodlit final match is expected to be a mouth-watering affair.         
	A full house is expected as a large number of fans have already reached Cuttack.         
	After all, its a clash of arch-rivals.

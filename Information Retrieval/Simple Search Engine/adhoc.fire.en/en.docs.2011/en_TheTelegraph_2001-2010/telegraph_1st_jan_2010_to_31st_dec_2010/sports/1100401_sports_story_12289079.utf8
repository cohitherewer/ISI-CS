The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting is KKRs weakness: Rohit
                                                                                                                       7                                        Batting is KKRs weakness: Rohit
            A STAFF REPORTER            Rohit Sharma                           
	Calcutta: If one thought that Rohit Sharma was surprised by his selection in the Indian squad for the World T20, he will surprise you with his nonchalance.         
	I was not surprised I expected to be in the Indian team for the World T20. I am pretty happy with my performance in the domestic season and the call-up wasnt a surprise, the 22-year-old Mumbai batsman told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening.         
	Rohit, in fact, scored the only triple century in this years Indian first-class season, an unbeaten 309 against Gujarat. His tally of 527 runs (two centuries at an average of 87 plus) was the third highest for Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai behind Ajinkya Rahane (809 runs) and Wasim Jaffer (638).         
	In the city to play the Deccan Chargers return leg match against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Rohit was more keen that the discussions be restricted to his current team rather than the upcoming national assignment.         
	Currently, we are playing IPL and I dont want to think about anything else right now. The first and foremost aim is to see that we reach the semi-finals and take it from there. Till now, its not really clear which teams will qualify for the last four phase, Rohit said.         
	He didnt agree that Deccans performance has been inconsistent in this edition. This is such a format where you can lose a few matches. We have lost three but have also won three and are very much in contention.         
	He also feels that the KKRs poor show with the bat can work in favour of the Chargers. We have to take advantage of KKRs batting which hasnt been very good so far. The pitch looks to be on the slower side and spinners are likely to come into contention.         
	On personal front, Rohit is pretty happy in the manner he is performing for Chargers in the current edition. I am very satisfied with my performance till now. I have been batting well and I have tried contributing in both departments. I will definitely like to keep up the good work.         
	He has been the highest run-getter for his team so far (172 runs at an average of 34.40 and a strike rate of 141) and has also chipped in with a couple of wickets.         
	I have always taken my bowling very seriously. If I can get a wicket or two per match obviously, its of great help to the team. I definitely see myself bowling more overs in the coming days, said the man who took a hattrick during IPL-II in South Africa.  
	Kolkata Knight Riders  
	Chris Gayle: His flamboyance is an asset for any team. There are few in contemporary cricket who can match Gayles ability to decide the fate of the match while opening the innings. Sourav Ganguly has been far from convincing and a lot will, therefore, depend on Gayle.  
	Angelo Mathews: The Sri Lankan is perhaps the most under-utilised cricketer in the Knights camp. One of the cleanest hitters in this IPL, Mathews can turn out to be the deadliest Knight if handled properly. His controlled aggression and improvisations can be extremely effective while chasing. Not to forget his tight medium-pace bowling.  
	Shane Bond: Bond can prove to be the Knights best bet as they look to foil Hurricane Gilly. After missing the last match with a stomach bug, the speedman must be hungry for a few scalps on Thursday. On the tabletop which the Eden wicket looks quite close to on match eve, Bonds pace (and a few early wickets) should get the momentum going for the Knights.  
	Deccan Chargers  
	Adam Gilchrist: The Australian has been Deccan Chargers most prolific scorer (1150 runs in 38 matches). His importance to the teams success in the Indian Premier League was made obvious when they fell flat in their last two matches with Gilly failing with the bat, scoring 1 and 0 respectively.   
	Andrew Symonds: He hasnt really fired on all cylinders and the Knights would be hoping he doesnt make Thursdays game his launch pad. One of the biggest hitters in the game, Symonds can win matches single-handedly.   
	Rohit Sharma: After his captain, Rohit has been the most consistent contributor for the Chargers. The right-handed Mumbaikar has time and again bailed out his team in difficult situations and his role on Thursday will, as always, be crucial.

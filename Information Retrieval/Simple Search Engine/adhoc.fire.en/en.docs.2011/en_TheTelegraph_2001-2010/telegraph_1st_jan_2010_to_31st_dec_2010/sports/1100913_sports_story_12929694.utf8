	Centurion: Jacques Kallis starred with an all-round performance as Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) crushed underdogs Guyana by nine wickets in their opening Champions League Twenty20 match here Sunday.         
	Kallis captured three wickets for 16 to play a big role in RCB skittling out Guyana for a paltry 103 after captain Anil Kumble put the opposition in and later smashed an unbeaten 43 to help his side overhaul the target with more than seven overs remaining at Super Sport Park here.         
	Veteran batsman Rahul Dravid, who opened the innings with Kallis, contributed 33 as RCB scored 106 in 12.2 overs to start their campaign on a winning note.         
	Kallis remained not out on 43 from 32 balls with the help of four fours and a six while Dravid, the only RCB batsman dismissed Sunday, hit three fours in his 34-ball innings.         
	One-down Robin Uthappa chipped in with an eight-ball cameo of 25 not out which he made with the help of two fours and an equal number of sixes.         
	The Guyana bowlers, lacking in international exposure, failed to make any impact against the top class RCB batsmen who scored runs almost at will.         
	With a meagre total of 104 to chase, Kallis and Dravid did not take much risk with too many shots before Uthappa ended the match in a flash by taking 21 runs in the 12th over with the help of two sixes and a four off Christopher Barnwell.         
	Uthappa hit the winning runs  a four  in the 13th over to overhaul the target.         
	Earlier, Kallis led a disciplined RCB bowling attack with three wickets, including two in three balls, as they shot out Guyana for 103.         
	Kallis claimed Guyana captain Ramnaresh Sarwans (7) crucial wicket early in the innings before scalping two batsmen in the 16th over after Kumble elected to field after winning the toss. Kallis (3/16) was ably supported by Kumble, Praveen Kumar and Nayan Joshi by chipping in with a wicket each as RCB bowlers tied down the Guyanese batsmen, most of whom lacking in international exposure, all through the innings.         
	Barnwell top-scored with a 35-ball 30 while the next highest scorer was opener Sewnarine Chattergoon with an 18.         
	Kumbles decision to bowl first was proved right by his pacers Dale Steyn and Kumar as the pace duo tied down Guyana batsmen with the help of some early swing. (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Seeking a goal glut
            A STAFF REPORTER            Joshimar                           
	Calcutta: The CFL Premier Division is headed for an exciting finish as Mohun Bagan and Chirag United aim for a goal rush in their penultimate encounters against West Bengal Police and Kalighat, respectively.         
	While Bagan will play at Salt Lake Stadium, Chirag will take on Kalighat at the Khardah Stadium.         
	With both teams on 33 points, Chirag have their nose slightly ahead with a better goal difference (+25) than Bagan (+24).         
	While Chirag have scored 29 goals in 13 matches, the green-and-maroon brigade have scored one less. Both teams have conceded four goals each.         
	On Thursday, the teams will be aiming to score as many as possible so that even a draw in the final encounter on October 25 will ensure the title on the basis of better goal difference.         
	If the two teams fail to consolidate their goal difference, a situation of being joint winners may arise as IFAs tournament rules dont have the provision for play-offs.         
	For Chirag, the local league bears more significance than Bagan as they have chance of scripting history by being the first team (save Big Three) since Eastern Railway in 1958 to have emerged champions in the elite division.         
	Chirag striker Joshimar, who has 13 goals to his credit in the CFL, will like to increase his tally and, in the process, help his team reach a comfortable position.

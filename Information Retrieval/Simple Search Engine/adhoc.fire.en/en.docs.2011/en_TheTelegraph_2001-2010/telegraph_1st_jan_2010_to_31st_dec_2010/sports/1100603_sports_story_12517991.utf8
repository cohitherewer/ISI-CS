            ROUND TRIP                
	Telstar             
	As the Cup travelled to Mexico, television audiences all over demanded that they wanted their eyes on the ball as their teams chased the title. The innovators put their heads together and voila, a black and white patchwork ball that is more prominently visible. A classic football design that has come to stay in Calcutta along with Pele and Brazil, the other stars of 70.         
	Azteca             
	After another Telstar and the Tango, came the first fully synthetic ball in Mexico 86. In between, was the Espana, which was the last time World Cup football was played with a leather ball. The Aztecas elaborate design was inspired by the host nations native Aztec motifs.         
	Tricolore             
	The official match ball of 98 France, it was the first multi-coloured ball to be used in the finals and the final World Cup ball to bear the classic Tango design, introduced in 78. The design of blue triads decorated with cockerel motifs was adopted to represent the colours of the French flag.         
	+Teamgeist                 
	Now the ball enters the province of rocket science. The 06 match ball has just 14 curved panels rather than the 32 that were standard since 70. In another first, the panels are bonded together rather than stitched. It is claimed this ball is rounder and performs more uniformly.         
	Jabulani                 
	This one means be happy in Zulu and is yet again a new design, consisting of eight thermally-bonded, three-dimensional panels. The surface of the ball is textured with grooves that are intended to improve its aerodynamics. But the goalies seem to have a lot of problems with this supermarket ball.

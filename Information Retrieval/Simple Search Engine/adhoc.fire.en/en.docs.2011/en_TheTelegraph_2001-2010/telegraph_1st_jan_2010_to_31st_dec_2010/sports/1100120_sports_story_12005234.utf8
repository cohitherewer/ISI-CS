	Amritsar: Two Uttar Pradesh players  one a current international and other an India discard came together on Tuesday to bail Central Zone out of trouble against East in the Duleep Trophy opener here.         
	Suresh Raina (83 batting) and skipper Mohammed Kaif (65 batting) added 141 runs in unbroken third wicket partnership.         
	Central finished the first day at 150 for three after losing their first three wickets for only nine runs inside the first six overs.         
	The East bowlers could manage only 38 overs on the day due to overcast conditions as the match started well after lunch due to fog-induced bad light.         
	There was another stoppage due to bad light before play resumed for the second time.         
	East Zone skipper Saurabh Tiwary called the coin correctly and opted to field.         
	Easts new ball bowlers Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda bowled well in tandem during their opening spell as Central lost both their openers in a space of three deliveries.         
	First it was Ranadeb who got southpaw Tanmay Srivastava (0) caught by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. It was the last delivery of his first over.         
	With Srivastavas wicket, Ranadebs first-class haul became 299 wickets and he touched Subrata Guha to become Bengals highest wicket-taking pacer.         
	In the very next over, Ashok Dinda got other opener Jalaj Saxena (0) to edge one to the slip cordon where Manoj Tiwary held on to the catch.         
	Veteran Sanjay Bangar was slightly better as he got off the mark. However, in the sixth over of the innings and Dindas third, the former India all-rounder edged one to Arindam Das in the slips.         
	At 9 for three, one thought that East would pile on the pressure but Raina who came in at No. 5 took the attack back to the opposition camp.         
	He started fluently hitting the East bowlers to all parts of the ground. Suddenly both Dinda and Ranadeb started looking ordinary.         
	With a dour Kaif playing sheet anchors role to perfection, Raina hit 15 boundaries and a six during his 96-ball unbeaten knock.         
	Kaif, who was released by the Rajasthan Royals and snapped up by the Kings XI Punjab for a $250,000 contract, took 115 deliveries to score 65. He hit 12 boundaries in the process.

	Calcutta: In his younger days, Bruce Shannahan used to wield the hockey stick and wasnt too bad at it. He was unlucky not to have featured in the Australian hockey team that played in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. However, in 1977, he donned national colours and shared the dressing room with none other than the legendary Ric Charlesworth.         
	After sweating it out for the national team in the late 70s, Shannahan decided to try his hand at a different sport. And, now, he isnt doing too badly with the golf club.         
	A proof of that skill came as he guided his team, the Royal Perth Golf Club (RPGC), to the top of the leaderboard where they are tied with the Royal Montreal Golf Club (RMGC) at the end of the first round of the Vodafone Royals Trophy, at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.         
	The clubs are tied at 40 points each while home team RCGC B on 39 points are breathing down their necks at third. Close on their heels is the Royal Melbourne Golf Club on 38 points.         
	I am enjoying every bit of it. I dont know whether I will win the championship but it really feels good that we are leading today, Shannahan told The Telegraph on Saturday. The Royals Trophy has given us the chance to interact with people from different parts of the globe and we are thoroughly enjoying our visit to India, added the captain.         
	Talking about his days as a hockey player, he remembered his association with Charlesworth. Myself and Ric played for Western Australia for a number of years. I couldnt make it to the 1976 Olympic squad and Australia didnt send a team to the Moscow Olympics (1980). Thus, I missed out on playing in the Olympics, the Aussie said.         
	On the day, the round was played according to the eclectic stableford format with the better stableford score of the partners on each of the respective holes chosen to arrive at the team total.         
	Apart from Bruce, who is the captain of the RPGC, the team includes Francis James Bryant. Also sharing the limelight were the husband-wife duo of Ravi and Binnie Mehra, representing RMGC.         
	The RCGC B is represented by Aditya Khaitan and Lakshman Singh while the Royal Melbourne is represented by Stephen and Margie Lilley.         
	RMGC captain Ravi Mehra was ecstatic. He could not control his excitement after receiving the news that they were in joint lead.         
	We just came here to enjoy the camaraderie and make new friends. We are delighted to be at the top, said Ravi. Tomorrow is another day and another format. Winning is not important for us but we dont mind ending up as the winners, added Ravi.         
	In the individual event played for the Vodafone Invitational Trophy, Noel Britto of IBM Bangalore emerged winner with 35 points. He pipped Aditya Khaitan on countback.         
	The Bangalore duo of Ramneek Bakshi and Anees Ahmed bagged the team honours with 41 points. With the teams bunched together, the final round promises to be an exciting affair.

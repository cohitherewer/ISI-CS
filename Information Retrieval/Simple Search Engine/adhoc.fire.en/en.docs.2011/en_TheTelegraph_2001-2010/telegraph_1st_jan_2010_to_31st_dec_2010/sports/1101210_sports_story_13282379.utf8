                                                                                                                       7                                      For legends, India favourites
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Four living legends of cricket  Imran Khan, Vivian Richards, Kapil Dev and Arjuna Ranatunga  who assembled here, on Thursday, during a promotional for the 2011 World Cup, have one thing in common. All strongly feel that India are overwhelming favourites to win the coveted trophy next year.         
	In a 90-minute interaction with mediapersons, the four former captains, described India as a well-balanced side who have the potential to fulfil the dream of winning the Cup on home soil.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Indias chances at the World Cup         
	 Imran: India are favourites going by their form and depth in bowling and batting. Sri Lanka are a close second. India will have the home advantage that matters a lot. I know people in India are dying to win it but there is a word of caution. Best teams often come under pressure and India will have to cope with that.         
	 Richards: When you are one of the top sides, there is a lot of pressure They (India) have something to defend You have a good chance. What Ive been impressed most by is the fact that most of the star players are not playing against New Zealand, and still the team is winning. It suggests you have lots of good players in the reserve bench.         
	 Kapil: On paper, India look very good. If they play like a team, they should make the semi-finals. One or two players can do the trick (Virender) Sehwag is important. So is Sachin (Tendulkar) and even (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni himself. (Yusuf) Pathan and (Gautam) Gambhir will also play important roles Frankly, I cant name one or two players I have to name six or seven players.         
	 Ranatunga: India are definitely the favourites as they have too many players to pick from But playing in front of the home crowd, often creates a lot of panic among the players... Sri Lanka are definitely one of the favourites. We have a good team but my only worry is their middle-order. We had a strong middle-order in 1996, but this team has better bowlers and both (Muttiah) Muralidharan and (Lasith) Malinga are match-winners.         
	If Indias tour of South Africa would be of help in Cup preparations         
	 Imran: I think the South Africa tour (ahead of the World Cup) will do them a world of good. The tougher the tour, the better prepared you are for the World Cup. Dont bother about injuries, it can happen any time.         
	 Richards: Touring South Africa is the best preparation... If you think positively, going to South Africa and beating them there, and then returning to win the World Cup, would be a great thing.         
	 Kapil: Its similar to the 1983 World Cup We went to the West Indies before the World Cup for a tough tour on good pitches. If this Indian team play well in South Africa, their confidence will be high. Even if they dont, they can still think that they would get to play at home. So its a win-win situation Only thing I want to say is that lets not play so much before the World Cup The big guns may sustain injuries.         
	Sachin Tendulkars role         
	 Imran: He is definitely one of the worlds greatest batsmen. Sachin would play an important role in shaping Indias fortunes in the World Cup.         
	 Richards: But Sachin is yet to win the World Cup He is special not only for India but also in international cricket. That World Cup is being held in India, winning it will be the icing on the cake for him.         
	 Kapil: People keep on saying this could be Sachins last World Cup But he could play two more The expectations are high especially after that 200 knock from him. Sachin is one of the most important persons of world cricket He brings people to the cricket ground. I hope he continues to play like this.         
	On captaincy         
	 Imran: A captain has to inspire the team by his own performance. The captain who performs always commands respect.         
	 Richards: Kapil Dev was the man who united the Indian cricket team in 1983. In 1992, Imran Khan was like the general in command in the middle. He commanded respect from the players.         
	 Kapil: If you perform, your thinking and even your tone of talking changes. After the Zimbabwe match in the 1983 World Cup, when we won after being 17 for five at one point, our self-belief went up.         
	 Ranatunga: I agree. One should lead from the front.         
	Their winning moments as captains         
	 Imran: It was always a desire to thrash your former colonial masters (in the 1992 World Cup final against England). We had young players like Inzamam-ul Haq, Wasim Akram All of them were tremendous cricketers. England had no wicket-taking bowlers. They had no specialists, only bits and pieces cricketers.         
	 Kapil: When Viv (Richards) was going great guns in the 1983 final, I thought it was all over. Madan Lal was hit for three fours in one over by him and I told Madan to take a break. He pleaded for one more over I gave it to him and he removed Viv. I took the catch running back, saying its mine, its mine, because I believe Yashpal (Sharma) was also running for the ball.         
	 Ranatunga: In 1996, when we beat India in Delhi, we realised we were good enough to win the World Cup. I knew the Australians would hurt us, even verbally, in press conferences. So I started it by saying the Waugh brothers and Shane Warne were over-rated and some other things. When I came out to bat in the final, I heard some Aussie fielders saying, oh, here comes the greatestwe are all over-rated. I knew my trick had worked... Winning the World Cup was also the worst moment for Sri Lankan cricket. A lot of unwanted people started getting into the game in my country.         
	On the most devastating batsman  Adam Gilchrist, Shahid Afridi, Chris Gayle or Virender Sehwag         
	 Richards: The last named Sehwag is so devastating. India need him badly. I admire his bravery... This guy is totally fearless when it comes to batting.

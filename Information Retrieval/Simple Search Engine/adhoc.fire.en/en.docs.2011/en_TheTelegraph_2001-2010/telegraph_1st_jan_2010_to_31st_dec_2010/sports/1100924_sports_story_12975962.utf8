The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Singapore on NZ mind 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Singapore on NZ mind 
                      
	Wellington: Setbacks for the upcoming Commonwealth Games are simply refusing to die out.         
	In an unusual move, the New Zealand contingent for the Commonwealth Games might base itself in Singapore till the Games Village, which was dubbed as filthy and uninhabitable, is made fully ready for the teams to move in.         
	The New Zealand contingent Thursday delayed their departure to Delhi by two days and could base itself temporarily in Singapore if the state of the athletes accommodation does not improve.         
	After Scotland and Canada, New Zealand has become the third participating nation to delay their departure for Delhi after the Games Village came in for sharp criticism by the visiting delegates.         
	New Zealand Olympic Committee said the travel plans of the team have been altered as there is a long list of outstanding issues.         
	...the village will now not be ready for New Zealand athletes to move in as planned, NZOC president Mike Stanley was quoted as saying by a New Zealand newspaper.         
	It is tremendously disappointing. We know how hard this must be for athletes and were continuing to push for an urgent resolution.         
	This is not a matter of comfort or luxury; its a matter of hygiene and safety, he said.         
	Stanley and NZOC secretary general Barry Maister were in Delhi to assess the conditions at the Games Village. Singapore could be used as an alternate base for the athletes if the facilities at the Games Village do not improve.         
	(Holding them) in Singapore is certainly a possibility, an NZOC spokesperson said.         
	A report also claimed that, dissatisfied with the upkeep at the Games village, New Zealand is utilising the services of a specialised outfit to clean up the residential tower where its athletes and officials would be put up.         
	The team armed with cleaning equipment and liquid solutions have commenced their work at the Games Village.         
	Impressed by the quality of work being done by the New Zealand cleaning team, sources said that the Organising Committee (OC) is now contemplating to request them to help clean up other towers as well.         
	In what would be music to ears of the Indian organisers, Australian CWG Association chief Perry Crosswhite Thursday said the condition of the Games Village is acceptable as of now and also confirmed arrival of their contingent for the Games.         
	Conditions at the Commonwealth Games Village are acceptable. Things are getting better every time. The residential towers at the Village are improving. However, water at the basement inside the Village is a bit of a concern to us, Crosswhite said at a media conference.         
	He also assured that Australian contingent would reach the capital on September 27.         
	Also, convinced by the assurances given by the CWG organisers to CGF that all glitches will be fixed in time, Wales, too, Thursday said that its contingent would leave for New Delhi as planned.         
	Wales had put on hold its departure and had given a deadline to the organisers to put things in order by Wednesday.         
	Scotland, which has already delayed the departure of its athletes, also came out with positive signals, saying that it was heartened by the progress made by the organisers.         
	In another development, two archers  Kevin Tataryn and Dietmar Trillus  have become the first Canadian athletes to pull out of the Games, citing health and safety concerns. Tataryn and Dietmar withdrew from the international competition on Wednesday morning, said Scott Ogilvie, Archery Canadas executive director.

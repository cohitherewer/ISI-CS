	Calcutta: If Sourav Ganguly gives the thumbs up, John Wright will suggest to New Zealands Southern Institute of Technology (SIT) that a scholarship be offered, with both their names, to a youngster from this city.         
	Obviously, Sourav has to agree... If he does, Ill be only too happy to suggest that SIT institutes a Calcutta-specific scholarship... That would be a wonderful way to continue an association, Wright told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Wright (a former New Zealand captain and India coach) is a brand ambassador for SIT, which has its main campus in Invercargill. It has already committed itself to handing out five scholarships, in Wrights name, to Indians.         
	Should there be one exclusively for the city, then it would be scholarship No.6.         
	Wright and Sourav, Indias most successful Test captain, formed an excellent partnership, from November 2000 till April 2005, and continue to be on very good terms.         
	Hopefully, Ill be meeting Sourav tomorrow (Sunday)... It will be nice to catch up with him once again, Wright pointed out, after a SIT promotional.         
	Each scholarship is worth NZ $ 14,000-18,000. Accommodation and food isnt covered, though.

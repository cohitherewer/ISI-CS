The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC to hear tainted Pak trio
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC to hear tainted Pak trio
                      
	Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will convene a preliminary hearing into allegations of spot-fixing against three Pakistani players in 40 days time, the legal adviser to the PCB said on Tuesday.         
	Tafazzul Rizvi said that the players, Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammad Aamer, had exercised their right to a preliminary hearing against their suspension over the scandal and filed responses.         
	The players had asked for a hearing to hear their point of view, Rizvi said. The ICC will now convene a hearing in 40 days time.         
	The three players were suspended on September 4 by the ICC for their alleged involvement in spot-fixing during the fourth Test against England at Lords.         
	The players responded to the ICC on Tuesday within the required deadline. Rizvi said they replied to the charges through a lawyer two days before the deadline was set to expire.         
	They met with PCB chairman Ijaz Butt in Lahore on Tuesday. No details of the meeting were revealed.         
	Team manager Yawar Saeed said earlier English police had delayed until Wednesday the questioning of a fourth player, fast bowler Wahab Riaz, over the scandal.         
	Riaz was originally summoned by Scotland Yard for Tuesday but Saeed said the questioning had been delayed by one day. Wahab will be going on Wednesday as there was some prior commitment he had to deal with first, Saeed said, without elaborating.         
	Riaz, 25, a left-armer, claimed five wickets on his debut in the third Test against England and was a member of Pakistans squad for the five-match one-day series, but did not play in the first two.         
	London police have already interviewed Test captain Butt and pace bowlers Aamer and Asif, who were suspended by the ICC over fixing allegations.         
	The trio have returned to Pakistan but on the condition they would be available for police questioning when required.         
	Rizvi said the tour selection committee took the decision not to select Riaz for the one-day matches, denying it was a result of ICC or PCB pressure.         
	He is available for selection as any other player in the touring squad, Rizvi said.         
	Meanwhile, Aamer could become an informant for the ICC and reveal dodgy betting identities that corrupted him to escape a life ban, a media report said Tuesday.         
	According to a report in an Australian daily, Aamer is ready for the high-risk roll of the dice that could put his life in danger.         
	Quoting sources, the newspaper reported that the 18-year-old fast bowler is contemplating co-operating with police and the ICCs investigations into the spot-fixing and match-fixing allegations that have followed a British tabloids sting operation on alleged bookie Mazhar Majeed.         
	It is understood the 18-year-old wants to tell his story and possibly give evidence against Butt, Asif and other Pakistani players under investigation.         
	Given his tender age, inexperience and potential co-operation with authorities, there is a high likelihood that Aamer could receive a watered-down penalty compared to the life bans that could be dished out to some of the other alleged cheats, the newspaper reported.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Parsana: Well try to give a sporting track
                                                                                                                       7                                      Parsana: Well try to give a sporting track
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India have an unassailable lead over New Zealand in the ICC Test rankings, and even though Mahendra Singh Dhoni doesnt face any immediate threat from the visiting Black Caps squad, there will be some apprehension when the two teams face off at Motera, in the first Test, from Thursday.         
	The venue has traditionally helped batsmen with little help for bowlers. Its curator, Dhiraj Parsana, has time and again found himself under fire from Indian bowlers and Harbhajan Singh had been the last one to criticise him.         
	The offie had slammed Parsana for a docile wicket that had no assistance for bowlers in the drawn Test, against Sri Lanka, in November. The pitch was so unresponsive for the bowlers that 1,598 runs were scored in that match.         
	Interestingly, a total of 6139 runs have been scored in the last five Tests at Motera paving way for two wins and three draws. While the players might be bracing for another toil at the soporific deck, there could be a spin in the tale of the Ahmedabad wicket.         
	The stadium had been flooded by incessant rains that lashed Gujarat in August this year. Parsana, however, called the deluge a blessing in disguise as silt was deposited on the ground. The water was there on the ground for about three days, but the silt deposit has worked in our favour. We didnt have to use fertilizers to grow the grass, he said.         
	Stung by the criticism last time, Parsana promised a result-oriented wicket. We will try to give a sporting wicket. I had done the same thing last time. There are no specific instructions for the wicket.         
	We are preparing the wicket with some grass on it. As the match day progresses, we will gradually expose the entire pitch. It will be batsman-friendly, but will have enough assistance for bowlers. The outfield is lush green and we should get a result in the first Test, he said.         
	Lets hope Parsana keeps his promise this time around and avoids another harsh scrutiny.

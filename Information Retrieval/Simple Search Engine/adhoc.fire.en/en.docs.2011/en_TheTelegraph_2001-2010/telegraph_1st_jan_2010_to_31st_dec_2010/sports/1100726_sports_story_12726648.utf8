The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No M amp;M, but a fresh headache for India
                                                                                                                       7                                        No M amp;M, but a fresh headache for India
    - Gambhir has knee problem while Yuvi is down with fever; Munaf in XII           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Gambhir (top) and Yuvraj                                  
	Colombo: With plenty to play for, India may have to do without Gautam Gambhir and even Yuvraj Singh in the second Test against Sri Lanka, at the SSC, from Monday.         
	Gambhirs right knee is troubling him, while Yuvraj has developed fever.         
	At this stage, Gambhirs struggling... Hell be put through a fitness test before the toss, but the signs just arent good... Yuvraj, however, could recover, a member of the team management told The Telegraph, late on Sunday.         
	Gambhir, one learns, hurt his knee during the tour opener (against the Board Presidents XI) and the injury got aggravated in the first Test, in Galle. He made no impact there, but remains a key player.         
	If Gambhir fails the fitness test, then Murali Vijay will open with vice-captain Virender Sehwag. Should Yuvraj also have to sit out, then Suresh Raina would earn his maiden Test cap.         
	Both Gambhir and Yuvraj are, of course, in the XII  the XI which got thrashed by 10 wickets, in Galle, plus Munaf Patel. If three new-ball bowlers are picked, then Pragyan Ojha will be dropped, with Harbhajan Singh the lone specialist spinner.         
	Such uncertainty hardly makes for an ideal build-up. In any case, being down in the fight for the Micromax Cup, much needs to be done to stay afloat in the three-match series.         
	The devouring M amp;M wont feature in the Sri Lanka XI, but that cant be reason enough for India to breathe somewhat easy.         
	While Muttiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga wont be around, Ajantha Mendis, who troubled Mahendra Singh Dhonis men in the tour opener, will be making a comeback at the ultimate level.         
	Mendis may not exactly be the mystery bowler he was two years ago, but has it in him to pose problems even for the accomplished.         
	The Sri Lanka captain, Kumar Sangakkara, made a point when he said: Before the last Test, everyone seemed to have worked out Murali, but he ended up taking eight wickets (to finish on 800)...         
	Generally, the SSC wicket is rather benign and the batsmen frustrate the bowlers. If that characteristic stays  incidentally, theres more grass this time, which is why Munaf is in the XII  then it will be tougher for India.         
	The biggest worry is how to take 20 wickets. That the spinners, Harbhajan and Ojha, went wicketless in Galle continues to haunt.         
	Dhoni, though, insisted that the mood within the team was back to normal.             If we lose it (the No. 1 spot), we will try to get it back... It rsquo;s not that once you reach the top, that place belongs to you  
	 Mahendra Singh Dhoni      
	The general thinking is that we could have batted a lot better... Were trying to rectify the problems... The dressing room atmosphere is back to normal... Were not thinking too much about what happened in the last Test... Now, its all about the next game.         
	Dhoni also pointed out one needs to stick to the basics and that the duration between mistakes is invariably longer in the case of good players.         
	The rankings issue is very much in the air around here and Dhoni took the No.1-related question head on.         
	If we lose it, we will try to get it back... Its not that once you reach the top, that place belongs to you. Its one place that everybody is fighting for... Its a test of character (after Galle)...         
	Sri Lanka, currently at No.4, have the chance to topple India if they add to their success in Galle.         
	For both, then, theres plenty at stake.         
	Much will hinge on Indias batting. However, a piece of statistics is quite frightening: In the last 11 years, only Sehwag has scored a Test hundred (two, in fact) in Sri Lanka.         
	After the Asian Test Championship, in early 1999, the Big Three (Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman) havent gone past double figures.         
	Sourav Ganguly did come close to a hundred, but was left not out on 98 in Kandy, on the 2001-02 tour, after Mohammed Kaif got the winning runs.         
	Where the Sri Lanka XI is concerned, Mendis will be in for Murali, with Dilhara Fernando expected to take Malingas place.         
	Theres talk that the selectors are keen on playing rookie off-spinner Suraj Randiv, but the team management is keen on retaining left-armer Rangana Herath.         
	Herath did precious little with the ball in Galle, but his 80 not out took Sri Lanka past the 500-mark and really turned the heat on India.         
	Sangakkara, one understands, has the final say.

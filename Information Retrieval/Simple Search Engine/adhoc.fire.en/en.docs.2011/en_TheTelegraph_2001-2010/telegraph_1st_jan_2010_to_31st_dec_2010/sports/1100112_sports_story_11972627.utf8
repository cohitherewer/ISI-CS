The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hope to make city proud: SRK
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hope to make city proud: SRK
    - We are more organised this time, says KKR principal owner             A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Prince of Calcutta and the Sultan of Swing were there. On Monday, the royal trinity of the Kolkata Knight Riders was completed when Shah Rukh King Khan visited the city to attend the franchises ongoing camp.         
	The principal owner was here, as he said, to cheer up the boys and hoped that the Knights will do better in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Also, on behalf of his team, he expressed regret over letting Calcutta down in the first two editions of the T20 event.         
	It was learnt Monday that, as part of the build-up to edition No.3, KKR, who do have a lot to prove, would be touring Bangladesh to play some practice matches between February 1-5.         
	Besides meeting the players, at the CC amp;FC ground, Shah Rukh had a brief interaction with the media.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The camp         
	Im not the right person here to talk about cricket There are many experts  Sourav (Ganguly), Dav (Whatmore), Wasim (Akram)  who have a better understanding of the game. The boys are working extremely hard at the camp and I have just come to cheer them up. Calcutta is the base for our team and I love coming here.         
	The reason behind visiting the preparatory camp         
	This is certainly not the first time I have visited KKR at practice. Im sure I have done that earlier too. Last year, things were too jumbled up  I got injured and then the tournament was shifted to South Africa. During the first edition, we had to play at a very short notice, so there wasnt really too much time for practice. But this time its different and we are more organised.         
	Hopes for 2010         
	We have a fresh approach to everything this year. We have a new coach in Dav, a new group of support staff and of course, theres Wasim. Im glad they havent changed me at least! Hopefully, by the end of the year we will be able to make Calcutta proud.         
	On the upcoming IPL auction         
	We have some names in mind. But a clearer picture about the availability of the international players will emerge by January 17-18. Dav and Dada will be taking a call on that. And, of course, Ill add some inputs.         
	The poor showing in the last two seasons         
	Lets forget it... I mean its over. We should concentrate on the way ahead. We have a mixture of experience and youth this time. I believe in team spirit and we have to ensure that it is maintained throughout. Its a new format and, may be, the players needed a little more time. But I take collective responsibility for the performance. I also feel I have let Calcutta down. We have just not been able to perform as a cohesive unit and need to work more towards achieving that.         
	Any regrets         
	I regret losing I dont like losing. I also regret that I have let Calcutta down, more so because of the love this city has showered on us. Were a good and honest side and I believe we can do much better than what we have so far. We have to bring cohesiveness into the team. Its also about proving to myself that if I undertake a job, I can be successful at it.         
	His take on the revolt of hockey players         
	Its sad for any sport. Hockey is a special sport for us as we have a great history in it. People have the right to protest in whatever way they feel right. But the important thing is to focus on resolving the matter.  
	All in a day rsquo;s work
    
	Shah Rukh Khan rsquo;s almost seven-hour stay in the city on Monday might appear short but the principal owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders had a busy schedule. From visiting the Knights rsquo; camp at the CC amp;FC to hosting a dinner for the players at a city hotel, SRK managed everything. And, as always, in style.
    
	This is how the Bollywood superstar rsquo;s visit went:
    
	1.58pm mdash; Shah Rukh enters CC amp;FC. After a brief chat with the KKR management, he steps on to the ground. He exchanges greetings with Sourav Ganguly and Wasim Akram before discussing a few things. He also meets physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Adrian Le Roux before walking up to have a chat with coach Dav Whatmore. It appeared as if he was asking for a few suggestions from the fitness experts for his injured back. 
  2.15pm mdash; Shah Rukh is mobbed by autograph hunters, but manages a brief interaction with the media.
  2.25pm mdash; Holds a round of discussions, over beverages, with KKR officials. Also sees the practice match being played among the Knights.
  4.00pm mdash; Has a brief meeting on some charity project.
  4.10pm mdash; Has a second round of interaction with Sourav, Dav and Akram, after the completion of the practice matches.

  5.00pm mdash; Enters hotel for the dinner and meets players personally.
  7.55pm mdash; Leaves for airport from hotel.

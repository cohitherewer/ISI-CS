The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salman, Aamer blast ICC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Salman, Aamer blast ICC
                      
	Islamabad: Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer on Monday accused the ICC of not really listening to their appeals against provisional bans for an alleged involvement in spot-fixing.         
	The ICCs code of conduct commission upheld the suspensions of Butt, Aamer and teammate Mohammed Asif, who withdrew his appeal last week, on Sunday after a two-day hearing in Dubai. The trio were suspended in September after a British tabloid sting alleged money was paid for bowling no balls at prearranged times in a Test against England at Lords in August to fix spot-betting markets.         
	Butt and the 18-year-old Aamer returned to Pakistan on Monday and expressed their disappointment at the outcome of the hearing, which was overseen by code of conduct commission chief Michael Beloff.         
	They heard us but (it was) as if say whatever you want to say, we have come with a decision, Butt said. Their decision was not based on a single piece of evidence against us. We requested from them the next date of the hearing but they didnt give it.         
	Aamer said he felt the ICC had made up its mind before the hearing that the suspension would remain in place.         
	(Before leaving for Dubai) we felt the case will be in our favour. But when he gave the decision, it looked as if he had written it before.         
	Aamer also requested that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Pakistans government come forward to help resolve the case.         
	Pakistan are due to send their 30-member list of probable players for next years World Cup to the International Cricket Council by November 30 and the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt said the three could only be included if they were exonerated by the ongoing investigation.         
	If they get exonerated then we can (ask) permission from the ICC to include them, Butt said. Suspended players could not be included, that is very loud and clear.         
	The ICC has not provided an estimate of how long the investigation will take.         
	Ijaz Butt also said Monday that the national team only needs bowling and fielding coaches and that batsmen should be responsible for preparing themselves before selection.         
	When a player (batsman) comes to Test cricket ... if he needs coaching he should not have been selected, the PCB chairman said.         
	Abdul Qadir wanted the PCB to hire a batting coach in the wake of poor performances against South Africa in the Untied Arab Emirates.         
	Pakistan lost both their Twenty20s in Abu Dhabi and were facing defeat at 136-5 in the second one-day International before a stunning unbeaten 109 off 72 balls by Abdul Razzaq lifted them to one-wicket win and levelled the five-match series 1-1.         
	Waqar Younis is Pakistans head coach with Aqib Javed his assistant.         
	I am not an expert, Butt said when asked why Pakistans top order batsmen were struggling against South Africa.           (AGENCIES)

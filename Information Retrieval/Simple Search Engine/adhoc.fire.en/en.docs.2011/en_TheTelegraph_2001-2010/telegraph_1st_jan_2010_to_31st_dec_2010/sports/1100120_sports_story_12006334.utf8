The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In my view, India can stay at the top, says Eric Simons
                                                                                                                       7                                        In my view, India can stay at the top, says Eric Simons
    - Test cricket is about absorbing pressure and creating pressure           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Eric Simons                                 
	Chittagong: Articulate and clear about his priorities... Thats how Team Indias bowling consultant, Eric Simons, came across on Tuesday.         
	Incidentally, he has worn the same hat with the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	The following are excerpts from what Simons said at a general media conference and during a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph:         
	His assignment only being for six weeks         
	Thats the way it is... I dont know whether Im the right man (for the job in the long-term).         
	The work hell actually be able to do in such a short time         
	Six weeks isnt enough to make a big impact... It may take a year if one has to change somebodys action, but Ill be happy if the bowlers can take something away... Hopefully, Ill be able to leave some stuff for them...         
	Having beaten Allan Donald, whose name had also been doing the rounds         
	(Grins) I dont know much about the process followed in appointing me... All I can say is that I got a call asking if Id be available... I said yes.         
	Rapport with coach Gary Kirsten         
	Its vital... Ive spent a lot of time with him... It would be wrong for an Indian to try and teach the South Africans how to play cricket... Equally, it would be wrong for a South African to try and teach the Indians how to play... Gary has no ego, isnt arrogant... I understand hes done an amazing job.         
	Initial thoughts         
	Im trying to understand the Indian bowlers in this Test... Im not so arrogant as to (straightaway) tell them how to bowl... Ill be looking to try and find a joint solution... Lot of things can be solved through good strategy. Ive always found the Indian cricketers to be very talented.         
	Whether hell be working with the bowlers as a unit or looking at them as individuals         
	As a unit... You need partnerships among bowlers, too... Theres no point having one taking wickets at one end, with another leaking runs at the other... In fact, Ill be looking at them as a batting unit, as well... Id definitely like Nos.8-11 to contribute.         
	The Indian bowlers inability, despite taking early wickets, to break partnerships in the middle and to finish it off quickly         
	To talk of Test cricket, its all about absorbing pressure and creating pressure...Having just joined the team, Im not sure about the reason.         
	Indias bowling in the first innings         
	There are periods... Good periods and bad periods... They couldve bowled better at times, but did pull it back. You could bowl six yorkers and all six could get hit for boundaries... That wouldnt mean the bowler has bowled badly, it would mean that the process (at least) has been good...         
	The Bangladesh bowlers performance in innings No.1         
	They bowled with passion and knew what they were doing.         
	If the Shahadat Hossains have it in them to take 20 wickets in a Test         
	(Laughs) Youve got to have a plan... I mean, you cant be bowling at 125 kms and looking to be a Dale Steyn... If the plans are right, 20 wickets can be taken.         
	Fitness as a factor         
	There are certain things you cant control, but you can certainly control things like strategy and fitness... The fitness trainer (Ramji Srinivasan) is going to be an important ally of mine.         
	Whether hell be keen to look at a bigger pool of bowlers         
	Im there for only six weeks and, so, wouldnt like to comment.         
	Rotating the quicks         
	Look, I dont know a lot about the bowlers out there (in India)... India plays a lot of Tests with just two seamers, thats an unusual situation for me.         
	The appreciable difference between wickets in South Africa and in India         
	Every wicket has something to offer, its how you use whats there for you... The length can be different, the strategy can be different...         
	Ishant Sharma having been low on confidence         
	We often ask bowlers to do things theyre not comfortable doing... One will need to have a game plan hes comfortable with... Also, its important to know how he measures success... Ive had a chat with him...You could get a wicket with a half-volley, while a good ball could get hit for a bound-ary. Hes certainly bowled more good balls in this Test.         
	Pressure on the support staff as well         
	Its part of the job...         
	His take on Ian Chappell saying that India didnt have the bowlers to remain No.1 in Tests for long         
	There are a lot of views in the world of cricket... While one respects what he has said, having got to No.1, I cant understand why India cant stay there... In my view, India can stay at the top.         
	Thoughts on the next series (both Tests and ODIs), against South Africa, a team he coached for two years         
	Test cricket is tough at the best of times, it gets tougher if the top two teams are involved... I suppose my knowledge would be of help... In any case, the cricketers play against each other so often, that they know a lot about each other.         
	If hes in touch with, say, Graeme Smith         
	Off and on, yes... With Graeme, Jacques Kallis...         
	Whether hed be having mixed feelings sitting in the India dressing room and helping plot the defeat of a team he once coached         
	As a professional, Ill be doing my job... Thats the way professional sport is run.         
	Finally, his style         
	(Grins) I like staying in the background, as much as possible... Thats my style.

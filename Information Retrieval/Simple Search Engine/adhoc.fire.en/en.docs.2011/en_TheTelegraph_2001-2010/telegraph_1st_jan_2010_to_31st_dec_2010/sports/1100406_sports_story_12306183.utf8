	New Delhi: A struggling East Bengal face a tough task as they take on Al Qadsia without their talismanic striker Bhaichung Bhutia in a must-win away match in the AFC Cup in Kuwait City Tuesday.         
	Nothing has gone right for East Bengal this season except for winning the Federation Cup. They have lost all their AFC Cup matches so far and are languishing at the 10th spot in the I-League.         
	They had lost to Al Ittihad of Syria 1-4 at home in their first match before being drubbed 0-3 by Al Nejmeh of Lebanon in their away match.         
	In their last Group D match on March 24, East Bengal had lost 2-3 to Al Qadsia in Calcutta. A loss Tuesday will reduce their remaining matches in the competition of academic interest.         
	East Bengal will be without captain and midfielder Syed Rahim Nabi, apart from Bhaichung, who is yet to recover from a hamstring injury.         
	The red-and-gold team have gone to Kuwait without three players from the team that lost to the same Kuwaiti opponents 2-3. Apart from Nabi and Bhaichung, coach Phillippe de Ridder has also left out defender Govin Singh.         
	Nirmal Chetri and Harmanjot Singh Khabra are likely to fill in the shoes of Uga Okpara and Govin. (PTI)

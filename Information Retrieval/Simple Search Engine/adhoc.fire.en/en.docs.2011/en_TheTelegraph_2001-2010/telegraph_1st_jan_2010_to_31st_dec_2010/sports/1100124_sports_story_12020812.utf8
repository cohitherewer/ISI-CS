                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak see win as answer to snub
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan on Saturday celebrated their victory over arch-rivals India in the ICC under-19 cricket World Cup with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and some former players here describing it as a right answer to the IPL snub.         
	It is a great win for Pakistan cricket and comes at the right time. It just shows that our cricketers are equal to any in the world, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt said. The PCB immediately announced a cash prize of Rs 1,00,000 for each member of the team.         
	Former captain Ramiz Raja described the win as a big one for Pakistan cricket.         
	It comes at a time when this IPL incident has taken place and when our senior team is struggling in Australia, Ramiz pointed out.         
	Former Test batsman Basit Ali went one step further terming the victory as the right answer for someone like Lalit Modi who had been trying to humiliate Pakistan cricket.         
	No matter what he does he should know the base of Pakistan cricket is very strong and we will keep on producing winners, he said. (pti)

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Chris Gayle                                 
	Bangalore: Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain, has praised Sourav Gangulys leadership in the ongoing edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Souravs passion is so obvious... Hes intent on doing a good job... He wants us to do well, too, Gayle told The Telegraph on Friday evening.         
	Gayle added: Souravs hugely experienced and is working towards getting the right formula... Hes dealing with pretty experienced players from overseas and quite a few inexperienced domestic players...         
	The dressing room atmosphere, according to Gayle, was better now as compared to last season. The guys are more relaxed... We get along with one another and theres no animosity... Its a cricket dressing room.         
	A significant observation that.         
	Looking ahead to Saturdays must-win match, against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, Gayle said: Hopefully, it will be our evening.         
	Many would be echoing just that back in Calcutta.

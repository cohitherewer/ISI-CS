            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: It was a golden Wednesday for Indian boxing at the Talkatora Indoor Stadium.         
	With a capacity crowd cheering wildly, the Indians came up with their best-ever show in the boxing ring, winning three gold medals for the first time in the Commonwealth Games history. Before this, India had won only two gold in the Games in 2002 (Ali Qamar) and 2006 (Akhil Kumar).         
	It is the greatest day of my life, an emotional chief coach GS Sandhu said after Paramjeet Samota won the super heavyweight title defeating Tariq Abdul Haq of Trinidad 5-1 in the final bout of the competition.         
	Flyweight boxer Suranjoy Singh was the first to start the golden run as his opponent Benson Njangiru of Kenya did not turn for the fight because of the injury he suffered in the semi-final.         
	The most enjoyable bout of the day, however, was the lightwelter final between Indias Manoj Kumar and Bradley Saunders of England. The English boxer received a huge battering and the crowd went wild. The controversial defeat of Vijender Singh against another England boxer, Anthony Ogogo, was still fresh in the minds of the spectators.         
	Manoj, who won a stunning 11-2 verdict against Saunders, got emotional after the victory. What I have achieved is all because of my brother Mukesh. He has sacrificed everything to make me a boxer.         
	I realised my rival would come for an early attack. Coach (Sandhu) told me that since my defence was good, I should make best use of it. I did exactly that. I never let my guard down and then attacked him whenever there were opportunities, said Manoj.         
	The gold medal also vindicated Manojs position in the team. He suffered an unexpected loss in the nationals semi-final and there were murmurs about his ability to stay in the team. So much so, one of the star boxers in the team even questioned the selection policy that kept Manoj in the Commonwealth squad.         
	But on Wednesday night, Manoj was in awesome form. After conceding an early point, he punched his way to a 4-1 lead in the first round and annexed another four points in the next round. In the end, the Englishman was seen moving around the right to avoid more humiliation.         
	If Manojs victory was overwhelming, the win for Samota was historic. India had always done well in the lower weights but Samota brought back the memories of the time when the great Kaur Singh ruled Asian boxing in the heavyweight.

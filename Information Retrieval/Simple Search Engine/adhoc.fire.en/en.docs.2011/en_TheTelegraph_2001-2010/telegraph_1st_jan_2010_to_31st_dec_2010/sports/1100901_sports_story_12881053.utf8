The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan aim for the right start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan aim for the right start
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Stanley Rozario will be hoping that his boys make a right start against a low-on-confidence Tollygunge Agragami side in their opening encounter of the CFL Premier division on Wednesday. Star striker Edeh Chidi, who is yet to recuperate from viral fever, is unlikely to feature in the starting XI.         
	Its always good if you start off with a convincing win, the coach told the reporters after the training session on the eve of the match.         
	However, Australian defender Okonwo Diamondstar will make his debut in green and maroon jersey. He will have Kingshuk Debnath, Rahul Kumar and Radhakrishnan Dhanarajan for company.         
	Although they will facing a weak team like Tollygunge but it would be interesting to see how the new-look defence perform. While Rahul had earlier played for Bagan, it will be first for Kingshuk and Dhanarajan, both of whom had played a couple of seasons for Chirag United.         
	Bagans man for all seasons Jose Ramirez Barreto and sharpshooter Subair Murithala Ali, will be starting upfront with veteran Ashim Biswas operating from the deep. The midfeld will have young Surabuddin Mullick, captain Ishfaq Ahmed, Jayanta Sen.         
	While Ishfaq will operate from wide left, Jayanta will play in the central midfield. He will be the key man as far as feeding the men upfront is concerned.         
	The Tollygunge side is yet to recover from Ashesh Dass death and four first team players are down with jaundice. Much will depend on how the defence led by Louis Ebami performs under pressure.If Ranjan Chowdhurys boys can steal a point from the green-and-maroon brigade, it will be as good as victory for the minnows.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United looking to keep up tempo
                                                                                                                       7                                        United looking to keep up tempo
  - Chelsea host Villa while Arsenal play Birmingham       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Wayne Rooney                                 
	London: Manchester United have seen and done it all before but the thought of the closing weeks of what promises to be the most tense finale to a Premier League title chase for many years should be enough to get the supporters pulses racing.         
	Manchester United, who lead by a nose from Chelsea and Arsenal, go to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday targeting the first of seven wins that will bring a fourth consecutive title and a record 19th championship in all.         
	Chelsea, who returned to form with a 5-0 rout of Portsmouth in midweek to lie one point behind United, host Aston Villa while Arsenal, two points behind in third spot, travel to Birmingham City.         
	As the finishing line looms on the horizon, the title contenders would each need every ounce of strength to pull in ahead of others.         
	So, it is understandable what Wayne Rooneys presence, or absence, means for the champions title challenge. There were anxieties last week after the talismanic striker appeared to have hurt himself but United manager Alex Ferguson insists Rooney has no injury problems ahead of Saturdays match at Bolton.         
	Rooney had a knee injury earlier this month and looked to be limping heavily as he left Old Trafford following Sundays 2-1 win over Liverpool.         
	But Ferguson said: Hes okay, theres no problem. He had some bad bruising for a couple of weeks but hes played (since then) and theres no problems with the knee.         
	United could be down to third in the table by the time they kick-off against Bolton as Chelsea and Arsenal play earlier in the day.         
	And while Chelsea suffered a minor blip with two dropped points at Blackburn, Ferguson expects a tight three-way run-in to the end of the season.         
	Arsenal, currently two points off United in third place, may have an easier fixture run-in compared to United and Chelsea, but Ferguson does not feel it will play a major role in deciding the Premier League title race.         
	Ferguson, whose team have won their last six matches, however, still feels that Chelsea, visitors to Old Trafford in April, are as much of a threat to Uniteds hopes of a fourth straight title as Arsenal.         
	On paper Arsenal have the easy run in but at this stage of the season Im not sure whether that works, whether it means anything at all, Ferguson said. The name of the game is to win your games and hopefully we can do that. Thats our best way of looking forward.         
	Uniteds lead over Chelsea, who visit Old Trafford next weekend, is wafer thin especially as Carlo Ancelottis side matched the leaders on goal difference at Fratton Park on Wednesday.         
	Those who wrote off Chelseas chances last week when they dropped points at Blackburn Rovers have suddenly gone quiet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have to lift our game: Bierhoff
                                                                                                                       7                                      Have to lift our game: Bierhoff
                      
	Erasmia: Germany manager Oliver Bierhoff has called on his careless team to move up a notch in their next World Cup match against Serbia despite being hailed as the most impressive team early in the tournament. The Germans crushed Australia 4-0 on Sunday in Durban but Bierhoff was still not satisfied as they took early control of Group D.         
	It would be wrong to rest on our achievements against Australia and I am sure we will lift our performance up a notch against Serbia. We just have to, the former Germany striker said ahead of their next Group D match on Friday.         
	We have to improve our conversion of chances. There was some carelessness there (against Australia), he said on Thursday. We have to be precise and unforgiving when our opponent offers us the chance.         
	Germany did squander some good opportunities to add to their goal tally against Australia but their overall performance won them widespread praise and earned their young squad much-needed respect. Bierhoff, however, warned his players not to be complacent. We do feel this euphoria but we have not achieved anything yet, he said. We do not want to have our third game against Ghana turn into a knockout game. We want to avoid that, Bierhoff said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL council   to meet tomorrow
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has convened a meeting of its governing council here on Wednesday to discuss and finalise operational aspects of the T20 leagues fourth edition next year.         
	IPL 4 is a reality. There is a lot of operational aspects that have to be decided, BCCI secretary N.Srinivasan told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	The issue of Kochi franchise is unlikely to be discussed as the consortium of investors have been given a 30-day notice, the deadline for which ends on November 27.         
	No, not to my knowledge, Srinivasan said, when asked if the Kochi franchise has replied to the notice so far.         
	Instead, the meeting could review recent decisions regarding the number of matches and player retention, which might have to be looked afresh in the wake of the scrapping of Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Sukhi upbeat despite setbacks 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A second string India will start their campaign in the AFC Challenge Cup on Wednesday when they take on Kyrgyzstan at the Sugathdash Stadium in Colombo.         
	India are treating the tournament as a launching pad for their second line players. While the first team is training under Bob Houghton in Dubai, Sukhwinder Singh has been given the charge to shape to the juniors.         
	The Colombo assignment could be a tougher one as India are placed in a strong group along with Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and World Cup qualifiers North Korea.         
	To add to Sukhwinders woes, goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya and defender Mohanraj are now in Houghtons team, while Baldeep Singh and Manish Mathani are injured.         
	Yet, Sukhwinder said his team was capable of performing a miracle. No one gave us a chance in Dhaka but we proved them wrong. We are capable of repeating the performance, he said.         
	The likely India XI: Karanjit Singh; Denzil Ferrao, Rowilson Rodrigues, D. Ravanan and Robert Lalthlamuana; Joaquim Abranches, Sheikh Jewel Raja, Baljit Sahni and Jibon Singh; Jeje Lalpekhlua and Sushil Singh (captain).

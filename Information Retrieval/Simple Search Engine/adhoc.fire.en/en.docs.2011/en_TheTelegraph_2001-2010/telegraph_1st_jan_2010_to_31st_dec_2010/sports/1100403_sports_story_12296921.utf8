                                                                                                                       7                                      Multiple entry visas likely, says Pawar
    - All supporters, except those from Pak, eligible                           
	Colombo: The International Cricket Council World Cup Central Organising Committee (COC) is contemplating issuing multiple entry visas to cricket fans, except from Pakistan, for watching matches in India during the quadrennial event next year.         
	The COC discussed the possibility of visa variations for supporters entering India to watch the 2011 World Cup, Sharad Pawar, the COC chairman, said here Friday.         
	At present only single entry visas are permitted for tourists to India, but all supporters, except those from Pakistan, holding valid match tickets, is expected to be allowed multiple entry visas, he added.         
	Pawar expressed satisfaction at the preparation of the 2011 event, which will be co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	I am sure that the thousands of spectators from Sri Lanka and around the world will be extremely impressed by the new venues, not just in Sri Lanka, but also in India and Bangladesh.         
	The reports we have received of the progress are extremely positive, Pawar said while unveiling plans to launch the logos and tickets for the Cup.         
	Haroon Lorgat, the ICC chief executive officer, said that the World Cup is expected to cost over $100million and the online bookings would be made available for easy availability of tickets.         
	The organisers of the World Cup also assured that the tickets for the event will be reasonably priced to enable more people to watch the matches.         
	These stadiums will produce a real legacy for cricket in South Asia and I am sure that cricket lovers, who travel to the three countries, will be impressed by the quality of the venues as well as the affordable and accessible tickets, said Pawar, who is also the ICC vice-president.         
	Pawar said Sri Lanka, like India and Bangladesh, are known for their warmth and hospitality.         
	I am sure that will make the 2011 World Cup an event to remember. I would like to personally thank Sri Lanka Cricket for the hospitality they have shown to the COC at this meeting and the arrangements that they have put in place, he said.

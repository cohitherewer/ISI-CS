The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies win World Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies win World Cup

	New Delhi: Ric Charlesworths smile said it all. Last year, hockey officials in Delhi had hounded the Australian legend out saying he was no good as coach, apart from levelling all sorts of wild allegations against him. On Saturday, Charlesworth emerged triumphant in the same city with Australia winning the Hero Honda hockey World Cup, defeating Germany 2-1 in the final.         
	This was Australias second world title, the last was in 1986, under Charlesworths captaincy. It was also sweet revenge for the Aussies as it was Germany that had beaten them in the finals of the last two World Cups.         
	I am naturally happy to become the first person to win the World Cup both as captain and coach, said Charlesworth. I worked hard with the team for the last few months.         
	If it was the coach who chalked out the plan to disrupt Germanys natural, free flowing game, Luke Doerners cracking penalty corner in the 60th minute made all the difference.         
	For the third-place match, the Netherlands emerged victorious with a 4-3 win over England. Veteran Dutch keeper Guus Vogels was named player of the tournament.

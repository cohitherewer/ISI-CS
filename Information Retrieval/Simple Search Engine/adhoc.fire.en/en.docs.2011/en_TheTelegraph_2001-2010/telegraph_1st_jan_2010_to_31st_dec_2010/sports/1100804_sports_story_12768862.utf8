                                                                                                                       7                                        Somdev wants to be consistent
            OUR BUREAU            Somdev Dev Varman                           
	Indian tennis fans may rejoice at Somdev Dev Varmans feat of entering the top-100 of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) singles rankings list on Monday, but there may be disappointments in the near future.         
	Somdev in an interview to The Telegraph on Tuesday spoke about his goals and that he was yet to confirm his participation for the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October and the Asian Games in China in November.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	First thoughts on breaking into the top-100         
	I have worked really hard to get here, so Im really glad I finally cracked the top-100. I am grateful to all the people who have helped me get so far. Ive consistently been having strong results this year.         
	If there is any pressure being one of the few Indians to be ranked within the top-100         
	Absolutely not. I dont really pay attention to all that history much. Im very respectful of all the past accomplishments but I try to stay focussed as much as possible. I try to keep working on my game for further improvements.         
	The goal now         
	The tough part is just about to start. I have to be more consistent with my game to stay at this level. If I play well, Im confident Ill be able to do that, and better this year. (He lost in the final qualifying round of the ATP Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, on Monday, which will cost him precious ranking points)         
	Importance of rankings         
	Well theyre important to get into a lot of the tour events. Being in the main draws of tour events makes a big difference because you get an opportunity to play against the best players in the world without being tired after the qualifying matches. So rankings help a lot.         
	The difference in comparison to last year         
	Ive learned a lot over the past year on tour. I have matured as a player and my new coach (Scott McCain) has helped me. Were trying to make the best of every situation.         
	The crucial two weeks in February         
	I feel the tournaments in Johannesburg (where he lost to David Ferrer in the quarter finals) and Dubai (where he went down to Marcos Baghdatis in the pre-quarters) were two big weeks for me. I really started believing then and henceforth, have had some really solid results.         
	His experiences playing against top players         
	I really enjoy watching their routines on and off the court. One can really learn a lot just by being attentive on tour.         
	Making it to the French Open main draw         
	I really enjoy playing on clay but my favourite surface is definitely the hard court. I have had some good results on clay but my better results have definitely come on hard court.         
	On the Commonwealth and the Asian Games         
	I have not yet confirmed my participation for the Commonwealth Games or the Asian Games. I will take that decision soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Joshimar sizzles, and then fumes

            A STAFF REPORTER            Joshimar at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Skipper Joshimar had every reason to feel angry after Chirag United Monday thrashed Calcutta Customs 7-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium. It is not every day that a player scores four goals only for the adjudicators to name someone else the Man of the Match.         
	Former players Prashanta Chakraborty and Nikhil Nandys decision to name Lalkamal Bhowmick the Man of the Match seems baffling after the Brazilian striker scored consecutive hattricks in the local league. It would have been fairer had Gouranga Biswas, who scored one and had at least three assists, got the award.         
	Barreto score one goal. He Man of the Match. Bhaichung score one goal, he Man of the Match. I score four and no Man of the Match. (Is there) Any problem? an agitated Joshimar wondered in his broken English, with the help of team physio Garcia.         
	Mondays result was the biggest margin of victory in this years local league, taking Chirags tally to 30 points from 12 matches  two behind leaders Mohun Bagan. Joshimars tally in the local league is now 12 goals.         
	It was like a walk in the park for Chirag against a Customs side languishing at the bottom with nine points from 14 matches.         
	Chirag went ahead in the 14th minute when Gouranga, after latching onto a Lalkamal pass, dodged a defender before placing it past goalkeeper Proloy Saha. In a couple of minutes, Joshmar got his name on the scoresheet when he rounded the goalie before slotting after receiving a long ball from Kingshuk Debnath.         
	Chirag made it 3-0 in the 40th minute when Lalkamal chipped from the right wing for the ball to be followed by Gouranga. It looked like Gouranga had the last touch but the goal was awarded to Lalkamal. Leading 3-0 at the break, Chirag made it 4-0 when Soumik Chakraborty deflected home a low centre from Sukhen Dey in the 47th minute.         
	Joshimars second and the teams fifth came in the 61st minute and was a tap in from a rebound after his first shot had hit the post. He completed his hattrick in the 77th minute with a left-footer after Gouranga had pulled back the ball for him. The Gouranga-Joshimar combination got the seventh goal when the Brazilian tapped home a centre.

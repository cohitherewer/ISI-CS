	New Delhi: World champion Tom Daley on Wednesday won the Commonwealth Games 10m platform diving title with a narrow victory over Australian Olympic champion Matthew Mitcham.         
	The English 16-year-old overcame a triceps injury he sustained in August to win gold with 538.35 points, beating Mitcham by a margin of 29.20. The win handed Daley his second gold medal of the 2010 Games, having won 10m synchro gold with Max Brick on Tuesday.         
	Malaysias Bryan Nickson Lomas won bronze while Brick came eighth.         
	In womens hockey final, Australia defended their crown, defeating a spirited New Zealand 6-4 via the tie-breaker.         
	New Zealand showed great fighting spirit and came back twice from a goal down to deny title holders Australia victory in regulation time.         
	However, in the shoot-out, Australia converted four out of their five strokes, while the Kiwis could score only from two.         
	The teams were locked 2-2 at the end of full-time, and even extra-time failed to break the deadlock. Nicole Jessica Arrold (9th minute) and Nelson (59th) scored for Australia while New Zealand levelled the scores twice through Samantha Harrison (48th) and Clarissa Eshuis (70th).         
	In boxing, Sri Lanka clinched their first boxing gold medal since 1938 through Manju Wanniarachchi. The 31-year-old Wanniarachchi defeated Welshman Sean McGoldrick on countback after being tied 7-7 with him in the bantamweight 56kg finals.         
	It was also a historic day for Northern Ireland in the boxing ring, which clinched four gold medals to leave traditional powerhouse England with just a single gold medal in the event.

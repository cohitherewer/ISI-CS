            A STAFF REPORTER            Ikene Ekenwa of East Bengal tries to get past Sudip Santra of BNR, during their CFL Premier Division match, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan could only smile when he was told that his BNR counterpart T.B. Roychowdhury rated his teams performance as Perfect 10 after the red and gold won 4-1 against the railwaymen, in a CFL Premier Division match on Thursday.         
	Its kind of him to say so but I dont agree, the soft-spoken former coach of the Hull City Development squad said in the post-match conference.         
	However, after completing a hattrick of wins, one can safely conclude that East Bengal are on the right direction and have looked the best among the Big Four.         
	After Ikene Ekenwa provided the lead as early as in the fifth minute, BNR came back strongly to equalise within a couple of minutes  courtesy a bloomer from veteran goalkeeper Sandip Nandy. However, Morgans boys kept up the pressure and scored three more with effortless ease to wrap up the match in style.         
	If one goes by the scoreline, it may appear as if BNR were outplayed on the day, but they definitely put up a fight before going down. BNR played well in patches but East Bengal were superior on the day. Be it in attack or defence, the boys in red-and-gold performed commendably on the day.         
	Especially, the midfield which has been key to East Bengals victories in all three matches. On the day, it was Naoba Singh whose incisive runs down the right created terror in the opposition defence. One such delivery in the fifth minute saw Ikenes powerful nod enter the net.         
	BNRs Michael Dkuludihs innocuous right footer within two minutes brought the equaliser as Nandy let it slip from his grip.         
	He made amends with a fantastic tip-over in the 12th minute to thwart a Prince James acrobatic effort. It was Naoba who was instrumental in East Bengal getting their second goal in the 34th minute.         
	He again sprinted down wide right and his cross was headed by Ikene, which was saved by goalkeeper Santosh Goswami. Reisangmi Vashum scored off rebound. Within another six minutes, East Bengal got their third goal. Nirmal Chetris long ball found Ikene who beat an off-side trap set by BNRs back-four and scored without any resistance.         
	In the second half, it was Mehtabs weak 25-yard shot in the 58th minute that made it 4-1 for the winners. Naoba was declared Man of the Match.

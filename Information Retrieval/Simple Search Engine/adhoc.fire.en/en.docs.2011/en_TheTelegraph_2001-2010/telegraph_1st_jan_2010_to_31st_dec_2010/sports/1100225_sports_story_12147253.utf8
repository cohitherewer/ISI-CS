	Stuttgart: Zlatan Ibrahimovics goal gave Barcelona a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart in the round-of-16 match in the Champions League on Tuesday.         
	The defending champions fell behind in the 25th minute of the opening leg to Stuttgart striker Cacaus goal amid strong pressure from the hosts.         
	Ibrahimovic equalised in the 52nd minute, slotting in from close after goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had saved his first attempt.         
	In the days other match, Girondins Bordeaux stayed on course for what would be a quarter final place for the first time after Michael Cianis first-half header earned Laurent Blancs side a 1-0 victory at Olympiakos Piraeus.         
	Bordeaux, who amassed more points than any other team in the group stage, soaked up late pressure and were good value for a last 16 first-leg win that makes them favourites to progress ahead of the return at the Stade Chaban-Delmas on March 17.         
	The home sides best chance came with just under 10 minutes lift when Matt Derbyshire and Lomana Lua Lua combined but the latters shot was tipped around the post by visiting goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso.         
	There was little evidence of the attacking flair that characterised Bordeauxs group stage campaign early on, with Fernandos fierce long-range drive after 26 minutes the only time home keeper Antonis Nikopolidis had to make a save.         
	Both teams were allowing errors to creep into their play as the half drew to a close but, just when it seemed they would go in level at the break, Bordeaux central defender Ciani stole in front of the Olympiakos defence to nod home Yoann Gourcuffs left-wing free-kick and give the visitors the lead.         
	We have to do better, play the way we are capable of, but dont forget that in European competition you are facing very good teams, said Barca coach Pep Guardiola. Europe is very tough, very difficult and very demanding.         
	Stuttgart outplayed Barcelona in the first half but the visiting team came back strongly after the break.         
	They had the possession, we had the chances, Stuttgart coach Christian Gross summed up after the match.         
	Ibrahimovic and midfielder Xavi Hernandez were included in Barcelonas starting line-up despite being in doubt due to injury.         
	Cacau, coming off a four-goal performance in the Bundesliga in Stuttgarts 5-1 win over FC Cologne, mistimed a shot early in the game while in a good position.         
	Stuttgart stepped up the pressure and Cacau soon found the target, rising over Barcelona defender Carles Puyol at the far post to head Timo Gebharts cross into the roof of the net.         
	Cacau and Stuttgart midfielder Sami Khedira then wasted another chance, both hesitated too long to allow Puyol to make a sliding clearance.         
	Stuttgart kept up the tempo for Cacau to break down the left flank, but his shot was stopped by goalkeeper Victor Valdes.         
	Barcelona finally threatened in the 40th minute when Lionel Messi shot from 20 metres. Lehmann dived to his left to parry the shot and the ball bounced off the post and back into the goalkeepers hands.         
	Stuttgart replied quickly with Valdes foiling striker Pavel Pogrebnyak soon after. The Germans pulled back somewhat in the second half and Barcelona used that space to equalise. Defender Gerard Pique headed down a long ball to Ibrahimovic, whose first attempt was blocked by Lehmann. The striker put the rebound back into the net.         
	It was a very intense game, Khedira said. We went into the match highly motivated, playing against probably the best team in the world. We had the better chances in the first half but then we conceded the goal too early in the second.         
	Khedira had a shot that went wide in the 63rd. Ibrahimovic then nearly put Barcelona ahead after Lehmann fumbled a corner delivered by Xavi, but Cristian Molinaro cleared on the line with his shoulder.         
	Valdes then made a risky diving save to deny Ciprian Marica, who had come on for Pogrebnyak.         
	Its a pity. We could have beaten Barcelona today, Lehmann said. The second leg is on March 17. (AGENCIES)

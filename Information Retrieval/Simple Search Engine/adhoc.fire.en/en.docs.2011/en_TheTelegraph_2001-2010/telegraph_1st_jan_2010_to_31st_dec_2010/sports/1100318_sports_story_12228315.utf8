The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shane inspires Avishek
                                                                                                                       7                                        Shane inspires Avishek
            A STAFF REPORTER            Avishek Jhunjhunwala                           
	Calcutta: His comeback season in first-class cricket hasnt been that smooth. But talented Bengal batsman Avishek Jhunjhunwala feels that playing for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League will be an ideal platform which will help him to get back the touch that deserted him during the first-class and one-day matches this season.         
	Its satisfying to get runs at this level. But I still feel that I should have got at least 10 to 15 runs more than my unbeaten 45-ball 53 against the Delhi DareDevils, Jhunjhunwala told The Telegraph from Bangalore.         
	He agreed that his performance was a bit patchy during the Ranji Trophy but once he played well in the Rajasthan Royals practice games, he caught the attention of none other than Shane Warne.         
	I was a bit apprehensive about my form during the domestic season. But in the run-up to the IPL, we played a few practice matches and I scored in almost all the matches. So when I was inducted into the first XI, I wasnt really nervous, Jhunjhunwala said.         
	However, he is indebted to Warne for his valuable advice.         
	Shane is so methodical in his approach when he interacts with the players. Personally, I have been immensely benefited from whatever he has told me.         
	Anything specific? Yes, just never try to replicate Yusuf Pathan, he laughed. Shane told me that I cant hit sixes like Yusuf so theres no point in doing so. Instead, if my forte is to find the gaps and hit boundaries, I must try and hit two boundaries rather than two sixes.         
	Also, I shouldnt try and play unnecessary innovative shots. I should stick to playing proper cricketing shots. Innovative shots for just the sake of it doesnt really help, said Jhunjhunwala.         
	The 27-year-old was also moved by the amount of support the team is getting from Shilpa Shetty. We keep meeting Shilpa at parties. She always has encouraging words for the players.         
	Jhunjhunwala laments joining the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) where he lost out on two seasons. I lost two years of active cricket. I was in good form when I decided to join the ICL... Suddenly, I wasnt playing cricket.         
	So does he realise the difference in standard? Oh yes. You cant compare the two. This is as good as international cricket where each and every run scored and each and every wicket taken counts.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Harbhajan Singh (from left), Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga and Saurabh Tiwary celebrate the fall of a wicket, in Mumbai, on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Its not often that Sachin Tendulkar scores a stroke-filled half-century and gets out-shone by a tailender. Harbhajan Singh did exactly that on Sunday, and all for a happy cause as the Mumbai Indians crushed the Deccan Chargers by 41 runs to record their fifth win in the tournament.         
	That Harbhajan could wield the willow to such deadly effect is already well known. Not long ago, he had played a blistering knock against Australia in a one-day International in Vadodara in October last year. But this was probably the first time that he had played a match-winning role as a batsman.         
	Bhajji hit a hurricane 49, the same score he had made against Ricky Pontings team but ended up on the losing side, with eight fours and two sixes to help the Mumbai side post 172 for seven, a formidable total on a sporting pitch at the DY Patil Stadium.         
	His 18-ball knock that consumed 16 minutes swung the momentum away from the Chargers who had reduced the Mumbai Indians to 119 for seven by the 17th over.         
	He then returned to take three for 31 to spearhead the Chargers collapse as they folded for 131 in 17.4 overs.         
	Harbhajan began with a six and a four off his nemesis Andrew Symonds but, as it turned out, it was only an appetiser before the main course.         
	He welcomed Kemar Roach, with a four and followed it up with a heave over mid-wicket that had brilliant timing written all over it. Two more fours and by the time the West Indian finished, his miserly third over, in which he conceded just three runs, had been forgotten as a dream.         
	The power hitting seemed to have charged up Jaskaran Singh of the Chargers. But the youngster seemed to be overwhelmed by his emotions and after delivering two successive beamers was taken off the attack.         
	Harbhajan had already turned the second beamer to fine-leg fence, and when Rohit Sharma came on to complete the over, he piled on the misery with three successive fours.         
	He narrowly missed one of the fastest fifties by a whisker when Rohit beat him with a quicker one off the last ball.         
	As it were, 53 runs came from his unbroken eighth wicket partnership with Ryan McLaren and the last four overs produced 62 runs for Mumbai. That innings over-shadowed Tendulkars composed 55 off 43 balls.         
	The premier batsman was forced to play a subdued innings due to a middle-order collapse in which five wickets fell for 29 runs.         
	However, Tendulkars fourth half-century, and third on the trot, comprised some elegant drives that he had been playing this season.         
	Back to Harbhajan! Twenty minutes later, the off-spinner was in the thick of action, this time in his more familiar role, with the ball.         
	Sensing that the Harbhajan was in the mood for a contest, Tendulkar asked him to open the bowling. And with an Australian, Adam Gilchrist, at the crease, the offie needed no invitation.         
	After pushing the first ball to on side, Gilchrist tried to tap the next to third man. But, to his horror, he found Tendulkar coming up with a low reflex catch.         
	Unfortunately for the India player, the second Aussie in the Chargers line-up, Symonds, was consumed by Lasith Malinga.         
	But Harbhajan accounted for a dangerous looking T Suman and Jaskaran to sniff out any life left in the Chargers.         
	Rohit (45) tried to wage a lone battle but the task proved to be too much for him.

	Chennai: Sachin Tendulkars (45) retirement due to dehydration led to a sensational batting collapse as the Chennai Super Kings thrashed the Mumbai Indians by 24 runs in an Indian Premier League match here Tuesday.         
	Chasing 166, the Mumbai Indians were cruising along before Tendulkar left the field in the ninth over at 62 for one after making a 36 off 28 balls, which contained six fours.         
	But once he left, the visitors lost their way with wickets falling like nine pins and could make just 141 for nine in 20 overs as their five-match winning streak was snapped at the packed M. A. Chidambaram Stadium.         
	Chennai produced a superb bowling and fielding display and turned on the heat once Tendulkar left the field.         
	All the CSK bowlers took wickets with Thilan Thusara and Ramachandran Ashwin being the most successful with two wickets apiece by conceding 16 and 22 runs, respectively.         
	Sudeep Tyagi, Doug Bollinger, Shadab Jakati and Suresh Raina chipped in with a wicket each.         
	Their fielding was also spot on with some fine catches, especially those by Thusara and Murali Vijay.         
	Earlier electing to bat, CSK made 165 for four with Matthew Hayden top-scoring with a 31-ball 35. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (31 off 18 balls) and Subramaniam Badrinath (30 not out off 22 balls) also made useful contributions.                     
	With this win, their third on the trot, CSK are now at fourth spot with 10 points in 10 matches while the Mumbai Indians retained the top spot with 14 points from nine matches.         
	Except for 45 by Tendulkar, who could add just nine runs after his return in the 15th over, and a late flourish of 33 off 23 balls by Harbhajan Singh, the remaining Mumbai Indians batsmen came a cropper with five of them failing to reach double figures.         
	From 62 for one when Tendulkar left at the end of ninth over and till he returned (89 for seven), the Mumbai Indians lost six wickets in 5.3 overs with the addition of just of 27 runs.         
	His 35-ball 54 contained six fours.         
	Harbhajan Singh made a late charge scoring a but it was too little too late as Mumbai Indians could score just 141 for nine.         
	Mumbai made a steady start with Tendulkar continuing his sparkling form and finding boundaries at regular intervals.         
	But once the Mumbai Indians captain left the field in the ninth over, the visitors simply crumbled. From 66 for one just before wicket-keeper batsman Ambati Rayudu was out in 9.5 overs, Mumbai were reduced to 89 for seven in 14.2 overs. They lost five wickets in the space 27 balls and addition of 23 runs.         
	Rayudu fell five balls after Tendulkar left the field as he was foxed by a Suresh Raina delivery and Dhoni affected an easy stumping.         
	With the asking rate over 10, Dwayne Bravo tried to force the pace but perished in the fourth ball he faced holing out to Thusara while trying to hoist Tyagi for just two. By then, Mumbai were 69 for three.         
	Saurabh Tiwary, who has been consistent in the tournament, did not last long as he holed out to Matthew Hayden while trying a slog sweep off Jakati in the 12th over.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Mumbai Indians Bindras choice
  - Sachins the captain and my favourite cricketer       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhinav Bindra                            
	Chandigarh: The Mumbai Indians happen to be Abhinav Bindras favourite team in the IPL and hes quite a fan of Sourav Ganguly, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain. On Saturday, however, he was rooting for the Kings XI Punjab.         
	Look, I didnt have much of a choice, as Id been invited to Mohali by friends associated with the Kings XI... In the circumstances, I had to cheer the local team, Abhinav, Indias only individual gold medallist in the Olympics, told The Telegraph.         
	By the way, hes also the world champion in the 10m rifle event.         
	Asked why the Mumbai Indians were his favourite, Abhinav replied laughing: Because of Sachin Tendulkar... Hes the captain and my favourite cricketer. Theres no other reason, really...         
	Abhinav is just back from training in Europe and will return there after a week or so. Besides training, Ill be competing in an event in Hanover...         
	Frustrated with the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI)s shoddy behaviour towards him, Abhinav almost quit two months ago. The core issue, though, still hasnt been settled.         
	Look, Im pretty detached from the whole thing... I dont, of course, know how Ill be returning to the India team... Im doing what I should be doing and Im enjoying the process, Abhinav signed off.         
	The good news is that the icon appears to be at peace with himself and, so, can focus on the goals ahead.         
	As for the NRAI, its time it got its act  and behaviour  right.

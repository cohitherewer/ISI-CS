                  Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes during a news conference, in Chennai, on Wednesday                     
	Chennai: Indias non-playing Davis Cup captain S.P. Misra is of the view that rankings are of no importance in Davis Cup.         
	Asked whether it will tough for the Indians, especially in the singles ties, against the much higher-ranked Brazilians, Misra said that his team will benefit from the home conditions and that rankings wont be a problem.         
	We have the home advantage and our players are used to playing here and they should perform well. In Davis Cup, ranking does not matter, he asserted.         
	He said a 2-0 verdict on the first day would be a dream and the Indians would try hard to achieve that.         
	We have to win at least one, if not both matches at the end of the first day.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi practised at centre court for more than 90 minutes with doubles partner Leander Paes, against the duo of Somdev Dev Varman and Rohan Bopanna on Wednesday. Earlier, the four practised at the side courts for about two hours.         
	Asked about Indias chances in the tie, Bhupathi said it would be 50-50.         
	We are back in Chennai. We are very excited about playing here having come back in the World Group. As for the chances, it is going to be 50-50 for us. Our players are playing well and are geared up for the matches, Bhupathi said.         
	Paes said that the environment that surrounds Davis Cup is phenomenal, especially considering that tennis is an individual sport.         
	Our team members are fantastic. The camaraderie has been excellent. At the end of the day, we represent India The responsibility also gives us great energy. It takes us to greater heights, he said.         
	Speaking to reporters, Brazil team captain Joao Zwetsch said though the Indians have the home advantage, the visitors are well prepared and have got acclimatised to conditions.         
	We expect a close finish on all three days. We know India is a strong team. But we are preparing hard.We are happy about our preparation for the important tie. All our players are in good shape.         
	We are ready to break the jinx of having missed out on chances since 2003. We have to be ready for taking our chances and not missing them, Zwetsch said.         
	Having higher-ranked singles players Thomas Bellucci and Ricardo Mello was a positive point in their favour, Zwetsch said.         
	He also added that each match would be an emotional game.         
	We have to convert our superior rankings on court and win the matches to be in the World Group, he said.         
	Bellucci rejected suggestions that the Indians have an edge on hardcourts and said that Brazil favour clay surfaces for their matches.         
	We have, in the last three years and particularly this season, won many matches on hardcourts. I have got good results and hope we play good on this hardcourt here, Bellucci said.         
	Asked whether the hardcourt in Chennai was slower, Swetsch said it was similar to the US Open court.         
	Our stars mostly are baseline players and they are comfortable playing here They have adjusted well to the conditions, he said.           (AGENCIES)

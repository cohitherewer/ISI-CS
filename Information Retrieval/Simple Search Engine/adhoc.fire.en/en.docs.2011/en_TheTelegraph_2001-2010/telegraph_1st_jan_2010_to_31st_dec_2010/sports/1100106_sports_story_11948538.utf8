The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough for bowlers in these conditions, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tough for bowlers in these conditions, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni feels that the dew was the decisive factor during his teams five-wicket loss to Sri Lanka in Mirpur on Tuesday. Although his side scored a decent 279, it was young all-rounder Thissara Perera whose 36 off 15 deliveries took the game away from the Indians .         
	However, one cant take away the credit from Thilan Samareweera, who scored an unbeaten 105  his second ODI century.         
	It was Ashish Nehras seventh and the 46th over of the Sri Lankan innings that tilted the scales in favour of the islanders. The left-arm pacer gave away 18 runs including two fours and a six.         
	Nehra, who had bowled a very decent first six overs ended with figures of none for 55 in eight overs. If there was something positive from Indias performance then it was a solid knock of 74 by Yuvraj Singh, who came back from a finger injury, and Harbhajan Singh who scalped three for 47 in 10 overs.         
	Harbhajans effort was laudable considering the fact that ball was getting wet and it was difficult to grip the ball.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Kumar Sangakkara: There was a bit of pressure once Kandamby and I were out. But it was a magnificent effort from Perera during the Powerplay. All credit to Sammy (Samaraweera) for the way he batted. It was a superb effort from him. When we started out in the morning, it was like, here we go again.         
	But Welegedara bowled brilliantly to bring us back into the match. Suraj Randiv also bowled well. I also feel that our fielding was much better on the day. But we still have some work to do as far as bowling during Powerplays are concerned.         
	The best part about our performance was the attitude of the boys. Everyone is showing the urge to do something and prove that they belong to this level. They seem to be enjoying it out there... We have suffered a lot due to injuries during our recent tour of India.         
	Even here, off-spinner Muthumudalige Pushpakumara is going back due to a shoulder injury. Still we will have to continue doing the basics right.         
	The idea would be to go out there everyday and maintain the intensity of our performance.         
	Dhoni: It is really difficult to defend a total like 280-290 during a day/night match. The ball doesnt do anything after the first 10 overs due to the dew factor. There is no reverse swing or spin... Still, I am proud of the effort put in by our bowlers.         
	I still dont know if we have any solution to the problems arising due to the dew. May be an early start. The ball change is something that doesnt work.         
	It remains okay for the first two overs, but after sometime it starts getting wet. The ball tends to slip out of the bowlers hands. They cant bowl yorkers at the death.         
	Still there were some positives that came out of this match. Yuvraj batted really well. Though Gauti (Gautam Gambhir) got out early, still we managed a good start. We kept losing wickets but reached 279.         
	Thilan Samaraweera (Man of the Match): I am definitely satisfied with this performance. It was easy to bat due to the dew factor. I knew that if we have a good partnership then things would be easier. Kumar and I did exactly that.         
	The ball was nicely coming on to the bat During a change of ball, it was not coming on well but that was only for three/four overs... This was my second ODI century but there was a bit more pressure this time.         
	But I always knew that during the Powerplays, we could score 50-60 runs. I was keen to make use of the opportunities that I got.         
	In India, the top-three really played well and then Mahela (Jayawardene) batted at No. 4. Here, I got the opportunity as Mahela is not playing. I got a lot of confidence from Mondays game against Bangladesh (41 not out).

	Guwahati: Sharath Kamal of the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) retained the mens singles title while teammate Poulami Ghatak regained the womens singles crown as the 71st Senior national and Inter-State Table Tennis Championship concluded Tuesday.         
	While Poulami overcame a stiff challenge from defending champion K. Shamini, also of PSPB, for a 6-11, 11-5, 11-13, 7-11, 11-6, 7-11, 11-9 victory Kamal had a comparatively easier 11-3, 11-8, 7-11, 11-8, 11-9 win against fellow PSPB player Sourav Chakraborty.         
	It was more than a satisfying victory for Poulami. A great moment for me because I have overcome a bad start to the year. I dont know why, but I was craving for the title this time and came into the match to give my 100 per cent, which I did, Poulami was gushing. It is her sixth singles crown overall, the last title coming at the Siliguri nationals.         
	She, however, admitted: It was the worst match I have ever played. I conceded a lot of negative points.         
	Poulami dedicated the title to her family and to her fiance, Soumyadeep Roy.         
	With this win, Kamal claimed his fourth straight title and the fifth of his career. It is the fifth in my career but feels like the first one. I didnt do anything special here, he remarked after the match.         
	Kamal, however, admitted that he had a tougher match against his doubles partner Subhajit Saha in Mondays semi-final.         
	In the doubles finals played Monday night, the Bengal duo of Sourav Chakraborty and Anirban Nandi annexed the mens title while Chakrabortys mixed doubles team-up with Mouma Das finished runners-up.         
	In the mens doubles final, Chakraborty and Nandi beat Soumyadeep Roy and Zubin Kumar of PSPB 11-8, 11-9, 5-11, 11-2 while in mixed doubles, Chakraborty and Das went down to the PSPB pair of Subhajit Saha and Nandita Saha 11-9, 7-11, 9-11, 7-11.         
	Madhurika Patkar and K. Shamini of PSPB fended off a strong challenge from fellow PSPB girls Pooja Sahasrabudhe and Divya Deshpande to clinch the womens doubles title. They won 11-8, 5-11, 9-11, 11-7, 11-6 in the final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mixed luck for Paes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mixed luck for Paes
                      
	Paris: Defending champions Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy remained on course for a second successive French Open title by advancing to the semi-finals of the mens doubles with a straight-sets win here Tuesday.         
	The third-seeded Indo-Czech pair defeated eighth seeds Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski of Poland 6-1, 6-3.         
	However, Paes was unlucky in the mixed doubles as partnering Cara Black, the Indo-Zimbabwean duo lost to Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan and Austrian Julian Knowle 3-6, 7-6 (2) 7-10 in the quarter finals.         
	Paes and Dlouhy will now take on the winners of the match between Brazilian duo of Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares and 10th seeded Austrian-Israeli pair of Julian Knowle and Andy Ram.

  - Woods will be determined to prove hes still the No.1: Montgomerie       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Tiger Woods                                 
	Orlando: Tiger Woods will speak before he plays in the Masters.         
	Woods is scheduled to hold his first press meet in nearly five months at 2pm on Monday, April 5, according to a tentative interview schedule that Augusta National released Wednesday.         
	It will be his first press meet in nearly five months, and will be the first time that he will be facing a room full of reporters since he crashed his SUV into a tree on November 27, which set off shocking revelations of his rampant infidelity.         
	The Masters only recently began conducting a press meet on Monday of tournament week, usually a player with only moderate news interest because most of the media isnt there yet.         
	Woods is the only player scheduled for an interview that day. Given the sensational nature of his downfall, what he says could trump the NCAA basketball championship game held later that night.         
	The last time Woods held a press meet was on November 15 after he won the Australian Masters in Melbourne for his 82nd career victory.         
	Woods typically has his press meet at the Majors on Tuesday.         
	Among those scheduled to speak the day after Woods are Phil Mickelson, Geoff Ogilvy and Jack Nicklaus.         
	Meanwhile, Colin Montgomerie, who has enough experience of barbs from American golf galleries to make Woodss predicament look like a playground tiff, feels he would make the perfect playing companion of Woods in what will be the most-watched threeball ever seen at Augusta, starting on April 8.         
	I would volunteer, said Montgomerie Wednesday, even though Europes Ryder Cup captain has not qualified for the Masters. I think it would be very exciting.         
	He has said that hes nervous to come back, and thats the first time Ive ever heard Tiger say those words, Montgomerie said.         
	Its shrewd what he has done to come back in the most controlled atmosphere possible.         
	Ive played the Masters a number of times myself, and I understand that its a very controlled environment. There are no cameras allowed within the ropes. You see nothing bar your opponent and caddie, and your own caddie.         
	The patrons are very knowledgeable and will respect him as the golfer he is, and I think hell get over his nerves by the Wednesday. I hear he has been up for a practice round already.         
	Hell be as determined as anyone has ever been to prove that hes still the No. 1 player in the world and, in my opinion, the best ever to play the game, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea held by Hull City
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chelsea held by Hull City
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	London: If Fabio Capello is looking for help in deciding what to do about John Terry, and the decision that could come to define his reign is understood to be causing the Italian some turmoil, he will have gleaned little from events at the KC Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The England captain showed the first signs of reacting to the controversy surrounding his alleged affair with Vanessa Perroncel by pointedly putting his finger to his lips as he celebrated Didier Drogbas 43rd-minute equaliser, but otherwise appeared unaffected by the storm that has engulfed him.         
	Although Chelsea missed the chance to go four points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 1-1 draw at Hull City, Terry, if not quite at his best, was by far the most accomplished defender on view.         
	Defender Steven Mouyokolo gave Hull a surprise lead in the 30th minute and, although Drogba equalised 12 minutes later with his 20th goal of the season, Chelsea were unable to convert concerted pressure into more goals.         
	The draw left Chelsea on 55 points, three clear of defending champions Manchester United. Both teams have played 24 games, the same as third-place Arsenal, who were another four points back and at Chelsea on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Korea track is slippery, says Karun
                                                                                                                       7                                        South Korea track is slippery, says Karun

	London: Red Bulls Formula One championship contenders Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel have been warned that a journey into the unknown in South Korea this weekend could give them a nasty surprise.         
	Karun Chandhok drove the Red Bull demonstration car at Yeongam on September 4, when the surface was in a comparatively rough state, but the Indian driver was still able to get a good idea of the characteristics. Its going to be very slippery, very low grip, I would imagine, Chandhok said on Monday.         
	The Red Bull is quick everywhere. But I think here, specifically though the first sector of the lap with the three long straights, they may not be as quick as some of the others. Ferrari and McLaren will be stron g, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni warning for bowlers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni warning for bowlers
    - Captain says team cannot always depend on the part-timers           A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Dhaka: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. returned to winning ways, cruising to a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their second match of the Idea Cup tri-series, in Mirpur, Thursday.         
	But the captain was candid enough to admit that despite the victory, his team, especially the bowling department, needed a lot of improvement to match international cricketing standards.         
	Its good that we won today (Thursday). But its also true that we need to improve our standards, at least by 50 per cent, to match the international level. We have been found wanting in some departments and need to address that.         
	I know it would be tough on the boys But thats the way international cricket is and it is important to survive, Dhoni said at the post-match presentation ceremony.         
	India reached the 297-run target set by Bangladesh in 47.3 overs, losing four wickets. The run chase was made to look easy thanks to Dhonis unbeaten 101 and youngster Virat Kohlis gallant 102-ball 91.         
	Dhoni and Kohlis 152-run partnership for the fourth wicket helped the team drag themselves out of early trouble as they lost three quick wickets and were reduced to 51 for three by the ninth over.         
	Later, Suresh Raina chipped in with an unbeaten 43-ball 51 to support his captain as India finished off the match.         
	But Dhoni sounded a word of caution for his bowlers saying the team cannot always bank on the batsmen to bail them out.         
	Its important for the bowlers to perform. If you want to be the No.1 side in the world, you need to improve and perform in all departments. Both batting and bowling are crucial to a teams success. Its important for a team that the main bowlers deliver, otherwise it becomes very difficult. Part-timers like Yuvraj (Singh) are doing their job alright, but you cant depend on that everyday, Dhoni said.         
	The Bangladesh batsmen scored heavily off the Indian frontliners. While Ashish Nehra gave away 44 runs in his six overs, Sreesanth conceded 54 off eight. Zaheer Khan, too, was expensive as he gave away 43 off his six. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was taken for 56 runs in his nine overs.         
	On the contrary, part-timers Yuvraj and Ravindra Jadeja did an impressive job. Yuvraj was the pick of the lot, giving away just 33 runs off 10 overs. Jadeja finished with figures of one for 45 from nine overs.         
	On his brilliant show, Dhoni said: Ive been gifted with a good body Its surviving.         
	If Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir get going at the top of the order, then theres not much left for me to do coming in at No.5. But Im happy to have done the job today, he added.         
	Speaking on Indias chase Thursday, Man of the Match Dhoni said: We never really panicked. We had the second Powerplay and were not short of the required run-rate. If you have wickets in hand, along with a Powerplay, you can always plan a successful chase.         
	Dhoni also expressed surprise at Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasans decision to bat first after winning the toss, despite the dew factor coming into play later in the evening.         
	I was surprised that he opted to bat. In the first two matches whoever had won the toss had opted to bowl first because everybody knows dew will play a major role in the result, he said         
	Dhonis counterpart, Shakib-al Hasan, said that his team need to bowl better to succeed. We are getting runs consistently But we need to bowl better to win, he said.         
	After scalping the early wickets, we had a chance. But India played sensibly and all credit to them for winning the match, Shakib summed it up.

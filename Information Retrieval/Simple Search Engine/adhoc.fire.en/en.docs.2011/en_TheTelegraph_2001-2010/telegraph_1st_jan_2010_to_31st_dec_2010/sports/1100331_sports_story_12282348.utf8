The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coulthard advice for Hamilton
                                                                                                                       7                                            Coulthard advice for Hamilton

	London: Lewis Hamilton needs someone around him to offer sound advice and should appoint a new manager as soon as possible to replace his father, former McLaren driver David Coulthard said on Tuesday.         
	Hamilton announced last month his father Anthony was stepping down as his manager to focus on his own business interests but Coulthard said that decision appeared to be backfiring.         
	Where is the reassuring arm around his shoulder? Where is the sound advice coming from? Where is his father? the Scot asked in a column for a British newspaper after Sundays Australian Grand Prix.         
	Lewiss decision to dispense with Anthonys services as his manager last month was hailed as a coming-of-age move on his part. But the folly of not appointing a replacement showed over the weekend.         
	Having no manager is like a top tennis player having no coach. Its fine when you are playing well but as soon as you are struggling people will point to it as a weakness, he added.         
	Hamilton made the headlines in Melbourne after he was stopped by police late on Friday for driving in what he called an over-exuberant manner on the city streets.         
	The 25-year-old Briton also castigated his McLaren team during the race for calling him in for a second pitstop while chasing for second place. He ended up sixth with world champion teammate Jenson Button winning.         
	I dont know if they have had a bust-up but it does strike me as odd that apparently they did not speak to one another in the aftermath of Fridays incident, said Coulthard, who retired as a Red Bull driver in 2008.         
	Either way, Lewis needs to appoint a replacement soon so he can concentrate on his day job.         
	Coulthard also expressed concern for Red Bull after Germanys Sebastian Vettel saw his hopes of victory dashed again after his second successive pole position.         
	I am not lying when I say they have the quickest car out there. They should be winning these races. That they are not is a worry for everyone at Milton Keynes, said Coulthard, who is a consultant for Red Bull Racing.         
	Sebastian Vettel is so far remaining calm, at least publicly, as he knows he has been the quickest car and driver combination in the opening two races and it is easier to make a quick car reliable than a reliable car quick.         
	But Red Bull need to sort it out before its too late.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zvonareva prevails
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zvonareva prevails
                      
	Doha: Vera Zvonareva overcame Victoria Azarenka 7-6, 6-4 in a closely-fought match to claim her second win at the WTA Championships and move closer to the semi-finals.         
	The No. 2-ranked Russian also kept alive her slim hopes of finishing the year as the top-ranked player.         
	In another match, Kim Clijsters beat Jelena Jankovic 6-2, 6-3.         
	Zvonareva recovered from 2-0, 4-2 and 5-4 down in the first set, winning the tiebreaker with the help of an ace and several other big serves.         
	In the second set, she was behind 2-0 and 3-1 before winning 6-4 against a visibly frustrated Azarenka.         
	Zvonareva must win her last match in the group stage and then make it to the final if she is to have any chance of toppling Caroline Wozniacki.         
	The hard-fought match between the two good friends lasted over two hours.         
	Azarenka started out strongly. Zvonareva struggled with her serve early on and was hitting too many balls into the net or long, prompting her at one point to kick the ground, mumble and cradle her racket.         
	But Zvonareva got her game going late in the first set, hitting several aces and backhand winners down the line. She leveled at 6-6 and then raced out to a 3-0 lead in the tiebreak and closed out the set with Azarenka netting.

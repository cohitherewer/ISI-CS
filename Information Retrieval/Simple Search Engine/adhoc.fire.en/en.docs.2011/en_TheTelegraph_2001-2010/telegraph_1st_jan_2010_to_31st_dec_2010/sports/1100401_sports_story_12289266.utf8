            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder will be staying at the helm, as of now. There were speculations that the coach may lose his job but the Belgian, on Wednesday, said he would not be leaving.         
	De Ridder also said that a poor bench strength and injuries to key players were the main reasons for East Bengals poor show.         
	We were bogged down by injuries and since we dont have a good reserve bench our performance level has dipped, he said.         
	De Ridder was also critical of assistant coach Tushar Rakshits role. He was a good player but yet to reach a level as coach.         
	Meanwhile, De Ridder named an 18-member squad that will play Al Qadsia in Kuwait on April 6.         
	Rennedy Singh and Govin Singh have been overlooked, while Uga Okpara is out with a double booking. Captain Syed Rahim Nabi has been rested.         
	Rennedy has been overlooked as the coach feels he is not speedy enough.

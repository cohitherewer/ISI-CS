The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods in a fix after change
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods in a fix after change
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Brisbane: The Australian Open will precede the Presidents Cup in Melbourne next year, a decision that will almost certainly see Tiger Woods missing from the Australian Masters in 2011.         
	The PGA of Australia announced, Sunday, that the Open, to be held at a Sydney-area course, will be held from Nov. 10-13. The Australian PGA at Coolum, Queensland, will be held from Nov. 24-27, a week after the Presidents Cup between the United States and International team members is held at Royal Melbourne from Nov. 17-20.         
	The PGA also said that the Australian Masters was tentatively scheduled for Dec. 1-4, but that date was still to be confirmed.         
	Woods has played the Masters the last two years, winning it in 2009, and had said hed prefer to see it played the week before the Presidents Cup.         
	The Masters is scheduled to be played at Kingston Heath, another sand belt course near Royal Melbourne and one, which would have given Woods and other Presidents Cup players an ideal preparation for the team event.         
	IMG, which manages Woods, also runs the Australian Masters and had hoped to get the prime week-before date to get players from the Presidents Cup in its field. The Australian Open in Sydney will now have that opportunity, although the likely course, The Lakes, does not have as much in common with Royal Melbourne as Kingston Heath does.         
	 We would like this date. Its critical to us, Mark Steinberg, head of IMGs global golf division, said in November during the Masters.         
	 We feel like we took on the risk by moving to this date a few years ago, going up against some big events, and we made it successful. We feel we deserve to keep the date, now that its a coveted date for next year.         
	Woods received a $3 million appearance fee - half of that paid by the Victorian state government - but in his first year, a government study showed the economic return was more than $30 million. Max Garske, the chief executive of the PGA of Australia, said, Sunday, that the decision was made in the best interest of both Australian golf and the PGA Tour of Australasia.         
	There were a number of factors that needed to be carefully considered in finalizing the scheduling for 2011, including the timing of a number of international events, the availability of certain venues and the domestic schedule that best serves the Australian golfing public, Garske said.         
	With the focus of the golfing world set to be firmly on Melbourne come mid-November 2011, it is a given that the Presidents Cup will offer a number of benefits to events falling on either side. So with these factors in mind we feel we have made the decision in the best interest of the game.

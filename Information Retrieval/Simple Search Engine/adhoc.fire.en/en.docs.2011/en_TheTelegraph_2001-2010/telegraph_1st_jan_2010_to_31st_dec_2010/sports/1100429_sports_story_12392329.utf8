The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo march on 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo march on 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                    A delighted Beto after scoring against   Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: A tornado struck the Mohun Bagan defence for 17 minutes and left the green and maroon brigade in tatters.         
	Up by an NS Manju goal at the end of the first half, Biswajit Bhattacharya and his boys could never have imagined what they got at the start of the second half. The three-time national league champions pounced on the home team and scored four goals between the 46th and 63rd minutes to inflict a humiliating 4-1 defeat at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	The win took Dempo to 47 points from 23 games and within sniffing distance of their fourth national league title, third in last four seasons. On the other hand, this was Bagans second four-goal loss at home after the drubbing at the hands of Lajong FC. Bagan stayed put at the third spot with 32 points from 22 games.         
	Dempo were helped by some poor defending by Bagans back-four, and some shoddy keeping by Shilton Paul, which led to his substitution in the 67th minute.         
	It started with a Sameer Naik flag-kick in the 46th minute, which was headed in by Beto. The ball went through the near post, which Shilton was guarding. The second in the 54th minute saw Joaquim receive a ball from the midfield and sprint down the middle before setting it up for Ranty. The striker found a crack between Deepak Mondal and Manju to beat the outstretched hands of Shilton.         
	The third goal in the 61st minute was an example of how a team wilts under pressure. It was a combination of indecision from the goalie and some horrible anticipation by Biswajit Saha. Anthony Pereira took a corner which was headed by substitute Anwar to the far post with Shilton receding after charging out of the goal.         
	Biswajit, who tried to head the ball out, missed it. Joaquim gleefully accepted the gift and smashed it home to make it 3-1. Within two minutes, it was 4-1. That was the best goal of the match. Beto snatched a ball from Surkumar Singh and then sprinted 20 yards before passing it on to Ranty.         
	Ranty then provided an assist for Anthony wide on the right. He delivered a measured cross which was met by Beto, whose powerful nod went in.         
	Beto and Ranty have been out of the playing eleven for quite a few matches, Sunil Chetri has left to play for the Kansas City Wizards in the MLS, still Dempo are the only team so far to have won more than 10 matches. They have certainly proved that the team that stays together, can fight together and win together.

  - East Bengal will aim to avoid the ignominy of losing all AFC Cup matches         KUSHAN SARKAR            East Bengals Bhaichung Bhutia, Yusif Yakubu and Mehtab Hossain take a break from practice at the club ground, while (picture bottom) Al Nejmehs Moussa Gueye (from left), captain Abbas Atwi and Papa Cisse are all smiles at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday.

	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder and his boys will be more than happy that their disastrous AFC Cup campaign will come to an end when they take on Al Nejmeh of Lebanon in their last group league encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Poor recruitment, some inexplicable strategies and injuries to key players  these has been, by far, one of the worst seasons for East Bengal in the last few years. The Federation Cup triumph has been the only silver lining. But the consistent shoddy performances by the red-and-gold brigade have belittled even that achievement.         
	After their poor show in the I-League, the AFC Cup campaign this season has only added insult to injury.         
	Having lost all five of their matches so far, East Bengal are on the verge of equalling Mohun Bagans ignominious record of losing all six AFC Cup matches last season. In fact, they have already conceded 16 goals and would hope that they manage to concede less than three on the morrow.         
	Otherwise, they will also equal the number of goals conceded by Mohun Bagan last season  19.         
	Among the 31 teams that are playing in the group league phase of the AFC Cup this season, only three other clubs have lost all their matches. They are Persiwa Wamena of Indonesia, Al Nahda of Oman and Ahli Sanaa of Yemen. All these three teams have also lost five out of five matches.         
	If the tournament has become inconsequential for East Bengal, the situation is no better for Al Nejmeh.         
	Although they have seven points with two wins and draw to their credit, practically they have no chance of making it to the next round with Al Qadsia of Kuwait and Al Ittihad of Syria almost sure of making it to the last 16 stage of the competition.         
	Nejmeh captain Abbas Atwi and the two Senegalese recruits  Papa Cisse and Moussa Gueye can pose a lot of threat for the opposition.         
	For De Ridder, this will also serve as a dress rehearsal before they take on Sporting Clube de Goa at home in a crucial I-League encounter on Friday. Currently placed 12th in the points table, De Ridders sole endeavour will be to improve his teams position and steer clear of the drop zone.         
	So, a victory, or even a draw, against Al Nejmeh will give a lot of confidence to the boys ahead of that important tie. Also playing on De Ridders wards mind will be the urge to avenge their 0-3 defeat against the same outfit in their away match in Beirut last month.         
	However, with motivation being on the downslide, it will be difficult for the home team to keep up the intensity that is required for such an international match.         
	Though East Bengal have had a rich history of beating better-ranked foreign oppositions, under De Ridder this season, that fact appears to be a fancy.         
	It will also be interesting to watch whether the coach gives Bhaichung Bhutia a start on Tuesday. Bhaichung, who is gradually reaching full fitness, wouldnt like to cool his heels.         
	With nothing at stake, the Indian captain may be able to play freely without feeling the acute pressure that he is under everytime he is on the pitch. Even his coach agreed.         
	Bhaichung may start tomorrow. There is no better way to get into the groove than match practice, De Ridder said after the training session on Monday.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav is raring to go
            A STAFF REPORTER            Kothari                           
	Calcutta: City boy Sourav Kothari will be representing India at the ISBF World Billiards Championship (time and points format) that gets underway in Pune on Friday.         
	The 25-year-old needed a wild card to make the team as he does not feature among Indias top-eight cueists. We have a very strong team comprising the worlds best. We have Geet Sethi, Pankaj Advani, Dhruv Sitwala, Devendra Joshi, B. Bhaskar, Alok Kumar, Rupesh Shah, Ashok Shandilya and myself, said PSPBs Kothari.         
	Nine-time world billiards champion Mike Russell will be playing after four years as also Singapores Peter Gilchrist. They will pose the stiffest challenge at the meet.         
	In the points format, players from Myanmar are very strong. Thus it will be a tough field in both formats, added Kothari.         
	The Championship has a 20-player field in the time format while 24 will fight it out in the points category.         
	He will begin the 150-up format in group B. Kothari, who will leave for Pune on Thursday, had his best showing at a world championship at Leeds where he lost to Russell in the quarter finals in 2008.

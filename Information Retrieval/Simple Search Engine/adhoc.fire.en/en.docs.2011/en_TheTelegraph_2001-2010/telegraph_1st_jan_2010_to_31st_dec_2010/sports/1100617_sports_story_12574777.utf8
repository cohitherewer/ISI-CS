	Ottmar Hitzfeld is known as Der General (The General) in the German football fraternity. The former Bayern Munich coach who has twice been elected World Coach of the Year is also a one-time mathematics teacher.         
	On Wednesday, at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, Hitzfeld got all his calculations right as his little-fancied Swiss bravehearts caused the biggest upset of the tournament by defeating an enormously talented Spanish outfit 1-0. Doff your hats to this 61-year-old German whose brilliant defensive strategy foiled the European Champions in their group league opener.         
	The strategy was very simple. Let Spain do all the attacking in the first 45 minutes; soak in all the pressure and the sweeping raids unleashed by the Spanish midfield and forwards.         
	The Swiss carried out Hitzfelds instructions to the letter and, save for a free-kick by Reto Ziegler, made no attempt to enter the Spanish penalty area. One needs the gumption to withstand constant pressure when playing a defensive game and the Swiss back-four probably had the match of their lives.                     
	They got their rare chance in the 52nd minute and, as it turned out, that was all they needed. A yawning gap opened up between central defenders Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol and Eren Derdiyok, with his never-say-die attitude, pounced on it. But as Pique fumbled with the clearance, former Manchester City forward Gelson Fernandes stabbed home the winner.         
	Talent and creativity is often packaged with a tinge of arrogance and over-confidence. And that can lead to disaster. One slip can turn fatal as Spain must have learnt from this disaster.         
	One saw the Iniestas, Xavis and David Villas display everything a fan would like to watch; lovely passes, quick changing of flanks, flowing football using the length and breadth of the ground, beautiful dribbling and deft movement. Pity they didnt do the most important thing in football correctly.         
	Call it bad luck or poor finishing, Vicente Del Bosques boys didnt deserve to be on the wrong side of the biggest upset so far in this World Cup.         
	Its always very hard to digest that a team with enormous talent and potential, one that are considered one of the favourites, should start their tournament so disastrously.         
	With Chile beating Honduras in the other match, it is now a doubly difficult task for the Spaniards as they need to win their next two matches in order to qualify for the knockout stages.         
	However, I wont support the idea of playing David Villa as the single striker, especially against a weak team that plays a closed game. If they failed to break the Swiss code, it was because there was no one to play close to Villa inside the 18-yard box.         
	Suddenly, there were two to three big-bodied Swiss defenders closing down Villa. Someone like David Silva or Xavi should have played close to Villa instead of operating from the flanks or from the hole. I couldnt comprehend the logic behind keeping Fernando Torres on the bench.         
	Torres should have started and his thrust upfront was a must. So confident were they with their touchplay, they didnt use the aerial route all that much right till the fag end.         
	About the teams defence, the Barca stopper duo of Pique and Puyol should have shown more understanding as they could have conceded another goal.         
	A question has cropped up after this match and Tuesday nights tie between Brazil and North Korea. Will skill and flair bow to defensive counterattacking tactics? Only time will tell.

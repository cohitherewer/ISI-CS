The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stuart is keen on emulating father
                                                                                                                       7                                      Stuart is keen on emulating father
                      
	Nottingham: Stuart Broad has admitted his father will have family bragging rights until he too is a member of an England team that has won an Ashes series in Australia.         
	England begin their defence of the Ashes in Australia in November, knowing that not since 1986-87 have they won a Test series Down Under.         
	Chris Broad, now an International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee, but then an opening batsman played a key role in that series in Australia with hundreds in three successive Tests. Stuart Broad, primarily a right-arm seamer but also, like his father, a left-hand bat, was just a few months old when Chris set off for a tour that has become etched in English memories.         
	Broad junior has already followed in his fathers footsteps once by moving from his original county (in his case Leicestershire) to play for Nottinghamshire, at whose Trent Bridge headquarters he is featuring for England in the first Test against Pakistan.         
	Now Stuart, whose five-wicket haul in last years final Test against Australia at The Oval helped England regain the Ashes 2-1, wants to be on the winning side in Australia as well.         
	We had a video called On Top Down Under, which was about the (1986-87) series and I always used to watch it, Stuart Broad said. Whenever we talk about our careers, dad will always have the upper hand until we have won in Australia.

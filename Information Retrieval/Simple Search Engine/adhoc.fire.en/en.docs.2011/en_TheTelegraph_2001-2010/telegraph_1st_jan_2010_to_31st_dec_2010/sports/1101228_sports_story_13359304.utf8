 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE
  Anything in excess of 320 would be challenging            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kepler Wessels                           
	Durban: South Africas former captain, Kepler Wessels, spoke to The Telegraph on Monday.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Honestly, did you expect India to be batting a second time on Day II?         
	A Actually, in my first (TV) commentary stint of the day itself, Id said we would only get to know how good this pitch is after South Africa have batted...         
	What made you say that?         
	Because there would always be something in it for the bowlers... It couldnt be assumed that the surface would flatten out... Of course, Im not suggesting its a 131-pitch.         
	India got it right in bowling and catching...         
	Absolutely... Both teams have bowled and caught very well... As we speak (in the final session), we havent seen much batting, though.         
	Clearly, Zaheer Khans return made a huge difference... Your take?         
	I agree... Zaheer bowled within himself and, yeah, Indias bowling in Centurion lacked teeth. Sreesanth and Ishant (Sharma) bowled better, at the other end, but they still have some way to go.         
	Did you expect Harbhajan Singh to make such an impact?         
	Because of the bounce, yes... Knew it would suit him.         
	What if India had won the toss?         
	Hard to say... Its like asking what if India had won the toss in Centurion? You can never say how a team couldve batted in the first innings of a Test.         
	The No.1-ranked team versus the No.2 side... Has the hype been unnecessary?         
	It has been a bit too much... Look, youve got to realise that teams play in different conditions and against different opponents... So, judging them isnt easy. Many variables come into play... Its nice to have a system of rankings, but you cant really judge sides entirely accurately.         
	Your thoughts on the Test as its poised now?         
	Definitely heading for a result... Never write off South Africa. At this stage, its fair to say its well-balanced.         
	What would be a challenging target?         
	Anything in excess of 320... Youve got to remember that its not going to be about a fourth innings-surface, but South Africa possibly starting the chase on the third afternoon. The pitch should be at its best then.         
	The last one... Eighteen wickets falling during the day...         
	(Laughs) Incredible, almost unbelievable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ojha scalps 3 in drawn tie
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ojha scalps 3 in drawn tie
  - Warm-up game Indian bowlers put up an improved show               Lahiru Thirimanne en route to his century in Colombo, on Thursday                           
	Colombo: Indian bowlers put up an improved performance to restrict Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI to 260 for six in their second innings in the three-day warm-up game which ended in a draw here Thursday.         
	After disappointing with both ball and bat for the last two days, the Indian bowlers gave a better account of themselves with left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha being the notable performer with three for 85 in his 22 overs.         
	The Hyderabad spinner was assisted by Amit Mishra, Virender Sehwag and Ishant Sharma  all taking one wicket each.         
	For the hosts, opener Lahiru Thirimanne scored 102 and top-order batsman Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with a useful 69, but the rest of the batting line-up failed to impress. Thilina Kandamby (9) and Sachithra Senanayake (6) were at the crease when both captains decided to call off play early at the Colts Cricket Club Ground here.         
	After bundling out India for 291 Wednesday, Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI could have enforced the follow-on but the hosts decided to bat and straightaway suffered a jolt, losing in-form opener Upul Tharanga to Ishant in the fifth over.         
	However, Thirimanne and Chandimal ensured there were no more hiccups and started scoring at a fast-pace, with the latter dealing in boundaries.         
	The duo kept the scoreboard ticking and forged a 113-run second wicket partnership in quick time.         
	Ojha then put the brakes on the scoring when he cleaned up the dangerous-looking Chandimal in the 21st over. Nine overs later, Sehwag had Prasanna Jayawardene caught by Laxman as the hosts succumbed to 172 for three.         
	In the 33rd over, Ojha struck again dismissing Kaushal Silva with skipper and wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni taking the catch.         
	Thilan Samaraweera (25) then gave company to Thirimanne as they tried to stem the rot with a 63-run partnership but the opener could not stay longer after completing his century and was caught by Sharma off Ojhas bowling in the 51st over.         
	Samaraweera was also back in the pavillion in the next over when he was stumped by Dhoni off Mishra as the match headed for a draw. Batting practice was the objective of the final day, when the Sri Lankans took guard for their second innings with a lead of 223.         
	Chandimal earned a promotion and made it count as he helped himself to a half-century. The pair went after the spinners and the partnership progressed at more than seven an over. Chandimal slammed four sixes in his 69 before Ojha had his revenge.         
	It was a difficult three days for the Indians who were outplayed with bat and ball. The first Test against Sri Lanka begins in Galle, on Sunday.           (AGENCIES)

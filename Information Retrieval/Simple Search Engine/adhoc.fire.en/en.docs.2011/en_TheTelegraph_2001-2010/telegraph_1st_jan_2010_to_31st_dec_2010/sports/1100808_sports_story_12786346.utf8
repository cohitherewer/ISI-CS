The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman: Ive had to live with constant scrutiny
                                                                                                                       7                                      Laxman: Ive had to live with constant scrutiny
    - When the focus is there, then pain recedes to the background, says stylish stalwart           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              V.V.S. Laxman celebrates his century, on Saturday        
	Colombo: Vangipurappu Venkata Sai Laxman, hero of Indias series-levelling win on Saturday, spoke to the media in general and, then, exclusively to The Telegraph in his Taj Samudra room.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Thoughts on his match-winning innings         
	I wouldnt rate it with earlier ones, but it was very important... Obviously, you like to contribute in every innings... Im satisfied, more so, as we won the Test and squared the series. Because of the situation, it will stand out.         
	His first hundred in Sri Lanka         
	As Ive said, its satisfying... Any performance which helps the team win is, well, satisfying... The hundred came at the right moment.         
	Dedicating the innings to...         
	Teammates and well-wishers.         
	On relaxing before going out to bat         
	At times, I read... Listen to music (on the iPod)... Talk to teammates... Today, I was listening to Kishore Kumar hits!         
	If he still gets that butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling         
	Yes, as one leaves the dressing room... Soon enough, though, that nervous energy translates into something positive... Thats the beauty of it all. If that nervousness isnt there, then theres something wrong.         
	Winning with a depleted attack and no Gautam Gambhir as well         
	I wouldnt say this was a depleted team... Id give full credit to the guys who stepped in... In my opinion, our bowlers did very well in conditions which suited batsmen.         
	Hundred-plus partnership with Sachin Tendulkar on the last day         
	To shift the momentum, one partnership was needed... Sachin and I put that together.         
	The wicket         
	There was assistance for the spinners (Ajantha Mendis, Suraj Randiv)... Both are top-class. Id say it was a typical fifth day pitch... We werent looking at the wicket, our aim was to build a big partnership... After Sachin got out, Suresh Raina played such an important innings. Once the partnerships began, I could sense that the Sri Lankans were giving up.         
	Having tamed Mendis         
	(Laughs) Its just unfortunate that Ive got out to him a number of times... Yet, it wasnt that Id been struggling... I didnt play him any differently today... Played according to the merit (of the ball).         
	Back spasms...         
	It was quite painful... Id felt the pain yesterday (Friday), while fielding... I was in a lot of discomfort today, but it was important not to lose the momentum... Initially, I didnt want a runner, because I didnt want a run out... Also, I didnt want the rhythm to break... But I couldnt help it, as my mobility was being hampered... At that point in time, it was best for the team, too, that I have a runner... I was having pain-killers, of course.         
	Getting past the pain barrier         
	When its a question of doing something for the country, the pain doesnt matter... In the past, too, Ive played with pain and much discomfort. In the last series in Sri Lanka, two years ago, Id twisted an ankle at the same ground... The team and I had a goal and, when the focus is there, then pain recedes to the background.         
	Whether runner Virender Sehwag and Raina kept boosting his morale         
	Yes... Both kept asking me to set small goals, to take it 10 runs at a time.         
	Often coming under scrutiny, despite being such a big performer         
	It has been so from the start of my career... Ive always been under scrutiny... (Laughs) Ive started dealing with it much better now, in the early years, Id feel insecure... There would be doubts over my place in the team. Looking back, I wonder how much better I couldve performed had I not felt insecure... How much better I couldve done had I got the freedom... Whats important is how the team looks at you and your role... Ive always had the teams support... It has been unfortunate, yes, but Ive had to live with constant scrutiny... Today, though, Im not bothered and, by Gods grace, have played over 100 Tests... Not many in India have done that.         
	His approach         
	That every Test is an opportunity to do something for the country. I dont worry about things that arent in my control.         
	Raising the bar         
	I do challenge myself to get better. After all, theres something to learn every day.         
	Nobody having forgotten his classic 281 at the Eden, against Australia, in March 2001         
	Actually, I had a back problem before that Test... Its nice to know that people continue to talk of that very special innings. It turned out to be a special Test and series.         
	Whether the coming good of a Raina puts pressure on the seniors         
	Look, everybody has his role... And, everybody has his style... Its a team sport and all have the responsibility to perform.         
	The dressing room atmosphere         
	Its the best dressing room that Ive been a part of... The atmosphere is great and Ive really enjoyed being there in the last two years or so (ever since Gary Kirsten became the coach, in March 2008)... Its like a family, with everybody caring for each other... We enjoy each others success, which is important.         
	Biggest difference from the past         
	(Pauses) Everybody knows what their role is... Its a much more relaxed dressing room. Theres calmness, with no unnecessary tension. Thats the hallmark of a good team.         
	Kirstens style of functioning         
	Hes had a huge influence, be it technically or mentally. Hes helped create the best dressing room atmosphere, has given the players space.         
	On captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	MS is calm and handles success and failure with equanimity... Both he and Gary have done a lot of good for Indian cricket.         
	Dhonis compliment that hes always switched on         
	I am, yes... Whatever the situation of the match, I like to encourage the bowlers and fellow-fielders... I like to enjoy every moment on the field and Id like the others to also do likewise.         
	Team India         
	Everybody in this team is a star and everybody has a role... Its about everybody going out and contributing.         
	Building partnerships with the tail, too         
	Our tailenders take a lot of pride in their batting and some, like Harbhajan (Singh), have improved so much... Ishant Sharma and (Abhimanyu) Mithun batted very well in this series... Experience helps... I take the maximum strike against the bowlers the tailenders arent comfortable facing. Its about giving them confidence.         
	What has he learnt the most in a decade-and-a-half of international cricket         
	To be level-headed and accept the ups and downs equally... Id like to add that my upbringing has helped... I dont get carried away by success, nor do failures leave me depressed. Im a balanced person, who is open to learning.         
	The future         
	Am looking forward to the home series against Australia and, then, New Zealand... Also, to the tour of South Africa. Over the next few weeks, Id like to prepare well, try and get better.         
	Message for youngsters...         
	Work hard and remain balanced... That way, setbacks wont break one emotionally.         
	Finally, if he remains disappointed that the selectors never considered him for ODIs after 2006         
	Definitely... At that time, Id felt I still had something to contribute, but didnt get the chance.

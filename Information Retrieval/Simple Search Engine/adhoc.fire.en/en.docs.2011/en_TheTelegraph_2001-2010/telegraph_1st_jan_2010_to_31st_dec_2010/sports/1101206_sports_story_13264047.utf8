The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viktor serves a delight

  - Jubilant Serbians shave their heads after maiden triumph             The Serbian team, after winning the Davis Cup, in Belgrade, on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Belgrade: Serbia celebrated their first Davis Cup title after Viktor Troicki thrashed Frances Michael Llodra to secure a memorable 3-2 victory inside a rocking Belgrade Arena on Sunday.         
	Chants of Viktor and Serbia reverberated around the imposing 17,000-capacity venue as Troicki, a late swap for the deciding rubber, won 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 against a powerless opponent who cracked under the pressure.         
	Jubilant scenes followed Troickis perfect backhand pass on matchpoint as his team mates stormed the court to swamp the 24-year-old before the players, and Serbian federation president Slobodan Zivojinovic sat down to have their heads shaved  a vow they made after their semi-final victory.         
	Even Niki Pilic got the razor treatment after he became the first person to coach three different nations to the Davis Cup title, having also achieved it with Germany and Croatia. Pilic was drafted in three years ago to support unassuming Serbia captain Bogdan Obradovic.         
	This is the most unbelievable moment of my life, Troicki said on court alongside an elated Djokovic who won both his singles matches in the tie.         
	Its historic. This is our biggest success as individuals, as a team, as a country, world number three Djokovic added.         
	There was just gloom and despondency though for France whose admirable 1,200 fans watched the mayhem unfolding before their eyes in silence. Llodra appeared distraught as he slumped on his chair and was comforted by captain Guy Forget.         
	To be this close to our goal, it hurts. What is hard is that in both matches today we never caught a glimpse of victory. The other guy was better in every area, Forget said.         
	Serbia begun the day 2-1 in arrears against the nine-times champions after losing a cliffhanger doubles rubber on Saturday, but first Djokovic pummelled Gael Monfils 6-2 6-2 6-4 to level the tie before Troicki finished the job.

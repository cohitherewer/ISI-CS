The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Keen contest on the cards
                                                                                                                       7                                      Keen contest on the cards
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dempo Sports Club and Chirag United are as different as chalk and cheese. If one have the most talented bunch of footballers in Indian club circuit, the other have a burning desire that can outweigh their limited resources.         
	One can expect a keen contest when these two teams lock horns in their 10th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Both are on 18 points each from nine games. However, Dempo, with 21 goals, are second on the table, while Chirag are fourth, having played a match less than Churchill Brothers, who are third with 18 points from 10 games.         
	However, qualitatively, Dempo are a far superior side with seasoned campaigners like Mahesh Gawli, Climax Lawrence, Clifford Miranda and Sunil Chetri on their roster. Even Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya agreed that Dempo have more versatility.         
	They have a lot of creative players in the midfield and up front. However, my boys have done well till now and there is no reason not to expect them do it once more, Bhattacharya told mediapersons after a practice session at the Bidhannagar Municipal Sports Complex Tuesday.         
	Bhattacharya will be happy that Dempo are without the services of their No.1 gamemaker Beto, and Nigerian marksman Ranty Martins because of injury.         
	Joaquim Abranches will partner Chetri in the forward line, while Peter Carvalho will replace Beto in the central midfield. Their opponents will be laid low by the absence of their Brazilian striker Joshimar, who is out with double booking.         
	Ashim Biswas, will be playing as a striker, along with Edmilson. Ashim, who has recently made a comeback has played couple of matches as withdrawn striker.

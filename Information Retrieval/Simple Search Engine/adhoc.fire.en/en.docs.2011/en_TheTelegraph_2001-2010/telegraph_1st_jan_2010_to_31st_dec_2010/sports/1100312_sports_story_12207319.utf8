	New Delhi: Defending champions Germany and Australia continued their domination in the elite level hockey when they reached the final of the Hero Honda World Cup at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, here on Thursday.         
	In the semi-finals, Germany, aiming to win their third title in a row, played with clinical efficiency to demolish England 4-1, while Australia survived a late onslaught to beat the Netherlands 2-1.         
	The final will be played on Saturday. The two teams also played the finals of the last two editions of the World Cup. On both occasions, Germany prevailed over Australia.         
	Playing through the wings with accurate passes and deadly penetration, Germany were a treat to watch against a team that beat them in the final of the European Cup only a few months ago. Once the Germans picked up an early goal in the sixth minute through a penalty corner conversion by Jan-Marco Montag, they looked unstoppable.         
	In the other semi-final, Australia dominated the proceedings and scored once in each half to take a 2-0 lead but the Dutch threatened to make a comeback when they were awarded a penalty stroke in the 57th minute.         
	Todays matches: For 9th/10th position: New Zealand vs South Africa (3.35 pm); For 7th /8th positions: India vs Argentina (6.05 pm); For 5th/6th positions: South Korea vs Spain (8.35 pm).

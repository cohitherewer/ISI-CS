                                                                                                                       7                                      Lions tame India A by 5 wickets 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Poor bowling by India A helped hosts England Lions to win the one-day tri-series final by five wickets at the New Road ground in Worcester.         
	Put in to bat first, India A scored a competitive 278 for seven, courtesy an unbeaten 87 (89 balls, 4x4, 2x6) by skipper Cheteshwar Pujara.         
	The England Lions played steadily with Andrew Gale scoring 90 (114 balls, 10x4). However, it was some lusty hitting by Darren Stevens (68, 53 balls, 9x4, 1x6) that enabled Lions to win with eight deliveries to spare.         
	Earlier, India A openers Shikhar Dhawan (39, 31 balls, 8x4) and Abhinav Mukund (62, 77 balls, 8x4) added 68 in less than 10 overs for the first wicket.         
	After that only Pujara and to some extent Manoj Tiwary (24, 41 balls, 2x4) tried to fight it out but there was very little resistance from the other players.         
	Ajinkya Rahane (12), vice-captain Wriddhiman Saha (5) failed to score big. It was yet another disastrous performance from young Manish Pandey who could manage only 13 before being holed out to Sajid Mahmood off Liam Plunkett. Plunkett (two for 51) and left-arm spinner Stephen Parry (three for 48) were the two most successful bowlers from the Lions.         
	When the Lions batted, it was wicket-keeper batsman Steve Davies who started the onslaught hitting 55 off only 61 balls with nine boundaries.         
	He and Gale added 76 for the second wicket after skipper Alastair Cook was trapped leg before by left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat (two for 46).         
	Gale was then joined by England discard Ravi Bopara (30) and the duo added another 68 for the third wicket before the latter was bowled by Unadkat.         
	After that Stevens and Gale conjured the most important partnership of the match adding 71 runs for the fourth wicket before Gale edged one to Wriddhiman off Jaskaran Singh.         
	Brief Scores         
	India 278/7 in 50 ovs (C. Pujara 87 no, A. Mukund 62, M. Tiwary 24). England Lions 79/5 in 48.4 ovs (A. Gale 90, D. Stevens 68, J. Unadkat 2/46). England Lions won by 5 wkts

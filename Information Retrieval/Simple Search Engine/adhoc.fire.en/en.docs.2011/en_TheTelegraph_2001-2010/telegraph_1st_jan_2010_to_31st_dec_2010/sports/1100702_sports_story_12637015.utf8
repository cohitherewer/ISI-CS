	Calcutta: South African pacer Dale Steyn had his entire match fee docked by the ICC for spitting in West Indies all-rounder Sulieman Benns direction during the third Test of a three-match series between the two sides in Barbados.         
	According to ICC media release: Steyn was found to have committed a Level 2 breach of the code contrary to clause 2.2.11 which relates to conduct of a serious nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game.         
	The incident took place when Steyn was dismissed, bowled by Kemar Roach, in the 132nd over of South Africas first innings.         
	The fact that he was provoked by Sulieman during his time at the crease helps to explain his actions but cannot excuse them , match referee Jeff Crowe added.         
	Roach has also been fined 50 per cent of his match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.         
	Roach pleaded guilty to a Level 1 offence and accepted the punishment handed out by Crowe after play concluded in Barbados on Tuesday.         
	He was found to have breached 2.1.8 of the code which relates to conduct of a minor nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game, the ICC said.           (PTI)

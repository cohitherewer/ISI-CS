The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA asks duo to return
                                                                                                                       7                                      CA asks duo to return
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With the Ashes round the corner, Cricket Australia, on Thursday, advised batsman Mike Hussey to return to Australia prior to the third one-day International, against India, on Sunday. Doug Bollinger, nursing an injury, has also been called back from the India tour.         
	The decision to pull out Hussey from the ODI series is a certain indication that Australia want to give adequate rest and practice to their middle-order mainstay ahead of the Ashes.         
	And that, therefore, implies that the Ashes is much more important to Aussies than the India tour.         
	Hussey will play in West Australias Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield clash with South Australia.

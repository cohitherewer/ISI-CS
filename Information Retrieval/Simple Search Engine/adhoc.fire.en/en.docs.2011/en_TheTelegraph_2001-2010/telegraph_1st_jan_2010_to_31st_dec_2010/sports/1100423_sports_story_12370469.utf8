The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bigger game on: Dalmiya
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bigger game on: Dalmiya
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jagmohan Dalmiya at the CAB, on Thursday                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya is upset with the recent controversies surrounding the Indian Premier League.         
	Yesterday, was one of the saddest days of my career (as a cricket administrator). Surely whatever is happening is very unpleasant. But I will not like to air my observations at this juncture as a bigger game is going on, Dalmiya told reporters on Thursday evening.         
	The CAB president also confirmed that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and association regarding the hosting of IPL matches hasnt been misplaced.         
	There is no question of misplacing any document. Each and every documents are in order. In fact, the copy of the MoU in question is also there. Since all the office-bearers were not present yesterday, we couldnt furnish the documents. Today we have found it.         
	We have shown the MoU to our income tax lawyer (Tapash Chakraborty). He has minutely studied the documents and made all the necessary notes. By tomorrow, our lawyer will hand over the photocopy of the MoU to the IT officials.         
	Also the one that was stored in our database is already with them. Since they wanted a hard copy we will be handing it over to them, Dalmiya added.         
	We have co-operated with the IT officials as a general investigation was carried out at all centres where IPL matches have been held. It goes without saying that we will fully co-operate with the government on anything regarding this matter.         
	Meanwhile, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said that they have already received and encashed cheques worth Rs 2 crore from the Knight Riders Sports Private Limited.         
	We have got two cheques (Rs 1 crore each) issued by the KKR from their Yes Bank account (Nariman Point branch). We have deposited the same at our State Bank of India (Chowringhee branch). They will pay us another Rs 50 lakh, Dey said.         
	It was also learnt that the money was paid in INR (Indian National Rupee) and not any foreign currency as there have been reports in some quarters.         
	The CAB, in addition to the Rs 50 lakh, will also receive Rs 2,56,776 as per telephone bills from two organisations that also worked along with KKR.         
	We are yet to receive Rs 1,88,348 from Multi Screen Media (MSM) and Rs 68,428 from World Sports Group, a senior official informed.         
	However, the CAB claims that there is no MoU between CAB and KKR during the first edition of the IPL in 2008. The Prasun Mukherjee-led regime had refused to sign the agreement then demanding that the actual expenditure be reimbursed.         
	The senior CAB officials along with their president went into a huddle on Thursday evening to discuss about the impending situation. Almost all the senior office-bearers were of the opinion that the CAB shouldnt be involved in this messy affair as all they have done is to act as facilitators.

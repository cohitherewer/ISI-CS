The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tried to sign Beckham, reveals Steve Bruce
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tried to sign Beckham, reveals Steve Bruce
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Sunderland manager Steve Bruce has revealed that he made an audacious bid to lure former Manchester United teammate David Beckham from California to Wearside.         
	Bruce tried to sign the former England skipper on loan from LA Galaxy last season and although his efforts proved fruitless his wider ambitions for the Stadium of Light remain undiminished by the knock-back.         
	Certainly I tried 18 months ago, Bruce said. I did try when he went to Milan. Milan or Sunderland, or Birmingham or Wigan?         
	He just said, Thanks Brucie Im going to Milan. I understand that. Milan and Prada or Sunderland and Primark?         
	I still keep in touch with him. I was his captain but he wouldnt call me skip.         
	I remember Beckham the year I left when we won the league at Middlesbrough and then he got the wonder-goal that put him on the road to stardom at Wimbledon.         
	That coincided with my first game for Birmingham at Crystal Palace. A bit of a come-down.         
	Bruce said he cant see the itinerant Beckham coming back to England for a Premier League swansong and is convinced his club has what it takes to have their own overseas adventure in the Europa League.         
	When I joined 18 months ago and had a conversation with the owner (Ellis Short) he didnt want to be in a relegation fight again, Bruce added.         
	Weve made big strides towards that, we are decent. As for Europe, it has never been mentioned above me. And I dont think we should just yet.         
	Lets keep our feet on the ground.         
	Lets try to get through the winter and lets see where we can be when spring comes.         
	And if we can get to the magical 45, 48 points with five or six games left fantastic.         
	 Europe is a huge slog. I would love to see European football here but it stretches your resources to the limit because it is not just a knock-out competition any more. It goes on forever.         
	However it would still be a wonderful achievement if we could do it.         
	I am convinced the club could cope, if you look at the last few years it has expanded fantastically.         
	I had dinner with the owner last week and he is excited about the future ahead and now he is excited I wouldnt rule it out that we can still go on and smash our transfer record as long as the owner keeps doing what he has done in the past.         
	I dont think it will be January because I genuinely believe now that there is nobody out there.

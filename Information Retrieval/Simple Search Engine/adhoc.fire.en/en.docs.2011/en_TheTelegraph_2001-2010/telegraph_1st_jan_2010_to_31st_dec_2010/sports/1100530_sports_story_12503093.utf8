	Istanbul: Jenson Button put Formula One firmly ahead of his love life on Saturday after fending off awkward questions about breaking up with his lingerie model girlfriend.         
	I am here to focus on the weekend which is obviously the main reason why we are here so I need to be totally focused, the Briton told reporters at the Turkish Grand Prix when asked about the relationship.         
	I dont want to be answering questions about my private life.         
	I have always had great people around me, including family and obviously my partner and friends, and that is important for me, added the 30-year-old McLaren driver, who has had a string of girlfriends over the years.         
	To have people around me that know me as a person, know me on my good days and bad days, and basically I have still got those people around me. My father is here and my physio who I have been with for a few years.         
	I have still got that little family around me and I really feel at home here, said the Briton, who moved to McLaren from Brawn at the end of last season.         
	Newspapers reported on Friday that Button and Argentine-Japanese model Jessica Michibata had separated after being together for more than a year.

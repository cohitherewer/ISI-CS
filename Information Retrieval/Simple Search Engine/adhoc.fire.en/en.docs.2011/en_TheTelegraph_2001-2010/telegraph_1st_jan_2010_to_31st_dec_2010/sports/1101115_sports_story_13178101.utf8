The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan upsets Black Caps plans
                                                                                                                       7                                        Harbhajan upsets Black Caps plans
            SUDIPTO GUPTA              Harbhajan Singh celebrates his half century, on the third day of the second Test, against New Zealand, at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, in Hyderabad, on Sunday. (PTI)                             
	Hyderabad: The land of delicious biriyanis got a taste of Harbhajan Singhs delightful fast food on Sunday. What he dished out on a Sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, would serve differently to both the teams. While it would satisfy the Indians appetite, it would definitely be the cause of indigestion for New Zealand. One wouldnt be surprised then if Daniel Vettori loses sleep!         
	For five hours, the visitors wielded the wand of control and then bang The tornedo called the Turbanator hit them. Destruction followed as the ball, tormented by the bat, began to flee in every direction of the ground. The rain had a brief role, interrupting play for 18 minutes, but the runs kept raining until the umpires decided to call it a day. And what a day it was!         
	[Late on Sunday night, there was a drizzle in Hyderabad. With forecasts threatening more rain, the weather might play a key role.]         
	With the setting sun rose Indias hero of the day. With 355 for eight, one could see the Indians gearing up for New Zealands second innings. But they never got a chance as, at stumps, on the third day of the second Test, India were 436 for nine, with a healthy lead of 86 runs over the visitors.         
	At the crease with Harbhajan was Sreesanth, who bravely defied the Black Caps for 47 balls to remain unbeaten on 14. If the duo can extend their unbeaten 69-run partnership, on Monday, India will advance a step towards taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	Harbhajans 82-ball 85 was of utmost cricketing importance in disguise of sheer entertainment. And one thing is certain His five sixes and seven boundaries would catapult him to the IPL franchises wish-list in the upcoming auction. If the off-spinner continues have such a ball with the bat, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will not have to fish for all-rounders in the future.         
	A testimony of Harbhajans impact with the bat in this series lies in the fact that he is the second highest accumulator of runs so far for India. Guess who he is competing with? Well, its Virender Sehwag! More startling is another bit of statistics. Harbhajan (269 runs)  one century and two fifties  trails Sehwag (270) by just a solitary run.         
	Hyderabad woke up with expectations on Sunday only to be lulled back to the silent mode in just the fifth over of the day. The 30,000-odd people, who had thronged the newest Test venue in India anticipating Sachins super Sunday show, were treated with some madness, very unlikely of the maestros methods.         
	But perhaps the opening ball of the day itself bore premonitions of the tragedy. While trying to steal a single which wasnt there, Sachin (13) was almost on the verge of an even more premature departure. But Sachin fell soon, attempting to hoist Vettrori over mid-on but managing just an edge to Ross Taylor at first-slip.         
	Its difficult to source the motive behind such a bizarre move, but maybe, the hype-created pressure around his much-awaited 50th Test century and the New Zealanders success in tying him up early in the day, burst the bubble of expectations.         
	However, that shouldnt have been the case when 25, 999 Test runs walked in to bat at the onset of the day. Thats the sum of Sachin and Rahul Dravids booty put together (before this Test). But credit to the New Zealand bowlers, who, with their miserly act, could have given the insurance companies a run for their money, literally. And, their accuracy in landing the ball in areas where they wanted, resembled a mathematicians precision.         
	Vettori himself was Captain Control, as he not only dried up the runs but threatened with wicket-taking deliveries every now and then. His field placements, too, were innovative and he marshalled his black-capped troops with perfection. Considering the pitch, which contains a cache of runs for the disciplined, Vettoris first spell of the morning was that of a magicians --- 11-2-16-1!         
	It was mainly due to him that the hosts managed a meagre 59 runs off 30 overs in the first session. Beside Harbhajans, Laxman (74) also provided the crowd with a unique treat. Shrugging off the initial bondage, the home hero unleashed an array of delightful strokes to enthral the gathering. He struck 11 boundaries and lent stability to the hosts middle-order.         
	Vettori bowled untiringly for his four wickets while Tim Southee has three wickets beside his name.         
	And whats New Zealands need of the hour? A finishing-school maybe They need to learn how to finish off the opposition after dual failures in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.

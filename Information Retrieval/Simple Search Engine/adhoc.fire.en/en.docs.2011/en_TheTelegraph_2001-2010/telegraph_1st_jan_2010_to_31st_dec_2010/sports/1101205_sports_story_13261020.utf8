The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Odafe nets Churchill equaliser 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Odafe nets Churchill equaliser 
                      
	Margao: Churchill Brothers came from behind to hold defending champions Dempo to a 1-1 draw in their opening I-League match, at the Nehru Stadium, here on Saturday.         
	After a barren first half, Dempo took the lead in the 58th minute through substitute Clifton Gonsalves.         
	Odafe, who was ineffective in the first half, drew parity in the 86th minute after missing on a couple of occasions early in the second half.         
	Churchill adopted a defensive approach in the first half, playing more men in the midfield to buckle the rivals moves, and, as a result, their attack suffered. Odafe, who played as a single striker, did not get much support from his colleagues.         
	Y Raju snatched the ball from defender John Dias and, after entering the box, laid it for Odafe. The Nigerian got the better of two rival defenders and essayed a left-footer which missed the target narrowly.         
	Dempo nearly scored through Ranty Martins, but goalkeeper Lalit Thapa averted the danger. (PTI)

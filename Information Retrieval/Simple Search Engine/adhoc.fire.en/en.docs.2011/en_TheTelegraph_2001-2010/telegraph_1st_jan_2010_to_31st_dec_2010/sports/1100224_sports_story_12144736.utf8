The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security: More the messier
                                                                                                                       7                                      Security: More the messier
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gwalior: When it comes to security, numbers do make a difference. Equally, too many may only add to the chaos, as one saw here on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Indeed, the Captain Roop Singh Stadium was a witness to chaotic scenes as the Indian and South African cricketers finished nets and began returning to their respective dressing rooms.         
	Very concerned was a member of Indias support staff and the two South Africans overseeing their players security in the lead up to Wednesdays match.         
	Its amazing how, despite the presence of hundreds of policemen (and a few policewomen), dozens of autograph-seekers repeatedly mobbed the players as they approached the boundary rope on the way back to their dressing rooms.         
	After a while, a member of Indias support staff was seen ticking off a couple of the officers, making it very clear that such policing in a heavily restricted area just wasnt acceptable.         
	There was chaos in Jaipur (during the first ODI)... It seems worse here... We, in the team, can only draw the attention of the people whore supposed to matter, one of the Men in Blue told The Telegraph.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, by the way, made his point beautifully when asked if he was happy with the security. Isse jyada security ground mein fit ho hi nahin sakti hai!         
	In tennis, that wouldve been game, set and match to the India captain.

                                                                                                                       7                                      ED tightens noose around Lalit Modi
                      
	New Delhi: Airports and other entry points across the country have been alerted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to detain Lalit Modi, under probe for alleged violation of foreign exchange regulations in connection with the Indian Premier League.         
	The financial watchdog issued a look out circular against Modi, who is currently in the UK. The circular has been sent to entry points and airports in the country along with his photographs by the ED, which has already started the process of revoking his passport.         
	The circular empowers the enforcement agency to detain the individual who has been flagged and immediately inform the issuing agency.         
	Adding to Modis troubles, the ED is examining the FIR filed by the BCCI against him for alleged misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 470 crore. The ED recently issued an international blue notice alert for detention of Modi for alleged serious contraventions of the foreign exchange law in connection with IPL. The notice bears Modis photograph and passport number besides other details.         
	Modi, however, has maintained that he has always co-operated with the ED and that he is ready to appear before the agency personally in London or through video conferencing. BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan had accused Modi of committing financial irregularities mainly in allotment of media rights and free commercial rights.         
	Modis lawyers, who deny all wrongdoing, said that they had heard about the development . Lalit has a valid reason to not return to India because of an elevated threat to his life here, Mahmood Abidi, his lawyer, said.         
	Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Police, on Friday, said it would take them at least one week to take any action against Modi.         
	We have been given a lot of records by the BCCI. Some of them are very complicated. So, we are going to seek the help of experts. After having gone through these records, we can come to a conclusion who are the people we can issue summons to, Chennai police commissioner T Rajendiran said.         
	That will be a logical step and the police have to wait at least for a week, he said, adding, there were some technical issues.         
	The police registered a case against Modi and six others under different sections of IPC, including criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, falsification of accounts and cheating, on Thursday. BCCI secretary Srinivasan had filed a complaint against Modi on Wednesday, alleging criminal misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 470 crore.         
	Modis lawyer had accused Srinivasan of personal vendetta in filing a criminal case against him even while the disciplinary proceedings are on.         
	He said that by filing the criminal complaint, they have rendered the disciplinary proceedings meaningless.           (AGENCIES)

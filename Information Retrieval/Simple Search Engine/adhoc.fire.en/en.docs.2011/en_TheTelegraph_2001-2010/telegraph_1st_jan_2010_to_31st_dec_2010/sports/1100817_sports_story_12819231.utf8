	London: Pakistan were dealt a blow on Monday when wicketkeeper-batsman Zulqarnain Haider was ruled out of the final two Tests against England. The Pakistan Cricket Board said in a statement on Monday that Haider would return home because of a hairline fracture of his finger.         
	The visitors, 2-0 down in the four-match series, take on England in the third Test at the Oval starting on Wednesday. The final game at Lords begins on August 26.         
	Vice-captain Kamran Akmal will now return to the team after being dropped for the second Test. Pakistan are also expected to recall former captain Mohammed Yousuf and Yasir Hameed to bolster the batting.

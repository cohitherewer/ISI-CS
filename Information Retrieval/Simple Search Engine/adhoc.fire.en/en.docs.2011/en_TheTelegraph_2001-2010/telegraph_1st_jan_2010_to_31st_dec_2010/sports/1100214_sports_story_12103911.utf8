	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith made himself available for the second Test match against India, commencing Sunday, at the Eden, despite having a fracture in his little finger on the left hand.         
	Smith had injured his finger during fielding practice on Friday.         
	Graeme is absolutely certain to play tomorrow (Sunday), teams media manager Michael Owen-Smith said on Saturday.         
	When the skipper was asked before the training session in the morning, he tried to put things into perspective as he said that he was confident about dealing with the pain.         
	Its really about dealing with pain. I am confident that I can deal with the pain and get through it. Injuries are a part of every sportsmans career.         
	There were a couple of injuries in the past few months and I have got through reasonably well. The big question is whether you are able to contribute to the teams cause That is something you got to be professional with and find the answer, Smith said.         
	It took a second MRI from the hospital authorities to detect the fracture in one of the joints of his little finger.         
	However, during South Africas net session in the afternoon, on Saturday, Smith didnt look in any discomfort as he faced the likes of Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Wayne Parnell for about 30 minutes. Before that he had a knocking session for about 15 minutes. As he drove the balls, he never flinched even once.         
	After the first session, he went to another net where he practised evading short-pitched stuff as a member of the support staff let a few deliveries fly past his face from close range.         
	The South Africans didnt have fielding session though and Smith didnt engage in any catching practice. This was probably a way of protecting his little finger which had a plaster on it.         
	It will be interesting to see whether Smith, who is a specialist slip fielder, man his usual position when he fields.         
	Later in the day, there was a mild flutter when last matchs double centurion, Hashim Amla, visited a dentist.         
	However, the local manager informed that there was nothing to worry as it was a routine check-up.

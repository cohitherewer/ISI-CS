The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL is clean, says Mallya
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL is clean, says Mallya
                      
	New Delhi: Royal Challengers Bangalore owner Vijay Mallya Tuesday gave a clean chit to the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the wake of the spot-fixing scandal involving the Pakistan team, saying that the Twenty20 event is free from any form of corruption.         
	There is no corruption or match-fixing in IPL. My team has participated in all three editions of the IPL and I can say I am very satisfied that IPL is clean, Mallya said after meeting International Cricket Council (ICC) president Sharad Pawar, at his office here.         
	The ghost of match-fixing scandal returned to haunt world cricket after an alleged bookie, Mazhar Majeed, claimed in a sting operation by a British tabloid that several Pakistan cricketers, including captain Salman Butt and pace duo of Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, were involved in spot-fixing in the third Test, against England, at Lords.         
	Mallya said that there is no place for corruption in cricket and anyone found guilty should be dealt with severely.         
	Any form of corruption in cricket is not just unfortunate, it should not happen at all. It should never be allowed to happen.         
	If it happens, the players should be obviously punished, said the liquor baron, who also owns the Force India Formula One team.         
	I am not a judge, neither I am an adjudicator But as the owner of an IPL team, and being an avid cricket fan, I feel any form of fixing should be dealt with severely, Mallya said.         
	[Earlier in the day, former India pacer Atul Wassan had said that a couple of IPL cricketers, whom he would not name, had been approached for spot-fixing over the last two-and-a-half years.         
	I cannot specify, but some players were approached and this is common knowledge here over the last two-and-a-half years.]           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No change in squad 
                                                                                                                       7                                      No change in squad 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bengal selectors, on Saturday, refused to make sweeping changes in the squad for their next Ranji fixture against Assam at the Eden Gardens from November 17. Chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee said they wanted to give the 15-member squad another chance in the Assam match.         
	The chief selector rued the lack of spin option outside Sourasish Lahiri and Shib Sagar Singh. We dont have an option here (spin department). If anybody is better than A player or B player we will take them, he said.         
	Banerjee said Bengal is taking one game at a time and, therefore, opted against wholesale changes. We want to go step by step. We are not looking for five points directly against Assam. We want to go for three points first. So, we wanted to give them one more chance, he said. But Banerjee was critical about the teams batting. Rohans (Banerjee) dismissal was poor. I dont know why Manoj (Tiwary) went for the third run (he was run out), he said.         
	THE SQUAD: Manoj Tiwary (capt), Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Arindam Das, Sreevats Goswami, Rohan Banerjee, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Anustup Majumder, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourasish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Md. Sami Ahmed, Shib Sagar Singh, Arindam Ghosh, Writam Porel.

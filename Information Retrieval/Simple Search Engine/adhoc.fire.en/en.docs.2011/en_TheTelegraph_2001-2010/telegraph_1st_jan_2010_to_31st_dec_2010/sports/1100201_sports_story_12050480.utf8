	Perth: Australia completed a cleansweep in the one-day International series against Pakistan as they managed a narrow two-wicket victory in the fifth and final match in Perth on Sunday.         
	According to cricinfo, Australia, having bowled out Pakistan for 212, were made to fight every inch for the victory that handed Pakistan their second 5-0 sweep in history. Fittingly, it was Michael Hussey who steered them home with an unbeaten 40.         
	After Clint McKay set the tone with four for 35, there was a welcome return to form for Ricky Ponting, whose 55 gave Australia the early initiative. was never entirely abandoned despite a fighting performance from the Pakistan spinners. Australia had begun the series with a brilliant chase at the Gabba and finished off the rout with Hussey again there to oversee victory, which was achieved in the last over, courtesy a no-ball. They will go into the ODIs against the West Indies in buoyant mood.         
	After four one-sided affairs, it was good to witness a contest in the last match. Defending a low total, Pakistans only chance was to bowl Australia out. They took two wickets inside the fielding Powerplay as the openers fell to aerial shots, but the way Ponting was playing, Australia looked on course for a comfortable win.         
	His first ball was fended wide of the slips for four, and two strokes soon after were especially memorable  an incredible back-foot punch to a length ball and a caressed nudge past square leg.         
	Mohammed Asif had been the best Pakistan bowler in this series, but on Sunday it was the spinners who scrambled Australias intentions and turned a walk in the park into a tiptoe through a minefield. On a pitch that had showed signs of cracking after Pakistans innings, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik, recalled for the specialist spinner Saeed Ajmal, made life difficult for the Australians.         
	The Pakistan team management in Australia has released left-arm pacer Mohammed Aamer and sent him home after he developed a groin problem.         
	Aamir has been released by the team management who felt it would be better if he undergoes rehabilitation course in Lahore under the supervision of the PCB medical panel, a board official said.         
	Meanwhile, taking the moral responsibility of Pakistans shameful performance against Australia in both the Test and one-day series, countrys chief selector Iqbal Qasim Sunday resigned from his post.         
	After the clean sweep in the Test as well as the one-day series in Australia, I dont think I should remain the chief selector, said Qasim, a former spinner.

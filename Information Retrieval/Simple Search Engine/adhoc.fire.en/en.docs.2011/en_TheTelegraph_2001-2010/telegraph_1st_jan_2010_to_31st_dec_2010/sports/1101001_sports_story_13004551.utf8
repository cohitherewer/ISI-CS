The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Never mind, game is on
                                                                                                                       7                                        Never mind, game is on
    - India yet to take a call on Bhajji; Aussies non-committal about Bollinger           SUDIPTO GUPTA            Sachin Tendulkar during a practice session, in Mohali, on Thursday, the eve of Indias first Test against Australia. Ricky Ponting believes that the maestros age-defying performances are an inspiration for everyone around the world. (AFP)                                           
	Mohali: A pessimist is a person who says is the last letter in zero, instead of saying that it is the first alphabet in opportunity --- that is how the funny man may look at things. Wondering what that has to do on the eve of the first India-Australia Test in the two-match series? Not much really if you are a pessimist.         
	But think of the state of cricket, as a sport, these days. The very essence of the game has come under the scanner with the allegations of spot-fixing sprayed all over its context. When every single ball bowled attracts a twitch of the eyebrow, it is very easy join the chorus and say to hell with the game.         
	However, can one escape the euphoria of seeing a Harbhajan Singh thumping his chest after hunting down his eternal rabbit Ricky Ponting? Can one resist the temptation of experiencing a Sachin Tendulkar playing one of his sublime knocks in the guise of butchering the famed Aussie pace attack? Can you deny the fact that it is indeed very very special whenever Laxman wields his willow against the men from Down Under?         
	If not, then brace yourself for one of the most fascinating battles on the cricket pitch when Mahendra Singh Dhonis men take on Pontings army, at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, here, from Friday.         
	Unlike in recent years, when the Australians came to this part of the world as the mightiest, this time it is the Indians who will have to do justice to their No. 1 ranking. The Aussies, then, are the underdogs and their dislike for such a tag can prove to be their inspiration in the upcoming battle.         
	Both India and Australia, in their last Test series, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan respectively, were patchy and that is evident from the results --- a 1-1 sharing of the series. So, form-wise there is not much of a difference. However, the fact that the Indians are the most successful team against Australia in the last decade does provide Dhoni with a psychological edge.         
	Talking of psychology, the efforts of entrapping the opponent in the mind is very much on in both the camps.         
	Sample this: Dhoni says that India are still to take a call on Harbhajan, who is suffering from an ankle sprain, which renders the off-spinner a doubtful starter on Friday. Pontings reply to that: It might just be smoke screen. I dont think Harbhajan will like to miss this match.         
	The Australians praising of Virender Sehwags destructive capabilities may seem quite obvious to the normal eye. But cant it also be a ploy to increase the pressure on the opener, a strategy to unsettle his calm?         
	The Aussies too have kept a cloud cover on pacer Doug Bollingers participation in the first Test. That might also turn out to be an eyewash and, perhaps, a method of spicing things up for a bowling attack which is the weakest for an Australian team in recent years.         
	If normalcy prevails, Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan would share the new ball for India while Bollinger, Mitchell Johnson and Ben Hilfenhaus would do the job for Australia. Amit Mishra, the star in the 2008 India-Australia Test here, is all set to partner Harbhajan in the spin department for India, while Nathan Hauritz will be the lone specialist tweaker at Pontings disposal.         
	And keep an eye on Suresh Raina. He may just deliver what Yuvraj Singh had always promised.         
	The pitch sports a tinge of green. But Mohali, in the last decade, have been fair to both the fast and the slow bowlers. The prolonged monsoon which has left an underlying moisture in the track, in fact, may just tilt the scale in the spinners favour and that may help heal Harbhajans injury quicker!         
	So stop counting the zeroes and relish the promise of opportunities. Lets hope for a spot-less cricket carnival.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The officials of CFL Premier division debutants Southern Samity insulted coach I.M. Vijayan after the team lost against Mohammedan Sporting in a Premier Division match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Thursday.         
	Some club officials want Subhash Bhowmick at the helm and have been making life miserable for Vijayan.         
	On Thursday, as Vijayan was about to enter the dressing room after the match, some officials demanded his removal.         
	The clubs executive committee will meet on Friday to decide on the coachs future.         
	It was bad luck. What more can I say? We missed four sitters! They (club officials) are free to take any decision, Vijayan said after the match.

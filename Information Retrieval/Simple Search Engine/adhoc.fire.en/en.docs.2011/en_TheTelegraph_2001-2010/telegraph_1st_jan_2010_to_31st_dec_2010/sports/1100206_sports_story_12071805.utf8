	Kuala Lumpur: Sania Mizra and Poojashree Venkatesha scored dominating singles victories as India drubbed hosts Malayisa 3-0 to top pool A of the Asia/Oceania Group II competition in the Fed Cup tennis tournament here Friday.         
	With this win, India have qualified for the play-off tie, the winner of which will be promoted to Asia/Oceania Group I.         
	Playing the first rubber, Poojashree thrashed veteran Chin-Bee Khoo 6-1, 6-1 to give India the lead and then Sania secured the tie with an identical win over Jawairiah Noordin in the second rubber.         
	India rested Rushmi Chakravarthy and instead Poojashree partnered Sanaa Bhambri for the doubles rubber, which they won 7-6, 6-2 after beating Noordin and Chin-Bee Khoo.         
	India, who had beaten Singapore 3-0 Thursday, will meet the Pool B topper which will be either Kyrgzstan or Hong Kong.         
	The tie between Kyrgzstan and Hong Kong has been interrupted due to rain.         
	India were relegated to Asia/Oceania group II last year.           (PTI)

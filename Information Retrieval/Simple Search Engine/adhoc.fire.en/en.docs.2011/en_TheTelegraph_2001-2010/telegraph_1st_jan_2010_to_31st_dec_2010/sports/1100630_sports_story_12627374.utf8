The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The best moment of my life: Martino
                                                                                                                       7                                        The best moment of my life: Martino
            JAYDEEP BASU            Japans Yuichi Komano, who missed the penalty, is consoled by Paraguays Nelson Valdez, on Tuesday                           
	Pretoria: There is some consolation for Marcelo Bielsa. On Monday, he watched helplessly from the technical bench as Chiles great World Cup dream went up in smoke against Brazil. But a day later, he had the satisfaction of seeing his protg, Gerardo Martino take Paraguay beyond the second round for the first time in their World Cup history.         
	Martino, an Argentine and one of the greatest players in the history of Newells Old Boys Club, has learned his trade under Bielsa and considers the former Argentina coach as his mentor. In many ways, Martino is Bielsas on-field representative, and he absorbed as much priceless information as he could from the coach, later applying it to his own teams.         
	Known as someone who never loses his composure, the 47-year-old Martino turned emotional after Paraguays 5-3 victory over Japan in the tie-breaker. As his team members hugged each other and celebrated, the coach was wiping tears. Yes, I got emotional, Martino later admitted. There are times when you cant control your emotions. It is the best moment of my life. Till now, beating Argentina in the World Cup qualifiers was my biggest achievement. But nothing can be compared to reaching the World Cup quarter finals, he said.         
	Martino was frank enough to admit that his team was lucky. For both the teams it was a battle to reach the quarter finals for the first time. Going by the trend of the match, either team could have won. After all, penalty shootout is always a kind of gamble.         
	Martino said his team could reach the semi-finals, too. Spain or Portugal are good teams but not unbeatable. Till now we played defensive football. But that doesnt mean we cant score.                 
	The defeat was a big let down for the couple of thousands Japanese fans in the stands. There was also a 400 strong Japanese media contingent to cover what could have been Japans maiden entry into last eight. The one penalty miss by Yuichi Komano cost them dear. Komano was absolutely inconsolable after the match.         
	I dont blame anyone, it was my fault, said the poker faced Japan coach Takeshi Okada. I couldnt insist my boys enough to win. They played wonderfully and I take the blame for what has happened.         
	Japan were capable of going ahead in the tournament, said the coach, who once boasted that his aim was to take Japan to the last four in South Africa. We are as good as any other team who are in last eight.

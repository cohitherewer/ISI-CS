The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well do well in China, says Saina
                                                                                                                       7                                      Well do well in China, says Saina
                      
	Hyderabad: Indias top shuttlers, including Saina Nehwal, on Saturday, said their success at the Commonwealth Games would not put them under pressure to perform at upcoming Asian Games in China.         
	We are all confident that we can do well. We are going to work very hard. I am sure we can do well, Saina, who won gold medal in the womens singles event, told reporters here.         
	Jwala Gutta, who along with Ashwini Ponappa won the womens doubles gold, said the good show in Delhi would actually add to their confidence.         
	Winning before any big tournament is always good. It boosts your confidence. I am sure we will go with lot more enthusiasm. You can expect us to perform very well. I am confident that we will do well, Jwala said.         
	Kashyap, who won bronze in mens singles, also echoed the same sentiment. I am happy with my performance. This helps to do well in future, he said.         
	The four shuttlers arrived in the city to a rousing reception from their family members, fans and well-wishers.         
	I was not aware that our medal would make a difference to the medals tally. When Gopi sir (national coach Pullela Gopichand) told me that, I was really happy, said Ashwini.         
	Jwala thanked the Central Government for the support.         
	I am very proud to be part of the Indian contingent overall. We really worked hard, all of us, 14 days. We got one medal, Jwala said.         
	I could probably say that our one medal is equivalent to 101 medals in the country. We enjoyed the stay, enjoyed the competition. I am sure we will bring laurels to the country in future, she added.

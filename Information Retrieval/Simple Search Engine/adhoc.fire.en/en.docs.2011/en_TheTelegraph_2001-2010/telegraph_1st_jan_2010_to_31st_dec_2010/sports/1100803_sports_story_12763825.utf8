The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not official, but Raina   set to retain his place 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Not official, but Raina   set to retain his place 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Suresh Raina during practice, on Monday                                 
	Colombo: Its not official, but Suresh Raina will keep his place in the Team India XI. Yuvraj Singh has recovered from his illness, but must wait to make a comeback.         
	With Sri Lanka ahead 1-0 in the three-match Micromax Cup, theres plenty at stake in the final Test, at the P. Sara Oval, from Tuesday.         
	Of course, its a setback for Yuvraj, whod been dropped for the recent Asia Cup, but the think tank couldnt have kept Raina out after such a splendid hundred on debut, at the SSC, less than a week ago.         
	Raina stays... It wasnt a very easy decision, but had to be taken... One of them had to be the loser... As it turns out, its the more experienced player, a well-placed source told The Telegraph, late on Monday.         
	Given the sensitive nature, the other sources went into the silent mode. Cells kept ringing and phones in their Taj Samudra rooms also went unanswered...         
	The decision, one learns, was taken before the team meeting. However, it was behind closed doors that it got communicated.         
	Whats officially confirmed is that opener Gautam Gambhir, a key player, wont be seen in action once again. A bad right knee had kept him out of the second Test.         
	Murali Vijay, therefore, will stay as vice-captain Virender Sehwags partner at the top of the order.         
	The most experienced spinner, Harbhajan Singh, wont be playing either. Hed been recovering from a strain on the left side when, during a run on the beach on Sunday evening, he strained his right calf muscle.         
	I cant even move... It may take a couple of weeks for me to recover... Ek injury pehle ho gayi thi, now this... Im very disappointed, Harbhajan said, speaking exclusively.         
	Frankly, hed been struggling with the Kookaburra in Sri Lanka.         
	With Amit Mishra being the lone spinner in the reserves, its assumed hell be making the XI.         
	Should captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten decide to gamble with three seamers, then Munaf Patel will have to take the highly unimpressive Pragyan Ojhas place.         
	For a change, the wicket has quite a bit of grass.         
	The Test will be very special for Sachin Tendulkar as hell be making his 169th appearance  one more than Steve Waugh, very much an icon, too.         
	Another record, then, for the accumulator of hundreds.         
	To talk of the Sri Lanka XI, Lasith Malinga is going to return, in all probability at the expense of Dammika Prasad. Then, Ajantha Mendis could get dropped, with Rangana Herath staging a comeback.         
	Again, it would make sense for the captain winning the toss to bat. Given his track record on the calling-front, Dhoni may say an extra prayer.         
	Whether he wins the toss or not, Dhoni will have to take that extra initiative, for the hard running has to be all done by Team India.

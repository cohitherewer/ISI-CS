The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dad praises the siblings
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dad praises the siblings
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	He has been there from the first ball they struck and for the 14th Wimbledon for Venus and 11th for Serena, their father was there to oversee the continuation of the entire, fascinating Williams project.         
	I dont know how long it will go on because I really think they have done everything that can be done, Richard Williams said on the Centre Court ramparts after his younger daughter had bagged the familys 12th Grand Slam singles title.         
	What is amazing to me is that when an athlete gets to the levels that Venus and Serena have reached, the tendency is for them not to be as hungry as before, but they dont show that at all. They just love to win.         
	With her 6-3, 6-2 victory over Vera Zvonareva, the 25-year-old Russian, in Saturdays final, it is clear we are a long way from the thrill of victory being quenched as far as Serena is concerned.         
	She flounced around the court, delivering crushing winner upon crushing winner, serving with the placement and power that are matchless in the womens game and further endorsing all that Richard said when tennis writers first drooled over Venuss talent  Ive got another one who is going to be even better.         
	He knew from the moment they re-entered the gates three weeks ago that his younger daughter would take a lot of shifting. He said: Serena wanted to win so badly and when it was time for practice she would say, I want everyone quiet. I can win this tournament.         
	I could say things, like, Look at the ball, but that was really it. Only myself, her mom and her trainer could come on to her court.         
	Remarkably, Richard expressed surprise that his daughters entered the championships as the top two seeds  Venus lost discouragingly badly, 6-2, 6-3 to Tsvetana Pironkova, the unseeded Bulgarian, in the quarter finals  for the first time since 2002. With the problems they had, with Serenas knee hurting and Venuss hip was hurting, it is truly wonderful they have done this, Williams, who is approaching 70, said.         
	Every year they come back is a major surprise for me. Im old now. I wonder how long I can do this. One cannot imagine the sisters trusting themselves to anyone other than Richard or Oracene, his former wife, who always travels with the girls to the Australian and French Opens.

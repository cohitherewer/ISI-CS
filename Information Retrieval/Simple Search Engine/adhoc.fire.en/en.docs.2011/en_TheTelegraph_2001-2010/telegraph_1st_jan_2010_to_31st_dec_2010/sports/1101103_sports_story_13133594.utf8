The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB: Duo need to respect Code
                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB: Duo need to respect Code
                      
	Karachi: A day after Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer lashed out at the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Tuesday said that the suspended cricketers need to show respect to the governing bodys Code of Conduct commission tribunal as it could affect their case.         
	The PCBs legal advisor, Tafazzul Rizvi said the comments made by the two players at the airport and on channels after returning from Dubai were inappropriate and could affect their cases in the final hearing of the ICC tribunal.         
	Butt and Aamer had lashed out at the ICC on returning home after their appeals were rejected by the ICC tribunal headed by Michael Beloff QC who said there was sufficient evidence to stop the players from playing cricket.         
	Butt and Aamer had accused the ICC of bias and trying to corner Pakistan cricket.         
	Rizvi said he was surprised at the reaction of the two players. I dont think their attitude or statements are appropriate. If they had any reservations over the fairness of the tribunal they should have raised this issue during the hearing itself, he said. It is not fair that after accepting the authority of the tribunal and attending a nearly 12 hour hearing the players are now questioning the tribunal.         
	They shouldnt be criticising the ICC like this and the PCB has nothing to do with it. The fact that the players have not shown respect and regard for the tribunal proceedings could go against them at the final hearing, he added.         
	Meanwhile the former ICC president, Ehsan Mani has also criticised the two suspended players for their comments and said he didnt think the ICC was biased towards Pakistan. (PTI)

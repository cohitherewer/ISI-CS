The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil can win ugly, says Fabiano
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazil can win ugly, says Fabiano
                                Luis Fabiano      
	Johannesburg: Brazil striker Luis Fabiano says that his countrys main objective is to win their sixth World Cup title in South Africa and if they have to do it in ugly fashion, well, thats no problem.         
	The 29-year-old Sevilla hitman  who incidentally wants to finish the tournaments top scorer  said it was pointless playing pretty football if it did not lead them to the trophy.         
	If it is necessary to play dirty to win, we will do it, what counts at the World Cup is to win, said Fabiano at Brazils training camp. I am at a stage where I want to achieve several goals. I have already achieved one, which is to be here with the squad.         
	Above all the most important target is to be crowned champions. To be leading scorer is a consequence of those efforts during the whole of the tournament, added Fabiano, who has formed a potent strike partnership with Robinho since 2007.         
	Brazil, who topped the South American qualifying group, are in Group G  the so-called group of death  along with 2006 semi-finalists Portugal, Ivory Coast and Korea DPR, who they play first up on June 15.         
	This Brazil side are full of desire and, under Dungas direction, have showed on more than one occasion that they are willing to get down and dirty with victory at stake.         
	Not only that, the will to win, it seems, has relegated everything else to the background.         
	Prize money has always been a thorny issue for Brazil teams in the run-up to past tournaments, but current players and coaches are downplaying the issue.         
	I have a particular view on this, Dunga said. Everything has to be agreed ahead of time. If you agree before it begins, then there wont be any problems.         
	Dunga knows first hand the difficulties the subject of money can raise. At the 1990 World Cup in Italy, he was one of the players who participated in a protest over prize money negotiations. Some players attempted to cover the sponsors logos on their jersey in official photos.         
	Dungas current assistant coach, former Brazil right back Jorginho, too, had participated in that protest, as did former goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel, one of the teams observers at this years tournament.         
	That was different, Dunga said. We were a new group and the (confederation) president was just starting. After that World Cup, we never had any other problems.         
	The president of the Brazilian football federation at the time was Ricardo Teixeira, who remains in charge. He does not disclose prize money on offer to players and the rest of the delegation, saying only that it depends on the number of wins achieved by the team.         
	The prize money for winning this World Cup is expected to surpass the amount on offer at the previous two tournaments. Brazil reportedly awarded each player about $250,000 for the title in 2002 in South Korea and Japan, and they would have won nearly $300,000 each if Brazil had won in 2006.         
	Brazil now have more than 10 official sponsors, the most ever for the national team. Its always the same thing, but the players are not talking about that, Brazilian football federation spokesman Rodrigo Paiva said. The prize will be announced to the players before the World Cup begins and thats it.         
	The prize money is unlikely to make a lot of difference to most players in this years squad. Nearly all of them already have multi-million dollar contracts with European clubs and are set financially.

	New Delhi: Australia continued to dominate the Commonwealth Games with a swelling medals tally, but the English swimmers made their mark at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee pool, on Tuesday.         
	While Francesca Halsall won the first gold medal for England, Liam Tancock immediately grabbed a second one.         
	Halsall stormed to 50mbutterfly gold, creating a new British record of 26.24 seconds, defeating Australian teen sensation Emily Seebohm in the process, and remained on course for six gold medals.         
	Leiston Pickett gave Australia their fourth gold of the six-day swimming meet, with a win in the womens 50m breaststroke.         
	Meanwhile in the mens 200m freestyle final, Australias Kenrick Monk was edged out by Scottish swimmer Robbie Renwick, missing the gold medal by a heart-breaking two-hundredths of a second.         
	In cycling, Australia made a clean sweep of the three gold medals up for grabs, on the first day of action, at the Yamuna Velodrome.         
	Scott Sunderland set a Games record of one minute and 01.411 seconds, to win the 1km time trial by more than one second. Jack Bobridge took gold in the 4,000m individual pursuit, while Anna Meares defended her 500m time trial title in a new Games record of 33.758 seconds.         
	The Malaysians also came good in weightlifting, when Aricco Jumitih gave his country the second gold medal of the Games by edging out compatriot Naharudin Mayudin for the 62kg title.         
	Jumitih, one of the favourites, had struggled in the snatch, lifting 120kg to stand at fourth place, but he hauled 156kg in the clean and jerk, for an overall total of 276kg.         
	That was one kilo better than Mayudin, who led after the snatch with a lift of 125kg, but finished on 275kg.         
	Sri Lankas Anton Kurukulaasooriyage took bronze with a final lift of 152kg for an overall 272, which denied Rustum Sarang of a medal, after the Indian failed at 153kg.         
	On Monday, Amirul Hamizan Ibrahim had won the 56kg title for Malaysia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shiv Kapur tied 17th 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shiv Kapur tied 17th 
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Shiv Kapur turned in a brilliant four-under 68 to lie tied 17th after the first round of the Abu Dhabi Open, here on Thursday. The Delhi golfer sank as many as five birdies against a bogey to lie three strokes adrift of the leading trio of Ian Poulter, Richard Bland and Keith Horne, who brought home an identical round of 65 each.         
	Spains Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland shot 66s to follow in a group of nine.         
	Poulter made seven birdies, including a 70-foot putt at the last that if it hadnt gone in would have gone 10 foot past the hole.         
	Todd Hamilton, the 2004 British Open champion, shot a 68. Defending European money list winner Lee Westwood hit a 69.         
	Jyoti Randhawa carded a two-under 70 for his tied 36th place, while SSP Chowrasia turned in a level-par 72 to lie tied 72nd.         
	However, senior pro Jeev Milkha Singh had the most disappointing day among the Indians as he carded one-over 73 to lie tied 88th. Playing his back nine first, Kapur picked up a stroke on the 10th but stumbled to a bogey on the 16th before dropping consecutive birdies on 17th and 18th to take the turn at two-under.

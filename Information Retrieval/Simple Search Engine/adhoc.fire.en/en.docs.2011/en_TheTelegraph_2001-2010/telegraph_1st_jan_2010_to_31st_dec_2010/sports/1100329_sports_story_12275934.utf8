	Ahmedabad: Naman Ojha hammered a 49-ball 80 before his bowling colleagues produced a disciplined performance to help the Rajasthan Royals to a thumping 17-run victory over the Chennai Super Kings in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match here Sunday.         
	Electing to bat, the Rajasthan Royals scored a challenging 177 for eight, thanks mainly to wicketkepeer-batsman Ojhas blistering innings which was laced with six fours and five sixes. They then restricted the Super Kings to 160 for six to notch up their fourth win on the trot and fourth out of seven matches in this IPL.           (PTI)

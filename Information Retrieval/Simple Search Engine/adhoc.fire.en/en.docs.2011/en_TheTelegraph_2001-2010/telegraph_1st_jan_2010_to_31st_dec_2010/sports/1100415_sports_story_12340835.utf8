The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal, Djokovic advance
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nadal, Djokovic advance
    - Monte Carlo Masters Murray loses in straight sets                 Rafael Nadal hits a backhand against Thiemo de Bakker on Wednesday                           
	Monaco: Rafael Nadal thrashed Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-0 Wednesday to win his 28th straight match at the Monte Carlo Masters, and top-seeded Novak Djokovic also won in straight sets to advance to the third round.         
	The second-seeded Nadal broke serve five times in the match. The Spaniard has won five straight titles at Monte Carlo, where he hasnt lost since a third-round exit to Guillermo Coria in 2003. He missed the 2004 event because of injury.         
	I expected it to be a bit tougher. I played well, I played a very solid match. No mistakes, Nadal said. This tournament is one of my favourites.         
	Australian Open finalist Andy Murray lost 2-6, 1-6 to Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany. The third-seeded Briton dropped serve five times and failed to earn a single breakpoint chance.         
	I just couldnt find the court. When its like that, its kind of difficult to play, Murray said. I tried a few different things. I tried serve and volleying a couple of times, I tried hitting some high balls. (It) didnt make a whole lot of difference.         
	Murray has lost his last two opening matches in straight sets, following his defeat to Mardy Fish in the second round at the Sony Ericsson Open last month.         
	The last two tournaments have been bad. Its been a long time since I lost a couple of matches like this, Murray said. I have to make sure that I dont panic.         
	Nadal next plays Michael Berrer after the German beat 14th-seeded Juan Monaco of Argentina 6-4, 6-4.         
	Djokovic beat Florent Serra of France 6-2, 6-3. Djokovic raced into a 4-0 lead in his first clay-court match of the season, but faltered at times. He faced nine break points overall and lost his serve once in each set. He won on his first match point when Serras backhand return bounced out.         
	There were some moments in the match that were a little bit difficult for me, Djokovic said. Some things can be better, like (my) serve and maybe some (of my) movement.         
	Djokovic recently split with Todd Martin after hiring him to work in tandem with longtime coach Marian Vajda.         
	Martin had been working with Djokovic on his serve, but the Serb is now trying to go back to his old way of serving.         
	Its very confusing, its complicated, Djokovic said. The worst thing you can do is to think about a bunch of different things technically because then you come to the stage where you dont know what to do.         
	Djokovic plays 13th-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka and said he expects a tough match against his Swiss opponent, who he leads 7-2.         
	We had so many long matches, especially the one we had here last year  three sets in the semis, Djokovic said. I wouldnt be surprised if we go the distance again.         
	Two-time former champion Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, No. 8 Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia, No. 11 David Ferrer of Spain, No. 12 Tommy Robredo of Spain and Wawrinka also advanced in straight sets.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The chairman of national selection committee, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, on Friday sought to allay apprehensions about players fitness following the selection of the 15-member squad for the upcoming World T20 championship in the West Indies.         
	We have selected the best team ... Everybody is 100 per cent fit. They have been picked after their fitness certificates were submitted to the Board, Srikkanth told reporters after the five-man committee meeting at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday.         
	There were concerns about Gautam Gambhir and Ashish Nehra, both of whom underwent ayurvedic treatment in Sri Lanka for hamstring and rib injuries, respectively. But Srikkanth refused to comment on any individual player.         
	The selectors chairman was of the opinion that batting would be Indias strong point in the event that is to be held from April 30 to May 16.         
	Our batting is very powerful and the pitches in the Caribbean would be similar to those in India. That will suit our batsmen, he said.

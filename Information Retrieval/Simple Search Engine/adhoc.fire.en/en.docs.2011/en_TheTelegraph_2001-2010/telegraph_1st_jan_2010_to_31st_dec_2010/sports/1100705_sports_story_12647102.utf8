            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Englands 3-2 series victory over Australia has earned them four ratings points which puts Andrew Strauss and Co. ahead of New Zealand in fourth position on 115 ratings points, in the latest ICC ODI rankings. The English can further narrow the gap with third-placed India if they perform well in the series against Bangladesh and Pakistan.         
	Australia, thanks to the big lead over second-placed South Africa, have retained their top position but, after conceding three ratings points, have had the gap between them and Graeme Smiths side reduced to just 11 ratings points.         
	The ODI rankings list for batsmen is headed by Mahendra Singh Dhoni with South Africas AB de Villiers at No.2 and two ratings points behind the Team India skipper. Three other Indians  Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh  were tied at No.17 with an identical 655 points.         
	In the recent England-Australia five match rubber that saw some high-voltage action, it was the bowlers Doug Bollinger and Ryan Harris of Australia and England off-spinner Graeme Swann who turned in performances that have seen them rocket into the top 20 of the rankings for ODI bowlers.

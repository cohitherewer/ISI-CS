The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 335-340 was in our reach
                                                                                                                       7                                      335-340 was in our reach
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla admitted that pathetic bowling and poor fielding led to their 29-run loss in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final against Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.         
	When they made 379, the match was as good as over. A score of around 335 to 340 could have still been chased on such a batting beauty. It baffles me how we keep losing in the title round every time, Shukla told The Telegraph, after reaching Calcutta late on Tuesday night.         
	Im really upset in the manner we bowled and fielded. Our two strike bowlers, Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda, couldnt provide us with the breakthroughs. Also, the batting Powerplay cost us dear., Shukla said.         
	Shukla will be joining KKR camp from Thursday after taking a days break.

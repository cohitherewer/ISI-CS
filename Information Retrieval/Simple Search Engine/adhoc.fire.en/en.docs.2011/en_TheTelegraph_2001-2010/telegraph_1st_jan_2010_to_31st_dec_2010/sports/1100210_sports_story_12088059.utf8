                                                                                                                       7                                      Public sale of tickets from today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Season tickets for the second Test against South Africa will go on sale for the public from Wednesday from the counters at Pankaj Gupta Indoor Coaching Centre.         
	Despite Indias abject surrender in Nagpur, ticket sales increased on the second day of sale for the CABs affiliated units. While only 325 tickets were sold on Monday, 893 were picked up by the affiliated units on Tuesday.         
	Around 8000 tickets will be available for the public on first-come-first-serve basis. The unsold tickets, if any, will be made available on a daily basis on the days of the match.         
	The CAB officials are hoping that sales will get a boost once the cricketers arrive in the city on Thursday. The Eden will have a reduced capacity of around 43,000 for the Test.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Duo dropped from ICC list 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pakistan pace duo of Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer have been removed from the list of nominees for the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Test Player of the Year and Emerging Player of the Year awards, respectively.         
	Asif and Aamer are two of the three Pakistan cricketers under investigation in the spot-fixing scandal and have been provisionally suspended by the ICC. Test captain Salman Butt is the other player.         
	The names of both the players have been withdrawn. The voting academy has been informed of this decision, an ICC spokesman told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	The 18-year-old Aamer, who was one of the 16 cricketers nominated for the annual awards, was the favourite to bag the honour.         
	In accordance with the provisions of the code, this means they are immediately barred from participating in all forms of cricket and related activities until the case has been concluded, the ICC had said in a statement late on Thursday.         
	The 2010 awards recognise cricketing achievement for the period between August 24, 2009 and August 10, 2010. During the period, Aamer bagged 33 wickets in nine Tests while Asif clinched 55 wickets in 12 Tests.

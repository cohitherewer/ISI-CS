  - Ledley sacrifices kickabout for england       [+uc('Henry Winter   The Daily Telegraph')+]                            
	Ledley Kings chronic knee condition has induced many painful twinges, not least when his son Coby looks at him hopefully, beseeches his father for a kickabout and then the five year-olds face drops as the Spurs and England defender refuses.         
	King can risk his damaged bones for club and country but not for his flesh and blood. Where once there was cartilage, only frustration now resides.         
	Coby loves football and theres plenty of times when hes trying to get me out in the garden or in the park to play and it can be tough, King reflected on Sunday at Englands World Cup base.         
	I have to say no. Hes heard enough to know theres some kind of a problem with the knee but as a kid you cant really understand that. Its difficult as a dad to say, I cant come and play.         
	The knee is that bad. Every time I get up and walk, there are restrictions with the knee, explained King, who has learned to deal with the psychological impact of the complaint by reading Paul McGraths autobiography.         
	He suffered knee problems and still managed to perform at a high level. I picked up things on how his mind worked. There are times when you do doubt yourself because youre not training and dont have the same sharpness.         
	Englands camp resembles the battle of wounded knee with Rio Ferdinand hobbling out of the World Cup, meaning King should partner John Terry in the final warm-up game against the local side, Platinum Stars.         
	The need to protect his knee means King will then manage only one proper training session before Saturdays World Cup opener against the United States at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. Ill speak to the manager to see which day he feels is important for his preparations for the team and Ill try to be out there for that day.         
	Its been a bit of a shock to the players and maybe the staff but the manager has been brilliant. Hes told me to do what I would normally do. Its great for me to have that much respect from somebody of his magnitude. Im hopeful I can repay that faith.         
	Of the possible long-term risks to his knee by continuing to play, King shrugged. Had the surgeons warned him he could end up in a wheelchair? I wasnt listening if they did, replied the 29 year-old. A career is short. No player really knows when their time is going to end, so Im trying to concentrate on doing as much as I can. No player can guarantee their fitness. What I can guarantee is that I will give 100 per cent.         
	The King-Terry axis has not been tried since Estonia away three years ago, has been used only five times and working on their understanding is complicated with King sitting out most sessions. Its difficult. But Ive watched enough of John for years. Ive played with him and know his game. Communication is key. Hes a big talker and I will talk and Im sure well be fine.         
	His competitive debut for England came in the 2-1 reverse to France at Euro 2004. It was an insane game. It showed how you can be doing well but it only takes a second for a bit of magic to strike and obviously Zinedine Zidane got the free-kick and penalty in the last minute to put the game to bed.         
	I went home early from the tournament because my son was born nine weeks early. It was a tough decision but one I felt I had to make.         
	Cobys name is even interwoven in an elaborate tattoo on his left arm. Utterly devoted to Coby, Kings frustration that he cannot enjoy kickabouts with his son runs deep. He has to save himself for club and country.

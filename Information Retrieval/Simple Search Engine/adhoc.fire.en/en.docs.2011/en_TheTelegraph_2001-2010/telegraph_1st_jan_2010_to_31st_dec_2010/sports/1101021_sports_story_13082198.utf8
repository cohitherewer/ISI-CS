	New Delhi: A week after being thrashed by Yemen at home, India jumped 16 places in the Fifa rankings to find themselves at the 144th spot on Wednesday.         
	Reduced to 162th in the previous rankings, Indias upward movement was definitely helped by their two victories over Namibia and Vietnam in the last one month.         
	The overall scenario, however, remained gloomy as India also lost four matches against         
	Thailand (twice), Hong Kong and Yemen during this period. India s three opponents in the Asian Cup final rounds group league in January are Australia (ranked 21st), South Korea (40th) and Bahrain (84th).         
	In the London Olympics qualifiers, India, ranked 24th in Asia, have been drawn to play against Myanmar. The matches will be played on February 23 and March 9, 2011.         
	In the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup, India have been clubbed with Turkmenistan and Pakistan. One more team will qualify to make it a four-team group.

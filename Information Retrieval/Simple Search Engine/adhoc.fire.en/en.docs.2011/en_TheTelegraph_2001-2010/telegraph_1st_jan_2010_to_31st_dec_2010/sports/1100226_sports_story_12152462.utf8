                                                                                                                       7                                      Selectors give the seniors a break
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With the three-match one-day International (ODI) series sealed, the Krisnamachari Srikkanth-led selection committee opted to rest maestro Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag for Saturdays third and final ODI against South Africa, in Ahmedabad.         
	India have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead after the thumping 153-run victory against the Proteas in the second ODI in Gwalior on Wednesday. The series had begun with victory in the first ODI in Jaipur.         
	After a meeting held at the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association offices, in Chennai, on Thursday, the selectors omitted pacer Praveen Kumar and all-rounder Abhishek Nayar from the 14-member squad for the ODI at Motera.         
	Tamil Nadu opener Murali Vijay, Mumbai batsman Rohit Sharma and Karnataka pacer Abhimanyu Mithun were included.         
	Harbhajan Singh, who had opted out of the first two matches because of his sisters wedding, was not considered.         
	[That the off-spinner might not figure in the squad for the final ODI if Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. took an unbeatable lead in Gwalior was reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday.]         
	In the absence of Tendulkar, who created history in Gwalior by becoming the first to score a double hundred in ODIs, and Sehwag, Vijay and Dinesh Karthik are expected to open the innings.

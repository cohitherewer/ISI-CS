                  Chris Gayle made 88                     
	Providence (Guyana): Chris Gayle and Narsingh Deonarine hit half-centuries as West Indies beat Zimbabwe by four wickets in the second one-day International on Saturday.         
	Zimbabwe failed to defend a target of 207, as Gayle top scored with 88 off 111 balls and Deonarine supported with 65 from 85 balls.         
	The result brought West Indies level 1-1 in the five-match series, after Zimbabwe won the opener on Thursday at the same venue.         
	It was also West Indies first victory since a depleted side prevailed over Bangladesh by five runs in a Twenty20 International last August in St. Kitts. This is a big relief, said Gayle. Hopefully, this is the first of many to come.         
	I must commend Zimbabwe on the way they have gone about their business in this series. They have played some good cricket, and they have put us under a lot of pressure.         
	It wasnt an easy game, but I am happy that we rebounded, and we won this game. Hopefully, we can carry on for the remainder of the series.         
	Elton Chigumbura had struck five fours in his 50 from 72 balls, as Zimbabwe were dismissed for 206 in 49.5 overs after they opted to bat.         
	The Zimbabweans were dismantled by left-arm spinner Nikita Miller who took a career-best four for 43 runs from 10 overs, and fast bowler Kemar Roach with three for 37 from 9.5 overs.         
	Zimbabwe seemed to have taken control of the match when the West Indies were reduced to 85 for four in the 26th over. Deonarine and Gayle then fought back into the match with a stand of 83 for the fifth wicket.         
	Then leg-spinner Graeme Cremer had Gayle stumped with West Indies still needing 39 from the last 49 balls.         
	When Price had Kieron Pollard caught at long-on three overs later, West Indies could have been facing trouble. But this time, there was no late drama, as Darren Sammy hit Price to long-off for four to seal the victory.

	The game of soccer is a great leveller. For the past few years, running down Calcutta football had become a kind of fashion among players and officials from other states.         
	So much so that a few days ago, I was told the national coach had made it clear in a meeting that he would never hold any camp in Calcutta.         
	Given the current scenario, I was happy to see East Bengal bagging the Federation Cup in Cuttack, and also maintaining their winning run in the Calcutta Football League (CFL).         
	So far, they have won 16 matches on the trot, something they could achieve only twice in the past. I remember East Bengal winning the Calcutta league without conceding a goal in 1972 under my coaching.         
	If I recall correctly, they also stayed unbeaten for several matches in the 90s, when Debasish Mukherjee enjoyed a great time under the bar.         
	Yet, there is a difference. Previously, on both occasions, the local players were mainly responsible for the success of East Bengal. In 1972, I had players like Arun Banerjee, Sudhir Karmakar and Gautam Sarkar, who formed the backbone of the team.         
	These days, domestic football is mainly played on the strength of foreign footballers. Among the top clubs, East Bengals foreign recruits looked the best and it benefited them hugely.         
	I am not denying the local players their due, but they played a secondary role in most of the matches.         
	The situation wasnt the same before. In Srinagar in 1986, the last time Mohun Bagan and East Bengal played in the Federation Cup final outside Calcutta, before the Cuttack tournament, both sides were depleted because of the national camp that I was running for the Asian Games.         
	Yet, the two teams played quality football in the final.         
	In Cuttack, the final was a mediocre affair with none of the teams managing to do anything spectacular. There was a big crowd for the final, but I am sure the spectators were not fully satisfied in the end.         
	But, then, why blame club football only? After months of intense training, the national team looked an ordinary side in the six matches they have played so far in Bangkok, Delhi, and Pune.         
	What happened in the match against Yemen was a disaster. I cant imagine losing a match against an Asian side by six goals, that, too, on the home turf.         
	In 2006, India lost to Yemen 0-3 in Delhi and the then coach, Syed Nayeemuddin, was shown the door the next day. My question is why the federation bosses are not uttering a word after losing 3-6 against the same team.         
	Is losing four out of the last six friendly matches in the last one month a sign of improvement?         
	Reports say that players like Mahesh Gawli, Anwar, Mohammed Rafi, Stephen Dias, Bhaichung Bhutia and few other players are nursing injuries. I know injuries are part of the game, but the list seems to be getting longer and longer.         
	Last but not the least, the supervision in the Federation Cup left a lot to be desired.         
	Throughout my career in football, I had always avoided commenting on the referees but what happened in Cuttack was simply shocking.         
	In the last couple of years, I was often told that refereeing in India, and the postings in important tournaments are handled by some officials who are involved in nepotism and promoting incompetent people.         
	After watching the Federation Cup, I have a good mind to believe the rumours.

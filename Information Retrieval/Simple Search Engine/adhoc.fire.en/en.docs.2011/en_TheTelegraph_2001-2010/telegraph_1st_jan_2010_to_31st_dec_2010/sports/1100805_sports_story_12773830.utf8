The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John wouldve picked Yuvi
                                                                                                                       7                                        John wouldve picked Yuvi
  - Im for consistency in selection, says former Australia coach       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Colombo: If John Buchanan had a role in Team India, he would have voted for Yuvraj Singhs return to the XI, even though replacement Suresh Raina got a hundred on Test debut.         
	Im for consistency in selection... Unless the selectors had informed Yuvraj, before the series, that his place wasnt guaranteed, I would have picked him once he became available, Buchanan told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Wednesday evening, after another busy day in connection with his Beyond Boundaries assignment in the Sri Lanka capital, Buchanan added: Theres merit in being consistent... I can cite the example of the 2007 World Cup, when Brad Hodge got dropped after a hundred, as Andrew Symonds had become fit...         
	Buchanan was responding to a question on how he would have reacted if confronted by the Yuvraj-Raina dilemma.         
	Yuvraj played the first Test, wasnt available (on account of illness) for the second, where Raina became a centurion on debut, and then got overlooked in the ongoing final Test.         
	Arguably the most successful coach of any national team, Buchanan, who worked with Australia from late 1999 to early 2007, may watch the Test at the P. Sara Oval on Friday.         
	I have prior commitments on Thursday, chiefly interacting with Sri Lanka Cricket coaches... The provincial ones could also be there, Buchanan said.         
	Buchanan coached the Kolkata Knight Riders in the first two seasons of the IPL, but he hasnt bumped into anybody from the franchise here. The Knights development squad has been in the country for around 10 days.

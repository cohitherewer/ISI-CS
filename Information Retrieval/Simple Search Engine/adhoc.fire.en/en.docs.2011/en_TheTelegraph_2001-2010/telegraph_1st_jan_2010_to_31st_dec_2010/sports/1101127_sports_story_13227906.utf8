The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lukewarm response in Guwahati 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lukewarm response in Guwahati 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag are as much a force off the ground as they are on it.         
	This has been more than underlined by the tepid response to ticket sales for the first one-dayer against New Zealand at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. Of the 16,150 tickets put on sale from November 22, just over 10,000 has been sold till date.         
	Things have come to such a pass that Biswanath Saha, in-charge of ticket sales at the Assam Cricket Association (ACA), virtually issued an appeal this evening that fans should buy tickets from the counters set up within the stadium and not fall prey to touts. In the past, forged tickets have been found, he said.         
	Though Saha did not specify the reason for the lukewarm response, Assam Cricket Association (ACA) insiders were admitting in private that the absence of Dhoni, Tendulkar, Sehwag, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh was the cause.

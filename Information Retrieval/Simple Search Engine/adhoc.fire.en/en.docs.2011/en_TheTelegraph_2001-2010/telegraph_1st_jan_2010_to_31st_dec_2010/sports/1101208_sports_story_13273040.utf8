The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting defiant in face of crisis
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ponting defiant in face of crisis

	Adelaide: Ricky Pontings captaincy may be at crisis point, but he was defiant after one of Australias biggest defeats by England and talked of staging a remarkable Ashes recovery.         
	Ponting has seen his side beaten in Adelaide and outplayed for the second half of the first Test in Brisbane, leaving England one Test victory away from ensuring a drawn series that would be enough to prevent Australia regaining the Ashes.         
	With his own lack of runs to address and a replacement needed for Simon Katich, as well as question marks over the places of three or four other players, Pontings captaincy may well be defined by the decisions taken over the next few days.         
	Its a bad loss for us, he said. An innings and 71 runs having won the toss on a good wicket says it all. We were out-batted, bowled and fielded in this entire game. Weve done a lot of talking about how were going to change and rectify things, but our actions have let us down.         
	We have to win two Tests to win the Ashes and well have to play better than we have in the last Test and a half. There has been no lack of fight or endeavour. Its been our skills and thought-processes have let us down.         
	Australias selectors are due to meet Ponting soon to discuss their options before announcing a squad over the weekend for the third Test in Perth.         
	Meanwhile, in the England camp, there was joy. The best feeling is walking into the dressing room having won this Test match, said Kevin Pietersen. Four years ago it was a very, very horrible dressing room to walk back into. It was a very quiet dressing room, a very negative dressing room, and not as united as the dressing room is at the moment.         
	We need to enjoy this and savour it because it is a special victory for us and in some ways it exorcises some of the demons from four years ago here, said Andrew Strauss.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson blasts inept FA
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ferguson blasts inept FA
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has accused the Football Association of running a dysfunctional disciplinary system.         
	Less than two months after Rio Ferdinand was eventually banned for four games following a video review of his attack on Hull striker Craig Fagan at Old Trafford, Manchester United find they must face Steven Gerrard during Sundays encounter with Liverpool, even though the midfielder appeared to commit two indiscretions recently that could have resulted in further action.         
	Instead, both an alleged V-sign to referee Andre Marriner in the recent defeat to Wigan and a nasty-looking challenge on Portsmouths Michael Brown at Anfield on Monday have both gone unpunished.         
	United manager Ferguson said: I didnt expect anything to happen to Steven Gerrard. It (the disciplinary panel) is a dysfunctional unit. I dont know what they are doing.         
	Ferguson has long held the view that his side are disadvantaged in their dealings with the FA.         
	The latest events will not have altered that opinion given Ferdinand had an additional match added to what would have been a three-game suspension for what was deemed to be a frivolous appeal over the Fagan incident.         
	At the time, Ferguson highlighted what he felt was a similar incident involving another Liverpool player, Javier Mascherano, at Leeds during a Carling Cup tie earlier in the campaign which, like the Gerrard situations, did not warrant any further attention.         
	There is no consistency for a start and I didnt expect to get any, continued Ferguson. I am not too bothered about it. They can do what they want down there. It is crazy at times.         
	Meanwhile, Ryan Giggs will return to the United squad for the clash with Liverpool.         
	Giggs has missed seven games since breaking his arm at Aston Villa last month but has returned to training without a problem and is expected to start against Rafael Benitezs men.         
	Nemanja Vidic will be hoping to stay on the pitch after being sent off the last three times he has faced Liverpool, but United need to arrest a similarly length losing run if they are to retain top spot.

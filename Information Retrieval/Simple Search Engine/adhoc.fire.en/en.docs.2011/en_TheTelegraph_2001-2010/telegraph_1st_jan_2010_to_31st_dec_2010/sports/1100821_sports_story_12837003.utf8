	Barcelona: Barcelona will count on their World Cup-winning core when they look to overcome a 1-3 deficit to Sevilla in the return leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Saturday. The eight Barcelona players who helped Spain to World Cup victory last month were unavailable for the first leg, leaving an under-strength starting lineup playing at the Copa del Rey winner.         
	Saturdays game at Barcelonas Camp Nou could see David Villa make his debut for the Spanish champions after a transfer from Valencia, as the Catalan club vies for a record ninth victory in the matchup between league and domestic cup winners.         
	Coach Pep Guardiola still wasnt sure how the World Cup would affect his players. A lot depends on the desire of the players, too, Guardiola said. We need to get our rhythm back little by little and if we can do it with a title, better.         
	Goalkeeper Victor Valdes, defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique, midfielders Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets and forward Pedro Rodriguez are all available alongside Villa after four players made their debut in the first leg, when Barcelona blew a 1-0 lead.         
	Weve all arrived in good physical shape, in optimal conditions, said Pique, who enjoyed a one-month break like his Spain teammates following the World Cup. I personally feel better than I expected.         
	Barcelona have been relatively quiet in the summer transfer market with only Adriano joining from Sevilla. Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are also available.         
	Sevilla, meanwhile, are coming off a 1-0 defeat to Braga in the Champions League. Coach Antonio Alvarez said: Its a game we know weve got the lead and the control. Weve got to try and play all the way through.           (AGENCIES)

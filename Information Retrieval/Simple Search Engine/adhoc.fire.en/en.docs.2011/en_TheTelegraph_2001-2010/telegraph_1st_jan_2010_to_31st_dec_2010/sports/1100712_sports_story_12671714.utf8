The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brave Germans find comfort in third party
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brave Germans find comfort in third party
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	The rule book may already have been well and truly shredded at this World Cup, but there was still time for one more twist in a wet and wild Port Elizabeth on Saturday night: a third-placed play-off brimming over with entertainment and competitive edge.         
	Traditionally, these fixtures are contested between players still smarting from seeing a date with destiny snatched from them and eagerly eyeing the sun-lounger. Here, however, was a feisty and fluent contest that saw Germany provide an impressive coda to their tournament with a 3-2 defeat of Uruguay for their second successive third-place finish in the World Cup.         
	With the defeat were dashed Uruguays hopes of beating Germany for the first time in 82 years, while the Germans finished in the top three for the 11th time.         
	It will not entirely soothe German angst: the semi-final defeat by Spain still rankles.         
	Both sides, however, deserve credit for delivering a fine spectacle for what is, essentially, a meaningless fixture, although Germanys Dennis Aogo might have chosen a more constructive way of showing his enthusiasm than planting his studs into Diego Perezs ankle in just the third minute. It was a horrible challenge and Aogos sheepish reaction to his yellow card suggested even he had expected harsher sanction.         
	Such agricultural moments have largely been anathema to Loews bright young team and, despite the wretched conditions, they were quickly in their stride once again, with Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Mueller and Mesut Oezil producing the kind of tiki-taka passing patterns that Spain victimised them with in the semis.         
	In the ninth minute, Muellers corner from the right was thumped onto the crossbar by Arne Friedrich  a portent of things to come, as far as Uruguays discomfort from crosses was concerned  and, in the 18th, Mueller went one better, bundling in Schweinsteigers swirling low shot after it had been spilled by Fernando Muslera.         
	That should have been the cue for Germany to grasp control, but Uruguays muscularity is more than just physical. They also have admirable mental strength and, within 17 minutes, parity was restored after Edinson Cavani, set clear by Luis Suarez, toe-poked into the bottom corner.         
	Nobody celebrated more joyously than Suarez, whose notorious goalline handball against Ghana in the quarter final earned him pantomime villain status for the African crowd. They delighted in two grisly misses either side of half-time, one dragged wide of the post, the other palmed away from close range by Hans-Joerg Butt.         
	It was left, once more, for Forlan to show the way. The former Manchester United striker, once so derided by Premier League followers, has become one of world footballs most coveted commodities at this tournament and his price-tag inflated again after he met Egidio Aravalos 51st-minute cross with a sweet first-time volley, which bounced past a helpless Butt.         
	It took his tally to five for the competition, level with David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Mueller at the top of the Golden Boot standings.         
	Crosses had proved taxing for the uneasy Muslera all evening and, in the 56th minute, another deep, hanging ball, this time from Jerome Boateng, provoked more panic.         
	After the goalkeeper failed to gather, Marcell Jansen had an easy task in heading into an unguarded net. If that was predictable so, too, was Germanys late winner, headed in by Sami Khedira after Oezils cross had caused havoc.         
	It was harsh on Uruguay, not least as Forlan struck the bar in stoppage time, but a World Cup bronze was the least Germany deserved. Gold could yet await in Brazil 2014.

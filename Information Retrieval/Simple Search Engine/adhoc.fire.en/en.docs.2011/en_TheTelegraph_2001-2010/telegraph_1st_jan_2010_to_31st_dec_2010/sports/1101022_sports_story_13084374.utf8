	New Delhi: The Indian marksmen proved to be the backbone of the countrys good show in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games, and Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra expects a repeat performance from the nations shooting contingent in the Asian Games in China to be held from November 12 to 27.         
	Bindra, the 10-metre air rifle pairs event gold medallist in the Commonwealth Games, assured the Indian shooters will give a stiff challenge to the seasoned players during the Guangzhou Games.         
	Indian shooters are ready for another good show in the Asian Games just like they did at the Commonwealth Games. Our standard is higher now after the recent success and the shooters will bring lot more glory to the nation, Bindra said.         
	I expect more medals from India this time, not only from the shooting contingent but also from other sporting disciplines. Our athletes are ready for the next challenge, the Chandigarh shooter added.         
	In the October 3 to 14 event, Bindra and Gagan Narang won the yellow metal in the 10-metre air rifle pairs event with a Games record. The pair together scored 1193 to break their own record, which they had set four years ago in Melbourne Games, by notching up 1189.         
	It was a foregone conclusion that Indian shooters would call the shots in the 19th Commonwealth Games. The hosts won 30 medals, including 14 gold, 11 silver and five bronze during the Games.

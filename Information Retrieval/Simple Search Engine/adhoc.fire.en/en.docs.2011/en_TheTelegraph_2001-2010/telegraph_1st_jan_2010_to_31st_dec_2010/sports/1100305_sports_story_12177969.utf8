The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gangjee is tied ninth 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gangjee is tied ninth 
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: In-form Rahil Gangjees tidy opening round of four-under 68 had the Calcutta golfer three shots off lead at tied ninth but seasoned pro Jyoti Randhawa stares at an early exit after a terrible start in the Malaysian Open here Thursday.         
	Gangjee, who was in title contention in the Avantha Masters back home last month, showed the kind of form he is in and dropped just one bogey as against five birdies to remain three shots behind Rhys Davies and Ignacio Garrido who shared the lead at seven-under.         
	One shot behind Gangjee at the 69th place were SSP Chowrasia and Digvijay Singh.         
	Two-time winner Arjun Atwal had a rather sedate start to his round and the US-based Indian shared the 48th place with rising star Gaganjeet Bhullar.         
	Caddie-turned-pro C Muniyappa was tied 71st after carding one-over 73, two shots ahead of Anirban Lahiri (tied 105th).         
	Randhawa had a nightmarish start and playing his back nine first, the lanky golfer was four-over at the turn and in all, managed five bogeys, one double bogey and a couple of birdies.         
	Lightning threats dropped early curtains on the proceedings with Himmat Rai (15 holes) and Shiv Kapur (17 holes) yet to complete their round in the $2 million tournament co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.         
	Gangjees was the best show by an Indian at the Kuala Lumpur Golf amp; Country Club Thursday and the diminutive pro looked in brilliant form as he sunk three birdies in the bogey-free front nine.

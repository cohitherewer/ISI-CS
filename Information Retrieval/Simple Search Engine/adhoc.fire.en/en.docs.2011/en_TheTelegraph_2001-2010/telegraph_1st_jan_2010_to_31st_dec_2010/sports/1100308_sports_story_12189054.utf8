	How close did you really come to quitting F1, Lewis? Lewis Hamilton frowns and casts his eyes downwards. For a moment he looks like he would rather be somewhere else, anywhere else, in fact, other than with a group of journalists intent on asking him about Australia 2009. About Lie-gate.         
	Lie-gate. The word itself may be preposterous (why do we persist with attaching gate to every conceivable controversy?) but the significance of the episode as far as Hamilton is concerned is very real. In fact it informs his current state of mind, one which the McLaren driver described this week as the happiest of my life.         
	So while he instinctively winces at the recollection of how he was persuaded by McLarens then sporting director Dave Ryan to mislead Formula One race stewards in Melbourne, of how he cheated Toyotas Jarno Trulli out of a rightful podium place and then refused to come clean in Kuala Lumpur four days later, the 2008 world champion does not duck the question.         
	Instead, he takes a deep breath and begins to talk. There was a lot to take on board after what had gone on, he begins. I care about how people perceive me. It was a feeling of shoot, maybe I shouldnt be in the sport rather than not in my team. This is my dream team and I am fortunate to have been here from the beginning [of my career].         
	I never had a desire to drive for anyone else. So it was not a desire to leave the team, just to stop racing.         
	For a while Hamiltons defence mechanism was to withdraw into himself. In Shanghai, Bahrain, Barcelona, even Monaco, he was guarded, moody and introspective; clearly uncomfortable in press conferences, he sported a soulful, melancholic look.         
	By the time we reached Turkey, however, he was beginning to look like his old self. And when the circus came to town in his back yard, Silverstone, last June, he felt sufficiently positive to give his fans a few doughnuts at the end.         
	How had he snapped himself out of it? Well, there was support from my family, team, fans, amazing letters and I thought you know what, I made a mistake but I am being given a second chance by all these people and support.         
	I never for a second didnt want to do it, I love racing. I just didnt know how to ... sometimes it is hard to face the people when you know that as soon as you turn your back they are talking about you.         
	But slowly I began to realise that it was not all negative energy and I had a lot of support and respect from people. It made me stronger. It was a real strong experience.         
	I cant say what will happen in the future but I have always said I love the sport, I love winning and winning in the right way. Integrity is very important to me.         
	To those who follow him around the world and have seen the way he has relaxed and opened himself up, it has become clear that, far from proving his ruin, the events of Australia and Malaysia have proved Hamiltons liberation.

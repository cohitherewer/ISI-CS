The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No nerves for Srinath
                                                                                                                       7                                      No nerves for Srinath
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                        Srinath        
	Calcutta: The Big Fight is just hours away and, like Anil Kumble, candidate for the presidency, Jawagal Srinath, who is aspiring to be the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) secretary, is confident.         
	Not over-confident, though.         
	Yes, Anil and I have personally met a large number of the voters and put our case forward... The response has been very encouraging and that makes me feel confident, Srinath, who led the India attack for close to a decade, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, on the eve of the KSCA elections, held every three years, Srinath added: We want to make changes, run the KSCA professionally and also improve ties with the Board... Theyve been strained for some time... quot;         
	Srinath was referring to the (outgoing secretary) Brijesh Patel era, as he never quite saw eye-to-eye with Narayanswamy Srinivasan, the Board secretary and its president-elect as well.         
	An International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee, Srinath is up against A.V. Jayaprakash, who has served as an ICC umpire.         
	Both Kumble and Srinath are high on integrity and a clean image has only enhanced their CVs.         
	Some among the around 1,430 electorate have raised the issue of whether they will have the time to manage the KSCA, but it seems that the sceptical have been convinced by the duo.         
	The incumbent president, Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, has been requesting the voters for another term. The older lot, apparently, has a soft corner for the Mysore royal, but the trend points to a convincing win for Kumble and his team.         
	At the same time, nothing is being taken for granted... Vishy (Gundappa Viswanath), after all, lost to Wadiyar in 2007... Hes a politician, not us, is what somebody from the Kumble camp had to say.         
	Back then, it was an upset.         
	However, theres a difference  Vijay Mallya had supported Wadiyar, three years ago. This time, hes with the cricketers.         
	Meanwhile, Roger Binny, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, is standing for re-election as one of the three vice-presidents. He has the backing of Kumble and Co.         
	Also in the running for a vice-presidents post is Venkatesh Prasad, who shared the new ball, for India, with Srinath.         
	Theyre on the same page now too.

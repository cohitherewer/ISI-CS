  - Tri-series final l The toss is not an important factor, says Team India captain
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Praveen Kumar during a practice session, in Dambulla, on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Dambulla: Mahendra Singh Dhoni stressed on the need for a team effort to win Saturdays tri-series final against Sri Lanka.         
	However, if we win the final because of individual effort, the team wont really mind it, the Team India captain said, at a media conference, on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Biggest challenge for Saturdays gameIt is the little things that really matter. If you take care of the little things, the big ones will take care of themselves. It depends on what you are doing first, bowling or batting. If you are bowling first, try to make use of the conditions. The fielding will be crucial because every 10 extra runs can count at the end of the game. We will stick to the basics.         
	If batting is an area of concern         
	Well of course it is, especially if you look at the number of runs scored by the batsmen (so far) It is a major area of concern. We are hoping to get a par score that the bowlers can help us defend. How that score, or who scores, doesnt really matter till somebody scores and we get that 220 or 240 runs.         
	His message to Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina         
	We try to keep it simple. I think it has been a series of ups and downs not only for our batsmen, but also for all the three teams that have participated         
	The extended net session on the eve of the final         
	It was a good practice session. I think we made the most out of it. We had a long practice session today (Friday) and are hoping that everything goes well.         
	On the team looking up to Virender Sehwag         
	I dont want to put pressure on Sehwag since he is a free-flowing cricketer. He is a natural, aggressive cricketer. So he should back himself and bat the way he bats. Since it is the final, a team effort will be needed. However, if we win the final because of individual effort, the team wont really mind it. But hopefully, since it is a team sport everybody will try to do their job.         
	If the expectations will be higher from Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh         
	We have the same expectations from every cricketer who is member of the playing XI. But when you are a cricketer who has played for the country for 6-10 years, then the burden is more It helps if an in-form batsman scores some runs.         
	The team combination...         
	Winning combination is important but we will choose the final XI depending on the kind of wicket. If we feel the wicket is dry, and not hard, then Jadeja will get a spot. But if it doesnt help the spinners and we feel like playing an extra batsman, then Jadeja will have to miss.         
	If he expects fireworks in the final         
	We try to play to our strengths. Our strength is not to go out there and be very verbal. So we have always kept a distance from the opposition batsmen. Hopefully, it will be a non-controversial final.         
	Whether the toss will be an important factor         
	Earlier, in Dambulla, the toss used to play an important role. In this tournament, however, we have seen that the toss is not an important factor         
	On the controversies in the tournament         
	We dont do that on the field. We try to go out and avoid as much controversy as possible. But in between, we have seen some of the batsmen getting fined and the skipper fined for slow bowling. Hopefully, there will be no controversies

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pompey dig own grave vs United

	London: Manchester United returned to the Premier League summit by trouncing bottom-placed Portsmouth 5-0 on Saturday, while Manchester City lost 1-2 at relegation-threatened Hull.         
	Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov scored one each for United, while three Portsmouth players scored own goals to add to the debt-ridden clubs woes. United will now hope Chelsea are beaten by third-placed Arsenal Sunday so the champions retain their one-point lead.         
	While Citys hopes of breaking into the top four were dealt a blow at Hull, rejuvenated Liverpool maintained their push for a Champions League place by beating Everton 1-0 in the Merseyside derby.         
	At Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney headed in from close off Darren Fletchers cross and Portsmouth defender Anthony Vanden Borre turned in Nanis attempted cross just before halftime.         
	After the break, Michael Carricks shot deflected in off Richard Hughes before Dimitar Berbatov tormented the Pompey defence and fired home the fourth. Mark Wilson became the third Pompey player to score an own goal to round off the miserable day for the visitors.         
	Uniteds crosstown rivals City slumped to their first loss since Roberto Mancini replaced Mark Hughes as manager in December as Hull climbed out of the relegation zone.         
	United States forward Jozy Altidore scored his first Premier League goal in his 18th game and George Boateng volleyed in Hulls second. Emmanuel Adebayors goal wasnt enough for City to spark a comeback, despite Patrick Vieira coming on as a substitute to make his debut for the club.         
	Liverpool remain ahead of City, having bounced back following a lacklustre start to the season by collecting 17 points from a possible 21 in the last seven matches.         
	Burnley climbed out of the relegation zone and sent West Ham back into the bottom three with a 2-1 victory over the east London club. Bolton are just one point above West Ham after drawing 0-0 with Fulham and Wigan Athletic are a further point ahead after holding Sunderland to a 1-1 draw.

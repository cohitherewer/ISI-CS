                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev out of Miami event
                      
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman showed a lot of fight but could not overcome third seed Ukrainian Illya Marchenko as Indias campaign in the Miami Open came to an end.         
	Somdevs gritty show could not prevent the Indian ace from losing 4-6, 3-6 in a second round qualifying match.         
	Somdev, who overcame David Guez of France in the first round of qualifying Tuesday, put up a spirited fight against Marchenko but the Ukrainian overpowered the highest-ranked singles player from India.         
	Against Guez, Somdev had faced some early resistance before sweeping aside his French opponent 7-6(7-3), 6-4 to sail into the second round.         
	Yuki Bhambri had earlier crashed out in the first round, succumbing to top seed Denla Istomin in a lop-sided affair.           (PTI)

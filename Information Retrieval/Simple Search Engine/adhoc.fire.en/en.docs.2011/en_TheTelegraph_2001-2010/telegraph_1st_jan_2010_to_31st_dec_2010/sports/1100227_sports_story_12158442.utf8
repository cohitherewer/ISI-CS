The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zeeshan for more India, Pak ties
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zeeshan for more India, Pak ties
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    Captains of the participating teams with the World Cup, in New Delhi, on Friday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha
    
	New Delhi: Pakistan skipper Zeeshan Ashraf said on Friday that India and Pakistan should play more on each others soil to normalise the relation between the two countries.         
	On Sunday, we will play against each other. I know there is pressure on both the teams, but that is good. Even though the match will be played in India, we will surely receive support if we play well, said Zeeshan with his Indian counterpart Rajpal Singh sitting beside him.         
	Every effort should be made to normalise the situation. The way the Pak players were treated in the IPL (Indian Premier League) this time was uncalled for. The more we play against each other, it is better, he said. Rajpal Singh also nodded in agreement.         
	Yet, when asked how important the Sundays clash would be, Zeeshan said it could be one of the most important matches of his life. Back in Pakistan , the people attach a lot of importance to this match. They would like to win at least the match against India even if we lose all other matches, he said.         
	Sohail Abbas, the Pak captain agreed, could once again be the trump card for his team though the other drag-flicker Mohammed Imran would also be pressed into service against India. In the recent past, Imran has improved dramatically. Watch out for him, said Zeeshan.         
	The first match against India is very crucial. If we win that match it will not only be a confidence booster for the boys but also give us psychological advantage going into the tournament, Zeeshan said.         
	Rajpal Singh felt the World Cup at home could turn out to be an important chapter for Indian hockey. If we do well here, the game will receive a huge boost, people will take notice of us. I hope we do well and at least reach the semi-finals, said the captain.         
	We had been practising well for the past few months and playing consistently, said Rajpal.         
	Thats a very positive sign. Beating Pakistan is not the only job. Its only the beginning. The team will have to go a long way before it can really achieve something.

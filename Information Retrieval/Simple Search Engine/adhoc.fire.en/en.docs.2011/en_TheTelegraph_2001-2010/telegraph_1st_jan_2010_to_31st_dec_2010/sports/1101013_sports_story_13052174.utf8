                                                                                                                       7                                      Hariom, the reason for backfire
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Gagan Narangs golden run at the Karni Singh shooting range was halted on Tuesday, when his sick partner struggled, after refusing to take medication for the fear of failing a doping test.         
	While Narang shot an impressive 593, his partner, Hariom Singh, who was running high fever, came up with a poor score of 580, leaving India to the fifth spot in the 50m rifle prone pairs event.         
	It was very bad, Hariom said later. I have not been well for four or five days, so I could not concentrate properly. I could not take any medicine also, because of the doping issue.         
	Sources in the Indian team management said that an effort was made, to field Imran Hasan Khan in place of Hariom, but the proposal was shot down by the technical delegate for the event.         
	The technical delegate Graeme Hudson did not approve of the change, as it was against the rule, said an official of the Indian team. Efforts, however, are on to replace Hariom for Wednesdays individual event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden curator in a fix
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eden curator in a fix
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) curator Prabir Mukherjee is in a fix. Mukherjee got a call from a top Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official, instructing him to prepare a turning track for the second Test between India and South Africa.         
	I got a call from one of the BCCI officials requesting me to prepare a turning track as per the wish of the team management. However, I have clearly told him that I want an official communication, like an e-mail, stating what should be the nature of the wicket. Also, I dont know how we can change the nature of the strip overnight, Mukherjee told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	The nature of the Eden Gardens wicket over the past few years has changed a lot. The last Test match between India and Pakistan in November-December 2007 had ended in a draw.         
	There is an underlying fear that trying to change the nature of the wicket at this time may turn it into an under prepared one.         
	It may be recalled that Mukherjee had once turned down the team management (Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell)s request to remove the grass from the strip during an one-dayer back in 2005. The opponents then, too, were Graeme Smiths South Africa. The Indians lost that match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal have a point to prove 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal have a point to prove 
            A STAFF REPORTER             Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman and Manoj Tiwary, at the Eden, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The hasty preparation at the Eden Gardens was symbolic on Tuesday. Bengal were jolted out of bed against defending champions Mumbai, and the hosts efforts to keep the nightmare at bay was writ large in their preparations before their Ranji fixture against Assam from Wednesday.         
	Bengal players went through the paces under the watchful eyes of coach Woorkeri Raman and if the hosts have taken any lesson from their last outing, they have to shore up their performance in all departments of the game.         
	This would be Bengals last home match and anything less than three points will rankle if not dent their hopes in the tournament ahead.         
	The unresponsive Eden wicket drew flak from both teams after the last match, and Raman had said there was not much help for the bowlers. Though the Assam tie will be played on a new strip, the Bengal coach doesnt expect much change.         
	Well, the wicket cannot change overnight. It is flat and we will try and make the right adjustments to make it all click, Raman said.         
	The toss would be crucial once again and, expectedly, the team who calls it right will be tempted to bat first. For Bengal, Arindam Das and Manoj Tiwary, have to take more responsibility, as the two form the fulcrum of the teams batting. In the bowling department, Ashok Dinda looks a doubtful starter owing to fever. But, overall, the Bengal seamers will have to be careful in their line and length. Much will depend on veteran Ranadeb Bose to make early inroads, in case Bengal are sent in to bowl first.         
	Fielding has been a major concern for Bengal and Raman ensured to grind his boys through rigorous fielding drills. Bengal had dropped catches at crucial junctures against Mumbai that had compounded their woes. About Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who will be playing his 100th first class match Wednesday, Raman said: It shows his level of fitness and his commitment to the game.         
	Though Raman said he was not keen to tinker with the teams batting line-up, he would expect his top-order batsmen to spend more time at the crease.         
	Assam meanwhile, seemed earnest in their efforts at the nets. The minnows, who graduated from the Plate group this season, had a good show against Railways in their last match. Captain Amol Muzumdar and Sridharan Sreeram are the mainstays of the team. Bengal wouldnt want to write them off. We are a growing team. Sure, Bengal are big, but we are not bad either, Muzumdar said.         
	Being the newbies and slotted in a tough group, Assam have nothing to lose. Muzumdar and Assam coach Subhrajit Saikia tagged the toss inconsequential. Saikia thought the Eden wicket will assist seamers initially, but will gradually develop into a batting wicket. Assam are likely to regain the services of medium pacer Abu Nachim Ahmed, who will start his Ranji season after an injury lay-off (Challenger Trophy).

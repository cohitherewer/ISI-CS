                                                                                                                       7                                      Shooting coach calls it quits
                      
	Guangzhou: Chief national shooting coach Sunny Thomas, on Friday, announced his decision to resign. However, later in the day, he clarified that this decision was made much before the Asian Games began.         
	Indias pistol and rifle shooters failed to fulfil expectations and could manage just three silver and two bronze medals here, a far cry from their superb performance in last months Commonwealth Games in Delhi.         
	I want to clarify that I had expressed my desire to quit four times in the past. Even after the Commonwealth Games I wanted to leave but was told to continue and do the job at the Asian Games, Thomas said denying that the decision to leave his post, which he has occupied since 1993, was because of the shooters none-too-impressive display here.         
	I had a meeting with all the shooters, on Thursday, and told them that I am quitting. I have already informed the secretary general of NRAI Baljit Singh Sethi that I dont want to continue after the Games. I have been a chief national coach for too long, 17 years and I feel I am a misfit in the system, Thomas said.

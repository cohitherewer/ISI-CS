The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lanka crush Bangla
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sri Lanka crush Bangla
                      
	Dambulla: Tillekaratne Dilshan produced a terrific all round show as Sri Lanka crushed Bangladesh by 126 runs to virtually qualify for the final of the Asia Cup cricket tournament here on Friday.         
	After scoring an intimidating 312 for four, the hosts bowled out Bangladesh for a mere 186 and collected a bonus point to take their points tally to nine from two matches at the Rangiri Dambulla International stadium.         
	Dilshan first scored a fiery 71 while opening the innings and then capped the successful day with a three-wicket haul. Bangladesh were hopelessly outclassed in all departments of the game.         
	Tamim Iqbal top scored with 51 (52b, 5x4, 1x6) while Junaid Siddique made a gutsy 35-ball 38.           (AGENCIES)

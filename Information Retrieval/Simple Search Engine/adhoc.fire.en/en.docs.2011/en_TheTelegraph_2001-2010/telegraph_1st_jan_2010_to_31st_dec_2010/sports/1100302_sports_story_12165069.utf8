The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alvitos candid confession
                                                                                                                       7                                      Alvitos candid confession
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Not many players have the courage to own up to their faults but Alvito DCunha is a bit different from the others. His straight-from-the-heart confession at the end of East Bengals training session came as a shocker for one and all.         
	I deserve to be punished for what I did on Saturday. I am ready to face the consequences for my actions. Human beings do make mistakes but I dont want to set a bad precedent. I should be punished because I dont want this (type of incident) to be ever repeated by anybody. If I am not punished today, may be tomorrow, someone else will commit the same mistake and get away citing my example. I dont want to set a bad example, Alvito said after training on Monday.         
	He didnt forget to add that Eduardo, too, was at fault. Eduardo spat on my jersey and the East Bengal jersey is my most treasured possession. I couldnt control myself.         
	It has been discovered that it was not only Eduardo who spat on Uga Okpara; even the Ghanaian had spat on Mohammedan Sportings Brazilian forward. The images of Okpara spitting on Edu were released on popular social networking site Facebook.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian Football Associations league sub-committee will be studying the reports of the referee and the match commissioner. It has been learnt that the state association will also seek reports from East Bengal and Mohammedan Sportings coaches and managers.

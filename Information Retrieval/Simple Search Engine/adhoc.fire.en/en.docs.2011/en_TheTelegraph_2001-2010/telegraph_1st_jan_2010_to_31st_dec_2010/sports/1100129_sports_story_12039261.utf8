	Calcutta: Abhimanyu Mithun, who is in the 15-member Test squad for the series against South Africa, has also been included in the Board Presidents XI team, which will take on Proteas, in Nagpur, from Tuesday.         
	This gives the Karnataka pacer, who has been a revelation during the Ranji Trophy, a chance to have a go at the South Africans before the first Test. Mumbai batsman Rohit Sharma will be leading the side, announced on Thursday. The 14-member squad also includes Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Shikhar Dhawan.

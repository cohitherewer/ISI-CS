The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Russia pull out of 2022 Cup race
                                                                                                                       7                                      Russia pull out of 2022 Cup race
                      
	Moscow: Russia officially pulled out of the race to host the 2022 World Cup, on Friday, with the aim of solely concentrating on their bid for 2018.         
	Russia is setting its sights exclusively on being awarded the right to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup and has formally withdrawn its bid for the 2022 edition of the worlds biggest and most important single sports event, the Russian bid committee said, in a statement.         
	We hope to be entrusted with the hosting of Fifas flagship event and are ready to inspire the global football family in 2018, the statement quoted Russias bid chairman and the countrys sports minister Vitaly Mutko as saying.         
	Russia and England are bidding to stage the 2018 World Cup, along with joint bids from Spain-Portugal and Belgium-Netherlands, while Japan, South Korea, Qatar, the US and Australia are candidates for 2022.         
	Last week, England officially withdrew from bidding for the 2022 tournament after the US had pulled out of the running for the 2018 event, making certain it would be held in Europe.         
	Fifa rules prohibit successive World Cups being staged on the same continent.         
	Soccers governing body is due to announce the winning bids in Zurich on December 2.         
	The bidding process has been overshadowed by allegations of vote selling, with two members of Fifas executive committee, Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti, being provisionally suspended for 30 days.         
	The Nigerian government has called the bribery allegations against Adamu shocking and disturbing and harmful to the countrys image.         
	A spokesman for Nigerias ministry of sports said the federal government noted with shock and dismay the alleged involvement of Dr. Adamu in the cash for vote scandal.         
	The statement late Thursday from Olukayode Thomas also said anti-corruption agencies are monitoring the outcome of the investigation and will act at the appropriate time.

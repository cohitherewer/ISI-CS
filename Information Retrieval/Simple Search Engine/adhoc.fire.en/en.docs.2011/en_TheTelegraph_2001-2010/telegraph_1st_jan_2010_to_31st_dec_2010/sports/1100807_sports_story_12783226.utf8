	Birmingham: A combination of superb bowling and inept Pakistan fielding saw England take charge of the second Test at Edgbaston on Friday.         
	England reached 112 for two at stumps, a lead of 40 with eight first-innings wickets remaining, but only after Pakistan dropped four catches on Day I.         
	If wed taken them it could have been pretty even, Pakistan captain Salman Butt said.         
	Kevin Pietersen was unbeaten on 36 at stumps, with Jonathan Trott unbeaten on 31. Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer claimed one wicket each for Pakistan.         
	Earlier, Pakistan were bowled out for 72, their lowest ever Test match score against England, as James Anderson took four for 20, while Stuart Broad claimed four for 38.         
	Umar Amin was Pakistans top scorer with 23, after they won the toss and chose to bat despite difficult conditions.         
	It was a positive move, Butt said. I think this pitch will not change. Given these conditions, I think the ball will keep swinging so the idea was to put some runs on the board, but unfortunately things didnt go the way we wanted.         
	Broad said England were glad Pakistan won the toss. We were going to bat, Broad admitted.         
	As a bowling group when theres that amount of cloud around youre always maybe hoping youre going to lose the toss. We were pretty excited about the chance of getting out there.         
	The Pakistan innings lasted just 39.3 overs and spanned four minutes short of three hours. Pakistan chose to bat despite agreeing in a team meeting the previous evening that they would bowl given such conditions, according to team sources.         
	Pakistan made two changes to the side that lost heavily in the first Test, with Zulqarnain Haider making his debut, replacing keeper Kamran Akmal and spinner Danish Kaneria making way for Saeed Ajmal.         
	However, there was no place for former captain Mohammed Yousuf, who arrived in England less than 24 hours before the start of play, and Pakistans lack of experience was painfully obvious.         
	Imran Farhat was caught behind for nought off Broad after batting for half an hour, Salman Butt (7) was caught by Graeme Swann at second slip off Steven Finn and Shoaib Malik (3) nicked an outswinger from Anderson behind.         
	Azhar Ali was leg before to Broad for nought having faced 32 balls in 55 minutes and Umar Akmal decided not to ask for a review when he was leg before to Finn for 17, despite the ball pitching well outside off stump.         
	Three balls later, debutant Haider was out for a golden duck when he edged Broad behind. Amin was dropped by Swann off Broad in the fifth over after lunch and in the next over, umpire Marais Erasmus gave Aamer out leg before to Anderson, only for the decision to be overturned.         
	A four from Amin in the 33rd steered Pakistan past their lowest ever Test score  53 against Australia in Sharjah in 2002.         
	However, Amin fell two overs later, caught off Broad by Paul Collingwood, and Umar Gul (0) lasted just eight balls before he was caught at gully by Pietersen .         
	Aamer (12) holed out to Anderson two overs later, caught by a diving Alastair Cook at mid-off, and the innings was wrapped up when Asif (0) edged an Anderson delivery to Pietersen at gully.         
	Broad said Englands strategy had been to stifle Pakistan. We didnt want to fall into the trap of chasing wickets and going at four or five an over and wasting the momentum wed built, he said.         
	Pakistan finally enjoyed some success when it removed both openers early in the evening session.         
	Cook (17), having successfully reviewed an leg before decision when he was on 5, fell to the third ball after tea, trying an ill-judged pull that flew off his glove to Akmal at second slip. Strauss followed in the next over, the 11th, after initially being given not out by umpire Steve Davis.         
	A review showed Aamer had found Strauss inside edge before he was caught behind by Haider, but Pakistan then missed four catches, three of them simple.         
	Trott was on 8 when he flashed at a ball from Asif in the 16th over, but Farhat grassed an easy chance and worse was to follow. In the 22nd over Pietersen, on 9, swatted Ajmal to mid-on, where Gul inexplicably parried the ball over the boundary rope for four.

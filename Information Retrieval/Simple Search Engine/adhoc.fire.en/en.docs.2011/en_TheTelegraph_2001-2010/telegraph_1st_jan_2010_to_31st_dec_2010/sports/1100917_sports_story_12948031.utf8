The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Conspiracy theory is dismissed by Butt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Conspiracy theory is dismissed by Butt
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday dismissed any conspiracy theory in the spot-fixing scandal it finds itself in and said it was not seeking leniency for the tainted teenage cricketer Mohammed Aamer.         
	The PCB chairman Ijaz Butt, who met International Cricket Council (ICC) president Sharad Pawar in the capital, said: I dont believe in any conspiracy theory. I am a simple businessman and a cricket administrator. I am also a part of the ICC and will stick to its Code of Conduct.         
	While Pawar too rubbished the conspiracy theory involving India saying that India has no role in the entire drama, Butt said he has requested Pawar to arrange for the Indian team to go to Pakistan and play matches.         
	I expressed my desire to Sharad Pawar that India should come and play in Pakistan, said Butt.         
	On Aamer, the PCB boss said: No demand has been made on showing leniency to Aamer. It will depend on what is found against the players.         
	Butt claimed that the PCB was not offended with the ICCs move to provisionally suspend three cricketers  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer.         
	We are not offended by the decision. The ICC asked them to individually answer and all of them have done so. If anyone is found guilty, we will not show any tolerance. ICC Code of Conduct is very clear regarding this matter, he said.         
	Both Butt and Pawar, who had a two-hour meeting at the latters residence, were unanimous in their views that strict actions should be taken against the guilty. While Pawar said that neither the ICC nor the PCB would tolerate any corruption in cricket, Butt made it clear that PCB had taken a zero tolerance policy in this regard.         
	The Pakistani board is a part of ICC, Pawar said. In ICC, all decisions are taken collectively and thoughtfully. The ICC, and that includes Pakistan board, will never tolerate any nonsense or any corruption in cricket.         
	We try to maintain the sanctity of cricket and in the process of doing so, every board, including Pakistan, is fully supporting ICC, added Pawar.         
	The ICC chief also informed that Scotland Yard investigation is likely to end very soon and the suspension would be reviewed only after it is completed.         
	Prima facie there are some allegations and we have suspended the players on the basis of that, Pawar said. Scotland Yard has permitted them to go back to Pakistan and the PCB has also promised to make them available to the investigators if required. Nobody is playing hide and seek. Neither PCB nor ICC will interfere in the process, added Pawar.         
	Butt refused to comment on the issue saying he would not be in a position to say anything till the investigation is completed.

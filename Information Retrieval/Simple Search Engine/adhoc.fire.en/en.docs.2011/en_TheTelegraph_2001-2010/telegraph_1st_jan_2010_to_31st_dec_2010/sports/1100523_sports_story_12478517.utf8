                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdevs golden chance
  - Grand Slam action gets underway on clay courts today
                      
	Paris: Somdev Dev Varman has been the Indian flag-bearer in mens singles for some time now and his maiden French Open, starting Sunday, has presented him the chance to achieve what none of his countryman has done for decades  reach the third round of the clay court Grand Slam.         
	Only three Indians have made the third round of French Open, the last being Ramesh Krishnan in 1982, where he lost to Ivan Lendl in straight sets.         
	Somdevs first round will be against a player, whom he has already beaten earlier. His opponent is world No. 65 Marco Chiudinelli and if he gets past the Swiss, he could run into American 17th seed John Isner. He beat Chiudinelli in Dubai this year and had defeated Isner in 2007 to win the NCAA championship.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi are always strong contenders here. They had won the mens doubles title together twice  in 1999 and 2001 here. Paes again won last year with Lukas Dlouhy.                (PTI)

  - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE
   - VVS has a special presence at the crease         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ravi Shastri                                 
	Durban: Former India captain Ravi Shastri spoke to The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Your thoughts on Laxmans innings here...         
	A An outstanding knock... Laxmans just made for such innings... Hes done it before this year ... Indeed, hes been playing such knocks almost throughout his career. Id say his temperament is fabulous and his shot-selection amazing... Absolutely first-class.         
	Laxmans been particularly awesome this season. What, do you think, has made the difference?         
	Bottom line is temperament... He scored an unbeaten hundred (103) in Colombo, in August... Then had that brilliant 73 not out in Mohali (against Australia), in October... Now, the 96 in Durban on a bowler-friendly track.         
	Well, whats special about Laxman?         
	Oh, his ability to produce runs when it matters the most... Ive already mentioned temperament and shot-selection... Add body language and a calm demeanour... Laxman has a special presence at the crease. In this Test, hes looked the most assured... Ive seen only six great Indian batsmen and Laxmans one of them.         
	The rest...         
	Gundappa Viswanath, Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag... Laxman may have 16 hundreds and not 25 or 30 or 35, but there have been times when his fifties have been worth so much more. Hes been scoring high-value runs.         
	But Laxman hasnt always got his due, isnt it?         
	Hell certainly get his due if we win this Test and level the series... That apart, where Im concerned, Laxmans a great player and his contribution to the rise of Team India has been tremendous... Of course, he went through a period early on when there was a question mark over his position, but thats it... Laxmans had fitness issues, but hes been batting like a champion...Others have possibly got the bigger accolades, but in 2010, I dont think anybody has overshadowed him. When it comes to helping win matches, Laxmans the man. He gives nothing away and keeps the scoreboard ticking.         
	The most memorable innings from Laxman...         
	His 281 at the Eden, in 2001 (against Australia) stands out... If we go on to win, then the 96 here.         
	Did you get emotional when Laxman got out?         
	One did feel for him... He deserved to get a hundred.         
	What can youngsters learn from Laxman?         
	Try and have the same self-belief... Try and emulate his temperament, learn from the discipline he maintains. He gets on with the game and theres little fuss about him... Actually, theres plenty to learn from Laxman.         
	Finally, what would you tell Laxman this evening?         
	(Grins) Thanks for another very special innings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Shift IPL if needed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Shift IPL if needed
                      
	Melbourne: Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne is concerned about safety of the cricketers in the wake of threats by terror groups and suggested that the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) be held in South Africa again if these threats are credible.         
	The threats of the past 24 hours have certainly got me thinking twice and is of deep concern to athletes across several sports, Warne said.         
	If the threats are proven to be real, then organisers of the IPL may look at moving the tournament. We moved it last year at short notice (to South Africa), so it can be done. There is no way organisers will risk the safety of players and officials, he added.         
	It was Warne who had a few days ago urged the Australian cricketers to turn up for the event without any fear.         
	Warne said he is waiting for the advice of Australian crickets security expert Reg Dickason before making a decision on whether to travel to India.           (PTI)

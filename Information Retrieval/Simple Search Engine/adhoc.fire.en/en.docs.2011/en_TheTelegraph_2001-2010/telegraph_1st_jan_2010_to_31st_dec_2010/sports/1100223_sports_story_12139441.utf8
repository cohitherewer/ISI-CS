The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB postpones league matches
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB postpones league matches
  - Fate of two controversial ties undecided
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided to postpone the next round of first division league matches with immediate effect in the wake of the recent controversies.         
	The CABs championship play-off matches were supposed to start from Tuesday while the relegation play-offs were scheduled from Friday.         
	Two matches had come under the scanner on Sunday. First, West Bengal Police, all but certain to play in relegation play-offs, chased a record 514 to win against Aryan.         
	Then, umpires Supriyo Sarkar and Subhranil Pakrashi made a blunder  one called a dead ball while the other ruled it as run out  and signed two scoresheets carrying two different results in the Customs-Kumartuli tie.         
	The result of the match has been withheld because of the faux pas by the umpires.         
	The official reason for the postponement is that all the group league matches havent been completed, and hence one cant start the next round.         
	However, there seems to be more to it. It is believed that senior CAB officials are trying to douse the fire by postponing matches.         
	Tollygunge Agragami, who have gone into relegation play-off as WB Police pipped them on quotient, has already written to the CAB and will play the relegation play-off under protest.         
	If this malpractice is not stopped, I will resign from all the committees at CAB, threatened Tollygunge Agragamis representative Chiranjit Bose.         
	It has been learnt that CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya is very upset with the recent happenings and has suggested that league matches be postponed till the fate of the two controversial matches is decided.         
	The CAB is yet to receive the umpires report and the two scoresheets for the Aryan vs Police match.         
	About the other match, at Customs ground, the two umpires Supriyo and Subhranil met tournament committee chairman Prabir Chakraborty, joint secretary Arun Mitra and assistant secretary Naresh Ojha to explain their side of the story.         
	As of now, their explanation of Sundays events is not really satisfactory. Also one cant ignore the fact that its because of their fault that the result of one group league match is still incomplete.         
	It will take some time for the committee to probe into the matter and take a call. The umpires are likely to be called again, a senior official said.         
	It will be surprising if the two umpires escape punishment going by the general mood of the members.         
	It may also be noted that during the next phase of matches, the CAB wont be getting access to most of the Maidan grounds as the BHA will get control from March 1.         
	The grounds where matches will be held are JU (Salt Lake), Eastern Railway Sports Complex (James Long Sarani), Deshbandhu Park, Deshapriya Park, Tala Park, Rajasthan, Kalighat, High Court and Rangers grounds.

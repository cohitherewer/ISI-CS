The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Meeting is not fruitful
                                                                                                                       7                                      Meeting is not fruitful
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The East Bengal core committee, which met on Tuesday to deliberate on the ongoing poor show of the team in the I-League and AFC Cup, failed to identify the reasons for the failure. Also, the discussions between club president Pranab Dasgupta and coach Phillippe de Ridder wasnt a fruitful one.         
	It was an informal meeting trying to figure out the reasons. We have played too many matches in a very short span and the performance obviously dipped. The players are too tired as there is no recovery time for them, football secretary Santosh Bhattacharya said after the meeting.         
	In the meeting with Bhttacharya and Dasgupta, the Belgian asked for a masseur and if Bhattacharya is to be believed he would be soon getting one.         
	The football secretary, however, maintained that they havent yet decided whether they would renew the contract with the Belgian. Its too early to take a call on that. All I can say is that we are still not in a position to talk about it, he said.

    - Got the skills to beat WI, its a matter of execution: Kirsten           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Bridgetown: For India and the West Indies, its a fight for survival in the World Twenty20.         
	While one began the tournaments third edition as a hot favourite, everyone expects the other to make the most of home advantage. On Sunday, it will be time to either do or be prepared to die.         
	Both India and the West Indies had an eminently forgettable start to their Super Eights campaign, on Friday. They had to chase 180-plus and lost by huge margins.         
	It was, to put it generously, embarrassing.         
	Yes, it has been a disappointing beginning... No team likes to start with a loss... We had our chances, but let them slip... For us, its back to the drawing board as its a must-win match against India, acknowledged Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain.         
	The West Indies women have already made the semi-finals, so theres definitely more pressure on the men.         
	Indias a good side, but well be backing ourselves... Its a pressure situation for both... Well have to be clear about our strategy as its a small ground (Kensington Oval)... Were aware that Australia used the short-pitched balls to good use... Well do something, Gayle added.         
	He indicated that Keiron Pollard, a hot property in T20, would be moved up the order.         
	Gayle laughed when asked if MoM Mahela Jayawardenes unbeaten 98 (off 56 deliveries) reminded him of the Sri Lankan stalwarts 110 not out at the Eden, last month, during the Kolkata Knight Riders versus the Kings XI Punjab match.         
	[Jayawardene, who has slipped into the openers role so beautifully, said: Its a different challenge, Im trying to push myself in a different direction... Fewer the mistakes, the better... As a team, we were clinical.]         
	Speaking exclusively, Gary Kirsten, Indias coach, told The Telegraph: Weve got the skills to beat the West Indies, its a matter of execution... Really, no side can afford to lose more than once (in the Super Eights)... We have and, so, have given up our lifeline...         
	The boys didnt play well enough against Australia and they know where they went wrong... Its a big match for both teams and I expect a great atmosphere...         
	With the management giving a day off, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. spent much of Saturday in the hotel itself  the scorching sun discouraging even the adventurous.         
	Theres been no official word, but it seems Ravindra Jadeja will get the boot, with Piyush Chawla returning to the XI. An option, of course, is to cap Ranganath Vinay Kumar.         
	Its a simple calculation... If we lose, we go home... After the defeat, the players are more determined... Theyre looking to play four matches (going all the way till the May 16 final), manager Ranjib Biswal, confident as ever, remarked.         
	Meanwhile, Praveen Kumars replacement, Umesh Yadav, wont arrive in the West Indies in time for the next match (versus Sri Lanka, on Tuesday), too.         
	Match starts: 7 pm (IST).         
	Footnote: Indias senior pro Yuvraj Singh is understood to have undergone a random dope test. He was, in keeping with the element of surprise, caught at the breakfast table.

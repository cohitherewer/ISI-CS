The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malleswari wants IWF secretary sacked
                                                                                                                       7                                        Malleswari wants IWF secretary sacked
                  Karnam Malleswari                     
	Patiala: Sydney Olympics bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari, on Sunday, demanded the sacking of Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) secretary Sahdev Yadav for not paying heed to her repeated complaints against coach Ramesh Malhotra, who has been suspended on charges of sexually harassing junior lifters.         
	Malleswari, the vice president of IWF, said Yadav has to be shown the door so that coaches like Malhotra are never appointed. Suspending the coach is not enough. The federation secretary should also be sacked because he didnt act against Malhotra despite repeated complaints. If he is not sacked then people like Malhotra will be made coaches again, she told reporters here.         
	I made a complaint against Malhotra in the IWF executive committee meeting in Udaipur in February and I was assured that action would be taken. But leave alone taking action, he was recommended for the Dronacharya award, she added.         
	The Sports Authority of India (SAI) coach, who was nominated by the IWF for this years Dronacharya award, was suspended on Saturday after Malleswari alleged that he harassed junior lifters for over a decade.         
	However, Malhotra was quick to deny the sexual harassment charges levelled against him as false and malicious.         
	Rubbishing all the charges, the man in the eye of storm said, She (Malleswari) has stained my 26-year-old career in sports coaching. I will not let this put me down. I will battle for my reputation, he said. Malhotra added the IWF should ask the girls training under him to find out the truth.         
	Asked why Malleswari would pick on him specifically, Malhotra said it could be because he backed lifters other than her in the run-up to the 2004 Olympics. She is trying to settle scores with me, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the federation has named a three-member committee headed by IWF vice president Kumbasi Subramanya, veteran coach Pal Sandhu and joint secretary Madan Lal Salvi to probe into the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Intikhab manager, no captain named
                                                                                                                       7                                      Intikhab manager, no captain named
                      
	Karachi: A 15-member Pakistan cricket team, sans captain, was announced Thursday for the upcoming series against South Africa starting later this month.         
	Former Test captain Intikhab Alam has been named as manager of the squad for ODIs and T20 matches against the Proteas in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	Shahid Afridi, who looked the favourite to lead the team, was named in the squad, but has not been given the captaincy. Misbah-ul Haq makes a comeback as the PCB chose him over out of favour Younis Khan.         
	Wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal was also kept off the squad as he is recovering from an appendicitis operation. The announcement was made at a press conference by PCB media manager Nadeem Sarwar, in absence of selectors.         
	Meanwhile, former cricketer Intikhab Alam returned as the manager of the team for this tour after Yawar Saeed stepped down.         
	Right now his immediate task is to manage the team in the South Africa series and the board will decide later on for other series, Sarwar said.         
	Earlier, Alam became coach in October 2008 and helped the Pakistan to win T20 World Cup in England. But after a shambolic tour to Australia, he was replaced by Waqar Younis.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Imran Farhat, Mohammed Hafeez, Mohammed Yousuf, Misbah-ul Haq, Umar Akmal, Asad Shafiq, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman, Shoaib Akhtar, Tanvir Ahmed, Zulqarnain Haider.

	Calcutta: Pakistani all-rounder Shahid Afridi was Sunday banned for two Twenty20 Internationals after pleading guilty to a ball-tampering charge during the fifth and final ODI against Australia in Perth.         
	Afridi has received two suspension points after breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.         
	Two suspension points in the code means a ban of a Test, two ODIs or two T20Is. As such, Afridi will miss Pakistans next two T20s against Australia on 5 February in Melbourne and against England in Dubai on 19 February.         
	Afridi was charged with an article 2.2.9 offence of the ICC Code of Conduct which relates to changing the condition of the ball in breach of Law 42.3 of the Laws of Cricket.         
	Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam confirmed that Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has banned Afridi for two matches after holding a hearing on the complaint by on-field umpires Asoka de Silva and Paul Reiffel immediately after the match.         
	It is unfortunate what has happened because Afridi was due to lead Pakistan in the Twenty20 match next week against Australia, Alam said from Perth. Im ashamed of myself. I shouldnt have done such an act. It happened in the heat of the moment. I apologise for my mistake, Afridi said.         
	It was a close match and Pakistan had not won any match. We needed a win and I just wanted to help the fast bowlers. I did it on that spur of moment. I have been banned now and I have learnt my lessons. I will ensure it doesnt happen again, Afridi said.         
	Afridi, who led Pakistan in the final ODI in place of the unfit Mohammed Yousuf, was caught on camera chewing on one side of the ball while walking to the run up with bowler Mohammed Asif. Trying to change the condition of the ball through illegal means prompts strict penalties from the ICC.         
	In 2005, Afridi was banned for twisting his spikes and trying to change condition of pitch during a Test match in Faisalabad against England.

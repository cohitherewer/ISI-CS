The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL a good platform to groom Indians: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        IPL a good platform to groom Indians: Dhoni
    - We have more part-time options and plan to utilise them, says Csk captain             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES            Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a promotional in Chennai on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Chennai: Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday said that he was happy with the present format of the IPL that imposed a restriction of only four international players in the playing XI of each team.         
	Let us not forget this is the Indian Premier League and it is only natural that more Indians should play. The format presents an excellent opportunity to groom young Indians especially when they get to play with experienced foreign players. Also we have a large talent pool to tap, Dhoni said.         
	Citing an example, Dhoni said players who made a mark in the first edition of the IPL went on to play for the country. We had Manpreet Gony, Murali Vijay and Subramaniam Badrinath coming into the side... And Suresh Raina is becoming a great player.         
	We are contributing a lot towards Indian cricket. Overall, we are trying to groom the Indian cricketers for the betterment of the game in India, Dhoni said.         
	Dhoni was confident that the Chennai Super Kings would be able to cross the last mile by winning the tournaments third edition. In the first edition we reached the final, and in the next we were one of the semi-finalists.         
	In this format even 15 minutes of indifferent play could cost you the match as there is no time to recover. One off day can pull you down, so we plan to play consistent cricket during all the matches, Dhoni explained.         
	The Chennai Super Kings bowling resources look a bit depleted in the absence of Andrew Flintoff and Jacob Oram and the stress therefore would be on the batsmen.         
	However, Dhoni was confident that his part-time bowlers would be able to chip in with the odd over or two while youngsters like Gony and Shadab Jakati, who made a mark last time, would be the key players to watch.         
	That way we have more part-time options and we plan to utilise the available resources.         
	Dhoni is happy that the players would not have to spend much time on the road unlike the second edition.         
	You compare it with the last IPL in South Africa... we will not be travelling that much in India. We have a base and we will be playing most of the matches in Chennai.         
	The facilities are great, so I do not think it will be as tiring as last years IPL. We will be enjoying much more playing in India Next 45 days we will be busy and lot of pressure will be on the cricketers, he said.         
	The skipper, though, said the weather of the city would pose a challenge for the players.         
	Chennai is hot and humid even at around 8.00 pm. Twenty20 is therefore very demanding in all respects, particularly on the body and also on the mental side.         
	Coach Stephen Fleming said that till the full extent of Orams injury was known the team management does not plan to ask for a replacement.         
	He said Australias Michael Hussey would miss the first few matches and join the squad from April 1 since he will be busy with the national commitments in New Zealand.         
	Jacob (Oram) of course is not available. I think the rest of the full squad should be available for CSK. There was a huge question mark on Andrew Flintoffs availability... Justin Kemp is the replacement for Flintoff, he said.         
	Dhoni also said players like Kemp with all-round abilities would prove to be handy.         
	When our main bowlers have an off-day, we have strong options to use others as bowlers and Kemp is one of them. Such an option in the team for a Twenty20 match, is good. Kemp is a big hitter. He can be an asset to the side.         
	On Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, Dhoni said: He is the best spinner in the world and still in international circuit. He can be useful in every format of the game.

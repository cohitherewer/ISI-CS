The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Miles to go, promises to keep

  - SRK graceful in defeat, congratulates CSK team in dressing room       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Jagmohan Dalmiya                                 
	Calcutta: Exactly a week ago, at a XXX promotional in Mumbai, Shah Rukh Khan admitted he hated losing.         
	On Tuesday night, Shah Rukhs team, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), lost for the first time in IPL III, but he remained graceful.         
	Outwardly, at least.         
	Besides acknowledging the cheers from both tiers of the Club House, Shah Rukh walked over to the Chennai Super Kings dressing room and congratulated Mahendra Singh Dhonis team.         
	Shah Rukh was accompanied by Jagmohan Dalmiya, once the badshah of cricket, now reduced to heading the state body.         
	Naturally, nobody likes to lose... I tried to lift Shah Rukhs morale by saying one loss wouldnt derail anything... I expressed the hope that KKR would actually go on to win this edition of the IPL, Dalmiya told The Telegraph.         
	Shah Rukhs response?         
	I think he said that, if I felt so, then KKR would... I dont recall his exact words, though, Dalmiya pointed out.         
	For Sourav Ganguly, the KKR captain, the problems didnt end with the match  which ended prematurely as his team didnt play out the 20 overs.         
	Indeed, something went into Souravs right eye as he was walking to the press conference enclosure. It took a few minutes for the foreign element to be removed.         
	Sourav didnt make excuses. Rather, he accepted that the last four overs, when the KKR bowlers conceded 61 runs, made all the difference.         
	For KKR, 11 matches remain to be played, in the league stage. Miles to go, then. Promises to keep, too...         
	Shah Rukhs team will next be seen in action in Ahmedabad, against the Rajasthan Royals, on Saturday.

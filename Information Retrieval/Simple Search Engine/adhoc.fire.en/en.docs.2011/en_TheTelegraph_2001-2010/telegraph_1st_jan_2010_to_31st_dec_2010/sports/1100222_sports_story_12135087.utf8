            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Roger Federer in Dubai, on Sunday. (Reuters)                                 
	World No 1 Roger Federer has pulled out of the $2 million ATP Dubai Open due to a lung infection.         
	Federer is hoping to have recovered in time to play at the ATP World Masters at Indian Wells which starts on March 11, or if that came too soon then at the following tournament in Miami.         
	He has got a lung infection, announced Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) circuit official Stephen Duckett said. He saw a doctor and he was advised not to play for a fortnight.         
	The Australian Open winner said: There are no guarantees that I will play at Indian Wells  this could be a maximum of six weeks, but if its treated properly everything should be fine and I should be back fairly quickly.         
	Federer, a four-time Dubai champion, was due to appear here for his first tournament since beating Andy Murray to win his fourth Australian Open at the start of the month.         
	That was the Swiss aces 16th Grand Slam and it secured him the top ranking for a 268th week.         
	Explaining how he had come down with the infection he added: Ever since I came back from Australia Ive been practising really hard but Tuesday was the last time I could practise. On Wednesday I couldnt get up anymore  and the next day I just wasnt in shape at all. I survived all the travelling from Australia to Dubai and into the practise routine again  but as youve heard now I cant play.         
	Its a lung infection  its the first time Ive had it. I cant play, its too risky. Breathing is difficult. I feel I am not fine, Im still very tired and slow. The doctors say its too serious for me to try  and that I should rest for at least two weeks  obviously I cant take any more chances.         
	Federer would definitely not like to take any chances, especially after a bout of glandular fever disrupted his preparations for the 2008 season. That year Federer lost his No. 1 ranking to Rafael Nadal.         
	Federer won the title in Dubai in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2007 and was finalist in 2006.

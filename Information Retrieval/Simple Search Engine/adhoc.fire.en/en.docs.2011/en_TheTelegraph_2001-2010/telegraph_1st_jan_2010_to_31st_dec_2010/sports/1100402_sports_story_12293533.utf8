	Mumbai: All-rounder Dwayne Bravo, who is playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL, dismissed reports that he was averse to playing for the West Indies.         
	I want to let all my fans and people back home know that I have West Indies cricket at heart. I would continue to play the game the way it should be played and am 100 per cent committed to West Indies cricket, Bravo said.         
	Just to clear that up, there was the incident that took place three days ago where the paper quoted me saying that Trinidad had to be first, Mumbai Indians second and the West Indies third (in priority) which is wrong, he explained.         
	I just want to get it cleared to people back home in the West Indies and to my fans that I was misquoted. I just want to get it cleared that I have West Indies at the top of my heart, he insisted.

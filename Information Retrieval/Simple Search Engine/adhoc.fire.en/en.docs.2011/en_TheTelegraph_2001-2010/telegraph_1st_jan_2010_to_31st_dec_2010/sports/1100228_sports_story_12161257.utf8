The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith had hand, but no showdown 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Smith had hand, but no showdown 
  - The captain and the end of Mickey Arthurs reign as the South Africa coach         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Graeme Smith amp; Mickey Arthur                                  
	Calcutta: Regular captain Graeme Smith actually had much to do with Mickey Arthurs removal/resignation as coach, but its not that they had a showdown in the days leading up to the rather sudden development late last month.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Smith has emerged as the most powerful captain in his countrys history and Cricket South Africa (CSA) listened to what he said at a review meeting of the board soon after the home series against England.         
	Mickeys a good coach and a fine person... Hes brought us thus far, but wont be able to take us any further... We need a change, Smith is understood to have told the board members, sealing Arthurs fate.         
	The knives, in any case, had been out for Arthur after South Africas poor show in the last Champions Trophy, at home. It didnt help that England then won the ODIs 2-1 and drew the Test series 1-1.         
	Also, as one source put it, Arthur didnt get along with the CSA president, Dr Mtutuzeli Nyoka. A classic case of a personality clash, the source pointed out.         
	Gerald Majola, the all-powerful CEO, used to support Arthur, but he stepped back once Smith called for a change. Like many others in positions of influence, Majola listens to his national captain.         
	Strangely, nobody bothered to ask why the coach alone should be held responsible for disappointing on-field performances...         
	That, too, a coach who took South Africa to the No.1 position in both Tests and ODIs.         
	With Dr Nyoka waiting to oblige Smith, there was no way that Arthur could continue. To ensure that dirty linen wasnt washed in public, CSA decided to pay out the remainder of Arthurs contract, till the 2011 World Cup, that is.         
	The Smith era, which began in early 2003, has seen three coaches  Eric Simons, Ray Jennings and Arthur  go. You cant, then, blame Corrie Van Zyl if hes a bit wary.         
	Ricky Ponting got the ODI captaincy in early 2002, but Smith began with the top job in all forms, so the 29-year-old left-hander is very much the senior-most Test captain in the business.         
	Significantly, another source revealed that CSA would go all out to get Gary Kirsten on board after the sports showpiece tournament in the subcontinent.         
	For the record, Van Zyls contract is till the World Cup and Kirsten, who played for South Africa with distinction, is (as of now) not keen on continuing in India beyond that tournament.         
	Kirsten is days away from completing two years as coach and, beyond a point, doesnt want his family life to take a beating. Kirsten and wife Deborah have two sons  Joshua and James.         
	Be it Sachin Tendulkar or Mahendra Singh Dhoni or Virender Sehwag, everybody has nothing but praise for Kirsten, which has led to his stock soaring sky high.

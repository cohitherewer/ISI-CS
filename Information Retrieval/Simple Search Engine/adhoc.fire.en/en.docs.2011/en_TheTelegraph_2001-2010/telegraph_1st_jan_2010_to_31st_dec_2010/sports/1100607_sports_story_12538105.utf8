The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2000s: Sunsets and new dawns
                                                                                                                       7                                      2000s: Sunsets and new dawns
                  Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro kisses the World Cup after the 2006 final                      African cousins Francois Omam Biyik of Cameroon and Papa Bouba Diop of Senegal share a special connection in World Cup history.  If Omam Biyik rsquo;s innocuous header in the opening match of Italia rsquo;90 left defending champions Argentina shocked, Bouba Diop rsquo;s push in from a goalmouth melee left Zinedine Zidane and his French superstars stunned.  Such was the staggering impact of that opening defeat Les Bleus failed to find their feet and were knocked out in the opening round of the 2002 edition when the Cup moved to the continent of Asia for the first time in its history. Like Cameroon in 1990, Senegal too surprised the world by making it to the last eight stage.   If the 2002 World Cup saw Brazil reassert their supremacy as world beaters, the 2006 World Cup will be best remembered for some of the teams changing their styles of play, notably Germany under the guidance of one of the most stylish German players of all-time Jurgen Klinsmann.  The Brazil team of 2002 showed clinical efficiency in winning all their matches in the championship. Credit goes to coach Luiz Felipe Scolari who showed enormous guts in dropping the legendary Romario despite huge pressure from media and the public. However, Big Phil had two superb men upfront to take care of things.  In 1994, Ronaldo was just a wide-eyed 17-year-old soaking in the feel of the Cup as Brazil retained the championship after 24 years. A powerful 21-year-old lad in 1998, Ronaldo failed at the final hurdle as the world saw the Zizou mesmerise one and all with his sublime skills.  Ronaldo rsquo;s performance in the final and his lsquo;unknown illness rsquo; before the start of the final will forever remain one of the best-kept dressing room secrets of all times.  However, 2002 was the year when the Brazilian was out to make amends. With his namesake Ronaldo de Assis Moreira mdash; better known as Ronaldinho Gaucho mdash; and the opportunist Rivaldo for company and a triangular patch of black on his head, the Brazilian was at his devastating best. The double strike in the championship match against Germany with a bit of help from Oliver Kahn was vindication for those fans who believed Ronaldo to be the game rsquo;s greatest striker.  If 2002 was all about clinical precision, 2006 was about flair and talent. Never had a German team caught the imagination of the world as Klinsmann rsquo;s boys did at home in 2006. Suddenly the German mantra of dogged defending and hitting on counter had changed. This time around it was to be a new theory: offence is the best defence.  The Italians won the Cup on penalties but the home team won hearts. The 2006 edition will also be remembered for one of the best ever World Cup goals, scored by Argentina against Serbia and Montenegro. It was Estebian Cambiasso who made the 24th and final touch before it went in but it was a collective effort from the Argentines. Pity Marcelo Bielsa got it all wrong against Germany in the quarter final.  
	 ALL AT SEA MAN  David Seaman played with distinction for England and Arsenal but if there is a match he would want to forget it has to be the quarter final against Brazil in 2002. Ronaldinho rsquo;s dipping free-kick found Seaman horribly out of position as Brazil won the match 2-1 after Michael Owen had put England in the lead. The ball dipped late and Seaman couldn rsquo;t gauge its flight.   
	 lsquo;butt rsquo; it was not over yet  It was his last international match in a France jersey and Zidane made a memorable start by scoring in two World Cup final matches. A moment of madness and a head butt that sent Marco Materazzi sprawling was the sight that is remembered by fans across the globe. Who knows what might have been had Zidane stayed back and taken one of the penalties in the tiebreaker?

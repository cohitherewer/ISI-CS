	London: Caster Semenya of South Africa, the world 800m champion, has confirmed her participation for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Delhi.         
	Im on the list and they just have to announce the team, Semeya was quoted as saying by a British daily.         
	Semenya timed 1 min 55.45 sec to claim her world title last year and the South African said she can still reach it again if the pace is quick enough in India.         
	I cant estimate the time, she said.         
	Its possible, but it just depends on the body. It all depends on my coach and how he trains me. Im quite happy with my performance. I wasnt expecting to run fast like that. My coach was expecting under two minutes so it was pretty good (1-59.90). I just have to do some more training so I can run faster, she added.         
	She will take on the worlds best in Fridays Diamond League final in Brussels, before completing her European campaign with two races in Italy.         
	Semenya said she was delighted to return to Berlin as she only had good memories of the German capital.         
	It feels good to be back in Berlin, she said.         
	I did not think about everything that happened after my gold medal. I just concentrated on my race and my time. When I won the race, it brought back memories of the 2009 final for me, he added.         
	The 19-year-old had to suffer a lot after failing the gender test last year following her World Championship gold.         
	However, with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) clearing her return, the South African made a successful comeback after an 11-month absence.

	London: Roger Federer beat Robin Soderling once again, winning 7-6 (5) 6-3 Thursday to earn a spot in the semi-finals of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals.         
	Federer improved to 3-0 in the round-robin phase of the tournament to secure first place in Group B. Soderling fell to 1-2 but has a slim chance of advancing if David Ferrer beats Andy Murray in straight sets in the late match.         
	Federer improved his career record against Soderling to 15-1, with his only loss to the Swede coming in this years French Open quarter finals.         
	Federer broke for a 5-3 lead in the second set, hitting a backhand passing shot that Soderling could only return into the net. The second-ranked Swiss then set up match point with a drop shot and converted it when Soderling hit his return into the net.         
	Federer has yet to lose a set in the tournament and took advantage of Soderlings 25 unforced errors on the indoor hard court at the O2 Arena.         
	The two traded breaks once in the first set before Federer took control of the tiebreaker by earning a mini-break with a forehand winner after a long rally, and followed it up with two straight aces for a 5-2 lead.         
	Soderling had two break points in the first game of the second set, but wasted the first when he shanked a forehand. He thought he had converted the second with a forehand pass down the line, but Federer challenged the line judges call that the ball was in, and the video replay showed that it landed just wide.         
	Earlier, top-ranked Bob and Mike Bryan of the United States reached the semi-finals of the doubles competition by beating Lukas Dlouhy of the Czech Republic and Leander Paes of India 6-3, 6-4.         
	In Wednesdays late matches, Rafael Nadal got the better of Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-2. In doubles, Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia qualified for the semis by beating Mahesh Bhupathi of India and Max Mirnyi of Belarus 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1)           (AGENCIES)

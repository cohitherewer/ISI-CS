            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: If there is something called a family sport, Haryanas Geeta, perhaps, boasts of the best example. The 22-year-old, who won the first women wrestling gold for India in the 55kg freestyle event in the Commonwealth Games on Thursday, comes from a family of wrestlers.         
	So much so, that all of Geetas other four sisters are top class grapplers and are part of the national teams. While one of her sisters, Babita, would be seen in action in the 51kg on Friday, the rest of the three are members of the junior national squad.         
	My father, Mahabir Singh, was a good wrestler in his younger days and inspired us to take up the sport, said Geeta, minutes after defeating Emily Bensted of Australia in the final. My aim now is to win the world championships, said the girl from Bhiwani, Haryana.         
	Geeta, who had earlier won gold in the Commonwealth Wrestling Championship, literally toyed with her Australian opponent by pinning her down in the second round, with still a few seconds left for the bout to end. Geeta was enjoying a whopping lead of 8-1. I was always confident of winning the final, she said. My main opponent was the Nigerian girl (Lovina Edward) in the semi-final. Once I defeated her, I knew the gold was mine.         
	She controlled the proceedings right from the start and never let her opponent make a comeback. She repeatedly got points employing the flipper tactic, catching the opponents leg and trying to pin her down.         
	The hosts also got a silver in the 48 kg freestyle category in which Nirmala Devi lost her title round bout against Canadian opponent Carol Huynh. Nirmala was upset after the defeat and was inconsolable for several minutes. I could never imagine of getting beaten in the final, said Nirmala. Pity I could not avail the opportunities I had.         
	Suman Kundu got India th-eir third medal from the competition winning her the med-al play-off in the 63 kg category.

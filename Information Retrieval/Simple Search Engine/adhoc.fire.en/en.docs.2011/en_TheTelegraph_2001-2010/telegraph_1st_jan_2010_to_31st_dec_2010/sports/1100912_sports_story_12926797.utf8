    - The iconic former India captain on the latest scandal             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                                  Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi      
	Calcutta: Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi, who is currently in London, spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youre in the midst of all the action, in London...         
	A (Laughs) Im on a private visit.         
	Long before the first match-fixing scandal, a decade ago, youd told me cricket had never been a gentlemans game... Your stand has been vindicated, over and over again...         
	Yes, but I didnt have match-fixing in mind when I made that point (in February 1983)... Id been referring to Bodyline and so on... If you go back in history, cricket began as a gambling sport... One individual formed a team and took on another individuals XI... It was all about lets see who wins. That was gambling, but fixing of any kind is cheating. Indeed, its downright cheating.         
	Why do cricketers play for bookies?         
	The lure of quick money, with little chance of being caught... Players coming from a financially weak background, I suspect, are more easily tempted. From what Ive heard, the bookies can be quite convincing.         
	Arent the Boards, too, to blame for not educating the players enough?         
	The Boards have a responsibility and Im glad that theres a proposal from Anil Kumbles company to educate the players They need to know how to handle big money and fame in a relatively quick time. They also need to know that theyve got to stay away from dubious characters.         
	What was your first reaction when Cronjegate stumped cricket, in the summer of 2000?         
	Total disappointment... One, generally, had a suspicion, but I never realised such things actually happened. It wasnt a nice feeling.         
	How about your first thoughts when the spot-fixing scandal broke?         
	That the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) cant go into denial... That the countrys high commissioner to the UK cant go into denial... I felt sorry for the young chap, Mohammed Aamer... He has so much talent, but has to pay the price.         
	You must be disillusioned...         
	Disappointed. Everybody has to be far more vigilant now.         
	The PCB handled things very poorly. What would you have done?         
	I wouldve taken the Metropolitan Police seriously and suspended the trio (Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif, Aamer) pending inquiry. At least.         
	Some have been calling for leniency towards Aamer, given his age (18). Do you support that school of thought?         
	Like Ive said, I do feel sorry for him... But, no, he has to face the consequences. A very humble background, age... These factors cant come into the picture.         
	Isnt spot-fixing as big a crime as match-fixing?         
	To fix a match, a bookie will need to directly involve six-seven players and the others have to look the other way... In spot-fixing, a bowler may argue whats the big deal in sending down a no-ball. Both ways, its cheating.         
	How can cricket get over this credibility crisis?         
	I dont know... Its difficult to answer... You tell me... In India, the laws pertaining to illegal gambling definitely need to get stricter.         
	Your take on the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit... For all the resources at its disposal, it hasnt caught anybody as yet...         
	I agree, but how do you stop players from meeting people? The players have to use their discretion and be vigilant. It becomes a personal thing... Bookies dont invite the anti-corruption personnel to dinner, do they?         
	Is a life ban punishment enough?         
	The way things exist, yes.         
	Frankly, can cricket ever be clean, or does it effectively mirror the corruption which exists in society?         
	Well, corruption in cricket is an extension of what happens in society... Match-fixing or spot-fixing may never ever go away. It can, however, be minimised.         
	Given what has happened in the past, are you confident that our players are clean?         
	Look, weve been very lucky to have players like Sachin (Tendulkar), Kumble, (Rahul) Dravid, Sourav (Ganguly) and (V.V.S.) Laxman... Theyve been sensible on issues which could hurt cricket, theyve been such fine role models.         
	The next generation...         
	Its easy to get tempted, but I hope no Indian will succumb... The first temptation is never the last.         
	What, in your view, is the top lesson to learn from the News of the World expose?         
	The Boards need to be vigilant, the players need to be vigilant... The players must not think that its easyto get away with easy money... They must not begin to believe that they can get away by damaging the game. At the end of the day, its up to the individuals and the values they cherish.         
	Finally... Were you ever approached by a bookie?         
	(Laughs) I wasnt, thank-you.              A grab of Tiger Pataudi rsquo;s interview to The Telegraph, which was published on February 6, 1983

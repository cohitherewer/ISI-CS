The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yusuf keeps hopes alive
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yusuf keeps hopes alive
                  Yusuf Pathan                     
	Hyderabad: A day after Dinesh Karthik became the third batsman to score hundreds in each innings of a Duleep Trophy final, Yusuf Pathan threatened to do the same as West Zone attempted a daring tilt at the windmills, chasing a monumental target of 536 with much spirit in Hyderabad. On a day of fluctuating fortunes, South had managed to nose ahead by stumps, with West still 157 runs behind with four wickets remaining.         
	West began the day at 50 for 0 and Dinesh Karthik opted out of wicketkeeping duties, leaving M Gautam to don the gloves. The change did not bring South much luck though, as Chirag Pathak and Harshad Khadiwale extended their good work from the third day to set up a solid platform for the chase.         
	Pathak started in style, turning C Ganapathy for four off the days first ball, before slashing him over third man to bring up 50. Khadiwale got going, striking Alfred Absolem for boundaries, and set the tone for a long day for South at the office.         
	A further 67 runs were added to the overnight score and the bowlers seemed to have run out of ideas when part-timer Srikkanth Anirudha intervened, getting Khadiwale to edge one behind.         
	That brought out Wasim Jaffer and West could not have asked for a more accomplished batsman for the occasion. Jaffer, for his part, slotted into Khadiwales role perfectly, playing second fiddle to Pathak and keeping the score ticking along.         
	Pathak grew in confidence, and made South pay for Ganesh Satishs drop at short leg, striking Aushik Srinivas for boundaries. The pair took their side to lunch at 173, of which the opener had scored 99.         
	Pathak duly reached his fourth first-class ton, smashing Rohan Prem to the ropes in the first over after the break and the leather hunt continued unabated for South.

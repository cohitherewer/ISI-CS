The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vishy: Twenty20 harming Tests
                                                                                                                       7                                        Vishy: Twenty20 harming Tests
            A STAFF REPORTER            Viswanath in the city on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: At heart, Gundappa Viswanath is still a purist. He is ready to accept the fact that Virender Sehwag is a glorious exception but still cant digest the thought of a budding batsman hitting aerial shots in the nets.         
	The men who matter had to think about making the ODIs more interesting and thus came the Twenty20s. Batting Powerplays have been introduced. We are getting to see many unconventional shots. But as soon we revert back to Test cricket, those shots are creating a dangerous trend. Test cricket is not about playing too many shots. Its about application, the veteran of 91 Tests who is in the city for a promotional event said on Friday.         
	I always tell youngsters that never hit aerial shots in the nets. You dont need to practise aerial shots. I only advise that once you are batting 60 or 70, you have the confidence to hit those shots. But one should try and play proper shots. Everyone doesnt have the exceptional balance of Sehwag, added Viswanath, who scored 6080 runs with 14 centuries.         
	He is against the popular idea of making a career out of the Indian Premier League rather than aspiring for playing for the country.         
	I can assure you that instant fame earned by bowling four overs or smashing around 30 deliveries wont stay for long. To be successful in T20 for a longer period of time, you need to have a firm grasp of the basic skills. Even in T20 you can score quickly by hitting copybook cricket shots, he said.         
	He also supports the idea that India should play more Test matches than what they are currently playing. We are the top-ranked Test nation and we should get enough chance to defend our rank. I would rally feel bad that another country overtakes us just because we didnt play enough matches, Viswanath stated.         
	Viswanath, who has worked as a batting consultant with the National Cricket Academy, is satisfied with Team Indias bench strength. He feels that the likes of Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Cheteswar Pujara have the potential to do well in the longer version, but they will have to wait for their turn.         
	When you have stalwarts like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman still performing, you cant do much. Sachin scored a magnificent 175 (against Australia) the other day. Who are we to judge when these guys will retire? The Pujaras will have to make that sacrifice.         
	You cant help. When Bishan Singh Bedi played, we had some great left-arm spinners. But they had to make the sacrifice as Bishan was the greatest during his time, he smiled.

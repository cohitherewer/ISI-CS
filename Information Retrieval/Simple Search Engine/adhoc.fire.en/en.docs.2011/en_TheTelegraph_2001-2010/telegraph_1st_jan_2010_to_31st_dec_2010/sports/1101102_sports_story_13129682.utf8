The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sitwala loses to Russell
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sitwala loses to Russell
                      
	Leeds: Indian billiards player Dhruv Sitwalas hopes of winning his maiden World Professional title came crashing down, on Monday, after he lost his summit clash to nine-time champion Mike Russell of Qatar at the Northern Snooker Centre here.         
	Sitwala played well throughout the final and constructed four century breaks against the nine-time professional champion, including one accounting for 281 to win 1204-1738.         
	On the other hand, green baize veteran Russell finally got back his crown that he lost last year to Advani, who had become the second Indian after Sethi to win the elusive title.         
	Sitwala said the five-day-long event has helped him to develop into a more mature, complete and pressure-seeking competitor.         
	Defeating defending champion Pankaj Advani in the quarter final was great achievement for me, he said.           (PTI)

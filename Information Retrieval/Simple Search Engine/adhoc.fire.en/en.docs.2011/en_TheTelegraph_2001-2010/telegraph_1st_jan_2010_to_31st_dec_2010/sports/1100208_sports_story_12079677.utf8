  - Premier League Chelsea move two points ahead of manchester United         THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Didier Drogba after scoring the first of his   two goals on Sunday                                       
	London: First-half goals from Didier Drogba earned Chelsea a 2-0 win over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, securing them a return to the top of the Premier League with 58 points, two ahead of Manchester United.         
	Sir Alex Ferguson had expressed the hope that Arsenal would absolutely batter Chelsea on Sunday, but it was Arsne Wengers team who were on the end of yet another sound beating against what are fast becoming the Premier Leagues big two.         
	Between them, Chelsea and Manchester United have won the past five league titles and have also now each beaten Arsenal four times in 10 months. This 2-0 win extends Chelseas lead over Arsenal to nine points and, with only 13 games remaining, reinforces the expectation of another two-horse title race.         
	It was another major occasion when Wengers huge confidence in his young team was not realised while his previous assessment of Didier Drogba as a player who doesnt do much was also further undermined.         
	Drogba had scored twice in Chelseas 3-0 defeat of Arsenal at the Emirates and duly put the league leaders two goals clear on Sunday after just 22 minutes. It also took Drogbas tally for the season to 22  and his personal haul against Arsenal to 12.         
	Poor defending contributed to both goals. The first arrived on eight minutes when Florent Malouda delivered a corner onto the head of an unmarked John Terry, who simply guided the ball across the goal for Drogba to volley beyond Manuel Almunia.         
	Wenger was complaining vigorously to the fourth official, presumably in reference to a foul that had been awarded against Gael Clichy in the build-up to the goal.         
	Arsenal almost immediately had the chance to equalise but Andrei Arshavin volleyed into the legs of Petr Cech when he had the goal at his mercy, following a wonderful Cesc Fabregas pass.         
	It was a miss that was quickly punished, although the source of Drogbas second will have infuriated Wenger. Having called his team nave after Manchester United scored twice from Arsenal corners last Sunday, his players again showed their vulnerability when they were attacking.         
	Following an Arsenal corner, Frank Lampard burst forward and simply fed the ball to Drogba wide on the right. Clichy, in particular, offered only negligible protection as Drogba cut inside and then smashed his shot beyond Almunia.         
	Arsenal improved during the second-half, particularly when Nicklas Bendtner was introduced and provided a different sort of threat with his more physical presence.         
	He won a free kick from which Fabregas forced a decent save but, generally, Arsenal continue to lack a natural focal point in attack without Robin van Persie. With Drogba again deadly  he also rocked the crossbar with an 83rd minute free-kick  the same cannot be said of Chelsea.         
	Terry, the Chelsea captain, showed no sign of strain despite being stripped of the England captaincy on Friday following a week of lurid press headlines about alleged extra-marital affairs, including one with the former girlfriend of England teammate Wayne Bridge.         
	Neither Terry, nor Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti, mentioned the scandal in their programme notes and the club have avoided any comment. Almost every touch of the ball by Terry was greeted with boos from Arsenal fans and cheers from the Chelsea support.

	Lincoln: Defending champions India started their quest for a second successive title in style, thrashing qualifiers Afghanistan by eight wickets in their opening Group A match of the ICC under-19 cricket World Cup here Friday.         
	Indian skipper Ashok Maneria elected to field in the lop-sided encounter and his bowlers kept the faith by packing off the minnows for 118 in 49.2 overs.         
	Chasing the paltry target, the Indian batsmen hardly broke a sweat and romped to 122 for two in just 25.2 overs.         
	For Afghanistan, skipper Noor-ul Haq waged a lone battle with a painfully slow 61-run knock that came off 119 balls.         
	Indias new-ball pair of Sandeep Sharma and Saurabh Netravalkar, who bowled for 20 overs in a row, were exceptionally hostile against an inexperienced team that defied the odds to make the cut for the elite under-19 event.

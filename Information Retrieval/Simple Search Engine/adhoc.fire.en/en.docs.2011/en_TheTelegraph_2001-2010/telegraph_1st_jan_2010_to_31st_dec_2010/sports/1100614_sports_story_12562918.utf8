                                                                                                                       7                                        Like father unlike son
            A STAFF REPORTER              Rachit                       
	Calcutta: In his short but eventful international career Chetan Sharma showed a lot of heart whenever he donned national colours.         
	But unfortunately the former India fast bowler has always been remembered for that infamous last-ball six hit by Javed Miandad in Sharjah. Who knows probably the scars are still there in Chetan. Or else why would his 18-year-old son Rachit take up serious football.         
	My father never pressurised me about taking up cricket. Instead, he encouraged me when I took up football. In fact, I dont watch cricket much save T20 matches, said Rachit who is a part of the Delhi U-19 team that took part in the U-19 National Championship for the B. C. Roy Trophy.         
	However, Delhi lost 0-4 to Bengal on the day.         
	Actually, I played the game as I have been extremely passionate about it. I was not aware of the Tata Football Academy where I could have honed my skills, said Rachit who plays as a striker.         
	An ardent fan of Steven Gerrard, Rachit is still undecided whether he would take up football as a career.

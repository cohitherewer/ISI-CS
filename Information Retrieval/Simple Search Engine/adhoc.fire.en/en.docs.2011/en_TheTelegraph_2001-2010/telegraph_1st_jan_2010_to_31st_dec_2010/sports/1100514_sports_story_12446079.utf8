The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terry scare underlines fragility
                                                                                                                       7                                        Terry scare underlines fragility
            MATT HUGHES            John Terry                           
	Fabio Capello revealed in a recent interview that when watching a game, he grabs his crotch out of superstition every time Wayne Rooney receives possession, a gesture that appears to be the Italian equivalent of crossing ones fingers. The England manager will have done just that for much of the afternoon Wednesday when John Terry gave him another injury scare a month before the start of the World Cup campaign.         
	Capello needs the Chelsea defender to be fit and firing when the squad departs for South Africa next month and greeted the news that Terry sustained minor bruising rather than the feared broken metatarsal with immense relief.         
	Terry had feared the worst, which, in a man used to playing through pain, indicates that the injury may return to haunt him. The 29-year-old Chelsea captain landed awkwardly on his right foot after a challenge in a training session Wednesday and was immediately carried off the pitch on a stretcher.         
	Terry had sufficient strength to be able to walk away from the training ground in a protective boot, but was immediately sent for further tests.         
	A scan revealed no evidence of a break, with the injury limited to minor ligament damage, and Terry vowed to return to action in the FA Cup Final against Portsmouth at Wembley on Saturday.         
	I took a slight knock in training but, with such an important match, the right course of action was to put a protective boot on my right foot and have a CT scan, Terry said.         
	Terrys bullishness is understandable and his desire to play admirable, but there is a danger that he could be underestimating the damage to his body.         
	He has had problems with his right foot before  breaking it in three places after clashing with Emmanuel Eboue, the Arsenal player, 2 and a half years ago  and if he sustains any further strain in that area, his hopes of playing in South Africa could be over.         
	The quickest recovery from a broken metatarsal in recent times was the six weeks it took Rooney to come back from his injury at Stamford Bridge to appear for England in the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany when not fully fit.         
	David Beckham took 13 weeks to recover from his broken metatarsal in 2002 and the midfield players physical condition on returning to the side was even worse than Rooneys.         
	Terry does not quite rival Rooney in his importance to Capellos plans, but Wednesdays three-hour injury scare did highlight the paucity of resources at his disposal at centre back.         
	Selecting any of the five other central defenders named in his 30-man squad would carry an element of risk, a situation that only increases Capellos reliance on Terry.

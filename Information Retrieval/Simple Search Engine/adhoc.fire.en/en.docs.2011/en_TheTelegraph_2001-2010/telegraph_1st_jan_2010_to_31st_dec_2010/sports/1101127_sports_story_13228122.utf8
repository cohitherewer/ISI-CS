            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Penn Orji (from left), Tolgay Ozebe, Robin Singh, Sanju Pradhan and Sushant Mathew enact a celebratory sail, after their first goal, against Mohun Bagan, at the Salt Lake Satdium, on Friday. Robins brace sunk Mohun Bagans boat as the red and gold brigade regained the CFL title. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Trevor Morgans vision and Robin Singhs passion confirmed East Bengals status as 2010 Calcutta Football League (CFL) champions with a game to spare on Friday. The red and gold brigade showed nerves in a derby match to beat defending champions Mohun Bagan 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Morgans appointment as coach has given East Bengal a new lease of life, as the Briton first helped the club win the Federation Club this year and then the CFL with a stunning win record throughout the season.         
	With Fridays win, Morgans men defeated Mohun Bagan three times in a row this year. Robin Singh, playing his first season in league football, scored two goals in each half to lift his side to a title victory.         
	East Bengal were a squad short on numbers due to injuries to key players, but Morgans tactical acumen gave the side a better hand in the face of a challenging situation. Mohun Bagan not only ran out of wits on a big-match day, but their forwards were blunted by a resilient red and gold defence.         
	The pressure showed in Mohun Bagans sluggish pass making and the resultant goal in the 12th minute. Shilton Paul made a rare mistake on a day when their title defence hung in balance. He dived full-length to pouch a Tolgay Ozebe cross but fluffed it allowing Robin Singh to tap in the first goal.         
	The Bagan camp was shocked as it came as a gift to the archrivals. Robin staged an impromptu dummy by pretending to row a boat with teammates in a dig at Bagan and from then on, it was an all red and gold show.         
	Bagan failed to hog position in the midfield and there was practically no attack through the wings. Dropping Snehasish Chakraborty from the first team proved costly as lack of overlapping hurt Bagan. Interestingly, Penn Orji came deep down in the face of counterattacks and that propped the East Bengal defence. The move was rather surprising and Morgan revealed Orjis role after the match. Penns role today was a little bit more defensive than normal when we didnt have the ball. When he did have the ball he could go, Morgan said.         
	East Bengal played to a plan and invited Bagan to make mistakes. Morgan said, We sat back, absorbed the pressure and hit them on the counter attack. It is exactly what we had discussed.         
	Morgans men attacked in bursts and crowded the defence so much so that the trio of Edeh Chidi, Murithala Ali and Jose Barreto failed to penetrate. To add to Bagans agony there were hardly any moves for the strikers that could pose enough threat.         
	Chidi knocked on East Bengals door in the 18th minute when his header was saved on the goal-line by Sanju Pradhan. Then, Ashim Biswas screamer in the 86th minute thudded against the crossbar.         
	Sushant Mathew and Sanju Pradhan combined brilliantly and played well individually too, till the combination of Tolgay and Robin struck again. Tolgeys measured cross in the area found Robin unmarked and the latter timed his jump nicely to head home his second.

            OUR CORRRESPONDENT                             
	Shillong: Lajong FC held Churchill Brothers to a goalless draw in an I-League match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, here, on Wednesday. It might be recalled that Churchill were upset by Lajong in the Federation Cup semi-finals in Guwahati just a month ago.         
	And on Wednesday, the defending I-League champions could not avenge their that loss only because they were much below par.         
	Even Lajong were not their element and the crowd, who came anticipating a victory, left home disappointed.         
	Churchill are now fifth with 19 points after 12 matches and Lajong 10th with 10 points from 12 matches.         
	Churchill dominated the proceedings in the first half. They created some chances but striker Felix failed to convert those.         
	In the second half Lajong regrouped and started making forays into the rival hlf. But frontline duo of Anil Gurung and S Tubois efforts lacked the sting.         
	Lajong goalkeeper Gumpe Rime was adjudged man of the match. Lajong coach Stanley Rozario said he was satisfied with the boys performance. You must keep in mind that eight of our players are nursing injuries. And most of the players are finding it difficult to cope with the pressure of playing in the I-League, he said.

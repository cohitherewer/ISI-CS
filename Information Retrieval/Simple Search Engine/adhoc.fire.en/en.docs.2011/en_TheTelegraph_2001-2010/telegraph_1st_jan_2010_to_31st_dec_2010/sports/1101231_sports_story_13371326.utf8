The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Finally, a victory for Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Finally, a victory for Blues
                      
	London: Chelsea ended their dire run with a 1-0 home Premier League win over Bolton Wanderers but Arsenal, seeking to go joint-top with a win, conceded a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw at 10-man Wigan Athletic, on Wednesday.         
	It was a miserable night for Liverpool as they were booed off after being outplayed and outfought by Wolverhampton Wanderers, who moved up from the bottom of the standings after securing their first away win of the season with a goal by Stephen Ward.         
	Arsenals draw took them to 36 points, two behind Manchester City and Manchester United, who lead on goal difference. Chelsea move back to fourth place on 34, one ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, with Bolton sixth on 29.         
	Having been beaten by Arsenal on Monday to make it just six points from 24, Chelsea were desperate to give their fans something to shout about. However, there was little sign of last-seasons double-winning pedigree in the first hour as Bolton, who would have leapfrogged the Londoners with a win, worked tirelessly.         
	Carlo Ancelotti, said, In the second half we were much better (than the first half) and played with more confidence, and after two games in two days we must say that the players did very well.

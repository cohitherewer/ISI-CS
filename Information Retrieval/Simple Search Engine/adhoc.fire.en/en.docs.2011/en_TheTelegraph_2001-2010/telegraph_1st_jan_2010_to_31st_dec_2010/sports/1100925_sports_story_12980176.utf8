The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA wants separate review on corruption
                                                                                                                       7                                      CA wants separate review on corruption
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has demanded an independent review on corruption in the sport be conducted without interference from the International Cricket Council, and the reports recommendations implemented unconditionally.         
	Sutherland wants the review to be conducted in such a manner that the recommendations last for a long period of time. The ICC has started a review of the games existing anti-corruption measures but the CA chief executive wants a worldwide investigation to be run independent of the ICC.         
	He has expressed dissatisfaction with how previous match-fixing scandals have been handled by the ICC.         
	There have been a number of inquiries in the past, including the Lord Paul Condon report, Justice Malik Mohammed Qayyum in Pakistan, Justice Chandrachud in India and the King Commission in South Africa. However, Sutherland questioned the longevity of such investigations, given the changing nature of cricket and society.         
	There were a whole lot of recommendations that came through from that, Sutherland said on CAs website. How many of those recommendations have been put in place, are they absolutely relevant to this day and age? The world has changed a lot in ten years. Were in far more of a digital age to where we were before.         
	All of those things need to be assessed and I dont think its appropriate for them to be assessed by some internal person. I think a highly-credentialed external expert could do a full-blown review around the world  the time is right for that.         
	Justice Qayyum complained that his findings in the late 1990s were not fully implemented. One of his recommendations was for players assets to be examined annually, a process that had not been implemented.         
	Sutherland said he was shocked and saddened to hear of the reports that Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif had deliberately bowled no-balls for financial gains during the Lords Test against England. However, he said it could be a good thing that cricket administrators would now be forced to act on corruption in the game.         
	If these charges are proven, we find ourselves in a position where weve got clear evidence of international cricket having been corrupted, Sutherland said. That in itself, I actually see that as a positive, that it comes out on the table and is clear. Its positive in a sense that we cant deny it  we have to face the facts.         
	With that on the table we can  we being cricket administrators around the world and the ICC  can take a serious look at the processes and the controls and the education weve put in place in the last few years, where they may have fallen down, where there are ways in which we can improve that.         
	Sutherland firmly believes the suspect Sydney Test match, when Pakistan lost from an unlikely position after a series of dropped catches, errors and bizarre field placings, was won by Australia fairly.         
	I remain unconvinced that match was fixed or corrupted in any way. At the moment, theres rumour and innuendo, theres nothing founded on that, Sutherland said. I guess time will tell.

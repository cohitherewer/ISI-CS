	Johannesburg: South African doctors are planning to leave bullet fragments in the stomach of Togo goalkeeper Kodjovi Dodji Obilale because it could cause more damage if they try to remove them.         
	The 25-year-old Obilale was shot in the lower back Friday when gunmen attacked the bus carrying Togos national team to Angola for the African Nations Cup. The bullet fragmented, and some pieces have become lodged in his stomach.         
	Removing them sometimes causes more damage than leaving them behind, said trauma specialist Ken Boffard, who is part of Obilales medical team at Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg.         
	Three people were killed and eight injured in the attack. The Togolese team was arriving in Angola for the African Cup when they were ambushed in an attack blamed on militants fighting for the independence of Cabinda.         
	Obilale was operated on after being flown from Cabinda to Johannesburg on Saturday, and he has been under sedation since, with a ventilator to help him breathe. Boffard said no more operations are planned.         
	I am happy to report that his condition has stabilized. He is in good condition at the moment, Boffard said Monday at a news conference.         
	We expect him to stay on the ventilator for the next couple of days and we dont expect his condition to change very much with the next couple of days. Overall, we are happy with his progress.         
	Boffard said it was too soon to say whether Obilale, who plays for French minor league club Pontivy, would recover enough to play again, but that doctors were optimistic. He said Obilale was able to move his legs when he was admitted Saturday.         
	He is built like a goalkeeper, Boffard said. That is very much in his favour. So his condition was reasonable when he got down here.         
	Efraim Kramer, a Fifa medical officer who has been monitoring Obilales case, said Obilales future in football will have to do with whats in his head or whats in his heart.         
	Kramer said he was giving Fifa president Sepp Blatter and other officials updates on Obilale every few hours.         
	An incident like this is a tragic incident and they see it in that light, Kramer said at the hospital briefing. And they are obviously concerned about the people that succumbed and their families as well as the patient lying here in intensive care and their families.         
	Togos French coach, Hubert Velud, told the a French newspaper: We were shot at from both sides of the bus, from 10 metres. We owe our lives to the nerves of our driver, who was able to keep driving for a few hundred metres before the army intervened.         
	Antonio Bento Bembe, an ex-rebel who is now a minister in charge of Cabinda affairs and policy on the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC), said the driver, earlier reported to have been killed, was badly wounded but out of danger.         
	Meanwhile, in Cabinda, Ivory Coast were held to a goalless draw by neighbours Burkina Faso in Mondays only Group B game.         
	Ivory Coast, Africas leading contenders at this years World Cup in South Africa, enjoyed most of the possession but Bakary Kone failed to convert three clear chances and Didier Drogba was far from his brilliant best.

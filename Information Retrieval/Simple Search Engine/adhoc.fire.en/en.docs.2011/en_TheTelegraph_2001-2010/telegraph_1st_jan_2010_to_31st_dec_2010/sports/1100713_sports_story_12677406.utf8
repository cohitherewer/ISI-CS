The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough test in warm-up tie
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tough test in warm-up tie
  -Harbhajan down with fever
                      
	Colombo: The absence of pace spearhead Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth will be a big setback for the team in the three-Test series against Sri Lanka, said Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Zaheer has been ruled out of the series due to a shoulder injury while Sreesanth has sprained a ligament of his left knee and will be replaced by Munaf Patel in the squad.         
	It has happened with us in the past. In the past also we have lost our main bowlers just before an important series. We will definitely miss Zaheer and Sreesanth during the series, Dhoni said.         
	He, however, felt that the situation was an ideal opportunity for youngsters in the team to prove their worth.         
	It is a great platform for young bowlers to prove their mettle and seal their place in the side, Dhoni said.         
	To make matters worse for India, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is down with a fever and has been ruled out of the practice match, against the SLC Board Presidents XI, which begins Tuesday.         
	Harbhajan is not playing tomorrow (Tuesday). He has got a viral infection but he is expected to be fit for the first Test, Dhoni said.         
	In Zaheers absence, his replacement Abhimanyu Mithun, would fancy his chances of partnering Ishant Sharma. In the slow bowling department, the team management are expected to field both Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha before determining who should partner Harbhajan in the first Test at Galle.         
	It will be a tough challenge for the Indians in the warm-up tie as six players from Sri Lankas Test squad are there in the Board Presidents XI. The presence of Dilhara Fernando, Chanaka Welegedara and Ajantha Mendis render a formidable look to the oppositions attack. Their batting seems decent with Thilan Samaraweera, Upul Tharanga and Lahiru Thirimanne in the ranks.         
	Dhoni praised Muttiah Muralidharan, who will quit Test cricket after the first Test against the Indians, and said that his batting colleagues will do their best to make it difficult for the Lankan spinner to attain the 800-wicket mark, a feat for which he needs just eight scalps.         
	Murali is great bowler but we will make it tough for him in the series. He will have to earn his wickets, he said.         
	Dhoni also said that he was not in favour of the use of Decision Review System (DRS).         
	I am not in favour of the review system. I feel it should be used only when it is 99 per cent accurate, the wicket-keeper batsman said.         
	Meanwhile, his counterpart, Kumar Sangakkara, however, was disappointed that the DRS would not be used in the Test series. Sangakkara rued that despite the Sri Lankan players being in favour of the system, it would not be used in the series.         
	At high levels of umpiring, you get things right about 92 per cent of the time. But the eight per cent is also now important these days, Sangakkara said.         
	As a player and a team, we are very much for the umpire decision review system, he said.         
	Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Nishantha Ranatunga had earlier said that the DRS was dropped since the Board of Control for Cricket in India was not in favour of it. Under the International Cricket Council rules, the host country needs the consent of the visiting team to use the review system.         
	We are very much in favour of it. When we checked with India, they were not happy to have it, Ranatunga had said.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi, the captain, is in a fix
                                                                                                                       7                                        Afridi, the captain, is in a fix
  - I just want one victory... I wont like to see my team go down without a fight             Pakistan players and support staff in the dug-out, in Cardiff, on Tuesday                           
	Cardiff: Pakistans ODI and T20 captain Shahid Afridi admitted that he has a job on his hands to raise the morale of his scandal-hit side after they lost the two-match T20 International series 0-2.         
	Pakistan were dismissed for 89  their lowest Twenty20 score in 40 matches at Sophia Gardens here, on as England won by six wickets with 36 balls to spare.         
	Pakistans tour has been overshadowed by a spot-fixing scandal that has seen Test captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif all suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after allegedly conspiring to deliberately bowl no balls during last months fourth Test at Lords.         
	But Afridi said off-field problems could not account for Pakistans form.         
	I made some plans as a captain. I knew Salman Butt was my opener and key player, and Asif and Aamer were my main bowlers. Everything has changed as a captain for me, but inshallah (God willing), we will come back, he said.         
	We are going through a bad phase Its tough to lead now. But as professionals we should take that out from our mind and focus on our cricket. At this stage I know morale of our team is very down. Its hitting the lowest ebb with each passing game. But if we can win one game, things will change for the better.         
	I just want one victory. I wont like to see my team go down without a fight, Afridi added.         
	The inexperience of some of the youngsters cost us the match. One expected a bit more maturity, Afridi told reporters. I think we played very badly. It will be a big challenge to compete in the ODIs, but we have some time, he added.         
	Me, my coach (Waqar Younis) and the team, we will sit together and talk.         
	Victory, built on seamer Tim Bresnans man-of-the-match winning return of three wickets for 10 runs in 3.4 overs, saw England to a seventh straight Twenty20 win  equalling the record for consecutive international victories in this format shared by South Africa and Pakistan.         
	In this form of the game it can be tough to win consecutively, said England Twenty20 captain Paul Collingwood. It just takes one performance from the opposition to take it away from you. To have that World Cup, you can have added pressure on you as well. But the way, weve played over the last two games, the boys are enjoying that added pressure, added Collingwood, who led England to a five-wicket win over Pakistan here on Sunday.         
	They tried to come hard at us today (Tuesday) -- you could sense that was their approach -- but we kept taking wickets and really applying the pressure.         
	There were more allegations in British newspapers, and the negativity looks to be seriously affecting the teams performances.         
	England produced an efficient display after losing the toss. Pakistan slumped to 22 for four after Afridi was caught for 2 edging to point when trying to slog-pull a delivery from Stuart Broad.         
	Im not letting my team down like this, not in the one-dayers, Afridi said. It will be a big challenge to compete, but we have some time. Me, my coach and the team we will sit together and talk. The first ODI will be played at Durham on Friday.           (AGENCIES)

                  Okolie Odafe                     
	Kolhapur: Talismanic Nigerian striker Okolie Odafe scored four goals as Churchill Brothers ended Mumbai FCs three-match winning streak on their home turf by humiliating them 5-1 in an I-League match, here on Saturday.         
	The hosts began well as Noel Wilson gave them the lead in the 12th minute.         
	However, Odafe took over from there and struck four times, twice on either side of the break, to put the match beyond Mumbai FC. Bineesh Balan scored the other goal.         
	The Nigerian restored parity for Churchill in the 18th minute through a penalty and gave them the lead 10 minutes later.         
	In the 40th minute, Balan made it 3-1 for Churchill.         
	Odafe then struck again in the 66th minute and three minutes into the stoppage time to complete the rout for Churchill.         
	In Margao, double strikes from Yusif Yakubu and Ryuji Sueoka kept Salgaocars winning momentum going as they thrashed AIFF XI 5-0 and move to the top of the I-League table.         
	Salgaocar played an attacking game right for the word go and took the lead in the seventh minute.         
	Sueokas through pass found Yakubu who took a defender in his stride and beat an advancing goalkeeper Jagroop Singh.         
	Anthony Barbosa initiated a move on the right and relayed the ball to Sueoka who released it to Yakubu. The latter then sent a measured cross to Sueoka who slotted the ball into the net from close.         
	Yakubu again had an opportunity to score but this time he drove the ball out after getting better of couple of rival defenders.         
	Sueoka with his swift running troubled the rival defence and scored his brace in the 33rd minute off a cross from Anthony Barbosa, who got the ball via Cajetan Fernandes.         
	The visitors came with early raids and had couple of chances but Jewel Raja Shaikhs attempts at the goal were saved by alert custodian Karnjit Singh.         
	Two minutes later, AIFF XI defence was again beaten when Barbosa released the ball to Yakubu who slammed home to score his double.         
	Yakubu had a golden chance to score a hattrick when he missed a penalty.         
	Salgaocar continued to hold their dominance in the second half too and had three chances to swell the score but Yakubu, Gilbert Oliveira and substitute Francis Fernandes failed to direct their shots on target.         
	Substitute Ekene Ikenwa then rounded the tally when he scored in the stoppage time.         
	In Kannur. HAL, Bangalore warded off stiff challenge from hosts Viva Kerala to hold them to a 1-1 draw.         
	The Bangalore outfit forged ahead in the 55th minute through a penalty conversion by J Murali, while the equaliser for Viva was scored by midfielder Anilkumar through a header in the 57th minute. Dominating the proceedings throughout, Viva failed to make use of the home advantage as they missed innumerable opportunities that came their way.         
	Viva had got a golden chance to sneak ahead in the 25th minute, but Bella Razak fumbled and drove the ball over the crosspiece.         
	Two minutes later, Viva had yet another chance, but this time it was Sabith, who shot it wide, much to the dismay of the crowd. Much against the run of the play, it was the Bangalore outfit who surprised Viva with the goal.         
	Striker Xavier Vijaykumar threatened when he dodged past a couple of defenders and was brought down deliberately by Vivas Sherin Sam inside the penalty box.         
	Murali, who took the penalty, converted it much to the delight of the visitors. But, hardly the cheers died down, when Viva found the equaliser through Anilkumar, who took full advantage from Umer Farooks cross.         
	In the dying moments, Viva went all out but the winner eluded them and they had to be content with a draw.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Right decision to omit Evra amp; Co.

                    GUEST COLUMN    SHYAM THAPA                                  Thierry Henry with coach Raymond Domenech after France lost to South Africa, in Bloemfontein, on Tuesday. (Reuters)		    
	I wonder what exactly is going through Nicolas Anelkas mind after watching his country exit from the World Cup on Tuesday. Isnt he feeling as bad as his fellow countrymen after the ouster? I firmly believe that Anelka should start accepting the fact that he has contributed a fair deal to the French teams disastrous result with his foul-mouthed bust-up with coach Raymond Domenech.         
	It wasnt a pretty sight to watch a dispirited Les Bleus lying in tatters against South African during their last group league encounter. Perhaps the zeal to fight and the purpose of playing at the biggest championship was lost even before they played their final match.         
	Blame it on Anelkas moment of madness during the half-time of the Mexico game or the stupid, amateurish conduct of his teammates, but this is one World Cup the French would like to forget in a hurry.         
	Personally, I feel the French Football Federation has done the correct thing in sending Anelka back after his act of misconduct. But certainly that wont be enough. I believe if the federation wants to set a good precedent, Anelka should be given exemplary punishment. No one is bigger than the game and certainly not bigger than the country. The likes of Anelka and Patrice Evra should understand this before anything else. Its not Domenech who has washed dirty linen in public. It is the players who did so, bringing their country into disrepute.         
	The 1-2 loss against South Africa is something I wouldnt pay much heed to. In any case, Frances chances of qualifying were remote.         
	But, it was heartening to see that Evra was put on the bench along with the likes of Eric Abidal, Jeremy Toulalan, Sidney Govou and Florent Malouda (the last two played as substitutes).         
	There were reports that some players refused to play the last match. In these situations, many associations will strike a compromise deal with the star players. Credit to the French bosses that they fielded a second string yet committed side.         
	The other day, I was feeling disgusted watching Evras heated exchange with French fitness coach Robert Duverne. When the chips are down and the team is in trouble, why make it more conspicuous?         
	In a star-studded team, it is the seniors who shoulder additional responsibility. Pity, Evra and Co. did exactly the opposite in the Anelka case. The manner in which they handled the issue was deplorable. Evra is not fit to be the captain of the team.         
	I read in the papers that the disgruntled players made Domenech read out a statement declaring their support of the banished Anelka. I appreciate the fellow-feeling but wouldnt it have been better had this bonhomie and understanding been reflected in their on-field performance?         
	If the players had a problem with Domenechs strategy and style of working, they could have sorted it out on a different platform. Maybe take the federation officials into confidence. Certainly the players ugly revolt will make Domenech look like a tragic hero. People will conveniently forget that this ageing team lacked quality and were found wanting tactically. But now it wont be Domenech who would be in the line of fire. The players will now face the wrath of the nation. And why not?         
	Now begins the transition period in French football. Theres no more Zinedine Zidane and the Thierry Henrys seem on their way out of the world stage. I also dont see a Evra playing in the next World Cup.         
	The French have a rich football culture and definitely these ugly events would have come as an eye opener for them.         
	Not lacking in talent and with most of their better players playing in the top European leagues, I dont see why they cant make a comeback.         
	So, lets wait for a French evolution.

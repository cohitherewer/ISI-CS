The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Why Capello is to blame
                                                                                                                       7                                      Why Capello is to blame
            Simon Barnes                      
	As Eric used to ask Ernie, what do you think of it so far? This is surely the most ineptly managed England performance at the World Cup finals for years. So perhaps its time we started blaming the manager.         
	Fabio Capello, the man in charge, is the best manager at the World Cup finals. Well, the best-paid, anyway. Almost five million pounds a year; well, thatd help with the mortgage. And what is his response to Englands miserable performance? Blame the players  the first resort of a manager out of his depth.         
	Its incredible, the mistakes of the players, he said, helpfully, after the dismal goalless draw with Algeria. Note: a manager is not supposed to criticise players as if they were something separate from himself. Rooney didnt play like Rooney, Capello added. Note: managers are not supposed to single out players for blame.         
	I want to see the spirit of the team and I didnt see it this evening. Could any manager have damned himself more completely? The spirit of the team is the managers responsibility.         
	It is these elusive things that managers draw their salaries for. Whats happening with your team? Blowed if I know! Thats not a satisfactory response from a man who is paid intensely serious money to run them.         
	One of my colleagues made an eloquent plea for unity before the World Cup finals started. He has his wish. The players are united, as they never were in the World Cup of 2006. They are united in that they all hate the manager.         
	Thats fine so far as it goes, but to rule by fear and hatred you need your players to be dependent on you. International players  particularly if they play in the Premier League  are not dependent on their international manager. They can walk away any time they want to, like Paul Scholes. There is a sense, these days, in which the players are doing the manager a favour.         
	And it seems pretty clear that most of those who played on Friday would be happy to pack it in right now and go back to a place where they feel valued and understood. That is the point that has eluded Capello in his transition from highly successful club manager to  so far  calamitous manager at international tournaments.         
	Heavy hints have been dropped, notably by David James  one of the few players to emerge from Fridays match with distinction  that the players are deeply unhappy with Capello. And they dont even think he can do the tactics, believing that his formation is a busted flush in modern international football and that Joe Cole ought to play in a five-man midfield.         
	No sympathy, no support, no understanding. He has bullied his team into sulking resentment, lead-booted football, a terror of failure, a still greater terror of responsibility, two points  and a fixture of pure desperation coming up.         
	Something will have to change if England are to get past Slovenia. Does Capello do change? Does Capello do listening? Does Capello do victory in tournament football?

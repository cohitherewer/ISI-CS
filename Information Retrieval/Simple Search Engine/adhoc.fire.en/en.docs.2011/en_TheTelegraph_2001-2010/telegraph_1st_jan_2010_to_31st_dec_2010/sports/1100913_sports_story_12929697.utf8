The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB to get tough with Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                      ECB to get tough with Pakistan

	England will not serve as a neutral venue for Pakistan again next summer. After the spot-fixing crisis of the last fortnight, Pakistan are believed to have been written out of the script and fixture schedule for the 2011 season.         
	The situation has been complicated by the fact that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke is also the head of the International Cricket Councils (ICC) new Pakistan Task group.         
	But his look of disdain, if not outright contempt, for Mohammed Aamer, when he was selected as Pakistans Man of the Series, and that Clarke refused to shake his hand, reflects the ECBs new, less-enthusiastic attitude towards Pakistan.         
	At the ICC chief executives meet in Cape Town on Monday, the ECB CEO David Collier is not going to offer Pakistan the same facilities for 2011. And the ICC is expected to tell the same to the Pakistan Cricket Board.         
	The ECBs grand design had been for Pakistan to use England as their second home so long as Pakistan was bedevilled by insecurity and terrorism.         
	But their two-Test series against Australia flopped at Headingley in terms of crowd numbers, instead of being the commercial success the ECB had hoped for. Then the spot-fixing allegations and the suspension of three of Pakistans top players dispelled thoughts of inviting Pakistan back to England in a hurry.         
	On Tuesday week the Pakistan bowler Wahab Riaz becomes the fourth man to be interviewed by police. England nowadays usually do without a third man, but at their current rate Pakistan may soon have to manage without a fifth, sixth or seventh man.         
	For 2011 the ECBs chief aspiration had been to stage a neutral Test and one-day series here between Pakistan and India, which would have drawn the crowds, at least for the limited-overs games. They would have served to help sustain Englands over-supply of international venues.         
	But, even if Indias government had allowed its national team to resume bilateral series against Pakistan  at present they can only play against each other in ICC tournaments like the World Cup  India are now fully booked for next summer. Immediately before their four-Test series in England they have to tour the West Indies, and immediately afterwards follows the Champions League, in which Indian players  and television  will be intimately involved.         
	As a modest alternative the ECB has thought of hosting a one-day series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka  a little something for Old Trafford and Headingley, which have not been allotted a Test next summer  and had left open a window of just over a week in July. But such a cloud has descended on Pakistan that, according to a ECB official, nobody is thinking about that one any more.         
	So now Pakistan face an even longer time in the wilderness than they had before.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

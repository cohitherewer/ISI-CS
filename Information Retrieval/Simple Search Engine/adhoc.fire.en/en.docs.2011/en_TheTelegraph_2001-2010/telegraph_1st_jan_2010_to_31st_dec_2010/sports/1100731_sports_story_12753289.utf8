The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shot in arm for HI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shot in arm for HI
                      
	New Delhi: A relieved Hockey India (HI) Friday said the Supreme Courts green signal for the national body to go ahead with its elections was a slap in the face of those who were constantly impeding the holding of the much-awaited polls.         
	Vacating the stay orders of the Bombay and the Delhi high courts, the Supreme Court Friday allowed HI to hold its elections, which was postponed for a fourth time on Wednesday.         
	However, the apex court has asked the national federation not to implement the results.         
	We knew it was just a matter of time before we got the stay orders vacated. It was bound to happen. It is a fitting reply to those who dont want the elections to take place, a HI official said.         
	But it was our responsibility to get the elections done as soon as possible, otherwise India faces the risk of a sanction from the international hockey federation (FIH), he said.         
	The official said HI would now conduct the elections as soon as possible.         
	Meanwhile, in a development that can have deep ramifications, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has asked the IOA to amend its constitution and take away the voting rights of the state Olympic committees to prevent manipulation in elections.         
	The IOC has recommended that the IOA report back to the parent body by mid-August after incorporating these changes in its constitution.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) took another step towards finalising a new Future Tours Programme for the 2012-2020 period as the chief executives committee has begun the process of drawing up rules and regulations for the Test and ODI leagues.         
	The committee also agreed to reconstitute its working group comprising David Collier (ECB), Nishantha Ranatunga (SLC), N. Srinivasan (BCCI), James Sutherland (CA) and David Richardson (ICC general manager cricket) to consider rules, regulations and points system for the leagues.         
	The working group, which previously made recommendations on the leagues and ICC global event calendar, will also have top statistician and ICC cricket committee member, David Kendix. The group will report back in January.

	London: Theo Walcott scored a hattrick in Arsenals 6-0 demolition of Blackpool and Tottenham relied on Gareth Bales double to edge Stoke 2-1, giving the north London rivals their first wins of the Premier League season Saturday.         
	Arsenal provided a harsh reality check for newcomer Blackpool, who had only been trailing 1-0 until Ian Evatt was sent off in the 32nd minute and Andrei Arshavin scored from the resulting penalty kick. Abou Diaby and Marouane Chamakh scored Arsenals other two goals in the second half either side of Walcotts third.         
	Tottenham, who also drew their opener last weekend, went ahead through Bales fortuitous header and he volleyed home before half time after Ricardo Fuller levelled for Stoke.         
	Craig Gardner also scored twice as Birmingham beat Blackburn 2-1, Johan Elmanders double helped Bolton win 3-1 at West Ham and Nigeria striker Peter Odemwingie scored on his West Bromwich Albion debut to clinch a 1-0 victory over Sunderland.         
	In Saturdays only draw, Wolverhampton held Everton 1-1.         
	Meanwhile, free-scoring Chelsea hit six goals for the second game in succession to heap more misery on Wigan at the DW Stadium. The hosts, who were embarrassingly beaten 4-0 at home by newcomers Blackpool in their opening game, made an encouraging start but still found themselves behind at half time.         
	Goalkeeper Chris Kirkland made a fine save from Frank Lampard but Florent Malouda was on hand to tap in the rebound in the 34th minute.         
	Nicolas Anelka made it 2-0 with a clinical finish in the 48th and he put the game to bed four minutes later with a close-range header, despite Wigans claims of offside.         
	Didier Drogba set up substitute Salomon Kalou for the fourth before Kalou got his second in the 90th with a glancing header, Drogba again the provider in an excellent all-round performance. Yossi Benayoun slotted home his first Chelsea goal in injury time to complete the rout and leave the Blues.         
	Around 3,000 Blackpool fans travelled to London buoyed by a dazzling Premier League debut last weekend, but there would be no repeat of the 4-0 victory over Wigan as the northwest side faced a ruthless attacking display.         
	A procession passing move ripped Blackpool apart down the left flank with Arshavin feeding Chamakh and the offseason recruit from Bordeaux laid the ball off to Tomas Rosicky, who returned the ball to Arshavin.         
	The Russia forward teed up an unmarked Walcott on the right of the penalty to fire into the bottom left corner of the net in the 12th minute.         
	Walcott continued to torment the visitors, but Arsenals second goal didnt come for another 20 minutes.         
	Chamakh latched onto Rosickys through and earned a penalty when Evatt was adjudged to have brought him down in the box and subsequently dismissed.         
	Arshavin drove the spot kick into the bottom right corner in the 32nd and with 10 men, Blackpool were effectively out of contention.         
	Walcott made sure of that by dispatching the ball into the far corner in the 39th after turning Dekel Keinan on the penalty spot.         
	Four minutes into the second half, Diaby volleyed in the fourth after latching onto Bacary Sagnas cross.         
	Diaby then slotted the ball through to Walcott in the 58th and the England winger, who was left out of the World Cup squad, fought off three players before curling the ball into the net to complete his hattrick.         
	Blackpools misery was completed in the 83rd when Chamakh headed in substitute Robin van Persies cross.         
	It was a less convincing win from Tottenham, who escaped with a victory from Stoke despite a late controversy when Jon Walters thought his header had crossed the line to earn a 2-2 draw but referee Chris Foy disagreed.

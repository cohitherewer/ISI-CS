The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand strikes   back in Game II
                                                                                                                       7                                        Anand strikes   back in Game II
                    Viswanathan Anand                      
	Sofia: GM Viswanathan Anand responded as only he could, bouncing back from defeat in the first game to force challenger Veselin Topalov to surrender in 43 moves in the second game of their FIDE World Chess Championship match in the Bulgarian capital on Sunday.         
	Following Anands defeat in the first game, chess fans were wondering whether he would try to pull level with the Bulgarian with white pieces or adopt a more cautious strategy and wait for the rest day on Monday to regroup.         
	They did not have to wait long for the answer  Anand opened with a very popular Catalan set-up, in which White aims for the initiative and long-term pressure. Topalov responded with a move designed to create imbalances in that position.         
	The pace was considerably slower compared to the first game as both players carefully considered their steps.         
	Anand sacrificed a pawn in the opening in exchange for the quick development and positional pressure. His first long pause was before move 15, on which he offered Queens trade. Anand was not bothered much with the doubled a-pawns, as his rooks obtained excellent activity on the open files.         
	Both pairs of knights were firmly entrenched in the central positions and the play revolved around the c-file and queenside.         
	But then came a moment of haste for Topalov and he made a move which official match commentator GM Zurab Azmaiparashvili termed unnecessary and allowed Anand to seize a nice positional advantage and collect black queenside pawns.         
	Topalov tried to reduce the pressure by offering one pair of rooks for trade, but his opponent wisely declined.         
	After establishing a pair of passed pawns on a and b files, Anand obtained a decisive advantage and it was just a matter of time before Topalov resigned. He gave up on move 43, in the lost rook endgame.         
	With this victory, Anand equalises the score in the match at 1-1. Monday is rest day with the third game to be played on Tuesday.         
	Anand did not have the best of starts to his title defence and the Indian GM was forced to surrender in 30 moves in Saturdays first game at the Military Club in Sofia.         
	The 12-game World Chess Championship match started with Anand, black, walking into the Bulgarians aggressive opening preparation in the Grunfeld Defence.         
	The dynamic opening saw both Topalov and Anand reeling off the first 20 moves in just 10 minutes. The first 18 moves were completed in just four minutes. Topalov and Anand have good experience in playing the Grunfeld against other opponents but had not used this variation against each other.         
	Eventually, between moves 26 and 28, the Bulgarian took control of the seventh rank with his rooks and forced Anands resignation quickly with an exchange sacrifice.         
	Anand has won the title on three occasions  2000, 2007, 2008  while Topalov is the 2005 winner.         
	The match consists of 12 games and the first to score 6.5 points will be the winner. In case the scores are equal at 6-6, four tiebreak games will be played in the Rapid format on May 13.

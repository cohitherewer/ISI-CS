The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Can return to United
                                                                                                                       7                                      Can return to United
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Cristiano Ronaldo may play for Manchester United again one day, saying: Maybe in the future I could return.         
	The 25-year-old departed for Real Madrid in a world record 80 million deal last summer after six seasons at Old Trafford, which yielded three Premier League titles, a Champions League crown and numerous other team and personal honours.         
	The move was long mooted, with Ronaldos desire to play in Spain and the astronomical transfer fee eventually seeing the forward switch to the Bernabeu.         
	Ronaldo, who joined Manchester United for 12.24m from Sporting Lisbon aged 18, has made a strong start to his Real career, scoring 11 times in 13 Primera Division appearances.         
	However, he may pull on a United shirt again.         
	Of course I miss playing for Manchester United, Ronaldo told a newspaper. I played there for six years and thats a long time. Im still interested in watching Manchester United and, you never know, maybe in the future I could return to play there. Its always possible.         
	Ronaldo has a long-term contract at Real which he plans to honour, but he stressed his fondness for Sir Alex Ferguson, his former United team-mates and the Old Trafford club.         
	I want to fulfil my contract here but, in the future, only God knows, he said.

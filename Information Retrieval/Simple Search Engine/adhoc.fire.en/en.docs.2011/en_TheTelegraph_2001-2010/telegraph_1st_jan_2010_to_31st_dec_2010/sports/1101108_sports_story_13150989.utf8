The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Italy take commanding lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Italy take commanding lead
                      
	San Diego: Holders Italy closed in on a third Fed Cup title in five years after taking a commanding 2-0 lead over the United States in the opening singles of the best-of-five match final, on Saturday.         
	Italys top player Francesca Schiavone gave the visitors a flying start by brushing aside American teenager Coco Vandeweghe 6-2, 6-4 in one hour 23 minutes at the San Diego Sports Arena.         
	Her compatriot Flavia Pennetta then held off a first-set fightback by American No. 1 Bethanie Mattek-Sands before winning a tense battle 7-6, 6-2.         
	In Sundays reverse singles, Mattek-Sands is set to face Schiavone while Vandeweghe meets Pennetta before Americans Liezel Huber and Melanie Oudin play Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci in the concluding doubles.         
	However US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said her teams lineup could change on Sunday and Mattek-Sands appeared to be suffering from cramps in her right calf in her opening match.         
	Schiavone, the French Open champion and world No. 7, had been widely expected to crush Vandeweghe in the first singles out, and she duly delivered after breaking her opponent twice in each set.         
	It was a good match for me, Schiavone told reporters after becoming the most successful Italian ever at the Fed Cup with a win-loss record of 24-14.I started really well, particularly the first set, and then I went a little bit down.         
	But I played a solid game. I was aggressive. It was not easy today for her but I think she can play good tennis because shes very strong, very powerful.         
	Vandeweghe, making her Fed Cup debut after being chosen ahead of the higher-ranked and more experienced Oudin, made a deceptively bright start after opting to serve first.         
	Roared on by a sparse crowd, she unleashed an ace followed by a strong first serve to lead the opening game 30-0 but later succumbed to nerves when she double-faulted and was broken.         
	The big-hitting American was again broken in the fifth, hitting a forehand long after a protracted baseline rally, before Schiavone won the opening set in 34 minutes.         
	The Italian broke her opponent in the first game of the second when a Vandeweghe forehand sailed wide but the American, ranked a lowly 114th, did well to break back in the eighth.         
	However Vandeweghe immediately lost serve in the ninth and Schiavone, leading 5-4, coolly served out to love, sealing victory when the American netted a backhand service return.         
	The feisty Italian pumped her left fist in celebration before acknowledging her own supporters in the crowd by clapping her left hand on her racket strings.           (AGENCIES)

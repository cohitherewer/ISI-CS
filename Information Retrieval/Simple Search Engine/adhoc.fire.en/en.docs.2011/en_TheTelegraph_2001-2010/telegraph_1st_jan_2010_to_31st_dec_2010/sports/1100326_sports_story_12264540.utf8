	Melbourne: Fernando Alonso had some advice for viewers turned off by the underwhelming spectacle of Formula Ones season-opener in Bahrain  go watch something else!         
	New rules, including a ban on refuelling, designed to inject excitement into the championship and discourage drivers from playing safe, fell flat at Sakhir, resulting in a procession decided at qualifying.         
	The Spaniard said the regulations must be given a chance.         
	I think we need to be calm, we need to wait some races to see if the new rules have some impact in the show, Alonso told reporters at Albert Park circuit on Thursday.         
	Last year, (in the) first seven races, Jenson (Button) won six or seven. It was boring? Maybe yes, maybe not, this is Formula One.         
	Michael (Schumacher) won five championships consecutively, it was boring? Maybe yes, maybe no, this is Formula One.         
	This is about technology, about how precise everything is in terms of driver, mechanics, engineering, everything, continued Alonso.

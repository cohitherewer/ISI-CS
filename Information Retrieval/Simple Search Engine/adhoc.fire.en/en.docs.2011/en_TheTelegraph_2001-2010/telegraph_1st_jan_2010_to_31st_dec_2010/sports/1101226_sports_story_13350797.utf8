  - Zaheer Khans return set to bolster the Indian bowling attack       OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES            Sachin Tendulkar in Durban, on Saturday                                 
	Calcutta/Durban: Battered into submission in the first Test despite Sachin Tendulkars batting heroics, India will aim to reclaim their bruised pride and level the three-Test series against South Africa.         
	The visitors are smarting from an innings and 25 runs defeat in Centurion, where their famed line-up capitulated so badly in the first innings that it became impossible to salvage the match in the second essay.         
	In their previous Tests at the ground, India managed a draw in 1992-93 but lost by 328 runs in 1996-97, and by 174 runs in 2006-07.         
	South Africas record havent also been too impressive at Kingsmead. Graeme Smiths men have suffered a couple of massive defeats at the venue in recent times (by 175 runs to Australia in 2008-09 and an innings and 98 runs against England last year).         
	The curator has promised a fair track which would have as much for the bowlers as for the batsmen and that should be music to the Indian ears.         
	The visiting batsmen seemed to have no clue against the pace and bounce of the Proteas pacers on the Centurion pitch.         
	The batting did come good in the second innings of that highly forgettable match for the Indians but the form of a few remains a concern.         
	One among them is Suresh Raina, who has scored 32, 3, 20, 3, 1 and 5 in his last six Test innings, and it is likely that young Cheteshwar Pujara will take his place.         
	But the big guns such as Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid and Dhoni himself showed they were in good touch, at least, in the second innings of the Centurion Test.         
	Their contribution would be crucial against the quality pace attack of the South Africans.         
	The Indians would obviously be bolstered by the return of Zaheer Khan, but the ineffectiveness of Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth would be a worry.         
	Zaheer is a key player, said Dhoni.         
	With all the experience he has, he always comes up with new plans and changes his plans during the course of a game, the Indian skipper added.         
	South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl plans to go with a spinner, something that the visitors, too, plan to do for Sundays game.         
	The ball does a bit in overcast conditions at Durban, and Dhoni said his bowlers have to be on spot on a wicket that would largely favour the seamers.         
	According to Dhoni, the wicket will not show much change, unlike the Centurion wicket that had too much of juice on the first day.         
	Come what may, Dale Steyn will steam in with his usual speed and a lot will count on the Indian openers.         
	It will be extremely important to hold fort against the Proteas speedsters and if India can manage to dead bat the opposition bowlers, the visitors can put the pressure back on South Africa.

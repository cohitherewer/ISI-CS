The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A special Slam: Paes
                                                                                                                       7                                      A special Slam: Paes
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Leander Paes created history on Sunday. He became only the second man to win Wimbledon titles in three different decades and, in the process, also topped the list of Indian Grand Slam winners.         
	The 37-year-old, together with Zimbabwean partner Cara Black, won the mixed doubles crown defeating South African Wesley Moodie and Lisa Raymond of the US 6-4, 7-6(7-5).         
	Paes had won the mixed doubles title in 1999 with Raymond and in 2003 partnering Martina Navratilova. Rod Laver is the only man to have previously won titles in three different decades.         
	Though Paes has always stated that numbers dont hold any special meaning for him, he described his 12th Grand Slam title triumph as a wonderful feeling, holding a special place in his heart.         
	It is wonderful to be in my 23rd Grand Slam final. It is a lot of fun. Days like these remind me what hard work is all about. It is really special, Paes said.         
	It has been 20 years since I first won the junior singles at Wimbledon and even after all these years, it is really sweet to stand out there with a trophy in your hand when you are almost doubly 19, the 37-year-old told a television channel.         
	Paes and Black had won the Australian Open in January this year and the Indian said the Zimbabwean was one of his favourite mixed doubles partners.         
	Cara is one of my favourite partners to play with. She is not only a true champion but also a very good human being. Navratilova was also a fantastic partner. I have been lucky to have good partners, Paes said.         
	In fact, I played against one of my first partners Lisa. We have played on centre court in 1999. So it was bitter out there to see Lisas face when we shook hands after the match, Paes added.         
	Paes thanked his fans for motivating him to keep going and hoped they would keep inspiring him during the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and US Open.         
	Indian legends lauded Paes achievement. Leander is the greatest doubles player of all time, said former Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali. Leander, by winning his 12th Slam on Sunday, gave me a wonderful birthday present a day before I turned 71! What he has achieved for Indian tennis is marvellous. No other Indian seems to be close to his pace right now.         
	Although it is easy to compete in doubles  as top singles players dont play  that does not mean it is easy to win a Slam.         
	I was present for the final and was amazed, said Naresh Kumar. Its a phenomenal achievement, to win a Grand Slam at the age of 37. Leanders hard work and dedication to the sport, especially at his age, is miraculous.         
	When I selected him for the Davis Cup squad 21 years ago, I knew he was special, but I could never have imagined he would end up winning 12 Grand Slams. With a couple more years of tennis still left in him, Im sure that by the time he hangs up his boots, Leander would have a few more Slams to his name.

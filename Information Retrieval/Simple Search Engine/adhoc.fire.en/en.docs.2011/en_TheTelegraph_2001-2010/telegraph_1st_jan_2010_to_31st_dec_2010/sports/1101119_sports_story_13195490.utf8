  - All-rounder slams career-best 250 as keeper stays unbeaten on 178       A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla (left) and Wriddhiman Saha, at the Eden, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Wriddhiman Saha together conjured up a cricketing spectacle Thursday that more than erased any memory of the wobbly start that Bengal made on Day I of the Ranji Trophy Super League match against Assam.         
	The Bengal duo fired on all cylinders to close the day at an imposing total of 562 for six wickets. Shukla was the man of the moment having notched up a career-best 250 runs off 371 balls which included 35 boundaries and three sixes. Wicket-keeper Saha was not far behind as he too smashed a career-best unbeaten 178 runs.         
	Together they stitched a record 6th wicket partnership of 417 runs, for Bengal. The hosts were on the attack from the word go and the first one hour was enough to know that they meant business.         
	Shukla and Saha were meticulous in demolishing the backbone of Assams pace bowling in the first half of the day as one by one Abu Nechim Ahmed, Dhiraj Goswami and Ranjit Mali failed to contain the explosive twosome.         
	They made short work of the opponents field set-up and sent them on a leather hunt. The spinners, especially, had no answer to the twin terrors who were unforgiving in their clever and unorthodox shots all over the stadium.         
	Shukla hit Arlen Konwar (one for 174) for three boundaries and two sixes in an over. In the last one hour, both Shukla and Saha slammed boundaries and sixes at a dizzying pace, and it almost seemed never ending. However, the left-arm spin of Sridharan Sriram found success when he castled Shukla.         
	Previously, Shukla was granted life twice, thanks to Assam keeper Kunal Saikia, who was at his butter-finger best. Saha, too, faced a run-out scare when on 99.         
	Shukla, however, had to call a runner in Abhishek Jhunjhunwala when he pulled a muscle. Though that might have slowed the pace of the runs, it was not enough to stop the run-machine.         
	Assams despondency was evident in their use of seven bowlers, but unfortunately none could make any difference.         
	While they face the tough challenge of overcoming Bengals mountain of runs, Assam skipper Amol Muzumdar remains optimistic.         
	It will be a very interesting day tomorrow (Friday). The wicket is very flat. It is as good as it can get So we will have to make the full use of that and score.         
	The onus will be on the experience of Muzumdar and Sriram to carry forth Assams endeavour. Muzumdar however has a different opinion. It will be a team effort. Each and everyone has their responsibility. We all have to put our heads together and work along.         
	Muzumdar applauded the efforts of the heroes of the day: Both Laxmi and Wriddhiman did a commendable job. They exhibited class.         
	At stumps, Assam were 10 without loss, with Dheeraj Jadhav and Shib Shankar Roy at the crease. Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary, however, didnt take the field as he was suffering from high fever. He is expected to be available Friday.

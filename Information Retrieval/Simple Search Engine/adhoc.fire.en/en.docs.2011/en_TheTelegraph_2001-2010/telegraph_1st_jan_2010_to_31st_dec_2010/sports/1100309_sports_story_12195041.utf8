The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brasa talks of host of woes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brasa talks of host of woes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian coach Jose Brasa said poor use of referral system cost his team heavily in the match against South Africa but did not agree to the suggestion that the hosts were victimised.         
	The 3-3 draw against South Africa was definitely not the result that we were looking for, said Brasa. But in the end, I am happy because my team had to encounter too many problems.         
	The coach was more critical about the state of the pitch than the referral system. Before the start of the match, we told the TO (technical officer) that the pitch was too dry and needed watering. He did not listen to us.         
	That was the reason why we missed two penalty corners in the first half, Brasa claimed. The pitch was too bouncy. Finally, the pitch was watered during half time. You could yourself see how smoothly the South Africans took the penalty corners from the same end in second half.         
	Asked whether his team was a victim of poor decisions, Brasa said: No, I wont say that we were victimised or it was done on purpose. But the system is definitely not foolproof. It cost us two points.         
	I was surprised how a referral was called by the umpires for a foul in our D after we went all over to the other side to score a fine goal. And even if we say that Vikram Pillay committed the foul, the ball was not goal-bound at that time. As per the rules, a penalty corner cannot be awarded if the ball is not going towards the goal, argued the coach.         
	The coach was of the view that nothing could be done with such a decision. We dont make the rules. You should ask those who make the rules. What can we do? We have to accept it. After all, we cant go and kill the umpires!         
	To play for the seventh and the eighth position, according to the coach, is an improvement for the home team. Last time in the World Cup, India finished 11th. It wont be a bad thing to end three or four positions higher than the last time.         
	My boys played very well in this World Cup and I am absolutely proud of them. I am not going to agree if you say that we played badly here, said Brasa.

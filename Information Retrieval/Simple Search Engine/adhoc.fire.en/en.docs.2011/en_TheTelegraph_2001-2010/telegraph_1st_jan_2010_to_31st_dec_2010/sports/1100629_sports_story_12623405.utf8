            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Brazil cruised into the quarter finals of the World Cup defeating Chile 3-0 on Monday. Juan, Luis Fabiano and Robinho scored for the five-time champions.         
	Brazil will face the Netherlands in the last-eight stage.         
	Two goals in a span of four minutes put Brazil in a commanding position as they were up 2-0 against their South American rivals at half-time.         
	After initial hesitancy, when the Brazilians found their rivals a hard nut to crack but patiently bided their time, the five-time champions struck in the 35th minute off a flag kick. Maicon, who won a corner on the right, decided to take it himself and swung the ball to the edge of the six-yard box for Juan to jump over the defenders and head home.         
	There were ecstatic celebrations on the Brazil bench, who were getting increasingly worried about not being able to create a clear opening till then. Their joy was doubled in the 38th minute when Luis Fabiano found the net to nearly confirm Brazils berth in the quarter finals.         
	The second Brazilian goal came off a counter move. The Chileans, who were playing an open game, moved ahead in search of the equaliser and found themselves in serious trouble when the ball was snatched away by their rivals. Robinho took the ball forward before playing it across for Kaka, who produced a delightful first time pass for Fabiano.         
	The striker coolly went around goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, before slotting it home.         
	Brazil had another chance a minute before the half time when Maicon sent in a cross from the right and Fabiano flung himself at the ball. It was a superb header but went just over the bar.         
	In the early stages, Brazil had more possession of the ball though they found it tough to make any headway. Gilberto Silva had the best chance when Bravo had to stretch himself fully to stop the long ranger from the midfielder.         
	The ball went to Kaka but the former World Player of the Year shot wide.         
	Kaka was back in the starting XI after sitting out against Portugal in the previous match due to suspension. Ramires took over on the left wing while Robinho made a comeback to pair up with Fabiano in the forwardline.

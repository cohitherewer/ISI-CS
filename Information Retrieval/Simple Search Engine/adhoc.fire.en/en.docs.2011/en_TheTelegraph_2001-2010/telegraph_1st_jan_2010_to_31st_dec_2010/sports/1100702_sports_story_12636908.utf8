The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Midfield is a worry for the Samba Boys
                                                                                                                       7                                      Midfield is a worry for the Samba Boys
                                  Dirk Kuyt (from left), Arjen Robben and Mark van Bommel of the Netherlands during a training session, on Thursday        
	Port Elizabeth: Brazil coach Dunga may have a hard time selecting his midfield for the quarterfinal against the Netherlands at the World Cup on Friday because of injuries and a suspension.         
	Kaka and veteran Gilberto Silva are set to start at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, but a suspension to Ramires and injuries to Elano, Felipe Melo and Julio Baptista leave the coach with few options for the other two midfield positions.         
	Elano is definitely out because of a bruised bone in his right ankle, while Felipe Melo and Julio Baptista are doubtful to make the starting line-up. Felipe Melo practised on Thursday and apparently was not bothered by the left ankle injury sustained against Portugal in Brazils final group match. The injury kept him out of Brazils 3-0 win over Chile in the round of 16 on Monday.         
	Felipe practiced normally. He is in condition to play, Dunga said. But we have to wait until tomorrow (Friday) to see how he feels.         
	Julio Baptista replaced the suspended Kaka in midfield against Portugal and injured his left knee in that match. Baptista missed the match against Chile but trained on Thursday. Elano is the most serious problem for Brazil, however, and he could even miss the rest of the World Cup because of his injury, according to Brazil doctors. He had been key in the Brazilian midfield and will be the biggest loss for Dunga on Friday.         
	Elano is important to the way Brazil plays, he contributes a lot to the team, Dunga said Thursday. The harder the match, the better he plays.         
	The Galatasaray player scored in each of Brazils first two matches before getting injured in a hard tackle against Ivory Coast. I wish I could be playing now, Elano said. I will keep undergoing treatment, and hopefully I will get better to still help the team in this World Cup.         
	Daniel Alves came in for Elano in the previous two matches, and Dunga used Ramires to replace Felipe Melo against Chile. But Ramires received his second yellow card and will miss the encounter against Dutch.         
	It was a shame, Ramires said. I played well and would have been good to stay on the team. But there is nothing I can do. It just happened.         
	Ramires gave the pass for Robinhos goal in the second half against Chile. World Cup veteran Kleberson and Wolfsburg captain Josue are the only defensive midfielders left if Felipe Melo is not in shape. Josue came in when Felipe Melo was injured just before halftime against Portugal. Kleberson played a few minutes after replacing Kaka against Chile.         
	Brazil was without its three regular staring midfielders against Portugal and struggled to break through its opponents defensive setup in a 0-0 draw in Durban.         
	When Kaka was struggling to regain his form following a season hit by a series of injuries with Real Madrid, Dunga even tried to use Robinho in the playmaking position with Nilmar in attack. The players have been downplaying the lack of options, however, saying the team will stay competitive regardless of who is starting.         
	Meanwhile, the man who will be under the bar to stop Brazil, Maarten Stekelenburg stated that he never doubted he would be under the bar even when repeated injuries sidelined him and he was left out of the team by club side Ajax.         
	The Dutch goalkeeping crisis was so acute last year (with Stekelenburg on the bench and two other keepers injured) that coach Bert van Marwijk pleaded with Edwin van der Sar to return from retirement for a couple of World Cup qualifiers.         
	The Manchester United No.1 and most capped Dutch player turned him down and Stekelenburgs path back to Oranje was assured.         
	I was not afraid I would not come back because I know what I can do and I think Ive demonstrated that, Stekelenburg said.           (AGENCIES)

    - Kaymer beats Watson to win his first major           LARRY DORMAN            Martin Kaymer with the trophy on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	Kohler: One contender fell victim to a rules technicality, another was done in by a poor decision. When all the controversy had settled and the chaos emptied into dusk on Sunday, Martin Kaymer kept his wits about him, played the percentages and won the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.         
	Kaymer, 25, of Germany, maintained ice-cool composure to win his maiden major title by winning a three-hole playoff with Bubba Watson. He won with a bogey at the final playoff hole for an aggregate score of par to beat Watson, who double-bogeyed the final hole for an aggregate score of one over.         
	Kaymer, who closed with a two-under-par 70 for a 72-hole total of 11-under 277, and Watson, who closed with a 68, thought they would be joined in a three-way playoff by Dustin Johnson.         
	Johnson seemed to be standing over the potential winning putt at the last hole of regulation. But he missed the putt, and then missed the playoff because he had touched the ground with his 4-iron in a bunker outside the ropes at the 18th hole before hitting his second shot. He was penalised two strokes. He signed for a 73 and finished tied for fifth at 279 with Jason Dufner (71) and the 1995 PGA Championship winner, Steve Elkington (71) of Australia.         
	Zach Johnson (70) and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland finished tied for third, one stroke out of the playoff.         
	Phil Mickelson, winner of the 2005 PGA Championship, fired a best-of-the-day 67 to share 12th place at six under. World No.1 Tiger Woods struggled with his driving to finish tied 28th.         
	The 25-year-old Kaymer, who has won five times on the PGA European Tour, was the third international golfer to win one of the four major championships this year; three international golfers also won majors in 2008. He made it look easy and calm down the stretch  his 12-foot par putt at the 18th hole put him in the playoff  but the meticulous Kaymer was churning inside.         
	To be honest with you, I was very nervous on the last three to four holes of the regular play, said Kaymer, whose lone bogey in regulation came at the 15th hole, when he missed a 7-foot putt. On the playoff holes, I was very calm. It was amazing, really.         
	Amazing and riveting best describe the last 45 minutes of regulation play and the 40 minutes of playoff golf on the 10th, 17th and 18th holes. Watson was the first player to finish at 11 under par, coming out of nowhere with birdies at the 13th and 14th holes and with a 6-foot par-saver at the 18th that ultimately put him in the playoff.         
	For Johnson, all the grinding came to a gut-wrenching close when it was deemed he had grounded his club in one of the nearly 1,000 bunkers that dot the landscape at Whistling Straits.         
	After he had taken the lead with a 15-foot putt at the 17th hole, Johnson smashed his drive at the 18th well right of the fairway, far outside the gallery ropes, up a slope into a sea of spectators.         
	The ball came to rest in a sandy area that looked like a waste area that had been trampled by the fans. As Johnson prepared to play his shot from more than 215 yards away, he clearly grounded his club, unaware he was in a bunker.         
	It never once crossed my mind that I was in a sand trap, said Johnson, who admitted that he did not read the supplementary rules of play distributed before the tournament that spelled out such areas as being bunkers.         
	Meanwhile, Watson and Kaymer were trading birdies and getting ready to settle things on the 18th hole. It is a monstrous 500-yard par 4 with a difficult fairway to hit and high rough in the bailout area to the right, where Watson and Kaymer hit their drives.         
	Watsons ball was in a tangled lie, one he thought would create a flier for his lengthy second shot, some 215 yards from the green. He chose a 6-iron, caught the shot a little heavy, and the ball fell into a creek. Kaymers ball was sitting in a similar lie, and he chose to chip out into the fairway, leaving himself 173 yards away. He hit a 7-iron from there, a lovely, arcing shot that hit 20 feet from the hole and rolled 8 feet closer.         
	Watson hit his drop from the high grass left of the green into the greenside bunker on the other side. He was lying 4, and his only hope of tying was to hole the shot, which he nearly did, clanging it off the flagstick.         
	Kaymer hit his first putt 4 feet past. Watson putted out for a double bogey, and Kaymer wasted no time, allowing no drama to build and no tension to build, as he stepped up and holed out for the victory.

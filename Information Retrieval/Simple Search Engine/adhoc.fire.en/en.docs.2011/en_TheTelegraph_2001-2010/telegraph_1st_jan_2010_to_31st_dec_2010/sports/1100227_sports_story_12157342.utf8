            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	 Calcutta: England womens hopes of winning their first-ever series in India vanished after they lost the fourth ODI in Visakhapatnam by five wickets. The defeat handed the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead with one match left.         
	Batting first England reached 152 for nine, helped by captain Charlotte Edwards patient 57 not out from 112 balls.         
	Having lost Ebony Rainford-Brent and Jenny Gunn, the latter unlucky to be run-out at the non-strikers end after Amita Sharma got a hand on a Caroline Atkins drive, Edwards began rebuilding the innings.         
	She put on 39 with Atkins and 37 with Beth Morgan as England made slow progress on a turning wicket. Danielle Hazell, in her first game of the tour, came in at 111 for six and struck three boundaries to give the innings the much-needed impetus.         
	With England needing quick wickets, Katherine Brunt gave England hope when she trapped Anjum Chopra leg before with just five runs on the board.         
	England will play their last game of the series at the Bandra Kurla Complex on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inexperience let us down, rues Raina
                                                                                                                       7                                      Inexperience let us down, rues Raina
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	A disappointed Suresh Raina admitted at the press conference that the inexperience was his teams undoing during their shock six-wicket defeat against Zimbabwe in the tri-series opener in Bulawayo.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Elton Chigumbura: There was a good partnership between Brendon (Taylor) and Hamilton (Masakadza) which gave us a good start and the foundation for a win. All credit goes to Brendon for his knock. We should also give credit to (Chris) Ervine as well. It was his debut match and he did really well. But he has to make sure that he consistently scores runs. Our plan when we bowled was that the seamers should dismiss a few of their top-order batsmen. Apart from Mpofu, the other pacers didnt bowl that well. But then the spinners came on and did well.         
	Raina: Its unfortunate but we didnt bowl well today (Friday). Some of the bowlers were playing for the first time. Hopefully, they can learn from the mistakes and move one from here. In the first six overs, we didnt bowl well. (Amit) Mishra and (Ravindra) Jadeja then bowled well and we made a comeback. But they had a batting Powerplay left. A couple of their batsmen played really well. It was their batting towards the end that cost us the game. There are lots of areas where we need to improve. We need to work on our bowling and the fielding department to come back against Sri Lanka on Sunday. We should give due credit to the Zimbabwean batsmen. They battled really well. They just hung around and had good partnerships going.         
	Brendan Taylor: Its nice to do well in all departments having also effected three catches. The basic plan while batting was that me and Hamilton should keep knocking around and wait for the Powerplays. We knew that we had a batting Powerplay to accelerate. We decided that we wouldnt hit aerial shots and try and keep it on the ground. The plan worked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Board may not move SC against IPL teams
                                                                                                                       7                                      Board may not move SC against IPL teams
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The IPL-IV player auction would be held as scheduled on January 8-9 amidst indications that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was unlikely to challenge the Bombay High Courts decision to stay the termination of Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab (KXIP).         
	The Boards working committee, which met here on Saturday, resolved that a decision on filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the interim relief granted to the two franchises should be left to president Shashank Manohar.         
	The Board president has been authorised to take a decision on appealing against the Bombay High Court decisions in the Supreme Court. There wont be any postponement of the auction, Ratnakar Shetty, chief administrative officer of the BCCI, told The Telegraph.         
	For the record, the BCCIs appeal was twice turned down in each case by the high court. An appellate judge upheld an arbitrators stay on Royals termination on December 14, while the same judges order in favour of Punjab was sustained by a two-judge division bench the following day.         
	Besides the legal embarrassment and the damage to the IPL brand, the Board would also have to take into account the fact that the Supreme Court goes into winter recess from Monday till New Years Day.

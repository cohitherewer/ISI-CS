The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettel takes pole, Chandhok 24th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettel takes pole, Chandhok 24th
                      
	Manama: Indias Karun Chandhok will make his Formula One debut for Hispania Racing in the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix in the last row, while Force India driver Adrian Sutil will be 10th on the grid here Sunday.         
	At the top, Sebastian Vettel secured Red Bulls first pole position, beating Ferrari teammates Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso.         
	Lewis Hamilton of McLaren-Mercedes finished fourth, while his teammate and last year champion, Jenson Button, finished eighth, one behind seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.         
	Chandhoks timing of 2:04.904 was not good enough for him to qualify for the second qualification and the Indian driver finished at the bottom, at the 24th position.         
	However, it was a brilliant day for Force India as Sutil made it to the third and final qualifying session and his best lap of 1:56.309, put him at the fifth row. His teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi will start 12th having made it to Q2 but failing to qualify for Q3.         
	I think it was a great achievement to go into Q3 at the first race: our best start to the season for a long time, Sutil said. Im the only car on hard tyres so it may be an advantage. Im surprised that the others were on soft tyres. So our decision could pay off, he added.

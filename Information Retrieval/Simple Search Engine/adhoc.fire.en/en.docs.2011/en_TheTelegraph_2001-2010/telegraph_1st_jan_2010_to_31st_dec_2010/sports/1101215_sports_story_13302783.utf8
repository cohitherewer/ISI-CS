The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sepp in a Cup soup! 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sepp in a Cup soup! 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter is at the centre of more controversy after suggesting that homosexual supporters should refrain from any sexual activities during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.         
	Blatter, who was speaking in Johannesburg, on Monday, at the launch of a post-2010 World Cup legacy project, has come in for criticism following a decision by the sports world governing body to take the competition to the Middle East for the first time.         
	Apart from the searing temperatures expected during the finals time of June and July, there could also be other problems with hosting the competition in an Islamic country.         
	Current laws mean drinking alcohol in public is forbidden, while bars and nightclubs are almost non-existent. Another issue could be public affection, and gay groups fear problems in a country where homosexuality is illegal.         
	When asked about such issues, Blatter, apparently joking, said: I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities.         
	He continued on a more serious note, saying: We are definitely living in a world of freedom and Im sure when the World Cup will be in Qatar in 2022, there will be no problems.         
	You see, in the Middle East the opening of this culture, its another culture because its another religion, but in football we have no boundaries.         
	We open everything to everybody and I think there shall not be any discrimination against any human beings, be it on this side or that side, be it left, right or whatever.         
	A leading international gay rights group demanded Tuesday that Fifa make an official apology.         
	Juris Lavrikovs, communications director for the European branch of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said the comments were very unfortunate and have left people deeply offended.         
	I think they should come out with a strong statement and not just wash it away and hide behind it with some wishy-washy comments. We are talking about a very basic human right that is being violated.         
	Qatar beat Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States in the Fifa vote on December 2.         
	Since Fifa made what is widely regarded as a surprise decision, concerns have been raised that a country hosting such a major tournament has stringent laws that are seen by many to violate basic human rights.         
	Also condemning Blatters remarks was John Amaechi, a former NBA player from Britain who revealed in 2007 that he was gay.         
	Meanwhile, the Football Association nominations committee leading the search for a new chairman met Monday to consider a list of potential candidates to succeed Lord Triesman.         
	They have just nine days before recommending a candidate to the main FA board.         
	David Dein, the former Arsenal vice-chairman, is a leading candidate but his interest is thought to be conditional. It remains to be seen if Sir Keith Mills, deputy chairman of London 2012, can be persuaded to step forward.

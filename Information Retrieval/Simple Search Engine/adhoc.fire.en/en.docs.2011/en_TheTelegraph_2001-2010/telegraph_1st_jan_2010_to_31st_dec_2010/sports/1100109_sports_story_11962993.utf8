            JAYDEEP BASU            Stanislas Wawrinka in Chennai on Friday. (PTI)                           
	Chennai: The couple of thousand spectators who waited patiently for three hours to watch some action at the Nungambakkam tennis stadium here Friday should thank Stanislas Wawrinka for keeping the faith.         
	The Swiss star, seeded third at the Chennai Open, gave yet another display of vintage tennis to get the better of Michael Berrer of Germany 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 and advance to the semi-finals.         
	Wawrinka served well and then played some great tennis from the baseline to completely outwit his opponent in the hour and 50 minute encounter.         
	Later in the night, second seed and defending champion Marin Cilic of Croatia outclassed Santiago Giraldo 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 to set up a semi-final clash with fourth seed Serbias Janko Tipsarevic, who continued his good run by beating Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands 7-5, 7-5.         
	Wawrinkas opponent in the penultimate round will be Israels Dudi Sela, the fifth seed, who defeated Lukas Lacko (Slovakia) 7-6 (7-3), 7-5.         
	Earlier, sharp showers delayed the start of the matches by three-and-a-half hours. A spell of rain in the early afternoon followed by a steady drizzle delayed the 5 pm start and put the tournament schedule in total jeopardy.         
	Once the rain stopped, industrial fans, vacuum cleaners, towels and mops, in short, everything was pressed into action to dry out the courts. But because of the high humidity level, it became difficult to make the turf fit for resumption.         
	Although the matches finally resumed at 8.30 pm, there could be trouble in the last two days as well with the weather department predicting more showers for the weekend.         
	In the 14-year history of Indias only ATP tournament, never has a full days play been lost to rain. Last season, the skies opened up during the second-round match between wild card Somdev Dev Varman and sixth-seeded Carlos Moya. The match was played the next afternoon, when the Indian scored a historic 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 win.         
	In the doubles quarter finals, Colin Fleming and Ker Skupski beat the Indian pair of Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna 4-6, 6-3, 10-2.

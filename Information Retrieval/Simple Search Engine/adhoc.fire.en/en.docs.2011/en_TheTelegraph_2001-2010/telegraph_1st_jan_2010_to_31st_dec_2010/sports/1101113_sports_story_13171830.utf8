                                                                                                                       7                                      Worked hard on playing spin: Guptill
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: In cricket, not cashing in on a reprieve is almost criminal. Martin Guptill was lucky enough to get two and he made sure that the Mahendra Singh Dhonis regret their lapses at the end of the day.         
	Speaking at a media conference, in Hyderabad, on Friday, Guptill said when he was caught behind by Dhoni off Sreesanth, he was frustrated with himself I was pretty much in the tunnel, on the way out, when I got called back. I was pretty angry with myself, and was preparing to sit down and ponder what happened. Getting called back gave me a second chance and I carried on from there, said Guptill.         
	Speaking on his 147-run stand with Tim McIntosh, Guptill said: We were just telling each other to keep backing ourselves and be positive.         
	He, however, refused to admit that it was the Black Caps negative approach that resulted in just 258 runs being scored on the day. The wicket is pretty flat, but the Indians bowled in some pretty demanding areas and we tailored our games to counter that.         
	He revealed that he had worked on his technique to enhance his batting against the spinners. Ive worked hard on playing spin over the last year or so, he said. I was just telling myself to be positive. I showed intent and got through it very well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. send home foreign trio
                                                                                                                       7                                        Md. Sp. send home foreign trio
            A STAFF REPORTER            Eduardo                           
	Calcutta: A day after it was known that Mohammedan Sporting wont be renewing the contract of coach Shabbir Ali for the upcoming season, the Calcutta outfit have now decided to discard their three foreign recruits  Brazilian Eduardo, Liberian Theodore Sunday and Samuel Jordan Shore of Australia.         
	But the twist in the tale is that the three players have been sent back from Bangalore where the club are currently fighting it out in the second division I-League. The reason: poor performance and not taking part in practice sessions.         
	According to the club management, not taking part in the training session can be termed as anti-club activity. We had a lot of expectations from them, but they havent delivered. What is the point of continuing with them if they perform so poorly? a club official fumed.         
	He also complained about the lack of interest on the players part to participate in the practice sessions. They are only interested in playing matches and do not take part in practice sessions. That is not right. How can you perform if you dont practice? he questioned.         
	When asked whether the club will be interested in retaining the players for the next season, the official said: Someone like Eduardo had promised us at the beginning of the season that he will help us to qualify for the elite division of the I-League. So far, it has been extremely disappointing. I dont think we will be retaining them for the upcoming season.         
	Mohammedan Sporting are currently placed fourth in the points table and their chances of qualifying are all but over.         
	But Eduardo has a different story to narrate.         
	Im not too sure why they took such a decision. If you ask me, I have performed better for Mohammedan Sporting this season than what I did for JCT in my first year in India. I have scored so many goals and also provided my teammates with assists. So I dont exactly know why these allegations are coming up, the Brazilian said in his defence.         
	He also pointed out a different reason for Sportings failure this season. Look, the side lacks quality Indian players. On most of the occasions, the onus of scoring is either on me or on Theo. So its not right to blame us, he said.         
	He, however, hasnt given up the hope of donning the black and white jersey next season. They (Club officials) havent communicated with me yet. I will meet them tomorrow (Wednesday). I certainly like to play in India. Lets see if they want to extend my contract. Otherwise, I will look for other offers.         
	Meanwhile, the names of Syed Nayeemuddin and Tollygunge Agragami coach Ranjan Chowdhury are doing the rounds for the coachs job at Mohammedan Sporting next season.

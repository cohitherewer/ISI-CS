The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Battle of equals on cards
                                                                                                                       7                                        Battle of equals on cards
    - Hosts set to make three changes; Ajinkya Rahane is fit           A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary with his counterpart from Mumbai, Wasim Jaffer, at the Eden, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: When subplots overwhelm the plot, it is extremely difficult to deduce the inference. Predictions go haywire and incidents overlap to create such filigree that often, the improbable trumps the obvious.         
	Bengals crucial Ranji Trophy Super League tie against Mumbai, which begins Wednesday at the Eden, encapsulates many such miniature wars within the bigger battle. An effort to pinpoint the favourites might thus be an attempt in futility.         
	On the eve of the second match of the season, the exploits of both the teams match each other almost perfectly. While Bengal stole a slender first innings lead in an away tie against Delhi, Mumbai, in a home match, had an easier outing against Saurashtra. With three points in their respective coffers, both the sides are eager to nose ahead in a tough group.         
	But while Mumbai, the 39-time champions, are on a mission to protect their reputation, Bengal, under the leadership of new and young captain and the tutelage of a new coach, are out to etch a mark and earn respect. The finishing line is same, its just that the motives are different.         
	The 22-yard Eden strip, too, threatens to enact an important role as it evoked different and contradictory views from the two sides. For Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary and coach Woorkeri Raman, its the usual Eden strip; Wasim Jaffer and Praveen Amre, Mumbai captain and coach respectively, are grinning at the green tinge that the wicket sports.         
	Talking of Tiwary, one is also reminded of Mumbais Rohit Sharma. The duo, who have played together at different age levels, were once hailed as talented would-be stars. But while Tiwarys twinkle has long faded into the oblivion, Rohit has somehow managed to cling on to his peep-in-peep-out status in Team India. Outshining the other will definitely be on the agenda for both.         
	Tiwary will also want to prove a thing or two to Amre, who had criticised the Bengal batsman in the not so distant past. And, above all, it will be a battle of two former India players  Raman and Amre  and it will be interesting to find out which coach derails the other.         
	An analysis of the Bengal team paints a confusing picture. While the batting looked somewhat solid, in the last match, one cannot vouch for the bowling attacks penetrative power. The fact that barring Ashok Dinda and Ranadeb Bose, the other Bengal bowlers were no better than part-timers, would be a worry for the home team.         
	However, Bengal are likely to bring in three changes in their final. Rohan Banerjee is set to nudge Avisekh Chowdhury out and Writam Porel is likely to make his Ranji debut at the cost of Anustup Majumdar. For the fourth bowlers slot, it will be a toss up between spinner Shib Sagar Singh and young pacer Shami Ahmed.         
	Mumbai, on the other hand, will draw confidence from their captains rich form. Jaffer hit centuries in each innings of the last match, against Saurashtra. Rohit, who hit a 90 in the last tie, would look to complement his captain. And to make matters more complicated for the hosts, the likes of Iqbal Abdulla and Ajit Agarkar are also capable of thrashing the ball, besides delivering them, as they proved in the last match.         
	Mumbais Ajinkya Rahane, who missed the last match with an injury, is fit for inclusion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not too hopeful of Indias chances
                                                                                                                       7                                        Not too hopeful of Indias chances
  - Robson impressed with Sunil Chetri         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Thailand coach Bryan Robson, in New Delhi, on Monday. Picture by Prem Singh                                 
	New Delhi: Bryan Robson, one of the greatest players to don the famous shirts of Manchester United and England, opines that India appear a vastly improved side under Bob Houghton.         
	Known as captain marvel of English football, Robson, famous for his defence splitting passes, superb runs and ability to produce late winners, is currently in the capital as the chief coach of the Thailand national team. On Saturday, Thailand defeated India by a solitary goal in Bangkok but Robson believed India would have to be handled with care when the two teams meet again at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday.         
	I didnt see India play before but I liked the mobility of the players, said the great midfielder. Only thing, the Indian players will have to work more on their fitness.         
	Robson said he was impressed with the skills of Sunil Chetri. That number 11, who has just come back from the US, was creating a few problems for us...only thing he didnt get too much support from others. That was understandable as at that time India were playing with a defensive structure.         
	Despite a marked improvement in Indias performance, the former England captain wasnt too hopeful about Indias chances in the Asia Cup in January next. I can very well understand Indias problems. They are in a real tough group. I know even Bob (Houghton) is upset that India have been drawn with some of the best teams in the continent, said the 53-year-old coach.         
	India, ranked 24th in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) rankings, are clubbed with Australia, South Korea and Bahrain. While the Aussies and Koreans qualified for the 2010 World Cup, Bahrain missed the berth by a whisker after losing to New Zealand in the play-off encounter. There is a huge difference in quality, said the Thai manager. I am sure India are working hard to do their best. I only hope it doesnt backfire in the end, he said.         
	Distractions in modern football on young players did not escape the attention of Robson. Asked whether the youngsters are getting too much money these days, he said it was true to some extent. I know that players like (Wayne) Rooney are getting big money. But, it is the duty of the players to resist temptations, said Robson, once a sight to behold on the field.         
	Rooney and some young stars of football have been embroiled in off-the-field controversies that have come in for criticism in recent times.         
	Talking on the English Premier League (EPL), the Manchester United legend said that more local footballers should be played by all the clubs. Thats the only way to improve the performance of the national team. More and more quality English youngsters should be inducted by the clubs. As far as Manchester United is concerned, I am only working as a brand ambassador. My main job now is the Thailand team...its a big challenge to me, he said.

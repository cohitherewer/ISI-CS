The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes: Our partnership is like magic 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Paes: Our partnership is like magic 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi on Saturday termed their partnership as magic but said that they were happy to be playing with different partners on the ATP Tour.         
	No matter how you write or phrase it, its magic, said Paes after the duo beat Bruno Soares and Marcelo Melo of Brazil in the World Group playoff tie.         
	The best thing that has happened to us is that we have grown to respect what we have achieved together and as individuals. We have made our share of mistakes and, if I can speak for Mahesh, we made our share of mistakes that have happened in the past.         
	Bhupathi said there was no point in debating about what they could have accomplished together. Its easy to sit back and wonder, but we are both in a happy place, he said. He (Leander) has won titles with other players and I have too. Like he said, its magic and probably we would have won 15-20 Slams by now. But we prefer to be in the present.         
	Paes regretted missing out on the bronze at the 2004 Athens Games with Bhupathi.

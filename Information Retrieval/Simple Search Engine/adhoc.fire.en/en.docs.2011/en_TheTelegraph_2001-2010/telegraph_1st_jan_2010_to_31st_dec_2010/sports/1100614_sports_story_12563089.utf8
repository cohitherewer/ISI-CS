The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germans thrash Aussies
                                                                                                                       7                                      Germans thrash Aussies
                      
	Durban: Germany began their World Cup campaign in style hammering a lacklustre Australia in a Group D match here on Sunday.         
	Leading 2-0 at halftime, the Germans pumped two more after Australias Tim Cahill was sent off in the 56th minute after a tackle on Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.         
	Australia had a promising start to the second half and had a penalty claim turned down in the 49th minute at Moses Mabidha Stadium in Durban.         
	Podolski scored with a searing left-footed shot in the eighth minute of the match, after Klose and Mesut Oezil had their drives stopped by Australias defence. Klose rose to head in after 26 minutes for his 11th World Cup goal, tying him on Germanys all-time list in second place with Juergen Klinsmann.         
	Germany coach Joachim Loew went for youth over experience on the right wing, giving 20-year-old Thomas Mueller his third cap ahead of 26-year-old Piotr Trochowski.         
	 He also picked Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber in the starting line-up.         
	Mueller struck in the 68th minute before Cacau added his name to the scoresheet in the 70th minute.         
	Klose, who was top scorer at the 2006 World Cup with five goals having finished second with five at the 2002 tournament, only netted three times for Bayern Munich last season.         
	Australia coach Pim Verbeek left Harry Kewell on the bench and gave Richard Garcia, who usually plays as an attacking midfielder, his eighth cap as the lone striker ahead of Josh Kennedy. Garcia has never scored for Australia.         
	Verbeek made several surprise selections as he chose defensive midfielder Carl Valeri starts instead of Mark Bresciano.           (AGENCIES)

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai, on Friday                           
	Mumbai: Anil Kumble has often mentioned how lucky he has been not having had to bowl to Sachin Tendulkar. On Saturday, Indias leading wicket-taker in Tests will face his moment of reckoning when he leads the Royal Challengers Bangalore against Tendulkars Mumbai Indians.         
	Tendulkar has been in a rich vein of form of late and his savage attack on the Delhi DareDevils bowling the other night was proof that winning matters more to him than the format.         
	Not that Kotlas knock would have gone unnoticed by Kumble. The truth is that the colossus from Karnataka has been making the ball talk too, as he demonstrated in Bangalores thrashing of Rajasthan Royals on Thursday.         
	Hopefully I dont have to bowl to Sachin. By the time I come on, hopefully our fast bowlers would have done the job, but I am looking forward to it. Its a great challenge to bowl to the Master, Kumble said after the teams practice under the lights.         
	It is bound to be a treat for fans and critics alike when the two go up against each other. Pity then that it would last only four overs at the best!         
	Tendulkar, however, is unlikely to be disturbed by such distractions. His net session on the eve of the match at the Brabourne stadium once again showed that the maestro does not leave any stone unturned when it comes to preparation.         
	The first thing Tendulkar did upon arriving at the venue was to get away from his teammates and take guard against the bowling machine, operated by coach Robin Singh.         
	No marks for guessing what happened there: the sessions focus was deliveries zeroing in on the front foot and some half-pitched stuff. The volleys were greeted with plucky drives and the bouncers with horizontal bats that sent the leather into the second and third tiers in the stands.         
	After Dale Steyns success in the recent Test series, Tendulkar must be keen to settle some scores. Has there ever been a bowler, in whatever level of the game, who has lorded over the lord of batting and gone unpunished? The South African better watch out.         
	Mumbais batting gained depth with the joining of all-rounders Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard from the West Indies. And, with Sri Lanka pacer Dilhara Fernando fit again, they would have more options in the bowling, which already packs a punch with Zaheer Khan and Lasith Malinga handling the new ball.         
	Neither are the Bangaloreans without any firepower. Jacques Kallis is yet to be dismissed in the tournament and is the highest run-getter at the moment with 198 runs from three visits to the crease.         
	So, if the hosts would take confidence from the two 200-plus totals they have successfully defended, the visitors would feel equally encouraged after overhauling the Kings XI Punjabs 203 and then bowling out the Royals for a paltry 92.         
	But Bangalores bowling, despite Praveen Kumars hattrick and Kumbles triple strike Thursday, has been a bit inconsistent. That might prove to be the difference between victory and defeat in the end.         
	Match starts: 8 pm.

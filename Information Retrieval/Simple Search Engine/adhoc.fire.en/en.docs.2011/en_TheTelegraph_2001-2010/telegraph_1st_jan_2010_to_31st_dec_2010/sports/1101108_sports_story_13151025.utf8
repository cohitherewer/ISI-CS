The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India begin with defeat
                                                                                                                       7                                      India begin with defeat
                      
	Guangzhou: India put up a valiant fight before going down 0-2 against Kuwait to start their Asian Games football campaign on a disappointing note, here, Sunday.         
	Sukhwinder Singhs boys were on equal terms against their stronger rivals for most part of the match. They paid the price of conceding an early goal and letting in another via a defensive lapse in the injury time.         
	Striker Khaled Al Azemi scored both the goals  in the sixth and 91st minutes  for Kuwait at the Huadu Stadium.         
	India will now have to beat either defending champions Qatar on Tuesday or Singapore on Thursday to have any chance of remaining in contention for a berth in the knockout round. The top two teams from each of four groups and the four best third-placed teams will qualify for the Round of 16.         
	India were on the back foot as early as the sixth minute with Al Azemi finding the target as the Indians were trying to settle into the match. Al Azemi found the target from an opportunistic shot after his teammates free kick from outside the box deflected from an Indian defender.         
	The India under-23 side did not allow their rivals to dictate terms after the first goal. They matched their rivals in ball possession and missed a few chances to score. In the whole match, India had five shots at the goal as against six by their opponents. The Indians had five corner kicks as compared to one got by Kuwait.         
	India dominated the second half but wasted at least three chances to equalise. They conceded the second goal in the first of the three-minute injury time. A miss pass from an Indian defender helped Al Azemi. Getting the ball, Al Azemi slotted it home and D. Ravanans desperate attempt to clear it was unsuccessful.         
	Despite the loss, Sukhwinder was happy with the teams performance and said India still have the chance of making it to the knockout round. It was an evenly contested match. Kuwait converted two from the three chances they got. So overall, I am happy with the performance of the boys, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena may not play before April
                                                                                                                       7                                        Serena may not play before April
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Serena Williams                           
	Serena Williams has announced she is unlikely to play again until April as the mystery surrounding her foot injury deepens. In July, this year, the former world No. 1 cut her foot on some broken glass in a Munich restaurant and has since undergone two rounds of surgery in a bid to get herself back on court.         
	But this news is the latest blow to Williams recovery and comes just weeks after she announced her withdrawal from defending her title at the Australian Open.         
	Amid fears the injury could be a cover for a more serious problem, when asked about her progress, Williams said: I hope to be out of the cast and back on court by the spring.         
	I looked at my foot and knew it shouldnt be like that. The big toe was drooping and it was obvious something wasnt right.         
	I had a scan and the doctors decided I shouldnt play. Pushing myself back into intensive training only caused further injury and damage.         
	While I desperately want to get back, it is imperative for my health that I continue to work with my doctors to ensure my foot heals properly.         
	An April return would put Williams chances of appearing at the French Open in doubt but would allow her plenty of time to get back into the swing of things for Wimbledon.         
	The 29-year-old is no stranger to the challenge of coming back from injury having missed three months of last season with after hurting her knee.         
	Meanwhile, Venus Williams is currently undergoing rehabilitation on a knee injury with a view to returning next year.         
	Speaking about her recovery, she said: I have been getting therapy and making progress but must continue to keep the weight off my knee.         
	There is nothing I can do about not playing any more in 2010 so I want to make sure I can look forward to the New Year.         
	Serena and I are okay. We dont need people feeling sorry for us. Im working to ensure I heal properly.

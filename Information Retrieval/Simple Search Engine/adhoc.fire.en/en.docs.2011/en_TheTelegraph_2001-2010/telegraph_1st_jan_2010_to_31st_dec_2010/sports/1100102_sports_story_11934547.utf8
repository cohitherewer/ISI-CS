            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jamshedpur is in line to get a one-dayer during South Africas forthcoming tour of India, in February. But there is a rider: The Keenan has to be made available to the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA).         
	The Keenan, owned by Tata Steel, was synonymous with cricket in undivided Bihar and has been the focal point of the game in Jharkhand.         
	The JSCA hasnt hosted an one-dayer for years and the Amitabh Choudhary-led association is making every effort to make sure that the Keenan is made available.         
	The tours and fixtures committee of the BCCI is to meet in a couple of days to decide on the venues for the two Tests and three ODIs against the Proteas.         
	For the cricket lovers of the region and the Steel City to see international cricket, the Keenan Stadium has to be made available to the JSCA on favourable terms .         
	It will also be an opportunity for the fans to watch Jharkhand icon and Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in action on his home turf.         
	In the past, all the 21 affiliates of the JSCA together have written to the then Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, requesting him to make the Keenan available for the development of the game in the state.         
	In the letter, the association had offered to upgrade Keenan to a modern international cricket complex. It referred to Tata Steels refusal to grant permission to conduct combined trials for Jharkhand and Bihar in April 2007 and May 2008 at the stadium, besides the disinclination in giving the go ahead for selections for the MRF Pace Foundation and local and national tournaments.         
	Meanwhile, it is learnt that senior BCCI officials are in touch with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya and have enquired about the simmering tension between the association and the police.         
	It remains to be seen if the Eden gets to host one of the two Test matches during South Africas tour.

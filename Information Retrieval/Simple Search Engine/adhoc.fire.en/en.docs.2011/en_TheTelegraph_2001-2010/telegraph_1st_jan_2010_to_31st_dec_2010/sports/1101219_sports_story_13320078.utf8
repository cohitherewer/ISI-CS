  - The problem is serious and it cannot be ignored, says Gopal Bose       OUR BUREAU                                        
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) affected quite a few changes in the set-up of the Bengal team in the build-up to the 2010-11 season. They changed the coach, bringing in WV Raman, and they also appointed a new captain  Manoj Tiwary.         
	However, the changes have failed to change Bengals fortunes. On Saturday, Bengal slumped to an innings and 10 runs loss against Railways, and in the process, failed to qualify for the quarter finals, yet again.         
	Dissecting the teams poor show this season, former Bengal captains were unanimous in saying that the problem is serious and that it needed immediate attention. Heres what Bengals former captains had to say:         
	On what ails Bengal cricket         
	Gopal Bose: Its very difficult to pinpoint what the problem with Bengal cricket is But one thing is certain, that the problem is serious and it cannot be ignored. With the players getting all modern facilities, its important to find out why they are not being able to produce the desired results.         
	Sambaran Banerjee: We lacked in quite a few areas and that led to the failure. First of all, it was the opening slot that didnt click properly. Secondly, we had a problem with the No. 3 batsman. We did try a couple of players but they werent much successful. Lack of a second spinner, besides Saurashish Lahiri, also hurt our chances.         
	Ashok Malhotra: I think Bengals problem lies in the bowling department. Among the pacers, we have been dependent on Ranadeb Bose for too long. And we dont have a quality spinner either.         
	Utpal Chatterjee: Application has been a major issue. Too much of chopping and changing also hasnt helped          
	Deep Dasgupta: There can be number of problems and it is difficult to pick any one If we are not performing in the desired way then everything is obviously not right.         
	On the way forward         
	Bose: If there is a problem, there is bound to be a solution. The concerned people should sit together and find a way out. We have a cricket development committee that comprises the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Arunlal The authorities should seek their advice on what needs to be done.         
	Banerjee: Theres no point lamenting on the have nots, we need to sit analyse what needs to be done to lift our game.         
	Malhotra: We have to unearth new bowlers We have to spot talent and they should be trained from an early age. We need good, young fast bowlers. Also, the CAB has taken a positive step by doing away with draws in local ties.         
	Chatterjee: Better planning is needed from the start of the season. We knew we had a tough group this time, but there was hardly much preparations. We had no practice match at the Eden That meant we had no idea of the wicket for the two home ties         
	Dasgupta: Whatever needs to be done should involve a proper thought process. We shouldnt gun for a temporary solution

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Three dope-tainted wrestlers, Rajiv Tomar, Mausam Khatri and Gursharanpreet Kaur, have been included in the Indian team for the Asian Games, Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) sources said on Saturday.         
	The trio was originally selected for the Indian Commonwealth Games (CWG) squad, but was later dropped for testing positive for banned substance Methylhexanamine. Their provisional suspension was lifted a few weeks later, but the WFI, at that time, refused to take them back into the team.         
	All the three, along with nine other athletes are supposed to once again appear before the hearing panel next week.         
	WFI sources, however, claimed the three grapplers have returned to the squad on the basis of their performance in the trials held here on Friday.         
	Interestingly, at least three CWG gold medal-winning wrestlers will not be in the team for the Asian Games. While Sushil Kumar (66kg) has pulled out because of an injury, two other women wrestlers (who won gold)  Alka Tomar and Anita  have failed to qualify in the trials.         
	The two star wrestlers, sources said, were beaten by Suman Kundu for the lone spot in the 63kg category. Kundu was a bronze winner in the Commonwealth Games.         
	Unlike the CWG, which had seven categories in womens wrestling, the competition in the Asian Games will be in four weight categories. Nirmala Devi (48kg), Geeta (55kg) and Gursharanpreet Kaur (72kg) are the other wrestlers likely to be selected.         
	In the freestyle section, Mausam Khatri and Rajiv Tomar have made the team in the 96kg and 120kg category.

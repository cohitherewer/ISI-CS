The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cameroon ousted   by Danes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cameroon ousted   by Danes
                            
	Pretoria: Dennis Rommedahl scored one goal and created another to give Denmark a 2-1 win over Cameroon, eliminating the African team from the World Cup and sending the Netherlands to the round of 16, in a pulsating Group E match on Saturday.         
	The 31-year-old winger gave his team the lead in the 61st minute, going past Jean Makoun and curling a left-footed shot past goalkeeper Hamidou Souleymanou. Rommedahl had assisted on the equaliser after Samuel Eto had fired Cameroon ahead in the 10th minute following a mix-up in the Danish defence.         
	Nicklas Bendtner restored parity in the 33rd after receiving a square ball from Rommedahl following a long diagonal pass from Simon Kjaer. Jon-Dahl Tomasson had a clear chance in the 71st minute to extend Denmarks lead.         
	Big name Cameroon players like Geremi and Alexandre Song took the field against Denmark on Saturday. It was just as coach Paul le Guen had said on Friday after the Frenchman bowed to the demands of his senior players to change his starting line-up. But he warned he would not take all the flak for any failures as his team needed to accept their own shortcomings.         
	Cameroons World Cup had appeared in disarray in recent days after players openly questioned Le Guens selection for their opening match which they lost 1-0 to Japan, the supposed weakest team in the group.         
	Midfielder Achille Emana said earlier this week the players had called on the coach to review the line-up because younger players, who had been brought in at the expense of more experienced ones, were being asked to do too much.         
	Le Guen left seasoned campaigners such as midfielder Alexandre Song and defenders Rigobert Song and Geremi on the bench and dropped goalkeeper Carlos Kameni after seven years in the role.         
	Captain Eto was also quieter than normal after playing in a deeper role, prompting the players to urge Le Guen to rethink his plans for Saturdays match.           (AGENCIES)

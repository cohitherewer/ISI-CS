            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The scoreline for Saturdays CFL Premier division tie between East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting should ideally read 2-2, and not 0-0. But thats not for the number of goals.         
	The highlight of what happened at the Salt Lake Stadium pitch was less football and more of kick- boxing as East Bengals Alvito DCunha and Uga Okpara, and Mohammedan Sportings Eduardo and Dipankar Roy were given the marching orders by referee Biplab Poddar.         
	The scoreline then, for their on-field action, stood at 2-2!         
	Ask Alvito, the man who showed exemplary fitness in unleashing himself on Brazilian Eduardo, about it and he would say: He (Eduardo) had no business spitting on Okpara. Its team game and Im a team man Thats when I reacted. He did a similar thing to me two years back in the Federation Cup.         
	He further added: He used abusive words, in Portuguese, which was too much for me to bear. Im sorry for what I have done but he started it all.         
	Whats strange is that this man was friendly to me three days back and I had even dropped him to his house. He, in fact, was complaining about Chirag Uniteds Edmilson for losing temper on pitch!         
	Phillippe de Ridder, the red and gold brigades Belgian coach, said: I have been saying this for quite some time that the referees should immediately come out with a red card for any unruly behaviour. Why didnt the referee at once show the player a red after he spat at anothers face? All these could have been avoided then.         
	This is not football. Why do we need to use our hand and mouth in football? Thats not the way the game is played. Im sad for certain individuals because its not about the whole team, only a few individuals, was De Ridders point.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali, too, questioned the referees role. Whatever has happened today is bad. But Ill blame the referee for the whole episode He shouldnt be there if he cant control the game.         
	I never tolerate indiscipline and will surely decide on my action against Eduardos behaviour today, said Shabbir.         
	Eduardo, the fulcrum of the chaos, left before the completion of the match and was unavailable for comment.         
	Indian soccer is generous enough to agree to all these point of views.         
	For the optimists, lets just say that the players were just doing their bit to spice up an otherwise dull afternoon.         
	Now, if you dont agree to that, its your problem. But we like to call it soccer!

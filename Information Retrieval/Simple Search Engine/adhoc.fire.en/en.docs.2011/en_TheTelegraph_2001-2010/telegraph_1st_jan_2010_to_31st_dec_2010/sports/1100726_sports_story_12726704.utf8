                                                                                                                       7                                      Ryder Cup captain to sound out Woods
                                Tiger Woods      
	Carnoustie (Scotland): American Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin will talk to Tiger Woods at next months US PGA Championship to learn whether he wants to be in his team at Celtic Manor in Wales in October.         
	Woods lies seventh in the points table that will provide eight automatic members for the United States against Europe.         
	However, he could drop down the table and need a wild card if the likes of Ricky Barnes and Hunter Mahan outperform him at the Bridgestone Invitational and the US PGA in August.         
	Pavin, playing this weekend in the British Senior Open at Carnoustie, does not know whether Woods would then accept a captains wild card into the Ryder Cup.         
	I have not spoken to Tiger yet about the Ryder Cup, Pavin said on Saturday.         
	But I do plan to talk to him about it during the PGA Championship.         
	All I know is what Tiger said at the Masters  I dont think he has said anything to change that position.         
	At the Masters, when asked about the Ryder Cup, Woods simply said: Would I like to play in it? If I qualify.         
	Pavin has made it clear he wants Woods in the team.         
	Thats for sure, theres no doubt about it. Hes the best player in the world.         
	Hes the No. 1 player in the world and hes going to make Team USA better if hes on it.           (AGENCIES)

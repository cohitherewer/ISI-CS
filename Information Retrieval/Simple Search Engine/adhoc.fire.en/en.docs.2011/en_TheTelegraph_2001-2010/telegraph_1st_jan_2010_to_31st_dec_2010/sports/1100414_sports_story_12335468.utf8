	Jaipur: A no holds barred battle is on the cards when the Rajasthan Royals lock horns with the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Wednesday, where at stake, potentially, is a place in the semi-finals of the Indian Premier Leagues third edition.         
	Two of modern crickets greatest spinners will be leading their teams into a battle of guts and gumption which would be as much a contest between Anil Kumbles understated leadership and the flamboyant Shane Warnes gamesmanship.         
	Only the Mumbai Indians are assured of a semi-final berth. Both Royal Challengers and Royals have won half of their 12 matches with Kumbles side ranked higher on the basis of superior net run-rate.         
	Incidentally, both teams are smarting from defeats in their previous matches and the challenge is as much to regroup as to perform well on Wednesday.         
	The resurgent Royals lost to the Mumbai Indians by 37 runs, a defeat that exposed a number of chinks in their armour. The Royal Challengers, in contrast, were pipped by the Deccan Chargers in their previous outing, a setback that has jeopardised their passage to the semi-finals.

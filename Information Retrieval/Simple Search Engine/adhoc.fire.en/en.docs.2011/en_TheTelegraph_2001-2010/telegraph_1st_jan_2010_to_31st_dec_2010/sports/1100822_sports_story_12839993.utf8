            UR CORRESPONDENT            Yuki Bhambri                                 
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambris dream came crashing down on Saturday as he was forced to concede the singles final due to cramps at the Youth Olympics in Singapore.         
	Bhambri was trailing 7-6 (4), 6-7 (4), 1-4 against unseeded Colombian Juan Sebastian Gomez when he retired at the Kallang Tennis Centre.         
	I am really upset I couldnt win the gold but happy at least I got the silver, a dejected Bhambri told The Telegraph from Singapore.         
	The 18-year-old from Delhi, who was out of action with an ankle injury three months ago, said the cramps, in his left leg, was not a cause for concern.         
	Its been really hot and humid out here. I wont be able to run for a day, but otherwise its not a worry, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Missed Zaheer:Dravid
                                                                                                                       7                                      Missed Zaheer: Dravid
                      
	Centurion: Admitting that India failed to make early inroads unlike their Proteas counterparts with the ball, Indian batting mainstay Rahul Dravid said the visitors missed the services of Zaheer Khan badly.         
	To be honest we are far too behind in this match, Dravid said after South Africa piled up 366 for two in reply to Indias 136 in the first innings on Friday.         
	Our bowlers tried their best but the conditions had changed. The wicket was playing differently and South African batters played well. But yes we could have bowled better. We were lacking in experience.         
	We missed Zaheer (Khan). He is leader of the bowling group and if he was there the bowlers could have bowled better, he added.         
	Dravid, however, said India is not yet out of the contest as there is enough cricket left in the match.         
	Theres lot of cricket to be played in this Test and in this series. We have to believe in our ability. We have to keep looking up. We have to bowl better on the third day and, most importantly, we have to bat really well in the second innings, he said.         
	The batsman said India are slow starters in any away series and they need to make improvement on that front.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My best innings   in IPL: Mahela
                                                                                                                       7                                      My best innings   in IPL: Mahela
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Mahela Jayawardene said that his unbeaten 110 off 59 balls, against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, was his best innings in the Indian Premier League. The Man of the Match, at the press conference, also said that the victory against the Knights at the Eden showed that there was unity in the team.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	If this was his best knock in the IPL         
	Definitely the best knock in the IPL I had a couple of half-centuries but when you get a hundred, that too for a winning cause, its always special. There is no point getting big scores when you end up losing. We fought hard, showed a lot of character today (Sunday). I am quite happy with it.         
	His promotion up the order after Shaun Marshs injury         
	There were a lot of things written about our side and the only way we could show unity in the team was by playing good cricket and we did that. Its really unfortunate for (Sahun) Marsh as he pulled up a muscle during the warm-up. I was asked to play after the warm-up and I suggested to Tom (Moody) that I was ready to open the innings... I was quite happy to do that. I thought if I go up there and spend a bit more time, I could get back to rhythm and get a good knock.         
	The mood in the camp when chasing 201         
	In situations like these everyone has to get something out of their hat. We lost a couple of games very closely in this tournament... It was crucial for us to get going. We have made a few mistakes in the last few games that cost us matches. But today we managed to finish the game off on a high and are quite happy         
	If the nothing to lose situation made it a bit easy         
	I dont think we had nothing to lose. In fact, we had everything to lose... We, as cricketers play for pride. We were very disappointed with our performances and we take responsibility for that. Everyone had a lot to lose coming into this game... We play with this kind of attitude everyday We hate losing matches. As long as we have this kind of an attitude and give everything we have, well be very happy.         
	Whether T20 is about power hitting or also has room for the classical batsman         
	I was hitting some big sixes too... Chris (Gayle) obviously is something special. You need different calibre to come to the party at different times. Up the order, Sachin (Tendulkar), Jacques (Kallis) and few others have played good innings in tough situations, while there are some others who approach the wrong way. You need everybody Cricket is something that keeps evolving. You need to keep challenging yourselves as cricketers. Any messages from co-owner Preity Zinta         
	Im not sure There are quite a few messages in my inbox but havent yet got the time to check It was crucial for us to get a good start and see through the first six overs. We had quite a few boundaries without taking any risk. It was very important for us to build partnerships. After (Kumar) Sangakkara came, he took the pressure off me completely and that helped me to settle down. I just had to bat through... I got into different roles at different times and when Yuvi came on, I just had to be there at the other end. I knew that he would hit a few ones as he was getting back to his form.

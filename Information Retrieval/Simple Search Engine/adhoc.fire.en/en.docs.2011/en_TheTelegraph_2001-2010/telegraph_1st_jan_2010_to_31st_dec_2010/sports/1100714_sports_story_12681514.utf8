	Colombo: A blunt Indian bowling attack stood exposed as Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI scored a mammoth 432 for five on the opening day of the three-day warm-up game, here, Tuesday.         
	The Sri Lankan top order crushed the Indian attack disdainfully as opener Upul Tharanga (116), Thilina Kandamby (101) and Thilan Samaraweera (102) smashed quick-fire centuries to have the No. 1 Test side on the mat.         
	Dinesh Chandimal (5) and Kaushal Silva (6) were at the crease for Sri Lanka when stumps were drawn for the day at the Colts Cricket Club Ground.         
	The hosts scored at a furious pace, with a run-rate close to five, as more than half of the runs came through boundaries.         
	India badly missed the injured pace duo of Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth as none of the six bowlers used by skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni could bowl economically, let alone trouble the rival batsmen.         
	Spin spearhead Harbhajan Singhs absence from the line-up due to viral fever just compounded the problems for India as the other tweakers failed to make an impression.         
	Although Pragyan Ojha (3/133) and Amit Mishra (2/120) shared five wickets between them, together they gave away 253 runs in 50 overs they bowled.         
	Pacers Ishant Sharma and Abhimanyu Mithun went wicket-less and it was not before the 35th over of the innings that India got their first success.         
	Ojha dismissed left-handed Tharanga but by that time he had raised a solid opening partnership of 188 runs with Lahiru Thirimanne (66) as Sri Lanka made a bright start after winning the toss.         
	Ojha struck for the second time after four overs when he scalped Thirimanne, but there was hardly a moment to rejoice after that for the Indians.         
	The next two batsmen, Kandamby and Samaraweera, frustrated the Indian bowlers by raising a huge 180-run stand for the third wicket.         
	By tea, Kandamby had reached 57 off 59, and Samaraweera, who took the major share of the strike, was on 47 off 90.         
	After the break, both the batsmen went on a further aggressive mode.         
	However, Kandamby, like Tharanga, didnt capitalise on his century.         
	With the spinners bowling a leg-stump line, Samaraweera slowed down in the later part of his innings.         
	India struck thrice towards the end with Mishra removing Kandamby and Ojha sending back Samaraweera. But by that time Sri Lanka had completely overwhelmed the hapless Indians.         
	That only four maidens were bowled all day, and 22 no-balls, 57 fours and 6 sixes were conceded, summed up Indias not-too-impressive start of the tour.         
	None of the three centurions dismissals were set up as all three got out playing adventurous shots.           (AGENCIES)

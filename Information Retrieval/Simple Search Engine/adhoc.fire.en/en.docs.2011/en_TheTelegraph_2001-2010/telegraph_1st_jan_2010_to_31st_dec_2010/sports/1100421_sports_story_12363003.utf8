                                                                                                                       7                                      Can cause upset: Puel
                      
	Munich: Olympique Lyon have the class to upset Bayern Munich in their Champions League semi-final and keep their fine run going, feels coach Claude Puel said. Lyon, who have reached the last four of the tournament for the first time, knocked out Real Madrid in the first knockout stage. They face Bayern in Munich in the first leg on Wednesday.         
	It is fantastic for our club to be in the semi-finals, the soft-spoken Puel told reporters on Tuesday.But we told this before the quarter-final against Bordeaux that why should it end here? Our run should not end here.         
	Bayern are confident, they had a huge win on the weekend (7-0 against Hanover 96), they are playing well but I still think we have what it takes to trouble them tomorrow. (Reuters)

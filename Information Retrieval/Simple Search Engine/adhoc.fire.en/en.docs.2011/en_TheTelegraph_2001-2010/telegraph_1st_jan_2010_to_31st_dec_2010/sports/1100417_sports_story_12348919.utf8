	Dharamshala: Rohit Sharmas breezy unbeaten 68 overshadowed Mahela Jayawardenes sparkling knock as defending champions Deccan Chargers pipped Kings XI Punjab by five wickets to keep alive their semi-final hopes in the Indian Premier League here Friday.         
	Chasing 175, the Chargers fumbled and faltered, but Rohit stayed till the end to guide the side to 178 for five in 19.1 overs.         
	Rohits eighth IPL fifty was the cornerstone of Deccan Chargers win as the defending champions recorded their seventh victory in 13 matches to jump to the fourth place in the points table.         
	Rohits unbeaten 38-ball knock included six fours and three sixes.         
	Earlier, Jayawardene (93 not out) starred in two identical 86-run stands with skipper Kumar Sangakkara (52 of 37 balls) and Yuvraj Singh (20) to power Kings XI Punjab to 174 for three.         
	Deccan began the tricky chase on an unconvincing note, losing skipper Adam Gilchrist (9) in the second over sent down by Irfan Pathan when Juan Theron took a skier at extra cover.         
	T. Suman (43 of 31 balls) then added 41 runs for the second wicket with Monish Mishra (20) and another 66 with Rohit to steady the innings as Deccan put their chase back on track.         
	Aware of the task at hand, Rohit began rather gingerly, playing balls according to merit. Suman, on the other hand, kept clearing the ropes, hitting Theron, Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh for massive sixes before Piyush Chawla got the better of him in the 14th over.

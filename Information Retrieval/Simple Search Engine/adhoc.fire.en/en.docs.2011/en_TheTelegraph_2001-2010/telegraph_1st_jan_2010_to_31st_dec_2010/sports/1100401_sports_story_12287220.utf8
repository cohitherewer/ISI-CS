The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No bet too wild when its Tiger
                                                                                                                       7                                      No bet too wild when its Tiger
                      
	London: Forget about only winning the Masters, British bookmakers are taking bets on whether Tiger Woods will hit a tree on his first drive or if hell kiss an anonymous blonde before teeing off.         
	Woods, who will make his return to golf next week at Augusta National after months of seclusion following revelations that he cheated on his wife, is shaping up to be a big market for bettors in Britain.         
	Well absolutely certainly take a couple of million (pounds) on it ourselves, William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said. So far, people are sensibly reluctant to part with their cash until two or three days beforehand ... because once you place your bet you cant cancel it.         
	Both William Hill and Ladbrokes have Woods listed as the 4-1 favourite to win, even though he has not competed since driving into a tree outside his home in late November. The 34-year-old Woods has won the Masters title four times and has 14 majors overall. This years tournament starts on April 8.         
	Phil Mickelson is the second favourite behind Woods at 9-1, and Ernie Els is third at 10-1, according to William Hill. But besides the usual bets about making the cut or finishing outside the top 10, markets are open on whether he will hit the fairway on his opening drive, miss the fairway, or even hit a tree.         
	Weve got a whole host (of markets), the funnies around to the serious, Ladbrokes spokesman Nick Weinberg said. Obviously, (weve) priced him up to win the major, to miss the cut, to have a fight with a fan on the first tee, to kiss an anonymous blonde  which doesnt include (John) Daly, we point out.         
	William Hill is already offering 26 markets on Woods, and Hill said they expect to open 10 more.         
	Things like: Will he have an argument? Will he throw a club? Will he break a club in anger? Will there be a streaker on the final green? Will Elin (Nordegren) be seen in the crowd? Adams said.           (AGENCIES)

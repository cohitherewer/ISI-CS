The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vinay Kumar and Aravind   restrict Punjab
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vinay Kumar and Aravind   restrict Punjab
                            
	Mohali: Pacers R. Vinay Kumar and Sreenath Aravind helped Karnataka bundle out Punjab for a mere 243 on the opening day of the Super League Group B Ranji Trophy match, at the PCA stadium.         
	Despite Punjabs Uday Kaul scoring a brilliant 94, Vinay Kumar (five for 61) and Aravind (four for 63) dominated the days proceedings to push the hosts to the backfoot.         
	Put into bat, the Punjab top-order completely failed to counter Vinay Kumars deadly spell. And although Kaul and Yuvraj Singh (39) tried to consolidate the innings, the partnership didnt last long.         
	Punjab received an early jolt, losing opener Ravi Inder Singh (0) in the very first over when he got bowled by Vinay Kumar. Other opener Sarul Kanwar (26), too, fell to Vinay Kumar.         
	Yuvraj and Kaul steadied the innings and it looked like the two left-handers would steer the team out of trouble.         
	But the 84-run partnership between the two came to an end when Yuvraj, who made 39 off 98 balls, edged one to wicket-keeper M. Gautam.

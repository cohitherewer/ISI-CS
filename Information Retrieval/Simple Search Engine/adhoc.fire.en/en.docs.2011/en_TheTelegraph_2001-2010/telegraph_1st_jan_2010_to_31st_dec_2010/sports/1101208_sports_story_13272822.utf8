The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB face the Dempo test, once again
                                                                                                                       7                                      EB face the Dempo test, once again
                      
	Margao: Defending champions Dempo would look to repeat their good performance against East Bengal, when they take on the Calcutta club, in the second round of the I-League, here, Wednesday.         
	In a one-off Super Cup match last week, Dempo had thrashed the red and gold brigade 3-1.         
	In the I-League, neither team have managed a start they would have wanted. While East Bengal managed to scrap past debutant team ONGC by a solitary goal through their Australian striker Tolgay Ozebe, Dempo had to split points with Churchill Brothers.         
	In spite of not having their regular players (six are at the national training camp in Dubai while a couple of them are on the injury list), Dempo managed to put up a good show against Trevor Morgans team to win the Super Cup.         
	Coach Armando Colaco is hoping that the team is able to repeat the performance on Wednesday to collect full points.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United, Bolton split points; Stoke win
                                                                                                                       7                                        United, Bolton split points; Stoke win
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Michael Owen                           
	London: Michael Owen scored the 200th goal of his club career to rescue Manchester United from defeat against Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. Owen, a 70th minute replacement for Darren Fletcher, scored with a clinical header after Martin Petrovs strike had appeared to set Bolton on course for victory.         
	Despite maintaining their unbeaten start to the season, United struggled to impress in the 2-2 draw and Wayne Rooney endured another miserable afternoon before being substituted on the 61st minute.         
	United had been given a tremendous incentive to claim all three points at the Reebok with title rivals Chelsea and Arsenal both losing 24 hours earlier.         
	But if Alex Fergusons players arrived at the Reebok expecting victory to be a formality, they would have been shaken out of their complacency by Zat Knights sixth minute opener.         
	Not only did the goal give Bolton the lead, it once again highlighted Uniteds current defensive frailties.         
	In other matches, Aston Villa moved into fifth spot when Emile Heskeys late header earned them a 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers in Gerard Houlliers first league match in charge of the midlands club, while Stoke City won 2-1 at Newcastle United to move out of the bottom three after trailing at halftime.

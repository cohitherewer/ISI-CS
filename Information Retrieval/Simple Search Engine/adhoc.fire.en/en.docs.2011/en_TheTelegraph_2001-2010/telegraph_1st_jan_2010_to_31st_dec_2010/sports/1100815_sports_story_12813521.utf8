	Mason (US): Sania Mirza and her Romanian partner Monica Niculescu crashed out of the $2,000,000 Cincinnati Open, after going down to Victoria Azarenka and Maria Kirikenko, in the doubles quarter final here, Friday.         
	Sania and Monica put up a spirited fight of late but the Belarusian-Russian combo foiled their bid with a 2-6, 5-7 scoreline.         
	Ana Ivanovic will meet Kim Clijsters in the singles semi-finals after progressing along with Russian teenager Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Maria Sharapova. Ivanovic, looking in-form and confident, comfortably defeated Uzbek qualifier Akgul Amanmuradova 6-1, 6-3 to reach her second semis of the year.         
	Clijsters, who is preparing to defend her US Open crown later this month, was pushed all the way by 11th seeded Italian Flavia Pennetta before clinching a 7-6, 6-4 victory.         
	Sharapova had little to worry about in her defeat of Frances Marion Bartoli, with the Russian producing a blistering service game, winning 29 of 30 first serve points and smashing nine aces in her 6-1, 6-4 victory.         
	The three-time Slam winner will face a tough semi-final after Pavlyuchenkova displayed the temperament of a veteran to beat Belgian 12th seed Yanina Wickmayer 7-5, 3-6, 6-1.(Reuters)

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: South African captain Jacques Kallis and Man of the Match A.B. de Villiers agreed at a press conference that the opening partnership laid the foundation for the victory.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Finishing on a winning note         
	Kallis: It feels a lot better that we have been able to end in a nice manner. With the World Cup next year, it was important for us to do well. It was disappointing to lose the series but at least we are taking some positives out of this tour.         
	On seniors taking more responsibility         
	De Villiers: Luckily, all the senior guys stepped up and accepted their share of responsibility.         
	Positives from this tour         
	Kallis: If I have to single out one thing that we learnt from this tour, it would be how and when to use the batting Powerplays during the next years World Cup. Powerplay 3 will be the key.         
	Take on Indian youngsters like Virat Kohli         
	Kallis: I have been watching Virat for the past couple of years and he has improved in leaps and bounds. He has the potential to become a world class player. Same about Suresh Raina. As for the bowlers, it was difficult for the two youngsters to bowl in these conditions.

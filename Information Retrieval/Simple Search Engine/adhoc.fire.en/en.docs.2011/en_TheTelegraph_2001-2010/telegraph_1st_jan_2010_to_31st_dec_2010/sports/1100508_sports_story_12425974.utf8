                  Paul Collingwood needs to fire                     
	Bridgetown: It will be a battle of equals when a confident England locks horns with title contenders South Africa in a Group E Super Eights match of the World Twenty20 at the Kensington Oval here Saturday.         
	While England defeated Pakistan by six wickets in their first match of the Super Eight stage on Thursday, South Africa also produced a clinical performance to get the better of New Zealand by 13 runs in the other match of the day.         
	With each of them having two points in the kitty, both the Englishmen and Proteas will be aiming to continue with the winning momentum and inch closer towards a semi-final berth.         
	Neither batting nor bowling is a worry for England, as they rode on Kevin Pietersens sizzling unbeaten 70 to defeat Pakistan.         
	The team will expect another crackling performance from the experienced cricketer.         
	England have an dependable opening pair of Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter, who can give a solid foundation while there are batsmen like captain Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan to support Pietersen in the middle order.         
	Their bowling has been equally impressive so far in the tournament. Ryan Sidebottom makes the batsmens life miserable with his consummate line and length, while Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad have the ability of producing some timely breakthroughs in the middle overs.

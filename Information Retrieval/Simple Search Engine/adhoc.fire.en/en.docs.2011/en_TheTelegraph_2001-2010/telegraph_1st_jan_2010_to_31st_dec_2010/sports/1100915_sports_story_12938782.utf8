                                                                                                                       7                                      Anti-corruption measures   to be reviewed by the ICC
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has termed the recent spot-fixing allegations involving Pakistani players as a warning, and said it will recommend a wide-ranging and, if necessary, independent review of the current anti-corruption measures to maintain the integrity of the sport.         
	The ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC), which met in Cape Town on Monday, also reaffirmed the ICCs zero-tolerance stance against any form of corruption within the sport.         
	It wished to send a strong message to the players and other stakeholders by supporting the decisive action taken by the ICC in the face of the recent spot-fixing allegations in the Lords Test between England and Pakistan.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said that cricket must not and would not be complacent when it came to tackling corruption.         
	He said the ICC would also consider the accreditation of player representatives or agents.         
	It is not enough that the ICC is regarded by other sporting organisations as a leader in the battle against corruption in sport.         
	We must continue to assess and, where necessary, improve our processes.         
	The recent allegations have reminded everyone of the need to remain vigilant and to ensure public confidence in our sport, Lorgat said.         
	CEC has wisely recommended a thorough review of all our procedures and protocols and that is something which is already underway.         
	I am especially keen to engage with governments to consider the regulation of betting and also to consider the accreditation of player representatives or agents.         
	While the present investigations are ongoing we will not discuss or comment on any specific issues but this incident is a warning to all of us.         
	We must heed those warnings and heed them quickly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni thanks Harbhajan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni thanks Harbhajan
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	After setting up his teams victory with a fluent 83, India opener Gautam Gambhir said at the post-match presentation ceremony that it had been payback time for their loss to Pakistan at last years Champions Trophy. However, both Gambhir and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who played an important innings of 56, praised Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh for guiding the team home.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Dhoni: I wasnt really cool. Its just that what people see from the outside. Underneath, you can never remain cool in such a situation. Thanks to Bhajji. He is an all-rounder now. However, I feel the batsmen should have closed the game. But that is the cruelty of this game. You can expect something but that might not happen. Normally, in tense situations, I just watch the game and pass expert comments. That is a liberty you take sitting in the dressing room. But credit goes to the bowlers as they did well. Ashish wasnt hundred per cent fit but did reasonably well. I have always maintained that Praveen Kumar is a street-smart cricketer. Bhajji went for runs but then compensated with his batting. Jadeja also bowled well. When Gautam and I batted, we set small targets. Once we were set, we knew that both of us could take chances against the spinners. About the wicket, its always difficult to play the spinners under lights especially if it turns both ways.         
	Shahid Afridi: It was great game which provided lot of entertainment for the fans. Gautam, Dhoni, Raina and Bhajji batted amazingly. When we got Dhonis wicket, we felt we had the game in our control. In the last two overs, I was telling my bowlers to keep up the good work and bowl in the right areas. A lot of positives have emerged from this tour and I am quite happy with teams performance and we will definitely improve.         
	Gambhir: The Champions Trophy defeat was still fresh on our minds. For all of us, it was payback time. We knew that if we could stick around for 30 overs, we can chase down the target. Myself and Dhoni always knew that there are big hitters after us. Then Bhajji, Raina batted superbly to finish the game. 268 is not easy to chase under lights. The light needs to improve as I wasnt able to pick Afridi or Ajmal properly.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: It was double delight for East Bengal custodian Abhra Mondal on Sunday.         
	Abhra not only celebrated the title-win but also had the rare distinction of not conceding a single goal in the tournament.         
	It is a great moment for me. I have not only helped my team win the title but also ensured that we won the title without conceding a single goal, a beaming Mondal said.         
	Mondal, who draw a lot of flak for conceding five goals against Mohun Bagan during the October 25 match, exorcised the ghost of that Black Sunday.         
	I worked really hard during the last couple of months and I am happy that my efforts bore fruit, Mondal said after the Federation Cup final against Lajong FC at the Nehru Stadium.         
	Coach Phillipe de Ridder was all praise for Mondal as well as his defenders. I am happy with everyones performance. Abhra was brilliant in his anticipation, he said.         
	About the opponents, De Ridder said: They played a great game. Lajong are going to be a very good team. They have immense potential.         
	De Ridder said his team was not cowed down the vociferous crowd. Thats part and parcel of the game. Boys are professionals and are used to with playing in adversity, he said.         
	Bhaichung Bhutia, who replaced skipper Rahim Nabi in the 66th minute, felt East Bengal should have gone for the kill in the very beginning.         
	We got the opportunities early in the match which we squandered. It became difficult in the latter part of the game, he said.         
	Lajong are a very strong team. They play as a unit. It was as tough a match as it happens to be with any leading team of the country, the Indian skipper added.         
	Lajong FC coach Stanley Rozario was a rued missing an opportunity to book an AFC Cup berth but was satisfied by the overalll performance of the team. The played a good game. In the tie-breakers, it is always anybodys game, he said.         
	I am happy that boys took the match till the extra time. But we did miss the services of Daniel Bidemi, James Gbilee, Aibor Khongjee and Romeo Shukhlain, he further said.         
	Lajong skipper R Samson said: It is a great to play in the final of the Federation Cup. It will give our confidence a major boost.

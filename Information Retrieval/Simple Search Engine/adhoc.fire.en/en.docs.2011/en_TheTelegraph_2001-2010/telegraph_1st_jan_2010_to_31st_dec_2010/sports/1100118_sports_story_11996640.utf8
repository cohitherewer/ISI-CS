            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Jose Ramirez Barreto scored four goals                           
	Mumbai: Jose Barreto scored four goals as the green and maroon brigade thrashed a hapless Air India 5-0 at the Cooperage here on Sunday.         
	Karim Bencharifas team were without several key players due to injuries but the Brazilian strikers poaching skills made sure the visitors did not feel their absence.         
	The comprehensive victory from the first of their four successive away games improved Bagans tally to 17 points, three behind league leaders Mahindra United whom they take on at the same venue on Thursday.         
	Air India, without their coach Bimal Ghosh who was hospitalised with chest pain last Wednesday, slipped to the bottom rung with just one win and five points from nine games.         
	Bagan made clear of their intention early as Ryuji Sueoka unleashed a bicycle kick to meet a ball from Surkumar Singh in the 15th minute from the right.         
	Surkumar was once again in action when his dipping free-kick tested custodian Arnab Das Sharma who managed to get his fingers to the ball.         
	But it was not until added time that Bagan were able to break the shackles and that too through a controversial penalty.         
	The incident came when Ishfaq Ahmed was seemingly brought down by Khelemba Meiti just inside the penalty area. Barreto slotted home from the spot without any trouble (1-0).         
	Then, four goals in the next half hour completed the rout.         
	Two minutes after resumption, Barreto stabbed home (2-0).         
	Kalia Kulothungan, starting in place of Rakesh Masih, scored the second when he made no mistake in driving home a pass from Ryuji (3-0).         
	Then, Barreto beat his marker Henry Gangte to head in his third goal (4-0).         
	The Brazilian hammered the last nail in the coffin with his fourth goal in the 69th minute (5-0).

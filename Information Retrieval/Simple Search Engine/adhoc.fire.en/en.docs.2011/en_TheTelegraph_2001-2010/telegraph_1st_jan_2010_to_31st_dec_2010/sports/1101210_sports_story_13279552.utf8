	New Delhi: Ace shuttler Saina Nehwal advanced to the quarter finals of the Hong Kong Super Series with a comfortable straight-game win over Salakjit Ponsana of Thailand, in Wanchai, on Thursday.         
	The world No. 2 took just 26 minutes to get the better off Ponsana 21-10, 21-12, in the second round of the womens singles.         
	However, Commonwealth Games bronze medallist P Kashyap had a disappointing day on the court as the Indian lost in straight-games to fifth seed Jin Chen of China. (PTI)

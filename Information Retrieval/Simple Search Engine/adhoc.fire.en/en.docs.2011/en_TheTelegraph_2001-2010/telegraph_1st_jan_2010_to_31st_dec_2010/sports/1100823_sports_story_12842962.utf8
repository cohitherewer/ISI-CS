The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Print media walks out 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Print media walks out 
                      
	Dambulla: The print media Sunday boycotted Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis media conference following their eight-wicket loss to Sri Lanka in the tri-series.         
	The convention is that the losing captain first addresses the media after the match. That didnt happen despite repeated reminders to manager Ranjib Biswal. The players were then busy playing football.         
	A good one-and-a-half hours after the match had ended, Dhoni finally turned up. However, at this point, members of the print media walked out because deadlines had to be met and also due to the attitude shown by the Indian captain. Only the electronic media persons were present at Dhonis press conference.         
	This is an unusual incident and something like this hasnt happened earlier.           (AGENCIES)

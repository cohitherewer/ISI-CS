The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham hopes for loan deal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Beckham hopes for loan deal
                      
	London: David Beckham still hopes to join a European club on loan during the Major League Soccer off-season to keep his hopes of playing for England alive.         
	The 35-year-old midfielder has spent the last two winters at AC Milan but the Los Angeles Galaxy is reluctant to send him out on loan again after he injured an Achilles tendon, while playing in Italy in March.         
	Beckham said, ... I will be going back somewhere as I want to keep myself fit and keep myself in with a chance of getting called up for England again. To do that, I have to be somewhere so fingers crossed I can sort something out.... I have always said that it will only be for Manchester United.

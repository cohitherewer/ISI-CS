            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Nathan McCullum and Kumar Sangakkara after their collision, during their abandoned tri-series match, in Dambulla, on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Calcutta/ Dambulla: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has been found not guilty of breaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) Code of Conduct during his sides abandoned ODI against New Zealand in Dambulla, a media release said, late on Friday.         
	Sangakkara was charged with a Level 2 offence, contrary to clause 2.2.4 of the ICC code of conduct for players or team officials, which relates to inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players in the course of play.         
	The offence related to an exchange with New Zealands off-spinner Nathan McCallum in the 26th over of Sri Lankas innings. While turning for the second run, Sangakkara collided with the bowler who had his back towards the batsman.         
	Match referee Alan Hurst explained his decision: I looked at video footage of the incident from various angles and considered the detailed evidence of the umpires. I found that video evidence that was put forward by the player provided reasonable doubt as to whether the contact was deliberate.         
	The incident happened, when after flicking a ball to fine-leg, Sangakkara bumped into McCullum while trying to ground his bat.         
	The bowler didnt like it and complained to the umpires, who reported it to match referee Alan Hurst.         
	Talking about the incident, former captain Mahela Jayawardene said Sangakkara did not do it intentionally as he was blinded when he took the run. It was not intentional. Sangakkara collided with a bowler and the latter complained to the umpire. But he didnt do it intentionally. Both the players spoke about it in the dressing room, Jayawardene said.         
	Coming to the real action, rain played spoilsport for the second consecutive day as the tri-series match, which was re-played Friday after a washout Thursday, was called off after the home side batted for 43.4 overs. Put in to bat, Sri Lanka were looking for a big total with Jayawardene (59) and Chamara Silva (41) taking the home side to 203 for three before the heavens opened up to stop play.         
	Rain stopped at around 7:30 pm local time after which the umpires made an inspection along with the curator. There was a glimmer of hope after the umpires decided to make another inspection at 9 pm before taking a decision. But the rain gods did not oblige as another downpour led the umpires to call off the match just after 9pm.         
	Each side gets two points and this is bad news for Sri Lanka who were playing Fridays match after being embroiled in a demoralising no-ball controversy in their second game on Monday.         
	Sri Lanka, who now have six points from three matches, will have to beat India in their last league match on Sunday to have any chance of reaching the August 28 final.         
	New Zealand, who scored a massive 200-run victory over India to get a bonus point, are now with seven points from three matches.         
	India, who play New Zealand on Wednesday, are on five points from two matches.         
	New Zealand captain Ross Taylor won the toss, but invited Sri Lanka to bat under overcast conditions. The home side were off to a strong start with Upul Tharanga and Dilshan putting on 56 in 9.4 overs in an opening stand before the former fell to a Daryl Tuffey bouncer.

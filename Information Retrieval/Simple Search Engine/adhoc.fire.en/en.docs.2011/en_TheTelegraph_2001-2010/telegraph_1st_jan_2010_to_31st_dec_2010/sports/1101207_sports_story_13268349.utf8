The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were looking for clean sweep, says Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      Were looking for clean sweep, says Gambhir
                      
	Bangalore: Having already clinched the series with an unassailable 3-0 lead, stand-in captain Gautam Gambhir is eyeing a clean sweep as India take on New Zealand in the fourth ODI, in Bangalore, on Tuesday.         
	Our target is to win all the five games. The team that plays better cricket in the 100 overs will win. We are looking forward towards performing well and hopefully we will keep the momentum going. We need to maintain the same intensity with which we played the earlier three matches, Gambhir said.         
	Gambhir however refused to divulge the playing XI and said that he would take a call after consulting with the coach.         
	The left-handed batsman lauded his teammates and said that the bowlers deserved special praise because they delivered on every kind of wicket. We are always tested in international cricket. It is not that we have not got runs at the top of the order. But I must say that the bowlers have done well in all the matches where conditions were different. Be it the flat tracks in Jaipur or the seaming wicket in Vadodara, they have done well for us, Bowlers deserve the maximum credit for us winning the series, the skipper said.         
	In the next two outings, all we need to do is to play to our potential. We should stick to our strengths and hopefully we will win, he said.         
	Gambhir also ruled out any chance of complacency and stressed on the fact that they needed to field their best side in order to win. It is a young side and we have some experienced players in the squad too. It is an international game and we need to field a best team.

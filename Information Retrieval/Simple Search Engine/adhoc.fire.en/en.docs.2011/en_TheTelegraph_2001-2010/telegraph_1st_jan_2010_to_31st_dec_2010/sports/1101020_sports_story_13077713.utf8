                                                                                                                       7                                        Chidi, Murithala shine in Bagan goal fest
  - Strikers on fire as green and maroon brigade win 7-0       A STAFF REPORTER              Mohun Bagans Subair Murithala Ali and Edeh Chidi during the CFL match against George Telegraph, at the Mohun Bagan ground, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                   
	Calcutta: When Edeh Chidi raised his arms towards heaven, seemingly to invoke the Gods, seconds before the start of Tuesdays Calcutta Football League (CFL) match, little did anyone realise what the Moh-un Bagan striker was up to.         
	That he had a revolution in mind emerged only a minute into the match, when he raced down the inside right channel off a pass from Jose Barreto and steered it down the far post for Bagans first of a seven-goal fest against George Telegraph.         
	Leading the green and maroon brigade for the second time this season, Chidi scored a hattrick and finished with four strikes. Murithala Ali, too, clinched three goals in a scintillating display of skill and supremacy.         
	Stanley Rozarios men proved that the 17-day break after their Federation Cup final defeat to East Bengal didnt get wasted, as they sprung back with full force.         
	It looked fairly a one-sided encounter as Mohun Bagan controlled the ball quite effortlessly on Tuesday.         
	While Barreto dominated the mid-field, feeding the through balls in time for goal-scoring chances, Snehasish Chakrabortys lung-bursting runs through the left wing caught George defenders frozen in the face of crosses.         
	It was Snehasish, who triggered Mohun Bagans second goal, when he slipped a pass to Chidi, who cut inside in full speed to slot it into the George net. Two goals in seven minutes had the entire Mohun Bagan contingent shouting and the celebration only increased as the match progressed.         
	The crux of Bagans victory on Tuesday was their sharp counter-attacks, good understanding and a sense of urgency. Murithala scored his third off a spot kick and completed the 7-0 rout with the biggest winning margin this season so far.         
	Chidi, who was the man of the moment, stressed how important the victory was for his side when he said: After the Fed Cup loss, we were disappointed. So, it was an important match for us. The win here will make sure we make a good comeback.

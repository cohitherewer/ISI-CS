The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto on song as Bagan cruise
                                                                                                                       7                                        Barreto on song as Bagan cruise
            A STAFF REPORTER            Barreto                           
	Calcutta: It took Jose Ramirez Barreto exactly a week to convert the jeers into cheers. After having the choicest expletives hurled at him upon missing a spot-kick against Salgaocar last Saturday, the Brazilian gave a fitting reply to his critics and in the best possible manner.         
	Barreto struck a brace as Mohun Bagan thrashed Air India 4-0 to return to winning ways in the I-League. Barretos second and his teams fourth goal was out of the top drawer. He dribbled past Uttam Singh to unleash a booming right footer that beat the outstretched hands of Arnab Das Sharma to crash into the far corner. The match was in its 69th minute then.         
	He scored the first in the 61st minute by tapping home once Edeh Chidi had pulled the ball back for him. The twin strikes took his tally for the season to 12 goals and the win took his team to 29 points  two less than fourth-placed Chirag United.         
	It was a thoroughly one-sided affair as the Bagan players literally toyed with the opposition. Midfield marshals Ryuji Sueoka and Marcos Perreira tormented the Air India defence time and again and, as a result, found their names on the scoresheet.         
	Sueoka scored in the fifth minute with a powerful grounder after a 20-metre sprint down the middle. Marcos scored in the 21st minute with a swerving freekick that left Das Sharma stranded.         
	There will be criticism and we all have to live with it. I was mentally disgusted for not having scored goals but what hurt me more were the calls for my retirement in some quarters. They questioned my fitness, which was really unfair. But the majority of the people love me so I really dont care about a small minority, the Brazilian said as he left the venue amidst the familiar chants of Barreto, Barreto.

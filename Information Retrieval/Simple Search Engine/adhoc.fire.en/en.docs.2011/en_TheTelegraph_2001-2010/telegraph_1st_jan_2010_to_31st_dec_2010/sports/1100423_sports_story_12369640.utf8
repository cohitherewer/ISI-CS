The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cause of Sania injury should be pinpointed
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cause of Sania injury should be pinpointed

     Naresh Kumar      After a Keystone Kops like   chase, the cross border cross  bow of Shoaib Malik brought   down Indias ruling sports   queen with Cupids arrow. When the   Mirzas announced Sanias marriage to   Shoaib, all hell broke loose. The Sid  diquis, an established, respected fami  ly, also from Hyderabad, were furious.  They claimed that Shoaib was al  ready married to their daughter   Ayesha and produced a nikahnama as   proof. For five days, the families fought   toe to toe exchanging impassioned   high decibel rhetoric on the television   channels. Eminent citizens, the Judi  ciary, lawyers and Qazis were drawn   into the fray and Shoaibs passport was   impounded by the police.  The paparazzi swarmed all the   venues like locusts as they gobbled up   every small nuance of the drama. To   top it all, a fatwah was also issued by   one of the Qazis. It was a great relief   when the warring families buried   their differences and were mature   enough to accept the inevitable.   Sanias love, kept under wraps, sur  faced when she stood by and stoutly   supported a fumbling Shoaib in a gate   meeting with the press. This was the   defining moment of the episode. She   is a brave girl carried away in a love   thermal.            Sania Mirza       Sadly, both   Sania and Shoaib   are going through   a bad phase of   their careers.   Shoaib is appeal  ing against a suspension by   the Pakistan Cricket Board   (PCB) at a time when Pakistan   cricket is at its nadir, and Pak   players are not welcome into   the Alladins Cave called Indi  an Premier League.  Sania has assumed the ad  ditional and heavy burden of a   difficult marriage. Apart from bridg  ing the Punjabi-Hyderabadi cultural   gulf, each have to continue pursuing   their careers and keep succeeding in   their respective sports. Tennis tourna  ments and cricket matches seldom, if   at all, are held   at the same   venues.  This   means the   young couple   would not   have much   time to spend   together. Be  sides, Sanias   career is at its   lowest ebb.  Riddled with in  juries, she has not   had a reasonable   injury-free run, as   a result of which,   her rankings have   plummeted to 92. Sanias injured   wrist needs time to heal and I   doubt if she will be ready to play   much before June. It is time for   her to take a long-term look at   her future career. Patching up in  jured limbs and rushing back to   play will not work.  There are no magic cures.   The cause of the recurring wrist injury   has to be pinpointed by video analysis of   the bio-mechanics of her shots. If need  ed, necessary adjustments should be   made, tweaking her technique.  Otherwise, it is bound to recur.   Martina   Hingis, Kim   Clijsters, Jus  tine Henin    all came back   after long lay  offs and took   very little time   to get to top   form. True,   Sania is   nowhere near   the standards   of the three who are Grand Slam win  ners, but she can surely get back to her   best-ever ranking, which was close to   30.  Sania knows her weaknesses. She   should tackle them with renewed   vigour and take the technical help of   the best in the world.  Coming back is a very tough call.   Now, a place among the top-10 for Sania   will be more than a fairytale. Sania has   to take two steps back and readjust her   sights. She has to balance her career   and married life. Both are of para  mount importance.  Career-wise, the fans and sponsors   will fade away if her level of perform  ance falls, while her married life will   need very skilful handling. The quest   for higher rankings requires intense   focus. Similarly, Shoaib will have to   focus on training for cricket to get back   to the Pakistani team, specially the   Twenty20 format.  One has seen Sania move, over the   years, from her giant-killing days on the   sports page to frivolous page 3 es  capades with film stars, and finally to   the front page of the papers, with cover  age akin to a minister of cabinet rank.  She now ventures into a new chap  ter of her life, with the score at love-all.   Her cup of joy is full and may it stay so   for the years to come.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Rimpuche may do the trick
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Rimpuche may do the trick 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Arktouros and Ascriptive, the two Vijay Singh-trained horses are expected to corner most of the betting in the 1,400m Stewards Cup, Saturdays main attraction. However, it is the Darius Byramji-trained Rimpuche who appeals most to win the race. The Pennine Ridge-Smarlee mares last run was brilliant when she covered lots of ground, from the rear, in the stretch run to place a decent fourth behind Silver Fox. That horse went on to score again. Impressive in her subsequent workouts, Rimpuche may do the trick now in the hands of in-form jockey Shailesh Shinde.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waqar: Boys lack belief
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waqar: Boys lack belief
                      
	Karachi: In a scathing criticism of the Pakistan cricket team, former captain and present bowling coach Waqar Younis said its poor show in the ongoing series against Australia is hardly surprising as the side lacks self belief and match winners.         
	Keep in mind that you are playing against the worlds best. Unfortunately we dont have many match winners in this squad, he said.         
	Our lack of self belief has been a big problem. The boys never really believed that they could beat Australia.           (PTI)

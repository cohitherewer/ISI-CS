The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB questions selection validity
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB questions selection validity
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will write to the Board of Control for Cricket In India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan questioning the validity of the selection process of the East Zone squad for the Deodhar Trophy.         
	We will be sending an e-mail to Srinivasan intimating him about the developments of that meeting. I have also taken the consent of the CAB president in this regard, said CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey on Monday. It has been learnt that the CAB will question the validity of the selection meeting where Tripura Cricket Association president and BCCI vice-president Arindam Ganguly represented his state as a selector.         
	Also, after the squad was finalised, Orissa Cricket Association secretary Ashirwad Behera signed on the list as president of the selection committee when he was not even supposed to be present at the meeting.         
	There is nothing called president of a selection committee. There are selectors among whom one is the chairman. Since Raja Venkat didnt attend the meeting, there was no chairman. Also how did Ganguly represent his association as a selector? Manash Roy, the selector from Orissa, was appointed the coach while Jharkhand selector Jodh Singh was appointed the manager. These are certain questions that needs to be addressed, he said.

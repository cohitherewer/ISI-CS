The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | World T20 is over   for Muralidharan
                                                                                                                       7                                      World T20 is over   for Muralidharan
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                        Muttiah Muralidharan        
	Bridgetown: The World Twenty20 has ended for the worlds most successful spinner  Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Im going back home... The (right) groin injury got aggravated during yesterdays match, against the West Indies... I just cant continue, Murali told The Telegraph on Saturday morning, walking out of the breakfast room at the Hilton with a bit of discomfort.         
	Murali got injured during the tournaments first-round, but even some days rest didnt serve the purpose. Then, why was he fielded against the hosts? Thats because Murali himself wanted to play.         
	When somebody like Murali says hes fit, then you include him in the XI... Hed been confident, said coach Trevor Bayliss.         
	Obviously, Murali got it wrong. But, then, hes the type who is always itching to get his fingers on the ball.         
	The 38-year-old is, of course, nearing the end of a fantastic career.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Australian Commonwealth Games contingent may have problems with most things here but their India-born wrestling manager Kuldip Bassi has no qualms scouting for local talents who can represent his adopted country.         
	Acknowledged as the most powerful nation in the Games, Australia have come to Delhi with plenty of imported wrestlers to make their presence felt. And if Bassi is to be believed, the Aussies are willing to recruit talented grapplers from India to strengthen their squad.         
	At the moment, the Australian side is packed with wrestlers, who have migrated Down Under. While 74kg freestyle grappler Kostya Ermakovich was born in Tashkent, Hassene Fkiri came from Tunisia.         
	And the list, actually, is longer. Australias newly-crowned Greco-Roman (GR) 120kg champion Ivan Popov was born in Omsk (Russia), while Masoud Sadegh Pour (60kg, GR), Hassan Shahsavan (74kg, GR), Farzad Tarash (60kg Freestyle) and Mehrdad Tarash (66kg, Freestyle) came from Iran.         
	Among the women, 51kg wrestler Kyla Bremmers birth place is Powell River in Canada, while Louise Randle (63kg, Freestyle) was born in England.         
	We are ready to take young and talented wrestlers from India so that they can represent Australia, said Bassi, who migrated to Australia many years ago.         
	Those who are good but are not getting enough opportunities here to make progress in wrestling are welcome. We want good wrestlers, said the Australian manager.         
	But Bassi said he was only interested in those who want to make a career out of the game.         
	We dont want people who think it could be a launching pad to go to Australia.         
	In the Beijing Olympics in 2008, too, the Australian wrestling squad had an India-born player, Sandeep Kumar. However, Sandeep couldnt make the team for the Commonwealth Games this time.         
	He is a good wrestler but now others also are doing well in the 74kg. There are a lot of talented wrestlers in Australia. The game is getting more and more popular, said Bassi.         
	Australia, however, are not the only team who are using foreigners to build their squad. England, too, are full of wrestlers, who have come from outside.         
	While Jagroop Singh (84kg, Freestyle) is a wrestler of Indian origin from Canada, Sasha Madyarchyk (60kg) and current 66kg Greco-Roman champion Myroslav Dykun are Ukrainians by birth.         
	Other wrestlers who have migrated to England are Terence Bosson (60kg) of South Africa and Mohammed Osman (84kg) of Iraq.

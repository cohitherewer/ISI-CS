The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Desperate for T20 win, says Gibbs
                                                                                                                       7                                        Desperate for T20 win, says Gibbs
                                
	Johannesburg: South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs desperately wants to win the ICC World Twenty20 and said he is ready to exchange any individual honour of my career for a victory in the Caribbeans.         
	I would exchange any major individual honour in my career for a winners medal at an ICC event, Gibbs told a Bridgetown daily, where South Africa is practising ahead of their first match against India in St Lucia on May 2.         
	You can take any Man of the Match Award away. I want to win a major ICC event, and it is the same for all the other senior players, Gibbs said, reflecting on the lost chances in earlier ICC tournaments that left him disappointed alongside Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher.         
	I wasnt part of the Test series victories in Australia and England, so this is what it is about for me, added Gibbs who has honorary citizenship of St Kitts and Nevis after hitting six sixes in one over in the 2007 World Cup against the Netherlands.

	Madrid: Lionel Messi netted his 30th and 31st league goals of the season as Barcelona inched closer to retaining their La Liga title with a 4-1 home win over relegation-threatened Tenerife at Camp Nou on Tuesday.         
	The Catalans are now four points clear of Real Madrid at the summit with just two games left, but Real have a game in hand and must win at fourth-placed Real Mallorca on Wednesday to keep their title hopes alive.         
	Messi put Barcelona ahead on 17 minutes and added a second in the final minute to stay on course to win the Pichichi crown for the leagues top scorer, as he is currently six goals ahead of his nearest rival, Real striker Gonzalo Higuain.         
	Argentine Roman Martinez stunned the champions by equalising for Tenerife shortly before half time following an error from home captain Carles Puyol.         
	But second-half goals from Bojan Krkic (in the 63rd minute) and substitute Pedro Rodriguez (77) turned the game in Barcas favour before Messi rubbed salt in the wound with his late strike.         
	Barcelona will hope Mallorca can do them a favour against Real as they turn their focus to Saturdays tough trip to Champions League hopefuls Sevilla.         
	Promoted Tenerife, who have won just once on their travels all season, stay third from bottom, although they are level on points with Malaga above them.         
	Valencia sealed a place in the Champions League qualifying round after coming from behind to defeat bottom side Xerez 3-1 at the Mestalla later on Tuesday.         
	Spain international winger Juan Mata scored a brace before setting up David Silva for a third as third-placed Valencia made sure of a top-four finish and moved to within a point of an automatic place in next seasons Champions League.         
	Xerez prop up the table, as they have done for most of the season, lying five points from safety and could be relegated on Wednesday if results go against them. (AFP)

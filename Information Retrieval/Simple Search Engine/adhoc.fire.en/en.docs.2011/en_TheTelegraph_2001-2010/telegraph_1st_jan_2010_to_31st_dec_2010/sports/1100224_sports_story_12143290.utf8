	New Delhi: Sanjeev Rajput stole the show from Gagan Narang in the 50m Rifle 3 Position by shattering the meet record as Indias medal tally swelled to 30, including 14 gold, on the sixth day of the Commonwealth Shooting Championships here Tuesday.         
	Rajput, who had teamed up with Gagan Monday to clinch the team gold, outshone his more accomplished compatriot by shooting a score of 1272.9 (1172+100.9), a major improvement on the previous meet record of 1260.2 set by Pemmiaha Subbiah in the 1999 edition in New Zealand.         
	Gagan had to settle for silver with a score of 1269 (1168+101.1), while another Indian Hasan Imran Khan took home the bronze medal after shooting 1259.6 (1161+98.6).         
	India fetched the second gold in the 25m center fire pistol team event. Vijay Kumar teamed up with Mahender Singh to claim the top honours as the duo shot a combined score of 1159.         
	Indian women shooters, however, failed to pocket a gold Tuesday. In the 10m Air Rifle team competition, Priya Aggarwal and Neha Sapte had to be content with silver after shooting a total of 782, way behind the 790 scored by the gold medallist duo of Akhter Sharmm Ratna and Sadiya Sultana of Bangladesh.(PTI)

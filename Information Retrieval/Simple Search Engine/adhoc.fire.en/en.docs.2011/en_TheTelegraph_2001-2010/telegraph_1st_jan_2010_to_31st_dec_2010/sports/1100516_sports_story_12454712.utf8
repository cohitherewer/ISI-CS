The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Danish faces fresh trouble
                                                                                                                       7                                        Danish faces fresh trouble
            [+uc('Derek Pringle   The Daily Telegraph')+]            Kaneria                           
	Danish Kaneria, Pakistan leg-spinner playing for Essex and young fast bowler Mervyn Westfield were arrested by Essex police on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud following the polices investigation into alleged spot-fixing in Essexs Pro40 match against Durham last September.         
	Both the Essex cricketers were questioned at Brentwood police station on Friday before being released on bail until September 15. That should allow Pakistans selectors to at least pick Kaneria, with only a modicum of controversy hanging over him.         
	That series needs Kaneria, though the England and Wales Cricket Board, as full signatories to the International Cricket Councils anti-corruption code, will be torn over his presence.         
	Unless Pakistans selectors decide not to select him while the investigation is ongoing, he is crucial to their competitiveness in that series.         
	Essex police had wanted to interview Kaneria, 29, who has 58 Test caps for Pakistan, last Monday, three days after his return to England, but that was during Essexs County Championship match with Kent and the club asked if that could be deferred until yesterday. Every other Essex player, as well as the support staff, have been helping police with their inquiries.

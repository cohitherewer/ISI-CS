The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No Deco for 66 rematch
                                                                                                                       7                                        No Deco for 66 rematch
                    Cristiano Ronaldo is all smiles during a practice session on the eve of their match against North Korea, in Magaliesburg, on Sunday                
	Cape Town: Portugal and North Korea meet on Monday in a reprise of one of the most famous games in World Cup history.         
	The remarkable 5-3 quarter final win of an Eusebio-inspired Portugal over North Korea at the 1966 World Cup continues to resonate as one of the greatest games ever in footballs premier tournament.         
	North Korea are making their first World Cup appearance since and, after a respectable 2-1 defeat to Brazil in their opening game, the Korean side must strive for at least a draw to keep alive ambitions of reaching the round of 16.         
	Portugal, who drew 0-0 with Ivory Coast in their Group G opener, need a win, given that their last group game will be against mighty Brazil.         
	But they will have to take on the resilient North Koreans without midfielder Deco who has been ruled out of with a thigh injury picked up during Fridays training session.         
	Deco has been ruled of the second match by Portugals medical department, Acaz Felleger, the players spokesman, said in a statement on Sunday. He is with the Portuguese delegation in Cape Town and hopes to play against Brazil in Portugals third match on Thursday.         
	But there is belief in the squad and the absence of spark in the opener has been put down to nerves.         
	We know we can improve. Things will be different on Monday, said striker Liedson after the game against Ivory Coast. Youre always nervous in the first World Cup game. Well be calmer in the second one.         
	Reclusive North Korea played with great composure against Brazil, before succumbing. Having manfully resisted the multi-pronged Brazil, the North Koreans are only looking in one direction to see Portugals threat  Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	Striker Jong Tae Se compared Ronaldo favourably with Eusebio, whose four goals in that 1966 quarter final ended North Koreas fairytale run.         
	Ronaldo is better than Eusebio, he said. He is a more skilful player both tactically and technically.         
	Midfielder An Yong Hak said the clash with the Portuguese will be tough because the whole world knows Ronaldo is the best player in the world.         
	Several players at the World Cup are hoping to strengthen their claims to being the worlds best. So far, only Argentinas Lionel Messi has lived up to his top billing. Like Englands Wayne Rooney, the jury is still out on Real Madrids Ronaldo.         
	Apart from rifling one ball onto the post from long range against Ivory Coast early on, he was near invisible for the rest of the game and was only notable otherwise for the yellow card he received.         
	Ronaldo has the eyes of his country and the world on him. The Real Madrid forward hasnt found the net for his country in an official game since the 2008 European Championship.         
	Of course I want everyone, including Cristiano, to score. But the most important thing is a victory. It doesnt matter who puts the ball in the net, said Portugal Carlos Queiroz.         
	I just have to focus on one thing: winning our next game. We have to get through.         
	But the North Koreans havent come to South Africa just to make up the numbers. The slogan on the side of North Koreas team bus in South Africa, where the reclusive countrys team has come once again into the worlds view with a second World Cup appearance, clearly states the countrys intentions: 1966 Again! Victory for DPR of Korea! it says, using North Koreas official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.         
	Only three of the North Koreans play overseas, and the team have made few international appearances in recent years, giving opponents little chance to study their strengths and weaknesses.         
	Form analysis aside, the game will be an event in itself, with the teams having waited 44 years to meet against after that famous 1966 meeting.         
	Likely Teams         
	Portugal (4-3-3): 1-Eduardo, 3-Paulo Ferreira, 2-Bruno Alves, 6-Ricardo Carvalho, 23-Fabio Coentrao, 8-Pedro Mendes, 16-Raul Meireles, 19-Tiago, *7-Cristiano Ronaldo, 11-Simao Sabrosa, 9-Liedson         
	North Korea (4-4-2): 1-Ri Myong-guk, 5-Ri Kwang-chon, 16-Nam Song-chol, 13-Pak Chol-jin, 3-Ri Jun-il, 8-Ji Yun-nam, 11-Mun In-guk, 17-An Yong-hak, 4-Pak Nam-chol, 10-Hong Yong-jo, 9-Jong Tae-se         
	Referee: Pablo Pozo (Chile)           (AGENCIES)

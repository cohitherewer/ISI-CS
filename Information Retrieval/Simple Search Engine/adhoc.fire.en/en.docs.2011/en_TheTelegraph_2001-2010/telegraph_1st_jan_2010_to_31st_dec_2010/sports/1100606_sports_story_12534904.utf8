                                                                                                                       7                                        Robben limps off
                  Robben on Saturday                     
	Johannesburg: The injuries just keep on coming, and plenty of big-name players are being affected with the World Cup less than a week away. A day after Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba and England captain Rio Ferdinand were hurt, the Netherlands winger Arjen Robben limped off the field with a left hamstring injury and Nigeria midfielder John Obi Mikel was ruled out of the tournament in South Africa because of his ailing knee.         
	Robben scored two goals before being hurt in the Dutch teams 6-1 win over Hungary in Amsterdam. I thought to myself, This cant be true, Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk said Saturday. He made an unnatural movement and injured his hamstring.         
	Robben came on as a second-half substitute against Hungary before leaving the game in the 85th minute.         
	The Dutch have another injury concern in center back John Heitinga. He was substituted after about an hour against the Hungarians and his ankle was immediately wrapped in ice.         
	Mikel will miss the World Cup because he has not recovered from knee surgery. He will be replaced by Ideye Brown, Nigeria Football Federation spokesman Ademola Olajire said.         
	Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel was also hurt Saturday. The Liverpool central defender injured his ankle in the 13th minute of Slovakias 3-0 win over Costa Rica, but he is expected to travel with the team to South Africa.         
	The World Cup opens next Friday, but many of the worlds most famous players will be missing. Former England captain David Beckham was ruled out of the tournament in March when he tore his Achilles tendon while playing for AC Milan. Germany captain Michael Ballack soon followed with an ankle injury in May, and Ghana midfielder Michael Essien was ruled out last week after failing to recover from a knee injury.         
	Others being affected by injuries include Mexico forward Guillermo Franco, Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo and United States striker Jozy Altidore.           (AGENCIES)

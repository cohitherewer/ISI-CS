The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gifted two wickets: Law

            A CORRESPONDENT             Suresh Raina and Ishant Sharma in Colombo, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Sri Lanka assistant coach Stuart Law said at a press conference he was confident that if his team could get closer to 500, it would put them in a good position to win the third and final Test against India.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The way things unfolded on the opening day         
	We played pretty well... Traditionally, you can lose a few wickets before lunch. Going into lunch, it would have been good had we been one wicket down. Unfortunately, Dilshan gifted his wicket before the lunch break. It wasnt to be... Overall, very happy with the way things went for us and hopefully this will set us up for a big first innings total.         
	Was it a gamble to bat first         
	Not at all... It looked quite dry, even though there was grass on the surface. We know our spinners will get a lot of assistance in the fourth innings. To me it means, when you win the toss, you remain positive and say I will take you on in a bowler friendly condition. Thats the way I saw it. Thats the way Sangakkara saw it when he decided to bat. That was the key. Lost an early wicket, but I thought Dilshan and Sangakkara played good sensible cricket until lunch. Just unfortunate that Dilshan gifted his wicket just before the break         
	A good total on this surface         
	The closer we get to 500, the better That would set us up for a victory. If you look at the average scores, 350-400 is pretty good.         
	The dismissals of some of the batsmen         
	We gifted India two wickets. Sanga still feels hurt for getting out the way he did. Hes in superb touch at the moment. He was destined for another 100, till he got out for 75. That happens, the guy has scored a hundred in the first Test, 200 in the second Test, 40 odd not out in the second innings, 75 today and you can probably excuse him for a lapse of concentration. Dilshan was unfortunate. He thought theres a single that wasnt there. You can also count Mahela unlucky as well for being adjudged LBW.         
	Did India bowl badly or Sri Lanka batted well         
	You can look at it differently We have a pretty formidable batting line-up, much like India. Both powerful line-ups... Yes you have to bowl some extraordinary deliveries to take 20 wickets. I think the way Ishant and Mithun bowled, they havent disgraced themselves one bit. They keep running in and trying... Not much time between Test matches and may be fatigue is starting to set in. But once again, today, I thought they bowled pretty well for very little reward. Our guys are playing well. We are a good team. We are tough to beat here in Sri Lanka, and once the confidence was high since winning the first Test, our batsmen have revelled in these conditions.         
	The Indian spinners         
	Once again, Mishra is playing his first Test in the series The spinners shouldnt really be playing too much of a part on Day One of a Test match... Ojha got a few balls to go past the bat, I think hes bowled without luck. Mishra, you can never underestimate a leg-spinner. They tend to bowl bad balls and get wickets. I have seen that many times over the years, wrist spin, tends to get more uneven bounce than other spinners. Look, they have toiled hard... We have played well.         
	The wicket         
	Galle was a very good wicket. A result happened there just under four days. You cant worry too much about the wicket in Galle... There was a bit of swing and seam and as the game wore on, there was lot of spin. All in all, it was a very good wicket. Obviously there was something for the batsmen as well. SSC was too batsmen friendly and the bowlers had to work very hard on that surface. This one looks like a more even contest between the bat and ball. If you bat well, you score runs if you bowl well, we have already seen balls flying past the edge both seamers and spinners. So for me, its going to be more of a test of the batsmens skills.         
	If the balance in the Lankan line-up is right to get 20 wickets         
	The attack is similar to the one we had in Galle. With Lasith Malinga back in the line-up, its not so much the wicket he needs he needs to turn up and get his variations spot on. If he does that, itll be handful. Welegedara has had a few problems with his wrist and swinging the ball, hes been working hard with Champaka Ramanayake in the last couple of weeks... He bowled very well. Angelo Mathews, if the wicket has little bit of assistance for the seamers, can be hard to bat against. Weve got a very balanced attack. Its not very heavy on spin or heavy on seam.         
	Whether Lanka would be missing a left-arm spinner against a batting line-up full of right-handers         
	Its one of those things I believe your best bowlers are your best bowlers. Doesnt matter whether they are right-handed or left-handed. They should get them out. We have a guy like Ajantha, who is not a traditional spinner. Hes got different types of variations and thats the beauty of Ajantha. I dont think it really maters whether you are right-handed or left-handed.

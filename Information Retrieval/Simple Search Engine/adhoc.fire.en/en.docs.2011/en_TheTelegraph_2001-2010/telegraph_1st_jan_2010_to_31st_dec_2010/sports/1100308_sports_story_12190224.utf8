                                                                                                                       7                                        India to finish season as No. 2 ODI team
            A STAFF REPORTER            Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhonis Team Indias position as the second-ranked team behind Australia, in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship, at the annual cut-off date of April 1 was confirmed on Sunday when New Zealand narrowly lost the second ODI against Australia by 12 runs on Saturday.         
	The loss means that even if New Zealand win the remaining three ODIs, it will not be able to leapfrog India which sits on 122 ratings points.         
	However, if the Black Caps win all the forthcoming ODIs against Australia, it will finish on 120 ratings points  three ahead of South Africa.         
	The second place in the ODI Championship at the annual cut-off means India win $75,000 in addition to $175,000 which they will get for finishing as the No. 1 Test side.         
	Australia will receive a cheque of $175,000 for their No. 1 position on the ODI Championship table while South Africa will collect a cheque of $75,000 for their second place finish in the Test table.         
	Meanwhile, India batsman Suresh Raina (659 points) rose a rung to 15th in the rankings for one-dayer batsmen, headed by his captain Dhoni with 819 points.         
	Sachin Tendulkar (762) was static in the fourth place while Virender Sehwag (694) and Yuvraj Singh (682) remained 11th and 13th, respectively.         
	Seasoned off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who remained to be the only Indian face in the top 10 bowlers, slipped one place to seventh with 645 points.         
	Yuvraj (343), who is the only Indian among the top five all-rounders, lost one place to be at the fourth spot.

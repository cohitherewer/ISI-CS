  - Century at eden gardens gave me confidence, says MoM         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir during his knock at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, in Dhaka, on Monday. (AFP)                                 
	Dhaka: Virat Kohli is not putting himself under any pressure and just wants to concentrate on playing his natural game. Mondays Man of the Match also said at the post-match media conference that he is trying to stay relaxed and not let pressure affect him.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	His feelings         
	Very happy Didnt manage to get a hundred on the earlier occasions and wanted to convert it this time. Very happy.         
	Pressures of batting at No.3         
	Yes, there is pressure, especially when you consider Im in the early stages of my career. But Im trying to not feel it too much, trying to stay relaxed. The hundred at the Eden gave me confidence and I know Ive to play my natural game.         
	His career at this stage         
	Im batting well and hope to make the most of this phase. Hope I can go out and bat like this always         
	If his reaction on reaching the century was a bit restrained today         
	We had to chase down a target of 248. The situation wasnt such that I needed to show much emotion. I just had to finish it off and was happy at achieving it.         
	If he is worried about having to miss out when Sachin Tendulkar returns         
	It doesnt worry meIts only understandable that Ive to sit out. Its an honour playing alongside Sachin.         
	On talk about his temperament in the early part of his career         
	I think such talk was correct to a certain extent during the first IPL. Since then Ive been more focused. The Emerging tournament in Australia gave me the confidence I became mentally strong and could tackle pressure situations better.         
	If such talk was a distraction         
	There are two ways on looking at it. You either choose to rectify yourself or ignore the talks. I chose the first option and it paid off.         
	The wicket         
	Obviously batting first and second does make a difference If you win the toss you have the advantage. Also one cant always depend on the toss and youve got to excel whether batting first or second. The conditions will be equally difficult for the pacers and spinners in the second innings.         
	If he expects a Test call-up         
	Its like a dream for me However, Im not putting myself under any pressure.. Right now Im just concentrating on the final and not thinking any further. Im not thinking about any future goals and just enjoying my game.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis role         
	He has always supported and backed me. He has always asked me to play according to the situationHes been a big help.

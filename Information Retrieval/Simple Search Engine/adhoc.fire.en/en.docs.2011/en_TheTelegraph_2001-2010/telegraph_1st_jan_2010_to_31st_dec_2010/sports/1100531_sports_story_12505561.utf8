            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: R. Vinay Kumar was Sunday ruled out of the ongoing tri-series in Zimbabwe because of a knee injury. Abhimanyu Mithun will replace him in the squad.         
	Vinay Kumar has injured his knee and has been ruled out from the ongoing tri-series in Zimbabwe.         
	The all India senior selection committee of the BCCI has chosen Abhimanyu Mithun as replacement for Vinay Kumar, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement.         
	He (Mithun) will fly out as soon as formalities are completed, he added.         
	Vinay Kumar was named in the squad for the tri-series in Zimbabwe and the two Twenty20 Internationals against the hosts.         
	The 26-year-old right-arm pacer made his debut against Zimbabwe on Friday, claiming two wickets for 51 runs in his eight overs, which was not enough to avert Indias embarrassing six-wicket defeat against Zimbabwe.         
	Mithun made his one-day International debut against South Africa in Ahmedabad in February.         
	Mithun was named in the India A squad for the tour of England in June, but will now head to Zimbabwe to fill in for Vinay. Mithun, 20, finished as the leading wicket-taker in Ranji Trophy with 47 at 23.23.

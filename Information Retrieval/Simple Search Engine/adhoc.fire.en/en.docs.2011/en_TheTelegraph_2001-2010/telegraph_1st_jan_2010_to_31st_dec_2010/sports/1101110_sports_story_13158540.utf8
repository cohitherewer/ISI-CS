The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger backs shorter season
                                                                                                                       7                                        Roger backs shorter season
          
	Paris: Roger Federer on Tuesday backed calls to shorten the tennis calendar to protect players from burnout by creating a six week off-season.         
	World No. 1 Rafael Nadal and top French player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are among the high-profile absentees due to injury at the Paris Masters this week. Nadal has previously said the season is too long.         
	I think its time we shifted back a bit and we get a proper off-season really, Federer, who has never got further than the quarter finals, told reporters.         
	The ATP is to finalise its proposed calendars for the 2012 and 2013 seasons at a series of board meetings in London during the World Tour Finals in November. The governing body has said it was looking at a meaningful way to reduce a punishing schedule.         
	Four weeks is just not enough off-season really, Federer said. Six weeks I think is much better as already you can take two weeks off...practise three, four weeks which is a lot for us in our world.         
	Several top players are behind the appeal for a tour overhaul including Serbian Novak Djokovic, who sits with Nadal on the Players Council.         
	Federer, who meets Frenchman Richard Gasquet in the second round on Wednesday, said it was in the best interests of tournaments which are often hit with a series of withdrawals towards the end of the tennis calendar year.         
	In Tuesdays match, Spains Fernando Verdasco came from a set down to beat Frenchman Arnaud Clement to keep alive his hopes of qualifying for London.         
	The Spanish sixth seed, who had won just one match since the U.S. Open in September coming into Paris, struggled to keep up with 32-year-old Clement in the early stages, before rallying to win the last 10 games to secure a 6-3, 3-6, 6-0 second round victory.

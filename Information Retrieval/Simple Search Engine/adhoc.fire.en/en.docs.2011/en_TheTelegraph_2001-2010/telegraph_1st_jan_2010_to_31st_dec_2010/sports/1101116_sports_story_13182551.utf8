            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: If New Zealand manage to save the second Test, Tim McIntosh can take some credit for keeping India at bay.         
	The Black Caps opener, who struck a brilliant 102 in the first innings, fell to a dubious decision on 49 in his second essay. But the opener was confident his team can share the spoils if they can negotiate the first session on Tuesday. The first session will be extremely important. We will have to take our chances to set up a good total, McIntosh said after the days play.         
	Speaking on the wicket, he said: Its true that the wicket is not producing much turn But wickets are falling. So, its a good strip for cricket.         
	Asked what was secret behind his successful partnership with McCullum, McIntosh said: I think that the fact both of us play positive cricket helps Besides, we back each other well.         
	He accepted that facing Zaheer Khan is a big challenge. Its a challenge to face Zaheer I practice hard in the nets and try to work on my batting and nullify Zaheers wicket-taking deliveries. But Im enjoying the challenge and hope it carries on for the rest of the series.         
	He also congratulated Sachin Tendulkar on completing 21 years of International cricket and said that the maestro is a special player.

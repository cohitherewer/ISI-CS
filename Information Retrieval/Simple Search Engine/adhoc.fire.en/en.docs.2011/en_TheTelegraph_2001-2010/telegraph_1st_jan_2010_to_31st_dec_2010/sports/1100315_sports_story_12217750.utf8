  - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Former coach wishes KKR good luck         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: John Buchanan has wished the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) good luck and said that the wins at the start of IPL III have given the new regime credibility.         
	The results allow them to begin to move beyond last season... I wish KKR good luck... Like all teams, they will have some interesting selections once all players become available, Buchanan, removed as the KKR coach last summer, told The Telegraph, on Sunday evening.         
	A couple of days earlier, the Brisbane-based Buchanan had spoken at length about IPL III. He remains very disappointed, though.               
	The following are excerpts         
	QYour take on the IPLs third edition?         
	A If the 2008 results can be used as a guide, teams should be capable of scoring higher totals than in South Africa  at least for the first two-thirds of the tournament. After which, all teams in the running begin to tighten up with the prospect of making the finals. A fact that will work against higher scores is that there has been significantly more 20-over cricket played around the world since IPL 2009. We have, for example, seen Australia employ a three/four-pronged pace attack to take early wickets and, thereby, limiting opposition chases or restricting the opposition from setting a big target. While Indian conditions will not be as conducive as in Australia or New Zealand, a new white ball delivered at pace will still trouble the less skilled top order batsmen. So, teams which employ a quality top order line-up should be able to counter such attacks, capitalise on less formidable bowling and provide a strong platform for bigger scoring.         
	Do you expect IPL III to be bigger than the first two editions?         
	There has been plenty of hype overseas, at least in Australia and New Zealand... The discussion concerning the next two franchises would seem to have been a good tool to heighten interest; Indias and Sachin Tendulkars performances would also suggest that an Indian public will want to see more of their superstars, no matter whom they turn out for... Also, simply the fact that the IPL has returned to India can only suggest that this edition will draw significant interest.         
	If you were still an IPL coach, would your own approach have been any different?         
	It would have changed slightly due to the return to India. However, we had initiated a long-term plan in terms of how we wanted to play the game and, while that had taken some time to deliver in 2009, the groundwork was done... It would have been an ideal opportunity (at KKR) to keep building upon the huge amount of work done behind the scenes.         
	Whats the No.1 lesson for the franchises to learn from the first two editions?         
	There is no question that wickets matter, particularly early wickets. There is no question that partnerships are crucial to big scores and these can start at any stage during an innings, but preferably in the first 10 overs, to allow the rest of the line-up to continue to bat without fear. And, provided you can have a pair of skilful players at the end, 12-15 runs per over average is very achievable.         
	Your assessment of the eight teams, beginning with the Deccan Chargers, last years champions...         
	Deccan Chargers: Plenty of experience and confidence will have been gained from last seasons win. Adam Gilchrist is another year older as well as another year without cricket. However, I think he will still perform and is still their best leader... Kemar Roach is an exciting signing and, with the rest, makes it a potent attack. Any side that boasts of Andrew Symonds and Herschelle Gibbs on top of Gilchrist can mount any score... Rohit Sharma will need to take greater responsibility this year. Similarly, Pragyan Ojha will need to win games with the ball... No home games will be an issue for Deccan, which may cost them not only financially, but also a place in the finals. Should, however, be in the top four.         
	Royal Challengers Bangalore: An exciting looking team with a real mixture of age and skills... Will be interesting to see how Anil Kumble handles the tournament, but if he stays fit and continues to lead the team as he has done, it will be a huge plus for Bangalore... Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher will bring continued experience to the team, with Kallis a key member. Bangalore have the best group of young Indian players, headed by Virat Kohli... Add the excellent 20-over players like Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Cameron White and Roelof van der Merwe and there is exceptional depth. Should make the final.         
	Delhi DareDevils: Delhi have remained relatively unchanged apart from Moises Henriques and Wayne Parnell as overseas inclusions... There is little doubt that their batting looks far stronger than their bowling with Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, AB de Villiers, Tillekaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Karthik all proven 20-over performers. Dirk Nannes will head their bowling... The ability to keep teams in check will fall on Amit Mishra and Daniel Vettori... Eric Simons has been added to the coaching staff, to assist Greg Shipperd, but I am not too sure how that will work. Delhi have promised a lot over the first two seasons, but have not delivered at the business end. Hopefully, this experience will be a boon for them, not an anchor. Will be on the edge of making the finals.         
	Chennai Super Kings: Even with Andrew Flintoff and Jacob Oram out injured, Chennai have a formidable outfit. Batting-wise Matthew Hayden, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Mike Hussey (after a couple of weeks), Suresh Raina... It is one of the strongest in the competition. Then, the bowlers will present a varied attack to meet most conditions... Stephen Fleming brings a calm and cool approach, which will be important. Should be in the top four, again.         
	Kings XI Punjab: Here is a side that can do anything  good and bad. Now that Tom Moody has retired from his WACA coaching position to concentrate on his IPL role, I think it will make a big difference to him and, ultimately, Kings XI. The physio, Patrick Farhat, will be critical to the success of the team as he battles to get Brett Lee fit and firing his thunderbolts, plus dealing with persistent hamstring injuries to Yuvraj Singh, Shaun Marsh and James Hopes... Kumar Sangakkara taking over from Yuvraj will be only good for Kings XI as they will get the onfield leadership needed at crucial times, while freeing Yuvraj to play his natural game. With a fit Lee, Sreesanth and the others will become a more potent bowling force. Batting is the potential Achilles heel of Kings XI as evidenced in the past and they have gone some way towards addressing that with Ravi Bopara being available for the entire IPL... Mohammed Kaif has been added... The key to Kings XI being in the finals will be the batting of Yuvraj, firstly, as also Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene firing. I am hoping Yuvraj wants to send a message to the Indian selectors that he is not only a batsman of class, but also responsibility. If this message is unambiguously sent, then Kings XI should make the final.         
	Rajasthan Royals: Any side that features Shane Warne, even an ageing Warne, will always present themselves with a chance. He controls his troops very well and still delivers on the stage he likes to play on the most. The Royals have given themselves some firepower with Shaun Tait, who with Shane Watson (once available), Morne Morkel and Munaf Patel gives the attack some real grunt and intimidation. Old friend Damien Martyn is a good buy for 20-over cricket and, together with Graeme Smith, Watson and Yusuf Pathan, will be the backbone of the batting... The Royals have cast aside a number of younger players and brought in some new faces. Of those that have remained, Royals will be hoping for improved and more consistent performances from keeper Naman Ojha and Siddharth Trivedi, to name two. The Royals will always be in contention and cause some unexpected results.         
	Mumbai Indians: With a new coaching team of Robin Singh and local Paras Mhambrey, supported by Jonty Rhodes and Shaun Pollock, it will be interesting to see whether they can bring out the consistency that the side lacked in the first two years. Bowling is Mumbais strong suit with Zaheer Khan leading the charge, backed up by Lasith Malinga and the rest. Spin and slow/medium bowling is well looked after by Harbhajan Singh, Abhishek Nayar, JP Duminy, Sanath Jayasuriya (who is in his 41st year!)... It is the batting  a factor in previous tournaments  which is of concern and I do not see Jayasuriya being as effective in 2010. Much will hinge on Sachin Tendulkar, who has not shown a great liking for this game. A lot will be expected from the young players like Shikhar Dhawan and Saurabh Tiwary... I think it may be another frustrating year for the Ambanis and the Indians.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders: A new coach, new captain, some new support staff and players, new colours... Gives KKR a new look... I think KKR will benefit from the work that was put in last season, so there is little doubt that they will improve on their showing in 2009. Although there is no Umar Gul, the bowling, as always, looks strong. Shane Bond provides additional pace with Charl Langeveldt, Ishant Sharma, Ashok Dinda and Ajit Agarkar there. Sourav Ganguly suggests two new men, Eklakh Ahmed and Varun Aaron, are both fast, which will be of good support to the frontliners... There is a great array of medium pace and spin through Angelo Mathews, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourav, Murali Kartik, Ajantha Mendis and Chris Gayle... Batting has been the real downfall of KKR, which is hard to fathom when it is headed by almost an all-star cast of Gayle, Brendon McCullum (when both become available), Sourav, Brad Hodge, David Hussey, Mathews... Add the others and you can get a total almost out of reach... I would like to tip KKR for the finals, but I think that will be just beyond their reach in 2010.         
	Today, do you regret having removed Sourav Ganguly as the captain, in 2009?         
	I had very clear plans for how KKR was to play its cricket... I was always open with this approach to Sourav and the owners. While, initially, I had the support of the owners, Sourav did not agree. I do not believe there to be any enmity between Sourav and I... We had different opinions on how the game was to be played and, therefore, his role in that. The owners chose to change their minds about how I saw the long-term plan for KKR, obviously influenced by our poor results in South Africa. While that is definitely their prerogative as they are carrying the financial weight of the franchise, I remain disappointed at not being able to finish a job that had only just started some 14 months before...         
	What would be your message for successor Dav Whatmore?         
	Continue to build on the work that has already been done.         
	Just how closely will you be following KKRs fortunes?         
	Very closely, as I still have a lot of people with whom I stay in contact within Calcutta and in the team.         
	Any comments on KKR buying out Ricky Ponting...         
	No... That was business between Ponting and his management and KKR. However, I think it was an obvious decision for both parties.         
	Could we see you in any role in the 2011 IPL?         
	As stated, I remain disappointed at not being able to finish something I had just started. So, I would definitely be keen on a coaching role, or something similar, with any franchise.         
	Finally, looking back, were you (a) misunderstood or (b) did you actually go about certain things in an insensitive manner?         
	I am not sure how I could have been misunderstood as I spent a lot of time with the owners, Sourav and the other key people, explaining to them about the long-term picture and how we needed to build solid foundations to reap success down the track. I am sure I have been insensitive at times, due to different cultural norms, sometimes my style and means of communication... However, while trying to avoid such situations always, I think we all step on toes at different times in our dealings with other people  not intended, but it happens. Irrespective of my dismissal from KKR, I would hope that everyone knew my intentions for KKR were always to make it the best it could be. The means to achieve this vision was where the final disagreement lay.

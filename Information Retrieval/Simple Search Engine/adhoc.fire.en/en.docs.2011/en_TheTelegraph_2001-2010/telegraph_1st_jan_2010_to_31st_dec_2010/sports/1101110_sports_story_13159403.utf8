The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A gentle reminder to BCCI goes unheard
                                                                                                                       7                                      A gentle reminder to BCCI goes unheard
  - Mr Pawar hasnt requested a meeting... Nor, for that matter, have I heard from Mr Gavaskar: Manohar       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Calcutta: To quote Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, hes given the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) a gentle reminder on his dues, but that hasnt been taken note of.         
	According to Gavaskar, the BCCI owes him the extra remuneration promised by former president Sharad Pawar for serving on the Indian Premier Leagues governing council, from the time it was constituted till end-September.         
	Pawar, a Union minister, now heads the International Cricket Council.         
	Gavaskar is understood to have mentioned a figure of Rs 20 crore over five years, which was to have been the life of the first governing council. It got dissolved after three years, thanks to the dubious dealings of Lalit Kumar Modi.         
	The BCCI has, of course, clarified that nothing is outstanding and that Gavaskar got every Rupee (of the regular annual payment, Rs 1 crore after deductions).         
	Gavaskars gentle reminder was through a statement, last week, which included the following: ... I am now waiting for Mr Sharad Pawar, the then president of the BCCI, to arrange a meeting with the current president, to help untangle and resolve this demanding matter, since it was he who made the offer for the extra payment...         
	Till it was reconstituted six weeks ago, the governing council had seats for three former players  Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri. Now, there are only two (Shastri, Mohinder Amarnath), with nobody getting even a paisa.         
	Contacted in hometown Nagpur on Tuesday evening, the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, told The Telegraph: Im aware of the statement, but Mr Pawar hasnt requested a meeting... Nor, for that matter, have I heard from Mr Gavaskar... Nothing is scheduled.         
	Asked if there could be a meeting when Gavaskar lands in Nagpur, for TV commentary during the third and final Test against New Zealand, beginning November 20, Manohar replied: I cant say anything...         
	The opportunity for a one-on-one, at least, assuming Pawar isnt there, may just arise.

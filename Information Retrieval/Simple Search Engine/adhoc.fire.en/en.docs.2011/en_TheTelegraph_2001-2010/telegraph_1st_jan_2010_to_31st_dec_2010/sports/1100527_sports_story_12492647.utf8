The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players apologise for pub incident
                                                                                                                       7                                      Players apologise for pub incident
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The seven cricketers, showcaused by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for an incident at a pub in Gros Islet during the World Twenty20, have tendered an unconditional apology, blaming the fans and pleading innocence.         
	In their letters, the cricketers said they were abused by disappointed fans in the pub and vowed there would not be a repeat of such incident.         
	It is quite likely that all the players would be let off with a reprimand. BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, however, refused to confirm having received the answers to the showcause saying it was an internal matter of the BCCI.         
	In the letter addressed to Srinivasan, Ravindra Jadeja said the cricketers were taunted by the fans, who refused to back down even after a request from the players.         
	I regret that the board has sent me a notice for the incident in the West Indies, and please accept my apology, Jadeja wrote .         
	I had gone to the restaurant (pub) along with other Indian team members. Some other guests, which I presume were Indian origins of the USA, also came to the restaurant and on seeing us they started abusing us, this may be because they were unhappy with our poor performance.         
	We requested them not to abuse us but they did not stop inspite of our repeated requests. No way was I involved in any ugly brawl and I went to the pub only to have dinner with my team-mates, the all-rounder wrote.         
	If the Board still thinks that I have brought disrespect to the game of cricket or our board and our country, I once again sincerely tender my unconditional apology and assure you that I will take care that in future no way my name will be involved in any such incident, said the Saurashtra cricketer.         
	Apart from Jadeja, the other players showcaused were Ashish Nehra, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Piyush Chawla, Murali Vijay and Rohit Sharma.         
	Three of the players have accompanied the team to Zimbabwe for the tri-series  Vijay, Rohit and Jadeja. Chawla will join the team for the two T20 Internationals.         
	Rohit said he was having dinner in a corner and was not even aware of the incident till his attention was drawn to it by his teammates.         
	The Board decided to showcause the players after the Indian team manager for the World Twenty20, Ranjib Biswal, submitted his report. Biswal didnt take any individuals name in his report and only mentioned players.         
	It was learnt, he mentioned in his report that the players had breached the curfew that was set for 9.30 pm. During the incident, the players retaliated verbally after being abused, the report said.         
	Biswal did not mention any pub incident for Team Indias disgraceful exit, but blamed purely cricketing reasons for the ouster.         
	This is the first instance of the BCCI pulling up so many players in public.

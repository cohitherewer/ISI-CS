            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ace trap shooter Manavjit Singhs aspirations for the Commonwealth Games suffered a jolt, on Friday, when his favourite gun was misplaced while travelling to Italy for training.         
	Arjuna Awardee Manavjit travelled to Italy via Frankfurt, on Thursday night, to train under his coach, Marcello Dradi, for a week, before going to Istanbul to take part in the World Cup finals.         
	Manavjit could not find his gun after reaching Italy, on Friday, as it was misplaced during transit, confirmed his father, Gurbir Singh. A complaint has already been lodged with the airlines authorities, he added.         
	Manavjits performance is bound to suffer at the Commonwealth Games if that particular gun is not found. In a sport like shooting, every shooter needs his favourite gun to enhance the performance, said Gurbir, also an Arjuna awardee. This year, Manavjit won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Shooting Championships and a gold at the trap shooting World Cup.

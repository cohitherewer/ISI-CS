The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Uphill task for Bangladesh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Uphill task for Bangladesh
                      
	Hamilton: The Bangladesh top-order collapsed in the second innings leaving hosts New Zealand on the verge of victory at the end of the fourth day of the first Test here.         
	According to Cricinfo, Bangladesh were 88 for five at the draw of stumps on Thursday. Shakib-al Hasan was yet to open his account while Mushfiqur Rahim was batting on 10.         
	Earlier, New Zealand declared their second innings at 258 for five giving the visitors a stiff 404-run target for victory.         
	A brilliant spell from Daniel Vettori was supported well by off-spinner Jeetan Patel and took the game well and truly away from Bangladesh.         
	Tamim Iqbal gave the visitors the opening, slogging to long off where a back-pedalling Daryl Tuffey took an important catch. The remainder of the top-order folded feebly under pressure, with New Zealand hot on attack in the final session.

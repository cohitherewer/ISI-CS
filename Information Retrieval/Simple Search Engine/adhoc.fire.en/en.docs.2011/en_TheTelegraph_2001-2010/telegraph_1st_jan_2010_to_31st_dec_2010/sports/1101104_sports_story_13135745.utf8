            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Subrato Bhattacharya has emerged triumphant in many epic battles at the Ambedkar Stadium over the years, but the one that is lined up for him on Thursday night would be hard to win.         
	Pitted against an all-conquering East Bengal in the Durand Cup semi-final, Bhattacharyas Chirag United are clearly the underdogs despite their impressive showings in the tournament so far.         
	But then, Chirag are no exceptions. Given the way East Bengal are playing this season, it is difficult to imagine any team getting the better of them at the moment. Even in Durand, both Air India and Salgaocar raised hopes by taking the lead, but finally succumbed to relentless East Bengal attacks.         
	Hoping to register their 19th straight win, East Bengal, however, have to overcome quite a few problems back in their dressing room. While key midfielder and playmaker Mehtab Hossain will have to watch the proceedings from the stands, Penn Orji is also a doubtful starter because of an ankle injury.         
	I will wait till 4pm on Thursday before taking a decision on Penn, said East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan. If Penn cannot take the field, then I may have to change the strategy, he added.         
	To add to the coachs woes, striker Robin Singh may also have to skip the semi-final. Too many injuries definitely upset the rhythm but thats a part of the game, Morgan said.         
	On the contrary, Chirag have limited options though Bhattacharya played his cards well in the deciding group league match against Indian Air Force on Tuesday. I am really missing Junior (Elijah) at this tournament, rued the Chirag coach.         
	East Bengal are good, but not unbeatable, Bhattacharya said. While East Bengal are on a roll, Chirag have a striker in Joshimar, who could prove dangerous and would surely be involved in a battle of wits with rival defender Uga Opara.

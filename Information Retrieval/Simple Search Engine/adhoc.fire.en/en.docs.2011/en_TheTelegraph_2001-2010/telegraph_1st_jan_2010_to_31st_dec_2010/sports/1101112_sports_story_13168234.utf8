The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haider: Dont want aid from UK 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Haider: Dont want aid from UK 
                    Haider                
	London: Zulqarnain Haider has once again confirmed that he deserted his team midway through a series as he feared for his life and has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to monitor suspected players phone calls and movements to eradicate corruption from the game.         
	In a hurriedly convened media conference at a restaurant in Southall Wednesday, Haider confirmed that he had met ICCs Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) and spoke at length about his decision to abandon his team in the middle of an ODI series against South Africa in Dubai earlier this week after receiving death threats.         
	It was very hard for me when I got threats from one person in Dubai. I just felt very nervous, he said.         
	The best way is to record all the players phones and monitor where they are going. Ive heard that in Pakistan a lot of people are involved in fixing, but I think the ICC is doing a good job, he said.         
	I just want cricket to be clear of fixing and all bad things, he added.         
	Haider reiterated the threat made to him before the fourth ODI against South Africa in Dubai, but said he did not know the person who issued the warning.         
	I was told if you work with us, we will give you a lot of money. If not, we will not select you again in cricket and, if you go back home, we will kill you and your family, he said.         
	I think they were interested to book me for the fourth and fifth ODI.         
	The 24-year-old fled to London, where he sought temporary asylum and later retired from international cricket citing threats to his life .         
	This country is very humane, very co-operative, there are very nice people here and there are very good rules here for my safety. Thats why I came here, Haider said.         
	He, however, insisted that he had no plans of seeking asylum permanently in the UK. I dont want any aid from the British government. I want to be a good citizen and I am a good citizen in Pakistan too. I want to live in peace.         
	The PCB finally got in touch with Haider who also met with the Pakistan High Commissioner in the UK.         
	I got a call from the chairman today and he inquired about the circumstances leading to my decision to leave the team and come to London, Haider said. I told him everything and he has assured me the board will do everything possible to ensure security.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa savours his new role
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rafa savours his new role
            Spaniard battles through personal pain      CHRISTOPHER CLAREY                                  Rafael Nadal		    
	New York: On the planets tennis courts  be they clay or grass or the blue, cushioned acrylic of the US Open  Rafael Nadal has answered all the big questions. But with matches finally done in New York and Nadals career Grand Slam complete, the questions kept coming Tuesday.         
	They came on the morning television programs when Nadal, after a very late dinner and three hours of sleep, dragged himself out of bed and made the now traditional rounds. They came at Niketown on 57th Street from fans wearing Vamos Rafa T-shirts and from John McEnroe, who played master of ceremonies for an interview session inside that temple of conspicuous sports consumption. They came from Spanish newspapermen who wrote lists of queries in their spiral notebooks before meeting with the athlete who has become one of the symbols (and solaces) of modern Spain.         
	And finally, just before a hurried lunch and Nadals rush to the airport to fly home, the questions came inside a van with the storefronts of Manhattan rolling past and Nadal leaning back in his seat, looking wearier than he ever looked in Monday nights four-set victory over Novak Djokovic in the Open final.         
	This is the fifth set, he joked in Spanish, mustering a smile. Youre the last one.         
	But rest will come soon enough for Nadal, and it will be repose untainted by regrets. At 24, he has become the seventh man to win all four Grand Slam singles titles. He has won the French Open five times, Wimbledon twice, the Australian Open once and now the US Open.         
	The clubs other members are Fred Perry, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Andre Agassi and Roger Federer. But it is perhaps best defined by all the great players who do not belong, including Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras, who never even reached the final of the French Open.         
	Nadal joined Agassi as the only men to have won the four Majors, the Davis Cup and the Olympics. That Nadal has ticked all the boxes in the tennis era that was once Federers alone only magnifies the achievement. At the start of Nadals career, his game and proclivities gave him a natural advantage only on clay, but he has been talented enough, open-minded enough and driven enough to modify tactics, even his technique, and close gap on games other surfaces.         
	Mondays victory  fuelled by powerful serves, suffocating defence and big variations in pace and spin  was merely the latest confirmation of his hardcourt prowess. He won the 2008 Olympic singles title on a nearly identical surface in Beijing and won the 2009 Australian Open on a very similar surface manufactured by the same company that produces the courts at Flushing Meadows.         
	Theres so much competition at the moment, and whats clear is either you get better or youre dead. And I think the reason I improved is because if I had not improved, I would not be here talking to you about winning the U.S. Open. I had to do it.         
	Little more than a year ago, after Nadal was overpowered by Robin Soderling in the fourth round of the French Open and he missed Wimbledon because of knee problems, his ability to dominate again was justifiably in doubt.         
	There was also break-up of his parents marriage. Then came January, when Nadal retired in the quarter finals of the Australian Open against Andy Murray with more knee problems.         
	Eight months later, he is alone at the summit. People see the victories; they dont see the obstacles, said his uncle Toni Nadal, who has been his coach from the beginning. Everybody has obstacles, but Rafas had his knees and his personal problems and physical problems of last year. I think all that only makes this sweeter for him. Rafa has an approach which is very important and that is even if things dont come quickly, he continues to believe they are going to come, and he is ready to keep trying until they do.

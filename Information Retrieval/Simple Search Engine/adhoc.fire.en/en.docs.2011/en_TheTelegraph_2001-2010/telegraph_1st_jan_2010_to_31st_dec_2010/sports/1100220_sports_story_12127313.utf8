The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Know how to stop Sohail: Rajpal
                                                                                                                       7                                        Know how to stop Sohail: Rajpal
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Rajpal Singh at a function in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: There are nine days to go for the face-off against arch-rivals Pakistan in their hockey World Cup opener here but no one in the Indian camp seems unduly perturbed by the presence of ace penalty corner specialist Sohail Abbas in the rival line-up.         
	Having scored more than 300 international goals, Abbas, 33, is considered a mystery drag flicker  someone whose game is yet to be deciphered by defenders and goalkeepers. And heres what the star player recently described as the atmosphere in a contest against India: jung ka mahaul.         
	Indian skipper Rajpal Singh admitted that their Cup opener was a potentially explosive affair but refused to give extra importance to Abbas.         
	No doubt he is a great player but we know how to stop him. I am sure now it is Pakistan who will be more worried about our penalty corner specialists, Rajpal said.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on the sidelines of a felicitation function organised by Hockey India, Rajpal said: Our goal is not to beat Pakistan only. We are aiming for a semi-final berth, which we will surely achieve. We will play our traditional attacking style of hockey. We have also evolved an effective system of counter-attacks.         
	Goalkeeper Adrian DSouza, perhaps the most articulate among the players in the team, was even more confident about taking Abbas head on.         
	We, too, are aware of his comments. No problem, we know how to handle him this time. Two years ago, when we played him in the Asia Cup, we were able to block him. It shouldnt be a problem this time either, he said.         
	National coach Harendra Singh, Jose Brasas understudy, too thinks India have never had it to so good in the penalty corner department.         
	Even in 1975, when India won the World Cup, the team had only two penalty corner specialists, Surjit Singh and Aslam Sher Khan. This time we have three, boasted Harendra.         
	Let me assure you that all three of them (Sandeep Singh, Diwakar Ram and Dhananjay Mahadik) are in top condition. Their strike rate in practice is pretty high, he added.         
	Although most former players have already dismissed India as not semi-final material, the team feel they stand a good chance in front of home crowds.         
	I have played two World Cups but this one is going to be the most memorable one, said Arjun Halappa, along with Prabhjot Singh the senior-most player in the team. I am telling the boys not to succumb to the pressure of the home crowd and enjoy it.         
	Rarely do we get a chance to play in front of a supportive crowd. When we played the Asia Cup in Chennai it was great fun to find thousands of people egging us on We bagged the trophy. This time, we shouldnt feel nervous but more confident, said Halappa.

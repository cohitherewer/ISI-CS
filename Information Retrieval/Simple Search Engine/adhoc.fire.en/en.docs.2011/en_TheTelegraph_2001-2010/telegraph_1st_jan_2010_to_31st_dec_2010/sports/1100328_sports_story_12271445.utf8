The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettel on pole
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettel on pole
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Melbourne: Sebastian Vettel will start from pole for the second successive race as he led a Red Bull one-two ahead of local favourite Mark Webber in qualifying for the 2010 Australian Grand Prix with an out of sorts Lewis Hamilton failing to get out of Q2.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil though hit the right gears to breeze into Q3 again and will start 10th on the grid. But the lone Indian in the fray, Karun Chandhok of Hispania, will once more start last row on the grid.         
	Both Force India cars should have made Q3 but Vitantonio Liuzzi was caught up in traffic and the Italian, who scored the outfits first points in Bahrain, is 13th on the grid Sunday.         
	Both should have been in Q3. Liuzzi had traffic problems and Sutil too could have qualified seventh or eighth but for a slight mistake in the first sector of his final timed lap, Force India chairman Vijay Mallya said.         
	On Friday night Hamilton had his silver Mercedes impounded for 48 hours when he was spotted deliberately losing traction as he left the circuit to join the main road. He apologised for his actions on Sunday.         
	And the distraction of the former world champions brush with the Melbourne law perhaps had a bearing on a disappointing showing from the McLaren driver, whose teammate Jenson Button starts from fourth.

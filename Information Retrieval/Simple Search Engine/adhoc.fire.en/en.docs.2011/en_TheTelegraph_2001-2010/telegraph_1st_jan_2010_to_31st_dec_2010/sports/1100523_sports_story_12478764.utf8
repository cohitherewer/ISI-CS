                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi does U-turn, to play Tests
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan Twenty20 skipper Shahid Afridi has decided to end his self-imposed exile from Test cricket and made himself available for this years full tour of England, barely 24 hours after making public his intention to retire from the five-day version of the game.         
	I have made myself available for the full tour of England that includes Test matches, Afridi said Saturday.         
	The 30-year-old all-rounder, who last played a Test match in mid-2006 in England, said he took the decision keeping in mind the difficult phase through which Pakistan cricket was going. This time I have changed my mind because I know Pakistan cricket is going through difficult times and the Asia Cup and the England tour are going to be very important tours for us from all counts, Afridi said.         
	 Sources, however, hinted that the Pakistan Cricket Board might have pressurised Afridi to end his exile from Test cricket because of the brewing captaincy crisis.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We can compete with India: Tamim
                                                                                                                       7                                        We can compete with India: Tamim

	Dhaka: Bangladesh are capable of not only giving India a good fight in the second Test but also capable of beating them and squaring the series, Tamim Iqbal said in Mirpur Saturday.         
	We are not a team just to come and play. We can compete with them (India). If we dont commit the mistakes of the first Test, we can get a positive result either a draw or a win, he said at the match-eve press conference.         
	Asked about the alleged sledging by the Indian players in the first game, Tamim said: Sledging is part and parcel of the game. We have very good relations with the Indian players, off the field.         
	The southpaw said he was determined to do well in Test cricket, which he says was the ultimate format of the game.         
	I enjoy scoring runs in one-dayers, but Test cricket is different. In Test cricket, I want to bat as long as possible and the concentration is important. If you bat long you will score.         
	In Chittagong, I was concentrating each of the 121 balls I faced but I did not concentrate on the 122nd ball and I was out, said Tamim who scored 31 and 52 in the two innings in the first Test.         
	I am pretty new in Test cricket and it will take some time for me to do well consistently. But I want to become a good Test player as it is the ultimate form of cricket.         
	He said Bangladesh have improved as a side but it will take some more time to come up with consistent performance.         
	We are improving in fielding, batting and bowling. The bowlers did better in Test than at the tri-series (earlier this month). In batting we had not done badly in the first Test, he said.

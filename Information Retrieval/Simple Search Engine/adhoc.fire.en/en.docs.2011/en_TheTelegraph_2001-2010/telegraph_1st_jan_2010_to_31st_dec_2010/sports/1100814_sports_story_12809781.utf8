The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All-white rule waived for 12
                                                                                                                       7                                      All-white rule waived for 12
                      
	London: Wimbledon has agreed to waive its traditional all-white clothing rule as part of plans for the 2012 Olympic tennis event that will give the venue a very different look and feel.         
	Players must wear predominantly white at the Grand Slam event, but London 2012 organisers said Friday the requirement will not apply during the Olympics.         
	All England Club chief executive Ian Ritchie said Wimbledon had no hesitation in agreeing to the move.         
	We have been very supportive to the Olympic organisers throughout the process, he said. We hope to some extent there will be a different type of audience. It is not a repeat of the Championships. It will be its own competition, have its own style and it will play out in its own way.         
	Among other changes, the Royal Box on Centre Court will be filled with the International Olympic Committee family, instead of the assorted royalty and dignitaries who congregate there during Wimbledon.         
	Only 12 of the available 17 courts will be required, meaning crowd capacity will be 26,000, down from 40,000 during the championships.         
	However, one tradition will remain: there will be no scheduled night sessions.         
	The Olympic tennis event is provisionally scheduled to begin on 28 July, 2012, just 20 days after the end of the Grand Slam tournament.           (AGENCIES)

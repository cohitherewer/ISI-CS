	Shillong/ Margao: Hosts Lajong FC will take on Pune FC in a crucial 17th round ONGC I-League match at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Saturday. Lajong, however, have a slight edge going by past results and are playing at home.         
	They had held Pune FC to a draw in their away I-League match on November 8 at Pune and in the group league stage of 31st Federation Cup in December last year.         
	In E.K. Nayanar Trophy last month, Lajong won 1-0. The hosts are hoping to do an encore which will be of great help as they are struggling at the second last place in the league table with 13 points.         
	No wonder Lajong coach Stanely Rozario said that the tie is very crucial for the team.         
	In another match, Churchill Brothers take on Dempo Sports at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	With no Sunil Chetri, Peter Carvalho, Joaquim Abranches and Clifford Miranda not fully fit, Dempo have a tough job in hand.

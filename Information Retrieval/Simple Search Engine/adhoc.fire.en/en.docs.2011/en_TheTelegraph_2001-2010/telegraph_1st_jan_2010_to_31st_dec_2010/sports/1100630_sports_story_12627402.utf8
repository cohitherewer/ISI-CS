The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers help SA seal Test series
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bowlers help SA seal Test series

	Bridgetown: Fast bowler Morne Morkel grabbed three for 33 as South Africa wrapped up a convincing seven-wicket victory over West Indies just before lunch on the fourth day of the third and final Test at Kensington Oval Tuesday.         
	The Proteas sealed a 2-0 victory in the three-match series to retain the Sir Vivian Richards Trophy for a sixth successive series since 1998.         
	West Indies, resuming their second innings on 134 for seven, was bowled out for 161 as Morkel took all three wickets to fall. Veteran left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul batted through the innings to finish unbeaten on 71.         
	South Africa, set 47 to win, coasted to their target despite a fiery three-wicket burst from pace ace Kemar Roach. Roach grabbed three for 22 before AB de Villiers hit the winning boundary 25 minutes before lunch.         
	South Africa needed just 36 minutes to brush aside the home teams lower order in the morning.         
	Morkel did all the damage, flattening the off stump of Sulieman Benn (9) before claiming Roach (8) and Brandon Bess (0) to outside edges.         
	Morkel ended the series with 14 wickets while pacemate Dale Steyn, who finished with 15, earned the Man of the Series award.         
	Chanderpaul and Benn stretched their partnership to 23 before Morkel found the gate between bat and pad to dismiss Benn.           (REUTERS)

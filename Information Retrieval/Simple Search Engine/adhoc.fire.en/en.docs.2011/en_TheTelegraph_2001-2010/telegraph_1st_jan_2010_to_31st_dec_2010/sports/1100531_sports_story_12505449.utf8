The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Englishmen triumph via friendly goals
                                                                                                                       7                                      Englishmen triumph via friendly goals
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                                England rsquo;s Ashley Cole (left) and John Terry after their friendly win against Japan, in Graz, on Sunday. (Reuters)      
	Same old story for England. In their final friendly before flying out to World Cup 2010 in South Africa Fabio Capellos team were spared embarrassment by two Japan own goals, once again failing to rediscover their qualifying form.         
	After a grim first half in which Japan led from the seventh minute, England made five changes and an improved performance put Japan under pressure, both their centre backs turning into their own net.         
	Amid torrential downpours and some noisy travelling support, England failed to convince but, just as against Mexico, came away with the win. First Marcus Tanaka headed Joe Coles cross past his goalkeeper and then Yuji Nakazawa turned an Ashley Cole cross into his own net in the closing stages. Inept stuff.         
	Japan had caught a flat England cold. With seven minutes gone Yasuhito Endos low corner was steered in by Tanaka. The England defence were static  but that was the running theme of the half. Japan, playing neat approach football, breezed through the England midfield too easily.         
	England were restricted to long range shots for the most part, with one Frank Lampard free kick panicking goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima while Aaron Lennon also went close after scurrying on to an excellent Wayne Rooney pass. Rooney himself went close with an improvised flick from a Tom Huddelstone pass just before the break.         
	An angry Capello sent on Joe Hart, Jamie Carragher, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole at the break as he tried to shake some life into his team. It worked, to a degree, as Gerrard provided far more drive in midfield and Joe Cole some spark going forward. Japan still offered sporadic threats, though, and Keisuke Honda was twice denied by fine Hart saves.         
	Ten minutes into the second half and England won a penalty after Lampards free-kick struck a Japanese arm in the wall. Having missed a penalty in the FA Cup final, Lampard stepped up but his effort, low to his left, was saved by Kawashima. Capello might want to promote Rooney to that job.         
	England finally got their equaliser on 72 minutes after a sustained spell of pressure, Joe Cole getting down the right and putting in a cross to the near post that was flicked in by the otherwise excellent Tanaka. Eleven minutes later and Japan somehow did it again.         
	There was still time for Emile Heskey to head wide a Gerrard cross with the goal gaping and Yuke Abe to hit the top of the bar with a cross. Capello had been animated and angry throughout the second half. Once again he comes away with more questions than answers.         
	Meanwhile, in a friendly on Saturday, Spain had to wait for a last-minute Fernando Llorente header for a 3-2 victory over Saudi Arabia as the European champions made a sluggish start to their preparations for the World Cup finals.         
	Spain should have felt at home in the Tivoli Neu stadium as it was where they beat Russia 4-1 to kick off their successful Euro 2008 campaign, but they fell behind to an Osama Hawsawi header in the 17th minute. David Villa and Xabi Alonso scored either side of the break but a deflected shot from Mohammed Al-Sahlawi in the 75th minute put the Saudis level, before Llorente headed in at the end.         
	This kind of thing happens sometimes but we have to be positive; we started a little lazily because we have had 15 days without playing and we found it hard to get into it, Spain coach Vicente del Bosque told Spanish state television after the narrow win.         
	Im not happy with everything. We are a little behind because we have these 15 days without playing but we have to remain optimistic.         
	Spain captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas made his 103rd appearance to become the countrys second most capped player.         
	Also on Saturday, Serbias stand-in captain Nemanja Vidic intervened to allow his sides friendly against New Zealand to finish in Klagenfurt, appealing for calm over the public address system as Serbian fans rioted.

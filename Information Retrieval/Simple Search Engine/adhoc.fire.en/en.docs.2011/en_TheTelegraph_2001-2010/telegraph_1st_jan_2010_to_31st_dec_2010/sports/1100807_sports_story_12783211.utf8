	Calcutta: Bengal striker Robin Singh was an elated man on Friday. And why not, it was his equaliser in the 84th minute that kept Bengal in contention before they pulled it off in the tie-breaker.         
	Obviously, I am happy that I have contributed my bit in teams success. But, we fought well collectively and my Man of the Match is Abhra Mondal.         
	He saved one in the tie-breaker which was far more important. Also, the fact that my parents were watching me from the stands was a bonus.         
	This is my first significant performance at the senior level. I will cherish it for a long time, the fomer TFA cadet said after the match.         
	Asked whether he was feeling lonely in the 18-yard box, he said: Yes, a bit. A bit more support could have been of much help. But you cant fight injuries. Its a team game and as a professional, I cant crib about the fact that I didnt have support upfront.         
	If you dont get support from others, the onus is on you to score. Thanks to our coach, who told me that I should play freely. He didnt put any restrictions on my style of play. One hurdle gone and lets hope, we beat Punjab to regain the title.         
	Abhra, the hero of the shoot-out said that there was absolutely no pressure on him.         
	I have never been tense during shoot-out. Whether its for club or for state, I have always been confident that I would be able to save a couple of shots. I am happy that my hardwork has paid dividends, the shot stopper said as he was whisked away by officials.         
	Ask Shabir Ali about the luck factor and he is quick to point out that he has never believed in luck.         
	I dont believe in luck. The tournament is not over yet. We have been inconsistent in the tournament. We must not slip in the final. The way the boys showed stomach for fight was exceptional.         
	The coach also confirmed that Nilendra Dewans knee injury isnt that serious and he can be expected to play in the final.         
	The doctors said that he is fine but Nilendra says that his knee is hurting. We need to check him during Saturdays training session and take a final call, the coach said.         
	However, the good news is that Gauranga Dutta, who was seen in considerable pain due to calf muscle injury is fit to play.         
	The IFA general secretary Utpal Ganguli said: I would beg to differ from those who feel that Bengal doesnt have talent. We do have talent and also the stomach for fight. I am proud that they have performed so admirably.         
	The IFA on Friday announced a cash incentive of Rs 2 lakh on reaching the finals. The official sponsors of the Bengal team have promised that they would bear an all expenses paid pleasure trip to Malaysia, if the team happens to win the final. So there is plenty to play for.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifa probe into fake Togo team
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fifa probe into fake Togo team
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Fifa is investigating allegations that a fake Togo team played a friendly against Bahrain earlier this month.         
	Bahrain won the friendly 3-0 but they were surprised by the poor quality of the Togolese team with head coach Josef Hickersberger describing the match in Riffa on Sept 7 as boring and a wasted opportunity.         
	However, it appears Bahrains opponents were not an official Togo team.         
	Togo sports minister Christophe Chao told a newspaper: Nobody has ever been informed of such a game. We will conduct investigations to uncover all those involved in this case.         
	According to a daily, BFA vice-president Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa confirmed Bahrain went through all the correct channels in organising the match.         
	The publication went on to report a letter listed a 20-member Togo team, including each players passport number and date of birth.         
	However, a completely different list of 18 players was provided by a team official a few minutes before the start of the match.

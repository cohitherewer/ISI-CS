The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreesanth is doubtful; two asked to join
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sreesanth is doubtful; two asked to join
                      
	Colombo: Team India pacer Sreesanth is a doubtful starter for the first Test against Sri Lanka, starting July 18, in Galle, due to a knee injury. Sreesanth, asked to lead the pace attack in the absence of Zaheer Khan, missed a training session on Sunday.         
	Sreesanth underwent an MRI scan and the result will be known only on Monday, a team source said.         
	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who is down with the fever, also missed the training session.         
	Zaheer was ruled out of the Test series due to a shoulder injury and in his absence Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma are supposed to share the new ball.         
	Saurashtra left-arm pacer Jaidev Unadkat may be inducted in the squad, if the team miss the services of Sreesanth.         
	Unadkat, playing for India A, picked up 13 wickets against West Indies A on his first-class debut.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders pacer picked up 16 wickets from two first-class matches on the recently concluded A tour but is yet to play a Ranji Trophy match.         
	The youngster has been asked to join the senior team directly from England as a net bowler along with Vidarbha pacer Umesh Yadav. Wriddhiman Saha and Abhimanyu Mithun will also be joining the squad from England.         
	However, India are unlikely to go with the three pacers on slow Lankan wickets. In case, Sreesanth is available and India plan to go in with three pacers, Mithun will be first choice to fill in the slot.         
	India are scheduled to play a three-day warm-up game against Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI from Tuesday. (agencies)

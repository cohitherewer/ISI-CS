The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gattuso to call it quits
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gattuso to call it quits
                      
	Irene: Italys combative midfielder Gennaro Gattuso announced Saturday that he will retire from the national team after the World Cup. Speaking two days before the Azzurris opener against Paraguay, the 32-year-old Gatttuso said that at his age its only fair to cede space to players with more gas in their tanks.         
	Gattuso is coming off a difficult season at AC Milan, when he struggled with a problematic knee and was often relegated to a bench role.         
	Gattuso was also expected to be a bench player for Italy at this tournament, but he has a chance of starting against Paraguay on Monday due to an injury to Daniele De Rossi.         
	Gattuso was part of the starting 11 for a training match against the Gauteng All Stars on Friday, Italys final test before its opener, and he played well in the Azzurris final pre-tournament friendly against Switzerland last weekend.         
	Im coming off a difficult season but (coach Marcello) Lippi gave me a chance and it was my responsibility to show up ready, he said. Everybody knows my characteristics and I still have some hunger and desire left in me. If I didnt have the desire anymore I would tell the coach. I still have something to give.         
	When I do something Ive got to do it with enthusiasm and desire, otherwise Im a third-division player, Gattuso added, punctuating his explanations with a series of hand gestures.         
	Gattuso underwent knee surgery in December 2008 and returned a month ahead of schedule for Milans final Serie A match that season, then joined Italy for last years Confederations Cup.

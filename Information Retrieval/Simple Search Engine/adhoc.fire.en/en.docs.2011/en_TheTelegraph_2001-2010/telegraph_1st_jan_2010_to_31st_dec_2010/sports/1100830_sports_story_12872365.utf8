            A STAFF REPORTER            Ajit Pal Singh (right), the 1975 World Cup-winning captain, and Zafar Iqbal, also a former captain, in the city, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Strange are the ways of Indian hockey. The tug of war between two bodies vouching for superiority, a sex scandal, conflict with the sports ministry over election norms, selection details being leaked  the plate of controversies are already full. But think again.         
	Now, theres a situation where national selectors are of the view that coach Jose Brasa has done little to improve Indian hockey.         
	Ajit Pal Singh, who is one of the government nominees in the selection committee, blasted Brasa on Sunday.         
	He has this bad habit of creating controversies. His comments are absolutely baseless. He has been consulted during every selection meeting.         
	He has the luxury of a monthly salary of Rs 7 lakh. But where are the results? You could have got seven Indian Olympians as coach with that same amount! said Singh, on the sidelines of a function to celebrate the National Sports Day, at Town Hall, on Sunday.         
	Asked if it was time to appoint a new coach, the captain of the 1975 World Cup-winning team said: Thats not for me to decide.         
	Olympian, Zafar Iqbal, who was also present on the occasion, echoed Singh on Brasa as he said: His comments are not right. And, moreover, he hasnt delivered good results yet.         
	When reminded of Saturdays e-mail-leak of selection meeting details, Singh said: It is obvious that someone betrayed by leaking the details. It is very unfortunate.         
	Speaking on Prabhjyot Singhs omission from the squad, he said: Selectors would never dump a player if he is good enough to be selected. Prabhjyot has been out of the team for the last 7-8 months. That says it all.         
	Both Singh and Iqbal, however, were optimistic about Indias chances at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.         
	One wonders how the players will draw confidence from Brasa with so many no-confidence missiles being launched in his direction!

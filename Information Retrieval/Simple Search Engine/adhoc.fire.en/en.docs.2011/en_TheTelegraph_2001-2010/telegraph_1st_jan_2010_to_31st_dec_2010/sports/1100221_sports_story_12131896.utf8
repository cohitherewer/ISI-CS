The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selectors forced to recall Lahiri
                                                                                                                       7                                      Selectors forced to recall Lahiri
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengals twin losses, against Tripura and Orissa, in the zonal one-dayers have had their effect and now the senior selection committee finds itself under immense pressure.         
	After having recalled opener Arindam, Sambaran Banerjee Co. have been forced to include another out-of-favour senior, Sourasish Lahiri, adding the offie as the 16th member for the National one-dayers. The Bengal squad didnt have a specialist off-spinner for their zonal campaign in Cuttack.         
	Bengal U-22 captain Arnab Nandi was filling-in for the off-spinners slot but being primarily a top-order batsman he could hardly make any impact as he managed one wicket from four matches.         
	I am feeling relieved after I got the call from the chairman of selectors. He told me to join the practice at the Eden tomorrow (Sunday), a delighted Sourasish said on Saturday.         
	Earlier, in the afternoon, Sourasish met CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra to explain his alleged jibe at senior selection committee members Samabaran and Malay Banerjee recently during a local league.         
	It was learnt that the senior-pro has informally apologised for his action. Sourasish, too, was pretty satisfied with the outcome of the half-an-hour meeting with Mitra.         
	It was an informal meeting. I explained my side of the story to him (Mitra)... What exactly was my frame of mind and what I was going through then. I have told the joint secretary that my gesture was not meant for anyone (the selectors). It wasnt something deliberate. Yet, if anyone has felt bad about it, I am sorry, Sourasish said after the meeting.

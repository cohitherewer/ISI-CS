	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Club failed to extract three points against Tollygunge Agragami, in their Calcutta Football League match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	Tope Fujas men were expected to garner full points against Tollygunge Agragami, who are fighting relegation, but their goalless draw kept them fifth at the league table, below Chirag United with a game still left to play.         
	It wasnt an auspicious start for Mohammedan Sporting when Tollygunge Agragamis Crispin Chettri tested with a probing header nine minutes into the match.         
	Rakesh Prasad was alert enough to parry it and that temporarily ended the teams ordeal in the defence area.         
	The David Mkandawire-led side could have taken a 2-0 lead had Dipendu Biswas not shot it wide in the 24th minute and Satyajit Bose kept his left-footer on goal a minute later.         
	Satyajit made some gutsy moves in the first half, but his efforts went in vain due to lack of precision.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting winger was in a perfect position to slam the ball home after a misdirected header from a Tollygunge defender was begging to be punished. However, Satyajit, who had enough time to ensure the lead, sailed it wide over the woodwork.         
	Tollygunge Agragamis Kallol Pal created an opportunity in the 31st minute, but the end result was zero again as his curling ground shot went wide of the side bar.         
	The second half saw Mohammedan Sporting launch a barrage of attacks, but not once did the moves materialise due to poor finishing. Till the 84th minute, the entire Tollygunge force was crowding the defence to thwart any attack. Even veteran Dipendu Biswas failed to create any opportunity and poor passing marred their attempts.         
	Teams         
	Mohammedan Sporting: Rakesh Prasad, David Mkandawire, Etesham Bucks, Suroj Mondal (Goutam Kujor, 34), Lucky Imran, Satyajit Bose (Sarip Ali Molla, 87), Dipendu Biswas, Musibau Adebayo (Kartick Kisku, 60), Sudip Das, Adeola Hassan, Saheb Ali Gharami.

	MoM: Louis Nicri Ebami

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourasish jibe at selectors
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourasish jibe at selectors
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Axed from the Bengal one-day side, off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri had an emotional outburst in front of selectors Sambaran Banerjee and Malay Banerjee during a senior division league match at the JU (Salt Lake) ground on Friday.         
	The incident happened in the final over of the day with Mohun Bagan left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena bowling. Sourasish, playing for Kalighat, hit a six and a couple of boundaries before he was dismissed off the final ball.         
	After hitting the six, Sourasish suddenly took off his helmet and pointed his bat animatedly towards his own dressing room, shouting, I can also hit big.         
	The jibe was, however, meant at the two selectors. The two umpires Aloke Bhattacharya and Aniruddha Banerjee summoned Kalighat skipper Manoj Tiwary and warned him about his players behaviour.         
	I had heard a lot of things about my abilities as a player. I was hurt and felt terribly insulted at what happened. I just feel that senior players should be treated well. I dont deserve this, said Sourasish.         
	Malay Banerjee was furious and was thinking of taking up the matter with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya. This is something I wont forget in a hurry. What are juniors like Sudip Chatterjee, Sayan Sekhar Mondal learning from a senior like him? he fumed.         
	Elsewhere, Eastern Railway captain Kanchan Maity threw the ball at umpire Rabi Shankar Chakraborty during their match against Suburban. Maity was apparently upset with the substitution restrictions enforced by Chakraborty. The umpire escaped unhurt.

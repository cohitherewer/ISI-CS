                                                                                                                       7                                      Katich and Broad out with injuries
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England fast bowler Stuart Broad has been ruled out of the remainder of England s tour of Australia  including the current Ashes series and the forthcoming one-day International series  due to a torn abdominal muscle suffered during the second Test, in Adelaide.         
	Australia opener Simon Katich, too, will not be taking further part in the Ashes as he is suffering from an Achilles tendon injury.         
	Broad will return to home shortly to begin rehabilitation and recovery with a view to preparing for Englands ICC World Cup campaign, in February 2011, said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), in a statement, Tuesday.         
	According to England chief medical officer, Dr Nick Peirce: Stuart has a torn abdominal muscle and as such will take no further part in the current Ashes tour of Australia. Given the nature of the injury Stuart has been ruled out of the forthcoming ODI series against Australia as well.         
	On the other hand, Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris, speaking on Katichs injury said: Simon Katich has struggled through the second Test match with an Achilles tendon injury that became increasingly painful during the fielding innings.         
	Based on Simons current symptoms and results of a scan undertaken last night (Monday), it is unlikely that he will be available to play any further part in the Ashes Series.

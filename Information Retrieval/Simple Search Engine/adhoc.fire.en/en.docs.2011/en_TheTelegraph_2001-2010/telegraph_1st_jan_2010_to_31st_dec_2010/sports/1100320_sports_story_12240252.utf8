The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yusuf is under no pressure 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yusuf is under no pressure 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                      
	Ahmedabad: Yusuf Pathan, who smashed a 100 off only 37 balls, in Rajasthan Royals opener against the Mumbai Indians, is praying for a good start on Saturday.         
	In two of our three matches, we just havent had an opening stand... Unless a platform is raised, how can the middle-order play freely? Opening mein runs chahiye... Hopefully, things will fall in place against the (Kolkata) Knight Riders, Yusuf told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking briefly at The Courtyard Marriott late on Friday evening, Yusuf added: Injuries (to Graeme Smith, for example) havent helped... Weve lost all matches, but one game may turn things around...         
	Yusuf, who has been dismissed by a bowler only once (run out on the other occasions), insisted he wasnt under pressure. Im trying to enjoy my cricket... Pressure ka sawaal nahin hai...         
	Fine performances in the first edition of the IPL, in 2008, earned Yusuf his maiden ODI call-up. Hes hoping for even better things after edition No.3.         
	Yusuf, 27, first made headlines when Team India annexed the inaugural World T20, in 2007. Hed been a member of the XI that September evening.         
	Then, in last years IPL, Yusuf hit KKR for a six in the Super Over, which was enforced in the first clash between the two.         
	A few days ago came that hurricane of a hundred, the fastest in the IPL, in Mumbai. Clearly, Yusuf loves to make an impact.         
	Whatever the Royals form, KKR need to be wary of Irfans elder brother.

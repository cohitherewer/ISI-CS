The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now or never for misfiring England
                                                                                                                       7                                        Now or never for misfiring England
                  John Terry during a training session, on Tuesday                     
	Port Elizabeth: Englands World Cup campaign is in tatters with crisis meetings, furious fans, misfiring strikers and splits in the camp and a win against Slovenia on Wednesday is their only hope of salvation.         
	In less than two weeks, England have gone from talented contenders to sulking underachievers, presenting unfashionable newcomers Slovenia with a chance to top the standings and revel in the sinking their famous Group C rivals.         
	Slovenia, who failed to reach the second round on their debut as an independent nation in 2002, lead the group on four points followed by the United States and England on two and Algeria, who play the U.S. in Pretoria, with one. A draw will be enough for them to enter the knock-out stage.         
	Typically, the England camp insists all is well, the players are united and fully behind their coach Fabio Capello, but the worst-kept secret is that the Italians team selection and strict adherence to a 4-4-2 formation is troubling the squad.         
	Whether the no-nonsense Capello cares what his players think remains to be seen but he has promised changes to an uninspiring side packed with in-form players who have shone in the Premier League but struggled in an England shirt.         
	Midfielder Frank Lampard was the first to admit it.         
	We have to play (here) with that pace and passion that we have every week at home, he said.         
	Defender John Terry spoke like the captain he no longer is in his efforts to show the team was united, determined and that the cloud hanging over them would soon pass.         
	Were here supporting and fully behind (Capello) and have his support as well, Terry said. Thats the main thing and we just have to stick together and get that win and stay unified.         
	Were going to get into the game, were going to win the game and well go through.                     Capello keeps his cards close to his chest but could move captain Steven Gerrard into an attacking role in support of troubled striker Wayne Rooney, with Joe Cole brought into the midfield to replace misfiring marksman Emile Heskey.         
	Jamie Carragher, who came in for the injured Ledley King, misses the game through suspension and will be replaced by Matthew Upson in the centre of defence.         
	Slovenia are the unexpected leaders of a group that was regarded as the weakest of the eight. They are on the verge of making the second round at a major tournament for the first time after early exits from Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup.         
	But the Slovenia team has its own troubles to contend with and have lost forward Nejc Pecnik, who fractured his ankle in the 2-2 draw with the U.S. having come on in the second half.         
	Likely Teams         
	England (4-4-2): 1-David James, 2-Glen Johnson, 6-John Terry, 15-Matthew Upson, 3-Ashley Cole, 7-Aaron Lennon, 8-Frank Lampard, 14-Gareth Barry, 11-Joe Cole, 4-Steven Gerrard, 10-Wayne Rooney         
	Slovenia (4-4-2): 1-Samir Handanovic, 2-Miso Brecko, 4-Marko Suler, 5-Bostjan Cesar, 13-Bojan Jokic, 10-Valter Birsa, 8-Robert Koren, 18-Aleksandar Radosavljevic, 17-Andraz Kirm, 14-Zlatko Dedic, 11-Milivoje Novakovic

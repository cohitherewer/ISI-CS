The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jadeja needs to bat well, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jadeja needs to bat well, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni feels that not having a genuine all-rounder is a big concern for the team. Dhoni spoke to the mediapersons on the eve of their Asia Cup final against Sri Lanka.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His take on teams bench strength         
	This is a learning curve for the players. Some young players have got chance here. The more they play, the better for us.         
	If the inexperience is hurting the balance of the side         
	In Zimbabawe, we were criticized for resting all the senior players. If we would have done that here, then the same question would have cropped up. So here we tried to put up a well- balanced team. Also we wanted to rest a few key players.         
	Missing out on a genuine all-rounder         
	Its a big concern (lack of an all-rounder), and if you want to play with five bowlers, you need one of them to do well with the bat.         
	Ravindra Jadejas role         
	Ravindra Jadeja has got the potential. He has shown that during the IPL and domestic games. Now he has got fair amount of chances at the international level too. We are hoping that he clicks. He has bowled well and can be called a specialist bowler. Now, he needs to contribute more with the bat as well.         
	He is the kind of guy who can give you stability at No. 6 or 7. There are not many players who can fit in that position. When he came into the team, he was more of a batsman who can bowl. But now he has turned into more of a specialist bowler.He bowls at the death, he bowls during the Powerplays, so I think he is the best potential we can turn into an all-rounder.

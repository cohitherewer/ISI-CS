The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venkys hatch realistic plan
                                                                                                                       7                                        Venkys hatch realistic plan
  - Blackburns prospective new owners mull taking players on loan       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Sam Allardyce                                 
	London: Blackburns prospective new owners have warned fans to have realistic expectations about their takeover. If the Rovers fans are hoping to see their team splash money on new players in next years transfer window, they are likely to be disappointed as the Indian company set to buy it are expected to spend only 5million for the purpose.         
	Venkateshwara Hatcheries, popularly known as Venkys, Tuesday moved closer to becoming the first Indian owners of a Premier League team in a 46 million deal.         
	Blackburn Rovers manager Sam Allardyce has already welcomed the prospect of fresh investment, but although Venkys have vowed to pump in additional money to get the club back into good shape, they do not appear willing to splash the money on high-profile names.         
	VH Group chairperson Anuradha Desai said: We wont need to buy expensive players, we can always lease (loan) them.         
	That means that Blackburn is unlikely to break its nine-year-old transfer record any time soon. Blackburn paid Manchester United 8million for striker Andy Cole in December 2001, but has since spent more than 5million on a player only twice.         
	Desai has also set a realistic goal for the club, which currently lies 17th in the Premier League, outside the relegation zone on goal difference.         
	We dont expect to be in the top five of the Premier League. We will be happy to be in the top 10-12, she said.         
	The 47-year-old, however, insisted the company did not have any financial issues.         
	The club has no major losses... That is not a major financial issue nor does it have accumulated debt, she said.         
	We will pump in whatever is needed but the main thing is to get the club back into good shape. This is an investment and it will grow on its own strength.         
	She also said that some companies were already showing interest in shirt sponsorship to which her company was open to as we need to turn around the club.         
	Football is a global craze and as the VH Group globalises, setting up feed plants and hatcheries around the world, we believe we can benefit from being owners of a major football club. It will help build our brand, she said.         
	Venkys managing director B. Venkatesh Rao said the completion of the takeover would be announced within 10 days.         
	Manchester United, Aston Villa, Sunderland and Liverpool are owned by Americans, while Chelsea, Manchester City, Birmingham and Fulham also have non-British owners.         
	Rovers are the only side outside of the big four of Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool to have won the EPL title in 1995. Since then the club has been largely mediocre and was put up for sale two years ago by the Jack Walker Trust.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena   to give   US Open a miss
                                                                                                                       7                                      Serena   to give   US Open a miss
            John Branch                                  
	Serena Williams will not play in the US Open because of a lingering foot injury. Serena, the top-ranked womens player in the world and a three-time champion at the Open, called the withdrawal one of the most devastating moments of my career.         
	It will be the first time in the 35-year history of the computerised rankings that the No. 1 player will miss the Open, according to the Womens Tennis Association.         
	Serena, 28, sliced her right foot on a piece of broken glass at a restaurant in Munich last month, a few days after winning her fourth Wimbledon singles title. She had surgery in mid-July and has not played since.         
	At last years Open, Serena lost to the eventual champion Kim Clijsters in the semi-finals, a match remembered mostly for her climactic tirade against a line judge who called a foot fault.         
	It is with much frustration and deep sadness that I am having to pull out of the US Open, Serena said in a statement released by her publicist. My doctors have advised against my playing so that my foot can heal.         
	Andy Roddick, the 2003 Open mens champion, was surprised that Serena, the winner of 13 Grand Slam singles titles, withdrew more than a week before the tournament.         
	The US Open is probably her favourite event, so if shes this far out and is not going to play, its got to be something pretty serious, Roddick said at a mens tournament in Mason.         
	The absence of Serena will open the tournament to a broader group of contenders.         
	Among those whose chances of winning increased was Venus Williams, who has not won a Grand Slam event other than Wimbledon since the 2001 US Open. But she is ailing, too, having pulled out of tournaments in Mason and Montreal to treat a nagging knee injury.         
	Injuries may be a recurring theme for the women. On Friday in Montreal, Clijsters hobbled through a third set with a hip injury and lost to Vera Zvonareva.         
	We regret that Serena Williams is unable to play the US Open and wish her a speedy recovery, the tournament director, Jim Curley, said in a statement.         
	The lasting image from last year may be Serenas verbal assault of a line judge near the end of her taut match with Clijsters. Serving late in the match, she was called for a foot fault. Angered, she turned and stepped toward the female judge, held up a ball and, with profanity, said she would shove it down her throat.         
	The episode cost Serena a code violation on what would have been match point, so the match ended without another ball put in play. Clijsters won, 6-4, 7-5, then beat Caroline Wozniacki in the final.         
	In late November, she was fined a record $82,500 by the Grand Slam committee and warned that she would be suspended from the tournament if she had other major offenses at a Grand Slam event in 2010 or 2011. She eventually apologised for her inappropriate outburst on her website and Twitter page.         
	Im devastated to not be participating in the Open, she wrote. Grand Slams are my life. My soul. ... I will miss it more than u can ever imagine.         
	Meanwhile, Juan Martin del Potro will not defend his US Open crown because he is not ready to compete after having surgery on his right wrist.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

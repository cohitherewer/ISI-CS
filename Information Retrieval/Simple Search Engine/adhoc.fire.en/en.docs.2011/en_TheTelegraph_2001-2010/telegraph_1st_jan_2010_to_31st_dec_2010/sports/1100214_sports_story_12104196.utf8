                                                                                                                       7                                      An offer for Dhoni with a difference
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Dont be surprised if Mahendra Singh Dhoni becomes possibly the first brand ambassador of a police force!         
	Wowed by the Team India captains down-to-earth demeanour, unbelievable patience and his passion for bikes of a particular model being used by the Calcutta police, joint commissioner, HQ, Jawed Shamim, invited him to be the forces brand ambassador.         
	Among the most visible of faces on the star-spangled endorsements market, Dhoni actually appeared to be game. Yes, I could be one, he quipped.         
	Shamim made the offer during Dhonis visit to the Police Athletic Club tent on the Maidan, a couple of hundred metres from the Eden, on Saturday afternoon.         
	As it was on Friday night, when Dhoni made a trip to the police HQ (Lalbazar), the purpose was to view another classic bike, which has been off the production lines for almost two decades.         
	The one Dhoni saw at the tent serves as a pilot for the states governor. Its an amazing machine and maintained so beautifully... I need to maintain my bikes as well, Dhoni told The Telegraph.         
	He had words of appreciation for the sergeant, Prosenjit Chatterjee, who rides the bike and is responsible for its upkeep.         
	Dhonis visit to the tent actually coincided with the conclusion of a limited overs match between the Calcutta police and Bharat Petroleum, an annual feature, so he couldnt avoid being mobbed even in police territory.         
	Before being shown the bike (and encouraged to take a ride on the badminton court), Dhoni was presented a silver salver by the police commissioner, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	A German silver mug on Friday and a silver salver on Saturday... Dhonis off the field collection has quickly grown. Now, defeating South Africa, at the Eden, is what hes thirsting for.         
	The mug may then be put to very good use.

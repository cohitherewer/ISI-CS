The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | FIA lifts ban on team orders
                                                                                                                       7                                      FIA lifts ban on team orders
                      
	London: Formula One has lifted a ban on the so-called team orders which caused a huge controversy at the German Grand Prix this year when Ferrari used them to allow Fernando Alonso to win.         
	The decision, announced by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) on Friday, will dismay some fans while others will feel such tactics have always been part of the sport and should be recognised.         
	It is only fitting that Jean Todt should preside over the legalising of Formula Ones controversial team orders, having triggered the ban in the first place. Since 2002, team orders had been outlawed, but never really went away         
	The FIA did warn, however, that blatant action early in the season could still be punished.         
	Teams will be reminded that any actions liable to bring the sport into disrepute are dealt with under Article 151c of the International Sporting Code and any other relevant provisions, the body said in a statement.         
	FIA also announced that Formula One will switch to greener 1.6 litre turbocharged engines from 2013 while in a major revamp of the technical and sporting rules drivers will also be allowed to use a moveable rear wing next season.         
	The widely anticipated new engine rules were the most far-reaching development in line with the FIAs determination to make the sport more environmentally friendly.         
	The current cars are powered by 2.4 litre V8 engines, themselves down from the fuel-guzzling 3.0 litre V10s and V12s of previous generations.         
	The FIA, whose World Motor Sport Council met in Monaco, said that the new specification engine would underline a commitment to improving sustainability and addressing the needs of the automotive industry.         
	Following dialogue with the engine manufacturers and experts in this field, the power units will be four cylinders, 1.6 litre with high pressure gasoline injection up to 500 bar with a maximum of 12,000 rpm, it added.         
	The FIA said the new engines would deliver a 35 per cent reduction in fuel consumption as well as featuring extensive energy management and energy recovery systems. Current engines are rev limited to 18,000 rpm.         
	At the same time, they would maintain current levels of performance.         
	Each driver will be allowed five engines in 2013, but that allocation will be reduced to four from 2014. This year, with 19 races, they were allowed a maximum of eight with a penalty of 10 places on the starting grid for any additional units.         
	In other changes, bodywork regulations were tightened and stewards handed new penalties to apply to drivers. Gearboxes will have to last for five consecutive races, instead of four, or incur a penalty.         
	From 2012, team communications during the race will be made available to broadcasters.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arindam may be let off lightly
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arindam may be let off lightly
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Arindam      
	Calcutta: The AIFF disciplinary committee may not hand out a harsh punishment to Churchill Brothers custodian Arindam Bhattacharya who was involved in an ugly brawl with Mohun Bagan supporters during his teams I-League match at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.         
	The AIFF disciplinary committee on Saturday decided to showcause Arindam for his poor conduct. The India international tried to rough up a Bagan supporter after a stone from the stands hit Churchills Nigerian midfielder Ogba Kalu.         
	The committee expects Arindam to tender an unconditional apology and promise that he wouldnt get involved in such unwanted controversies in future. The committee is expected to reprimand him but nothing more than that. At the most, he may get a very nominal financial penalty, a senior AIFF official informed on Sunday.         
	He is an upcoming talent and everyone considers him to be one for the future. He will be told in no uncertain terms that a repetition may mean an end to his football career. But everyone deserves a second chance and Arindam is no exception, he added.

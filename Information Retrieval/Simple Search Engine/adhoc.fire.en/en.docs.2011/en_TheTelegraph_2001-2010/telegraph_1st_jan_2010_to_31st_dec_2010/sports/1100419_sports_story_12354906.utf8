                                                                                                                       7                                      Bowlers showed guts: Gilly
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: The Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist, said at the press conference, that he was confident of reaching the semi-finals even though his team could manage only 145 runs against the Delhi DareDevils.         
	Knowing the nature of the pitch, we always thought 145 was a decent score, said Gilchrist. Today (Sunday), the match kept on fluctuating and at one point of time, when (Andrew) Symonds and (Mitchell) Marsh were batting, I expected to reach 170.         
	Symondss innings was a gem, but he got out a little early and we could not reach the desired target. When the DareDevils came out to bat, our aim was to stop the boundaries in the first six overs and pick up as many wickets as possible. We did a good job and won the match. The bowlers showed a lot of courage and character. It (the knockout stage) is like a new tournament from here on and are looking forward to do well.                   
	Asked about the recent controversies in the IPL, the former Australian wicketkeeper said he wasnt really able to follow it. Its very difficult to follow as it keeps on changing, said Gilchrist. So we decided to ignore it. Let the cricket be played and let the cricket speak for itself, added the veteran player.         
	Gilchrist also said that he wasnt too bothered about the blast outside the stadium in Bangalore on Saturday. We have spoken to people who are in charge of security in the IPL. We have been told that it happened outside the stadium. I know there is a system in place and there are people to take care of it, he said.         
	Man of the Match Symonds said that he was disappointed with the timing of his dismissal. I was really disappointed with my dismissal. I should have continued a little longer. But Im pleased with way the boys played We may not be the most skilful side, we always try to give our best, the Australian said.         
	The DareDevils captain Gautam Gambhir blamed the whole team for not reaching the final. We had to win only two of the last four matches and we couldnt even do that.

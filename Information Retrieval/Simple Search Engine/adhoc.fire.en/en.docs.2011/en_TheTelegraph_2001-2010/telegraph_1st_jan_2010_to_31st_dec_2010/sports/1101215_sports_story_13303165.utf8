	Calcutta: Defending champions Indian Oil set up a summit showdown with Air India, after both teams registered easy victories in their respective semi-final ties of the Coal India 115th All-India Beighton Cup hockey tournament, at the SAI complex, on Tuesday.         
	Indian Oil ousted last years runners-up South Central Railway 4-1 in the first semi-final.         
	Air India rode on a hattrick by Victo Singh to thrash Punjab SC 5-1 in the other last-four tie of the tournament.         
	Prabhjot Singh began the proceedings for the defending champions.         
	While the India forward scored in the 20th minute, Innocent Kullu restored parity via a penalty stroke 10 minutes later.         
	However, Hamza Mustafas 49th minute conversion set the right tone for Indian Oil.         
	Then, nine minutes later, Affan Yousuf made it 3-1, while PR Raghunath gave a perfect finish when he converted off a penalty in the 61st minute.         
	In the other tie, barring Bittos hattrick, Vikram Pillai (10th) and AB Cheeyana (63rd) scored for Air India.         
	Manish Rana (25th) scored for the Punjab outfit.         
	Air India had earlier beaten Karnataka XI 4-0 in their quarter final league match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Why Berdych is the braveheart
                                                                                                                       7                                      Why Berdych is the braveheart
            Greg Bishop                       
	London: The mens singles finalists at Wimbledon got that far despite opposing styles, pedigrees and strengths.         
	One, almost everyone has heard of: the fearsome Rafael Nadal of Spain, winner of seven Grand Slam titles, owner of the No. 1 ranking and the most physical, punishing groundstrokes in the game.         
	The other, few had heard of until recently: the fearless Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic, armed with an enviable serve and headed to his first major championship final.         
	Both won their semi-final matches in straight sets Friday, but career statistics tilt heavily toward Nadal in matches won (194 more), titles won (35 more) and money earned (some $25 million more). But Berdych faced similar odds earlier this week  and then beat the second- and third-ranked players in the world. Rafa is the favourite, said Andy Murray, who lost to Nadal in three close sets. Hes the best player in the world. He hasnt lost here.         
	Still, for nearly two weeks now, Berdych has not appeared capable of crumbling. He played as if fear  of Roger Federer, of Centre Court and, on Friday, of Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals  had never entered his mind. For years, Berdych fought against the prevailing notion that he was fragile, that he came up smallest in the moments that mattered most. Occasionally, he tantalised with his talent, with that enviable serve, those gorgeous groundstrokes, his propensity for risks.         
	But only in the last month has Berdych emerged as an elite player, a true threat. He made the semi-finals at the French Open, then knocked out Federer in the quarter finals here, then topped that upset with another Friday, a 6-3, 7-6 (9), 6-3 dismantling Djokovic. Im still not done here, Berdych said. One more to go.         
	Earlier in the week, he became the first player from the Czech Republic to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals since Ivan Lendl in 1990. Berdych had never advanced to a major championship final and had not reached a semi-final until last month.         
	Berdych won with style, with big serves and with free swings. He was rewarded for risks taken. In his quarter final, Berdych overwhelmed Federer, the top seed and six-time champion, with groundstrokes sent low, at great speeds, and with that serve, which he often aimed at Federers body, jamming him.         
	Berdych dismissed those who considered his rise meteoric, saying he did not feel nor prepare that differently. This from a man who, when asked to name his hobbies, listed only a good sleep.         
	He said the current run started earlier, at the beginning of the year, with less-celebrated victories in smaller tournaments, at Indian Wells and in Miami. He said it came from experience, from losses, from stronger focus and better mental preparation.         
	Meanwhile, Murray called Nadal the best player in the world and one of the best players ever. His scouting report included backhand is good and serves well and forehands good and movement is good.         
	Murray twice said he loved watching Nadal play, and added that Nadal was his favourite player to watch.         
	Nadal seems to have returned to his 2008 form, when he looked like the games best player, before knee injuries sidelined him and Federer reclaimed the top ranking. On Friday, Nadal said he struggled at points last year, especially in the second half.         
	But recently, Nadal snatched back the top ranking and resumed his dominance on clay. Here, he also shrugged off an aching right knee and will enter Sundays final as a heavy favourite. Last July, an injured Nadal watched Federer and Andy Roddick play five epic sets. A beautiful match, Nadal called it.         
	On Sunday, he will return, when the expected contender meets the unexpected challenger and Wimbledon hopes for its fourth fantastic final in a row.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

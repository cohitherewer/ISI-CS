The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Liverpool, Chelsea shown the door
                                                                                                                       7                                      Liverpool, Chelsea shown the door
                      
	London: Liverpools season went from bad to worse as they were shocked by fourth-tier side Northampton in the third round of the League Cup, on a night fellow Premier League giants Chelsea and Manchester City were also knocked out.         
	Manchester United won 5-2 at Scunthorpe, and had no problems going through. Liverpool, who are fifth from bottom in the EPL, lost 4-2 on penalties Wednesday, in the teeming rain at Anfield, to the lowest-ranked team left in the competition to pile more pressure on manager Roy Hodgson.         
	Newcastle upset Chelsea 4-3 following a last-minute strike by Shola Ameobi, the strikers second goal of the night, and West Bromwich Albion came from behind to beat City 2-1 through goals by Gianni Zuiverloon and Simon Cox.         
	But the biggest shock of the night came at the home of the seven-time League Cup winners and 18-time English champions, who rested most of their main players for a match they were expected to win comfortably.         
	Northampton are eighth from bottom in the lowest championship in the Football League but belied their status by earning arguably the biggest win in the clubs history.         
	Liverpool went ahead thanks to Milan Jovanovics angled drive but Billy McKay sent the match into extra time with a 56th-minute close-range goal. Michael Jacobs put the visitors ahead in the first half of extra time and although David Ngog equalised to force penalties, Northampton went through, thanks to Abdul Osmans decisive spot-kick.

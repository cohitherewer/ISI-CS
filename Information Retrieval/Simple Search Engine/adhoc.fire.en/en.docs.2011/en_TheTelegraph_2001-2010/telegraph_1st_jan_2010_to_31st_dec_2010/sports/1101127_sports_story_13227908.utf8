The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hussey holds the fort

	It was an archetypal day of Test cricket. To the unbeliever, nothing happened. To the initiated, everything happened. In the fog of war some of the most fascinating individual battles were waged.         
	Outstanding duels were fought during the first two hot sessions of the second day at the Gabba, notably Mike Hussey against Graeme Swann, but some of the battles were not duels at all. Michael Clarke fought his bad back, and lost. James Anderson fought his temperament, and won.         
	At stumps on the second day, Australia were 220 for five. Hussey was batting on 81, in the company of Brad Haddin who was unbeaten on 22.         
	Anderson had appeared despondent on the first evening when England bowled, after being dismissed for 260. Bowlers tend to such feelings when they think their batsmen have let the side and not given the bowlers enough runs to play with.         
	On Friday morning Anderson continued to bowl from the Vulture Street end and found none of the swing that Australias pace bowlers had done.         
	Then Anderson switched ends and moods. He got into the game. He grew angry not despondent. He became confident that he belonged in this series  and few swing bowlers have visited Australia and acquired that confidence.         
	All the luck of the morning went against England, including a couple of television reviews, but they persevered  and Anderson was rewarded when, after an opening stand of 78 had eaten deep into Englands precious supply of runs, Shane Watson nicked the Lancastrian to first slip. Andrew Strauss did a brief jig of celebration.         
	In one instalment after lunch all of Englands ill luck of the morning secured compensation. Ricky Pontings trademark is a century in the first innings of Ashes series. This time he was only a zero, or 90 runs, short. He was strangled, caught down the legside off the faintest of glances against Anderson, for 10.

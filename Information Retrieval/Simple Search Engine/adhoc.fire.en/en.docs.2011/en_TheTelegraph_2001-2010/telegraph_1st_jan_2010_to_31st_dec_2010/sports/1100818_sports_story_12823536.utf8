The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SLC is all set to act firmly
                                                                                                                       7                                        SLC is all set to act firmly
    - Apologies from the Board secretary, Randiv; interim body meets today           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Virender Sehwag                                 
	Calcutta: Three decades after Greg Chappell directed younger brother Trevor to bowl the last delivery of an ODI underarm, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is in a bind over Suraj Randivs no ball, on the final delivery, in Dambulla, on Monday night.         
	The issue has reached SLCs all-powerful interim committee, which is to hold its fortnightly meeting, in Colombo, on Wednesday.         
	Randiv, who is fairly inexperienced, didnt do anything unlawful, but definitely violated the spirit of the game. Of course, it may be argued that there have been umpteen instances of poor sportsmanship.         
	Greg took the cake, though, as New Zealand were prevented from trying to hit a six, thereby forcing a tie, in Melbourne.         
	Be it Melbourne or Dambulla, the actions of Trevor and Randiv have only confirmed a view held very strongly by Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi  that cricket ought not to be linked with the gentleman bit.         
	Indeed, in Pataudis opinion, cricket has never been a gentlemans game.         
	Its for the committee to take things forward... Weve received the report of the team manager (former captain Anura Tennekoon) and that will be placed before its members, SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga told The Telegraph.         
	That was on Tuesday evening.         
	Severely embarrassed by Randivs act, when Virender Sehwag was on 99 and Team India one run short of winning, SLC wants to act firmly. Not least because it doesnt want relations with the Board of Control for Cricket in India to take a hit.         
	The interim committee, one learns, can recommend a fine or a ban or both.         
	Stung by Sehwags it was a deliberate no ball attack, SLC directed Tennekoon to conduct an immediate internal inquiry as it was necessary to clear the good name of Sri Lanka cricket on a priority basis.         
	Sri Lanka, it may be recalled, won the ICCs Spirit of Cricket award twice in a row, under Mahela Jayawardene, in 2007 and 2008. New Zealand prevented a hat-trick.         
	Now, after the infamous last delivery in Dambulla, theres absolutely no chance of Sri Lanka winning back that award, during the 2010 function  in Bangalore, on October 6.         
	Theres no confirmation, but the buzz is that Tillekaratne Dilshan probably advised Randiv to bowl a no ball. Then, theres been talk of captain Kumar Sangakkara himself being the in-the-background villain, but thats highly unlikely.         
	Surely, if he was involved, Sangakkara wouldnt have condemned the act publicly, knowing that post-mortems would be done.         
	What Ranatunga did say is that SLC had left it to Tennekoon to take every help possible  including audio from the stump microphones  in compiling the report.         
	That appears significant, but cricketers have become smart.         
	Randiv has, however, apologised to Sehwag. He did so by going to the Team India vice-captains room, soon after everybody got back from the stadium.         
	Sehwag said as much on his Twitter page.         
	Ranatunga, too, has apologised. He conveyed that, on behalf of SLC, to manager Ranjib Biswal.         
	Virus fine now... As you know, hes the carefree type... He was initially disappointed at being denied a hundred (his 13th in ODIs), but is okay... Ive also conveyed to him the apology tendered by Nishantha... Hed called me in the morning, Biswal informed, when contacted at the team hotel (resort, actually).         
	Laughing, he added: Im playing the role of a diplomat, too.         
	Biswal has been having his hands full  from the pub brawl in St Lucia, during the World T20, to this drama on the final delivery.

	London: Andy Flower has told Salman Butt to mind his own business after the Pakistan captain backed Australia to deny England a successful defence of the Ashes.         
	Butts men beat England by four wickets at the Oval on Saturday to reduce the hosts series lead to 2-1 ahead of the fourth and final Test, starting at Lords, on Thursday.         
	Pakistan drew 1-1 in a two-Test series against Australia in England last month and Butt was unequivocal when asked by reporters at the Oval, whom he favoured to win the Ashes series, which starts in Brisbane in November.         
	The Aussies are much better players in their own conditions, Butt said.         
	However, England coach Flower, speaking on Sunday, said: Salman Butt shouldnt really be making judgements about our bowlers in Australia. Of course, if the ball doesn;t swing at any venue, (fast) bowlers will be less dangerous. Thats perfectly obvious.         
	Meanwhile, Flower wants a show of faith in the top-order to be rewarded with a much improved batting display at Lords.         
	Yorkshire seamer Tim Bresnan was the only addition on Sunday to the England team beaten at the Oval. That means England are set to field an unchanged top order at Lords and Flower wants that vote of confidence rewarded after a poor display.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi: Fresh from their 40-run triumph over the Kolkata Knight Riders, Gautam Gambhirs Delhi DareDevils will host Rajasthan Royals in a crucial Indian Premier League match at the Kotla on Wednesday.         
	The Rajasthan Royals and the Delhi DareDevils have eight points each. Given the fact that they are placed third and fourth, respectively, in the tournament, both teams would go all out on Wednesday to strengthen their chances of entering the semi-finals.         
	The DareDevils were convincing winners when the two teams met for the first time in Ahmedabad with Virender Sehwag hitting 75 off 34 deliveries. Things, however, have changed since then .         
	Like the DareDevils, their opponents, too, have a batting line-up that is capable of blowing away any attack. If Yusuf Pathan remains the main attraction for his ability to score almost at will with huge sixes, wicketkeeper-batsman Naman Ojha has also displayed similar qualities during his knock of 80 against the Chennai Super Kings.         
	To cap it all, the Rajasthan Royals have Shane Warne, one of the icons of modern day cricket, as the skipper.         
	We had beaten Delhi in the semi-finals in 2008 and we would look to do the same again, Warne said of Wednesdays match.

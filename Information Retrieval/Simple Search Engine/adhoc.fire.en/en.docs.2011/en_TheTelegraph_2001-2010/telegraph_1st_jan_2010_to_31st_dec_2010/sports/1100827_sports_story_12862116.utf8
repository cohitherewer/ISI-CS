    - I wish Elin the best in everything, says Tiger woods           Thomas Kaplan            Tiger Woods during practice, in New Jersey, on Wednesday                                 
	Paramus: Tiger Woods stood before reporters at the Ridgewood Country Club on Wednesday and for two minutes answered the kinds of questions that golfers are used to answering. The course played long, he said; he drove well.         
	Then came the kinds of questions that Woods admitted have made playing golf this summer almost impossible at times.         
	Does he still love his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, whose face is splashed across the cover of this weeks People magazine? Has he been able to avoid being distracted by their divorce proceedings, which were completed Monday?         
	No, Woods said to the second question, confirming what has been obvious to anyone who has seen him string together a summer of wayward tee shots and off-kilter putts.         
	It was a lot more difficult than I was letting on, he said.         
	Woods said that the repeated questions about his personal life, the distraction of going through a divorce and the sadness that goes along with it have made playing golf an almost impossible task.         
	As far as my game and practising, thats been secondary, he said. Were trying to get our kids situated to our new living conditions and how thats going to be. Thats where our focus is going to be right now.         
	Woodss comments came a few hours after People published an interview with Nordegren, who had not spoken publicly since Woodss car accident last November led to revelations of his infidelity.         
	In the People interview, the product of four visits to her Florida home spanning 19 hours, Nordegren said she never suspected that Woods was being unfaithful to her.         
	She described feeling absolute shock and disbelief upon learning of his infidelity and said she began losing her hair before the divorce proceedings concluded.         
	Ive been through hell, she said. Its hard to think you have this life, and then all of a sudden  was it a lie? Youre struggling because it wasnt real. But I survived. It was hard, but it didnt kill me.         
	Nordegren refused to disclose to People the amount of the divorce settlement. What she did emphasise was that she never hit Woods and that she did everything she could to get him out of the SUV he crashed into a fire hydrant and a tree outside their house.         
	To think anything else is absolutely wrong, she said.         
	Asked for his reaction to her comments, Woods expressed contrition, although he did not answer the question about whether he still loved Nordegren. I wish her the best in everything, he said. Its a sad time in our lives.         
	Sadness was the theme of Woodss remarks; in the 10 minutes he spoke to reporters, Woods used the word or a variant of it five times.         
	He acknowledged that his personal troubles had hung over him on the golf course at times, saying that there have been tournaments where the distractions from his off-the-course problems were almost too much to deal with. (Most of the summer was like that, he said.)         
	Concentrating on his shots has been a challenge at times, Woods said, as has dealing with daily questions about his personal life, even in the midst of a tournament.         
	But he took responsibility for the divorce.         
	My actions certainly led us to this decision, he said. And Ive certainly made a lot of errors in my life, and thats something Im going to have to live with.         
	Woods said that he was continuing to work with the swing coach Sean Foley and that he was still weighing whether to change his swing, which he described as an undertaking that I have to wrap my head around.         
	If nothing else, the last few days have marked another milepost in Woodss obsessed-over journey to reclaim his long-held position as the worlds best golfer.         
	With their divorce proceedings finished and with Nordegren and Woods both having answered questions about them, it remains to be seen whether Woods will take to the course this weekend with a clearer head.         
	Woods was asked Wednesday if he felt any relief or any remorse now that his divorce was final.         
	I dont think thats the word, he said. I think its just more sadness. Because I dont think you ever  you dont ever go into a marriage looking to get divorced. Thats the thing. Thats why it is sad.                   NYT NEWS SERVICE

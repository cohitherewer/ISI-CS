The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maria loses attitude, but wins admirers 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Maria loses attitude, but wins admirers 
            Oliver Brown            Maria Sharapova                           
	Mercifully, Maria Sharapova is losing her affectations. At Wimbledons past she has irked many with her grand royal waves, stroppy put-downs, and feathery white outfits that would have looked better on a swan. It seems that winning a grand slam at 17 can do that to a girl.         
	Of course, she still conducted her victory press conference on Saturday night with a certain hauteur, matching her Nike gym top with a designer bag so capacious it was technically a sack. She also scrupulously refused to say anything whatsoever of interest about herself, her game or her opponent.         
	It used to be worse. Any question of the vaguest impudence was once treated with the type of disdain a teenage girl might muster if her mother scorned her boyfriend. But her demeanour on court at least showed a greater spontaneity, and fewer ostentatious hair flicks.         
	No, it was Sharapovas third-round victim who had the attitude problem.         
	Barbora Zahlavova Strycova  try pronouncing that name while sober  could barely lose a point without flouncing in disgust, or making another ludicrous Hawkeye challenge. The pity for the Czech was that her play appeared good enough to beat Sharapova, who made 35 unforced errors, a total she can ill afford to repeat if she has any hope of beating Serena Williams Monday.         
	It may be too romantic to expect that Sharapova can emulate her exploits of 2004, when she outwitted the weapons of Serena with her balletic 17 year-olds poise. Most expect her to be marmalised by the American, and even she had the modesty to concede that her relationship with the world No. 1 would only be a rivalry if I won more. Reflecting on that age of innocence six years ago, Sharapova said: There are always wonderful memories. But when you step out on court, its new. Youve got to start from scratch. The score is zero-zero.         
	At that age when youre just playing a few tournaments, not many people know about you or your game. Ive been around the tour for many years. So I think Serena and I know each others game pretty well.         
	Sharapova has endured a truncated season as a result of a troublesome shoulder injury, and her movement continues to be somewhat staccato. So it was against Zahlavova Strycova, her unseeded adversary, but she still produced the decisive shots when called upon to seal a 7-5, 6-3 triumph.         
	The crowd on Court No. 1 were effusive in their applause, confirming the impression that Sharapova has come full circle since she was embraced at Wimbledon as the siren of Siberia, referred to by some as Maria Supernova.         
	After two seasons on the periphery of the game, though, and much time in injury bays, she appears to have rediscovered her glow.         
	Sharapova needed all her patience to thwart Zahlavova Strycova. The first four games of the match all ended in breaks of save but a tie-break was averted when the Czech pitched a forehand into the net to fall behind.         
	Still Sharapova was not safe, finding herself broken early in the second set, only to reclaim the advantage immediately. Again she broke in the sixth game, and had to hold the lead with the increasing desperation as her net play faltered, forcing her to defend a succession of set points.         
	The coup de grace was emphatic, though, as she served an ace down the centre of the T for an invigorating win. Sharapova cannot be judged just by how she discharges her work on court, though. Her popularity is inextricably linked as much to her personality.         
	There is feverish interest among the commentators here, for instance, in her boyfriend, Sasha Vujcinic, the Slovenian player for the LA Lakers basketball team. Vujinic, who has just helped inspire his teams comeback to win the NBA title against the Boston Celtics, is expected at Wimbledon imminently.         
	Even if she is swept away by Serena, she can still find much to keep her humble.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni amp; Co. cannot afford to slip-up
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni amp; Co. cannot afford to slip-up
                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni                     
	Chennai: Fresh from their win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore after a series of disappointments, the Chennai Super Kings cannot afford to relax as they take on the Rajasthan Royals in an Indian Premier League encounter here Saturday.         
	Opener Murali Vijays impressive 39-ball 78 and Suresh Rainas determined unbeaten 44-run knock helped Mahendra Singh Dhonis side eke out a comfortable five-wicket win.         
	The last time both the teams clashed, Shane Warnes men had the last laugh after Naman Ojha produced a scintillating 49-ball 80 and Yusuf Pathan and Shaun Tait shared four wickets between them to guide the team to a 12-run triumph.         
	However, the Super Kings batting line-up has been strengthened with the arrival of Aussie star Michael Hussey and their bowling has also received a facelift with the inclusion of pacer Doug Bollinger.         
	On the other hand, the Royals have had a clear run in the tournament but surrendered their initiative to an embarrassing 67-run loss to the Delhi DareDevils in their last match.         
	A fine blend of experience and youth gives the Chennai side an edge over Warnes team.         
	However, while the Royals have won four of their eight matches so far, the home side have managed three playing the same number of matches.         
	That implies that Dhonis men cant afford to lose from here, as any defeat would severely dent their chances of making the semi-finals.         
	With Vijay and Raina hitting a purple patch and Hayden too getting back his rhythm, the Super Kings batting looks solid. And if Dhoni also finds his touch, the hosts would definitely pose a lot of difficulties for the visiting team.         
	The Royals have won most of their matches at home and away matches seem to be their nemesis.         
	Warne has been a great motivator for his young teammates and his compatriot, all-rounder Shane Watsons arrival has only bolstered the teams batting and bowling departments.         
	Royals Yusuf Pathan remains the single big threat. But openers Michael Lumb and Ojha have been among the runs too. Pacer Tait, Siddarth Trivedi and Warne himself have taken good care of the bowling department. On the whole, the Super Kings would be looking forward to reverse their 17-run loss against the same oppositions last week.

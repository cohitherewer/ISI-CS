The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Dhoni: God has made Sachin for cricket
                                                                                                                       7                                      Captain Dhoni: God has made Sachin for cricket
    - Satisfaction at beating a good side praise for pujara             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Bangalore: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, had an interaction with the media in general, on Wednesday afternoon, and then took some questions exclusively from The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Whether the seven-wicket win over Australia is the most memorable in the two years that he has been the Test captain                   Mahendra Singh Dhoni      
	Cant pick one ahead of the other... The same goes for ODIs... But the fact is that Australia are a good side.         
	Reflecting on the Chinnaswamy victoryBy losing tosses I dont help the bowlers... It wasnt a turning track, but was slow and the balls kept low... The bowlers did a very good job... A target of 207 wouldnt be seen as big, but a start was still needed. Had a few wickets gone early, then panic wouldve set in. The scorecard may suggest it was easy, but there was some tension and a bit of nervousness in the dressing room.         
	A clean sweep, 2-0         
	Its easy when its a two-match series only... It could get difficult if it involves three or four Tests.         
	His first series win after marriage         
	(Laughs) Yes, hadnt thought of it.         
	If wife Sakshi made a trip to the Chinnaswamy         
	I did ask her to come on one of the days, at least, but she preferred to stay in the hotel. We do talk cricket, but never in any detail.         
	Thoughts on Sachin Tendulkar, Man of the Match and the Man of the Series         
	What do I say? God has made Sachin for cricket... I cant put it better... We know hes so talented, but we must also appreciate the amount of work he has put in from such a young age... He continues to work so hard, doesnt take anything for granted.         
	Areas hed been looking to exploit         
	Wanted to put pressure on Australias middle order and the lower middle order.         
	Promoting debutant Cheteshwar Pujara to the No.3 position and dropping regular Rahul Dravid to No.5, on Wednesday         
	We (the team management) wanted an experienced player down the order, after Sachin at No.4... Had Rahul come at his usual position, then it wouldve been (the inexperienced) Suresh Raina and Pujara after Sachin... Also, we thought the Australians may be taken by surprise and attack Pujara, which they did... He got the chance to play his shots... Instead of feeling the pressure, Pujara took it up as a challenge.         
	Whether Pujara was given time to mentally prepare himself         
	He was told about it before we began our second innings... He was up for it. Of course, we (the team management) had a discussion in the morning itself.         
	Pujara making a mark on his debut         
	The good thing is that the younger players (too) are performing... Murali Vijay, for example, got past the 100-barrier... Pujara realised that if he performed today, it would be remembered. Its a learning curve for everybody.         
	Australians getting a taste of their own medicine  seeing the opposition chase down the target rather comfortably         
	Well, we got partnerships going... That was needed.         
	[Vijay and Pujara put on 72 for the second wicket, the third wicket partnership between Pujara and Sachin was worth 57 and, then, Sachin and Dravid took India to victory with an unbroken stand of 61 for the fourth wicket.]         
	Crowd support at the Chinnaswamy         
	Support helps and the crowd was remarkable... Thats why, as a token of our appreciation, we did a lap of honour... Were used to playing in front of 30,000-40,000 fans in the ODIs and in the IPL and wed like the same support in Tests... One needs motivation... Were like performers in a circus, but the circus must be full... (Laughs) This should be taken in the right sense, though.         
	Whether India can dominate Test cricket like Australia did till recently         
	Would depend on one basic  playing good cricket... It would be nice if we could have a bigger pool of fast bowlers and spinners to pick from.         
	Finally, on the ODI series, which begins on Sunday         
	Australia and India are the top teams... Both, however, have rested some of the big players... It should be interesting.

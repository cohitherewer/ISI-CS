The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wonderful to get so far... Im indebted to so many: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wonderful to get so far... Im indebted to so many: Sachin
      -  The maestro on getting to 14,000 runs in tests             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Michael Clarke congratulates Sachin Tendulkar, in Bangalore, on Sunday                                 
	Bangalore: Marcus North and Murali Vijay summed it up, well, perfectly.         
	Sachin (Tendulkar) is a pretty amazing guy... Just look at his longevity and the pressure he takes... Hes got to 14,000 runs in the same Test where Ive got my first 1,000... So, what do I say?         
	That was centurion North, after stumps on Sunday.         
	Vijay said: Im living a dream, playing alongside Sachin, my childhood hero... Sharing time with him in the dressing room is celebration enough for me... I hope to one day play like him.         
	As for Sachin, the cynosure, he spoke to The Telegraph at the lovely Royal Gardenia. Given that hes still batting (not out on 44), the interaction wasnt that lengthy.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Whether 14,000 too is merely another number...         
	(Laughs) No... I wouldnt put it that way... Its wonderful to get so far and I remain indebted to so many.         
	If he was actually counting the runs to 14,000         
	I knew I was getting there (requiring 27 at the start of the innings)... I had an idea... Confirmation came when the big screen flashed the milestone.         
	First thoughts         
	Definitely remembered my late father.         
	If Sunil Gavaskars 10,000th run was described as the scaling of Everest, how should 14,000 be hailed?         
	I leave it to you... Im not sure what to say.         
	Whether hed spoken to the family, on returning to the hotel         
	Im expecting a call any minute.         
	Dedicating the achievement to...         
	Actually, havent thought about it.         
	The Australians making it a point to applaud and, then, congratulate him in person         
	It feels good... Respect from the opposition and teammates is always nice. I appreciate the Australians gesture.         
	If, after the excitement, hell be able to sleep tight         
	Of course, yes... Plenty of work remains to be done.         
	Whether he remembers his first Test run, in Karachi, 21 years ago         
	Frankly, I cant... That entire Test is a blur... I know I got out for 15 (bowled by fellow-debutant Waqar Younis, now the Pakistan coach), though...         
	If the chanting of Sachin, Sachin, even when hes fielding, puts him under pressure         
	No... My focus is on whats happening inside the field. However, I do respect the sentiments of fans.         
	The year 2010 being among the more special for him, both in terms of records and recognition         
	Well, yes... You could say so, not that Ive made a comparison of all the 21 years.         
	Lastly... Monday being a big day for Team India in the ongoing series         
	(Passionately) Absolutely. As Ive told you, plenty is to be done...

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: You dont need to be a Jonty Rhodes to be a good fielder, says the South African legend himself.         
	Rhodes, in India for the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as the fielding coach of the Mumbai Indians, believes the youngsters should focus on producing excellence on the cricket field instead of trying to ape their idols.         
	I am not here to change anybody into Rhodes or AB de Villiers or Ricky Ponting. I want them to be the best they can be. Thats what Gary Kirsten has done with the Indian team, Rhodes said on Saturday.         
	The 40-year-old said his task as a fielding coach is to make the players realise they can bring value to the team with their fielding.

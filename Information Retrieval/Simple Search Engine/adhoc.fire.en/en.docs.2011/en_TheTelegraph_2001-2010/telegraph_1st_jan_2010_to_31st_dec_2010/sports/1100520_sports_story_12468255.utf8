                                                                                                                       7                                        Somdev   moves ahead
                  Karvolic has pulled out of the French Open                           
	Paris: Somdev Dev Varman easy defeated Daniel King-Turner 6-1, 6-2 to advance to the final qualifying round of the French Open here, on Wednesday.         
	The sixth-seeded Somdev needed only an hour and twelve minutes to brush aside his challenger from New Zealand in the second round.         
	The 25-year-old will now take on Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, who beat Ramon Delgado of Paraguay 6-2, 7-6, in the final round to qualify for the main draw.         
	Somdev produced a dominating performance to pocket the first set under half an hour.         
	He is the only Indian left in the draw after the exit of Prakash Amritraj Tuesday in the first round.         
	Meanwhile, Ivo Karlovic has withdrawn from the French Open with a right foot injury and is doubtful for Croatias Davis Cup quarter final series against Serbia in July.         
	Karlovic says his Achilles has been bothering him for months.         
	The Croatian joins Russians Nikolay Davydenko (left wrist) and Igor Andreev (left ankle), Argentines Juan Martin del Potro (right wrist) and David Nalbandian (left hamstring), American James Blake (right knee) and Tommy Haas (right hip).         
	His replacement in the mens singles main draw is yet to be announced.         
	Karlovic said on Wednesday that he wants to play at Wimbledon and in the Davis Cup, but the health is most important.         
	He says he will make a final decision after more medical tests.         
	Croatia, the 2005 Davis Cup champions, will face Serbia in the Davis Cup quarter finals on July 11-13.         
	Croatias Mario Ancic is struggling with back pains and is also not certain for the Davis Cup.           (AGENCIES)

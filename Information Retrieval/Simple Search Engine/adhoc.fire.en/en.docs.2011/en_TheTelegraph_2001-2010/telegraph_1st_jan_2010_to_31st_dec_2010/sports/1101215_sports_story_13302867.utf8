The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | High Court upholds Royals return
                                                                                                                       7                                      High Court upholds Royals return
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: In a further setback for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the Bombay High Court (BHC), on Tuesday, dismissed its appeal against an arbitrators order staying the termination of Rajasthan Royals as an IPL franchise.         
	I have found the order to be sustainable, Justice Shiavax Vazifdar observed while upholding the stay granted by the court-appointed arbitrator Justice (Retd.) B.N. Srikrishna, on November 30.         
	The interim injunction came on a day when the BCCI filed an appeal against the same judges another order staying the termination of Kings XI Punjab last week.         
	While the BCCIs appeal in the Kings XI case was being heard by a two-member Division Bench of the BHC, the Board could challenge Justice Vazifdars order in the Royals case only in the Supreme Court due to the various sections of the constitution under which the two cases were filed.         
	As in his order in the Kings XI case, Justice Vazifdar placed certain conditions to be met by Jaipur IPL Cricket Ltd., owners of the franchise.         
	The franchise would have to furnish a bank guarantee of $18 million against future payment for players they would be signing for the upcoming seasons and a security deposit of $2.83 million to the BCCI for losses it might incur if the final verdict in the case upholds the termination.         
	There was some last minute drama when the judge sought to put the franchise to a test of bonafide by asking whether their three owners  Suresh Chellaram, Lachlan Murdoch and Manoj Badale  indeed have control over their respective companies  Tresco International, Bluewater Estates Ltd. and Emerging Media  and if they would be willing to disclose their mode of control.         
	Justice Vazifdar had dealt with Kings XI in similar fashion, by asking the latters counsel whether Windy Investments and MB Finmart would be willing to transfer their entire shareholding in the franchise to the individual name of their owner Mohit Burman. Kings XI immediately agreed to do so.

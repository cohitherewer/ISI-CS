	Miami: An unusually inconsistent Roger Federer beat Florent Serra 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3) on Monday in the third round of the Miami Open.         
	The top-ranked Federer lost serve three times, each time when he led. He committed 35 unforced errors to 32 for Serra.         
	But Federer won eight consecutive service points in the tiebreakers and closed out the victory with a service winner.         
	All in all, Im thrilled to be through, he said. At the end of the day, thats what counts.         
	The crowd included Rafael Nadal, a potential opponent in Sundays final.         
	It has always been a lot of fun playing against him, Federer said. I hope that day is going to come soon again.         
	Venus Williams rallied to beat Daniela Hantuchova 1-6, 7-5, 6-4 in the fourth round, sweeping the final seven points. She overcame 45 unforced errors, including 11 as she lost the first four games.         
	Venus is seeking her fourth title here, but her first since 2001. Her quarter final opponent will be No. 6 Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat Yaroslava Shvedova 6-1, 6-4.         
	The top-seeded woman, Svetlana Kuznetsova, was hampered by a right shoulder injury and lost to Marion Bartoli 3-6, 0-6 in the fourth round, while defending champion Victoria Azarenka lost 4-6, 0-6 to former No. 1-ranked Kim Clijsters. No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki beat No. 22 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 6-2 and will play another former No. 1-ranked Belgian  Justine Henin, who beat No. 11 Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-4 to advance.         
	Clijsters, seeded 14th, next plays No. 9 Samantha Stosur, who eliminated No. 7 Jelena Jankovic 6-1, 7-6 (9).         
	Kuznetsova, the 2006 champion, required treatment from a trainer three times during the match and won only eight points in the second set. I almost had stars in my eyes, it was so painful, Kuznetsova said. I think I should have pulled out earlier. Its impossible... I cannot return. Then I cannot serve, but that was my choice to play.         
	The upset was nothing new for the 13th-seeded Bartoli, who has won seven of her past 11 matches against top five players.         
	Bartoli advanced to the quarter finals here for the second time. She also reached the final eight as a qualifier in 2003.         
	Mardy Fish reached the fourth round with his second consecutive win over a seeded opponent, beating No. 29 Feliciano Lopez 7-5, 6-3.         
	Fish upset defending champion Andy Murray in the second round.         
	Federers fourth-round opponent will be No. 16 Tomas Berdych, who beat Horacio Zeballos 6-4, 7-5.         
	The champion here in 2005-06, Federer has won 36 matches in the tournament, third behind Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras.           (AGENCIES)

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	David Beckham has denied reports that he wanted to become a US citizen. The former England captain has been living in Los Angeles since 2007, but insisted that he was still very much an Englishman.         
	He said: You may have seen some recent quotes attributed to me. Just to be clear  Im happy living in America but have no intention of becoming a US citizen. Im English and proud to be. That will never change.         
	In an interview with an American daily, Beckham was reported to have said it would be nice to get citizenship in the States. He lives in Beverly Hills with his wife, Victoria, and their three sons, Brooklyn, 11, Romeo, eight, and Cruz, five.         
	This weekend the 35-year-old will be concentrating on trying to add another title to his impressive record of achievements. He has already won the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup with Manchester United, and the Primera Division with Real Madrid.         
	Now he has the chance to claim Americas top prize, the Major League Soccer Cup.

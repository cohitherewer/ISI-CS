The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gerrard does it for Liverpool
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gerrard does it for Liverpool
            EUROPA LEAGUE                                Steven Gerrard celebrates after scoring against Napoli, on Thursday       
	London: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard came on as a substitute and scored a late hattrick on Thursday for a 3-1 win over Napoli and a good chance of progress in the Europa League.         
	Ezequiel Lavezzi put Napoli ahead in the 28th minute and Liverpools poor performance prompted manager Roy Hodgson to introduce Gerrard at halftime.         
	Gerrard equalised in the 76th from a sliding challenge onto a short back pass, made it 2-1 with an 88th-minute penalty, and lifted the ball over the goalkeeper to complete the scoring with a minute left.         
	Victory gives Liverpool control of Group K and was the English clubs third in a row for the first time in almost 14 months.         
	We showed an awful lot of character and determination in the second half, Hodgson said. It took some Steven Gerrard magic, and courage and determination, which I thought epitomised our second-half performance.         
	Watched by new owner John Henry, Liverpool fell behind when Edinson Cavani picked up a loose pass on the left and slipped a pass through to Lavezzi, who steered the ball under goalkeeper Pepe Reina.         
	Gerrard added impetus to his side and curled a free kick just wide from the edge of the penalty area before racing onto a weak back pass by former Liverpool defender Andrea Dossena. Gerrards sliding challenge got there just ahead of goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis and prodded the ball into the net.         
	Gerrards next goal came after Salvatore Aronica tripped Glen Johnson for a penalty, and he completed his first hattrick in almost three years from a pass by Lucas Leiva.         
	Elsewhere, Lech Poznan scored two late goals  one freakish and the other superb  to stun Manchester City 3-1, while Juventus drew 0-0 with Salzburg for their fourth draw in as many group games.         
	CSKA Moscow and BATE Borisov became the first teams to guarantee a place in the knockout rounds, the Russians beating Palermo 3-1 to maintain their 100 percent record while the Belarus outfit beat Sheriff Tiraspol by the same score.         
	Lech reclaimed top spot in Group A on goals scored after beating City with both teams on seven points from four games.         
	Dimitrije Injac fired the Poles ahead on the half hour with a swerving shot from outside the area after the Premier League teams defence failed to properly clear the ball.Emmanuel Adebayor headed the visitors level seven minutes after halftime but Lech went back in front with four minutes left when City defender Dedryck Boyatas headed clearance hit Manuel Arboleda on the head and went into the net.         
	Four minutes later Lechs 19-year-old substitute Mateusz Mozdzen added to Citys misery with a superb curling shot into the top corner from almost 25 metres.Juventus, who host City in their next game, have four points after failing to break down the Austrian champions at home.         
	 quot;Theres still some hope but its not going to be easy to win at Poznan and then beat Manchester, quot; said Juventus coach Luigi del Neri.         
	While Juventus captain Alessandro del Piero missed several chances, fellow striker Amauri again failed to make an impact, which will only increase speculation that the Turin side will try to replace him during the January transfer window.         
	The draw also provided little for Michel Platini to cheer for, with the former Juventus standout and current Uefa president on hand at Stadio Olimpico.         
	Missing several players due to injury, and with Alberto Aquilani and Fabio Quagliarella having joined the squad too late to make the list for European matches, Del Neri had to make some tough lineup choices.         
	Simone Pepe, who often lines up near the forward line, was dropped back to fullback and 19-year-old Manuel Giandonato was given a start in midfield.         
	Del Piero had a shot to the high corner saved in the 17th minute and also threatened in the 33rd following a setup from Milos Krasic. Salzburgs Franz Schiemer headed just wide in the 49th and Roman Wallner also missed the net with a header high in the 68th.         
	Making matters worse for Juventus, Krasic exited in the 62nd with an apparent muscle injury and defender Nicola Legrottaglie was also injured.         
	Before kickoff, Juventus announced that defender Paolo de Ceglie had undergone kneecap surgery and wont be back for about three months.         
	De Ceglie was injured in Saturdays 2-1 win over AC Milan.         
	Group F leaders CSKA Moscow scored three times in seven minutes after halftime to sink Palermo, with Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda wiping out Massimo Maccarones 10th minute effort for the visitors before Tomas Necid added two more.Sparta Prague went second with seven points after coming from behind to beat Swiss second division outfit Lausanne Sport 3-1 away.         
	Aleksandr Pavlov and Renan Bressan scored in the last 20 minutes for BATE, giving an unhappy European debut to Sheriffs 19-year-old goalkeeper Dmitri Stajila who replaced injured Vladislav Stoyanov just before the hour.         
	Group E leaders BATE have 10 points, three ahead of Dynamo Kiev who are favourites to follow them through to the knockout stages after beating AZ Alkmaar 2-0 with a second-half brace from Artem Milevsky.         
	Atletico Madrids Tiago scored a stunning winner six minutes from time to give the holders a 2-1 win at Rosenborg in Group B, with the midfielder leaving three players in his wake before a long-range strike gave goalkeeper Daniel Orlund no chance.         
	Sergio Aguero had put Atletico ahead after four minutes before Rosenborg, newly-crowned Norwegian champions, equalised through Markus Henriksen after halftime.Atletico have seven points in Group B, one behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen who beat Aris Salonika 1-0 with a last-minute goal by Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal.

  - Bonuses scandal 
  -  Internal probe now, as SA hits transparency for a six         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gerald Majola and Lalit Modi. A file picture                                 
	Calcutta: With Gerald Majola, the Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive, seemingly influencing the quick burial of an independent inquiry into the bonuses scandal, involving him and a former official, fears of a cover up have grown.         
	That CSA instead, is, continuing with an internal probe even though the International Cricket Council (ICC) has instructed member Boards to undertake independent inquiries into substantive allegations of corruption, is mighty unusual.         
	Majola and Don McIntosh, who quit as CSAs chief operating officer in August, awarded themselves fat bonuses for the Indian Premier League (IPL)s second edition, held in April-May last year, and the Champions Trophy, staged a few months later.         
	While Majola gave himself Rand 1.2 million (around Rand 7.00 to a dollar) from the Rand 3.3 million CSA received as a bonus from the IPL, McIntosh took home Rand 800,000. The remainder went to 38 other employees.         
	According to reports, they pocketed a major share of the Rands received for the Champions Trophy, too, this time from the ICC.         
	Neither Majola nor McIntosh had any business acting the way they did, for CSAs Remuneration Committee alone decides on who gets what as a bonus. It wasnt in the picture.         
	Once the scandal made headlines, in mid-August, CSA declared that an independent probe, with former chief justice Pius Nkonzo Langa in the chair, would look into it all.         
	Justice Langa was to be assisted by a nominee each from Deloittes (CSAs external auditors, the lid-blowers) as well as KPMG, another top auditing firm.         
	On September 29, however, CSA announced that its own Review Committee would hold an inquiry into the awarding of bonuses to employees in the 2009-10 season!         
	So much for transparency.         
	A.K. Khan, CSA vice-president, is heading the internal probe. The other members  John Bester and John Blair  are also part of the Establishment.         
	Khan and his colleagues must complete their work before November 19.         
	This doesnt look good at all and the media (in South Africa) appears convinced that a cover up is underway... To do away with Justice Langa, who enjoys an excellent reputation, is shocking, is how a retired administrator put it.         
	Confirmation wasnt forthcoming till late on Saturday, but it does seem that Majola, who has been around for a decade, has regained much ground within CSA, with president Dr Mtutuzeli Nyoka losing territory.         
	An undeclared turf war appears to be raging.         
	In any case, Majola is seen as the non-playing face of cricket in South Africa, not Dr Nyoka. Having said that, Majola doesnt have the aura of Dr Ali Bacher.         
	Asked if the ICC could step in, Colin Gibson, head of media and communications, told The Telegraph: Look, CSA should know whats to be done (when there are allegations of corruption)... If somebody writes to us that the protocol isnt being followed, then the ICC may, in turn, write to CSA...         
	Significantly, Dr Nyoka was present in Dubai, on Tuesday-Wednesday, when the ICCs Executive Board instructed member Boards to undertake independent inquiries into any substantive allegations of corruption...         
	Majola, for the record, worked very closely with Lalit Kumar Modi, one-time IPL boss, who today faces detention on landing in India.         
	The Modi-related developments are being closely followed in South Africa. What if the messy trail actually leads to Johannesburg, where CSA is headquartered, too?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kim sweeps past Kvitova
                                                                                                                       7                                        Kim sweeps past Kvitova
  - Federer, Wozniacki advance; Sania campaign ends             Elena Dementieva hits a return to Daniela Hantuchova, in New York, on Friday. (AP)                           
	New York: Kim Clijsters beat Petra Kvitova and Hurricane Earl, which lashed New York, with a quick victory before rain briefly suspended play at the US Open.         
	Matches resumed Friday afternoon after a 25-minute delay. The forecast from the tournaments meteorologist called for intermittent showers. Officials planned to try to get in the full schedule of matches.         
	The main concern went from heat to rain in a matter of hours. Defending champion Clijsters won the final 12 games in her 6-3, 6-0 third-round victory over the 27th-seeded Kvitova. The second-seeded Clijsters dropped two service games to fall behind 3-0 early.         
	A match like this probably gives me more satisfaction, because I beat a good player without even playing my best tennis, Clijsters said.         
	Earlier, Elena Dementieva, the 11th seed, recovered from a first-set slump to continue her strong record against Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova with a 7-5, 6-2 win on Friday.         
	It was the 16th career meeting in a decade between the two and the Russian took her tally of wins against Hantuchova to 12 on Arthur Ashe Stadium and earned a spot in the fourth round.         
	Dementieva elected to receive serve and the move paid off as she moved into a 2-0 lead before her game temporarily fell apart.         
	Her previously clean, crisp shots from the back of the court evaporated as she over-reached for her big groundstrokes and Hantuchova raced away with five unanswered games.         
	Dementieva finally stopped the rot when facing three set points to move within two games of Hantuchova, who still looked on course to win the set.         
	Hantuchova appeared to have lost her rhythm during the rain break and conceded her break advantage with two consecutive double faults.         
	Dementieva, eyeing her chance, turned the screw with increasingly confident play from the back of the court to level the set before breaking her opponent again and comfortably serving out the set.         
	Both players seemed utterly incapable of holding serve as the second set opened with three consecutive breaks.         
	Dementieva was the first to hold but more because of Hantuchovas faltering play, which enabled her rival to round off the third-round contest with ease.         
	On Thursday, there was an old-fashioned fight, but not the one tournament officials wanted to see.         
	Instead of happening on the court, the scuffle broke out in the upper deck, high above Arthur Ashe Stadium where Novak Djokovic and Philipp Petzschner were locked in their own battle.         
	Play stopped briefly as New York police handcuffed three rowdy fans and evicted them from Flushing Meadows.         
	The fracas in the stands came at the end of a day when some of the sports heavyweights delighted in humbling lesser-known opponents in second round matches.         
	Each of the five featured matches on centre court were decided in straight-sets. At times the quality of tennis was breathtaking and the crowds roared their approval, but it was rarely a fair contest.         
	Roger Federers victim was Germanys Andreas Beck. He won the match 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 in one hour 41 minutes and even the Swiss master himself was impressed.         
	Its the perfect start, he said. I played Monday, had two days off. I had another easy one physically today, and here I am in the third round feeling like Im completely in the tournament.         
	Maria Sharapova was also in a hurry, belting Czech Iveta Benesova 6-1, 6-2, but neither of the former champions could match the ruthless display from Caroline Wozniacki.         
	The Dane needed just 47 minutes to inflict the dreaded 6-0, 6-0 double bagel on Taiwans Chang Kai-chen and remain on course for a meeting with Sharapova in the fourth round.         
	Russias Vera Zvonareva, Wimbledon finalist this year, and Belgiums Yanina Wickmayer, semi-finalist at the US Open last season, also registered easy wins on another steamy day when the Extreme Weather Policy was invoked as temperatures climbed past 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius).         
	Meanwhile, Sania Mirzas campaign ended after she lost her womens doubles first round along with Russian partner Vera Dushevina to 11th seeds Alisa Kleybanova and Ekaterina Makarova here. Already out of singles, Sania and her partner lost 7-6(6) 2-6 6-7(3) in the first round.         
	Petzschner landed a few blows on Djokovic but the world No. 3 was way too crafty for the German, winning 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 to meet James Blake in the next round.         
	Djokovics fellow Serb Jelena Jankovic, the womens fourth seed, survived after being pushed to three sets by Mirjana Lucic.         
	Russian Nikolay Davydenko, however, was left punch-drunk after being hammered 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 by Frenchman Richard Gasquet. I dont know if I need to have a coach, a mental coach or if I need to go somewhere to change my brain, the sixth seed said.         
	The casualty rate among the seeds in the first four days of the championship has been almost as brutal as the baking heat with 22 making early exits, including six more Thursday.         
	Agnieszka Radwanska, Aravane Rezai and Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez were sent tumbling out of the womens draw. Davydenko was the highest mens seed to fall and was joined at the exit by Thomaz Bellucci and Croatias 11th seed Marin Cilic, upset 5-7 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-1 by Japans Kei Nishikori.         
	For Federer, it was business as usual in his pursuit of a 17th Grand Slam title but there was no repeat of the magical between-the-legs trick shot he played in his opening match.

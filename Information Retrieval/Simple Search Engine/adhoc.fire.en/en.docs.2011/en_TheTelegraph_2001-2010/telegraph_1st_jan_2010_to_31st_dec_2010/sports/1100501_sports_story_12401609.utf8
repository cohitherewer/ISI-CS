The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla test for depleted Pak
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bangla test for depleted Pak
                      
	St Lucia: Smarting from an embarrassing defeat to Zimbabwe in a warm-up match, defending champions Pakistan will have to quickly get their act together as they have a tricky opener against Bangladesh in the World Twenty20 here Sunday.         
	The defeat came as a rude shock for the defending champions, who had beaten Sri Lanka in the summit clash of the previous edition at Lords to clinch the title.         
	Pakistan have played very few Twenty20 matches in the last one year and some of their top cricketers were banned and fined for indiscipline.         
	Hence, the onus would be on skipper Shahid Afridi to ensure that his teammates put behind all such issues and give their best.         
	Afridi will have to make sure that this defeat doesnt dent the teams morale and has no bearing in the clash against Bangladesh.         
	Although failing with bat, Afridi at least picked up four wickets against Zimbabwe with his leg-spin and it will boost his confidence which might reflect positively in his captaincy on the morrow.         
	On Friday, Afridi said he would like his team to take Bangladesh as seriously as if they were Australia.         
	Anything can happen in this form of the game. Its about what happens on the day. I want to see the same body language whether we are playing Bangladesh or Australia, he said.         
	I think as the defending champions, there is some pressure on us, Afridi added.         
	There is extra responsibility on me as captain to set an example.         
	But weve got a good team and Im, quite happy. This is the right time for us to play some good cricket. Thats what I am expecting from the guys, Afridi said.         
	Despite the loss, Pakistan remain a formidable side and Bangladesh will have to play out of their skin to beat them.         
	In their seven matches at the previous editions of the World Twenty20, Bangladesh have won just one match  against the West Indies.         
	To top that, a seven-wicket loss to England in a warm-up match in Barbados on Wednesday must have dented their confidence.         
	Bangladesh have the likes of captain Shakib-al Hasan, Mohammed Ashraful and Abdur Razzak, who can guide the team to an upset win.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | See-saw battle on cards
                                                                                                                       7                                        See-saw battle on cards
            SUDIPTO GUPTA            Tim Paine in Mohali, on Saturday                           
	Mohali: Ever heard of Keninisa Bekele? For the uninitiated, the Ethiopian is the world and Olympic record holder in both the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events and is considered one of the greatest distance runners of all times.         
	Is his achievement inferior to that of Usain Bolt, the fastest man on earth? You bet Ricky Ponting would love to put forward this question to Zaheer Khan, whose alleged why dont you run like Usain Bolt advice to the Australian captain had triggered an on-field showdown between the two on Friday.         
	Australias first innings ended on 428 runs. For the T20 enthusiasts, who may say that the runs were made at a snails pace, mind you, its Test cricket.         
	Battles here are fought on a larger scale and strategies deal as much with the future as with the present.         
	But then, the Indians approach, when they came into bat, was Bolt-like indeed. Thanks to Virender Sehwags 54-ball 59, India closed the second day, of the first Test, on Saturday, at 110 for two. Rahul Dravid was at the crease batting on 21 while nightwatchman Ishant Sharma was yet to open his account.         
	Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir (25) began well with an 81-run opening stand. Both the openers, however, fell to Mitchell Johnson.         
	Compared to Australias innings run rate of 2.82, the Indians are racing away at 5.23 runs per over, but have also lost two crucial components of their plans.         
	The visitors slow scoring rate bore a two-fold advantage  it ate away a thick slice of time, transferring the onus on the Indians to score quickly if they want to force a result; it also sapped a lot of energy from the hosts reserve who had to field for a staggering 151.4 overs under the blazing sun.         
	For Australia, Shane Watson and Tim Paine, who could have perished on zeroes, became the heroes. While Watson went on to score 126, Paine played a matured knock of 92. The Indian camp would hope that the lapses dont get translated into a loss.         
	Paine, by the way, was again dropped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on 86. His 196-ball stay was studded with 12 boundaries.         
	For the Indians, Zaheer was the most successful, labouring to his 10th five-wicket haul giving away 94 runs in 30 tiring overs.         
	Apart from Paine, Johnson chipped in with 47 runs, which included three booming sixes. Two of the major issues at the start of the day were Ishants availability and how long the Indians would persist with the old ball.         
	Unfortunately, the innumerable twists and turns of cricket rules often leaves one at a dead end. While Dhoni was relieved to have Ishant back in his pack, the pacers long absence of 53.2 overs on Friday restricted his role to that of a fielder and could only deliver four overs on the day.         
	That in turn complicated things for the Indian captain who decided against taking the new ball for 56.4 overs of the day. He, perhaps, was afraid that the spinners would leak too many runs with the shinning cherry without scalping any wickets.         
	But then ideas need to be malleable. Not taking the new ball in spite of the spinners inability to extract considerable turn from the track or Zaheers failure to reinvent the reverse swing, is a little taxing on common sense. The low bounce played its role ensuring that the edges teased the fielders behind the wickets dropping tantalisingly short of their reach. Watson was the beneficiary of that on two occasions.         
	The race has begun. Lets wait and see who triumphs  Bekele-like Aussies or Bolt-like Indians.

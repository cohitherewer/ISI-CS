	London: Middlesex are now trying to rope in explosive Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh for their domestic Twenty20 Cup later this year after Sachin Tendulkar turned down an offer from the English county side.         
	We have been in talks with Yuvraj about the possibility of him playing Twenty20 cricket this summer, Angus Fraser, Middlesexs director of cricket, told a cricket website.         
	The contract is not in place at the moment, but were in communication, and it seems to be going quite positively, he added. (PTI)

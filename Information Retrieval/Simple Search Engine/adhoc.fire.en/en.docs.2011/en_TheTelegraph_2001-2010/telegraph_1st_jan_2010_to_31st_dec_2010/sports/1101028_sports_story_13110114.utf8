            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National camps have taken their toll on Churchill Brothers. With eight of their top players busy preparing for the Asian Cup and the Asian Games, the depleted Goa side struggled to beat MEG Bangalore 4-2 in the Group A quarter final league match of the 123rd Durand Cup on Wednesday.         
	While the Goa team forwards scored three goals in the first 16 minutes, their defenders let in two almost simultaneously. Both goals were scored by attacking midfielder Lokeshwar Singh.         
	Churchill opened the scoring through Odafe Okolie in the second minute, when he headed in a flag kick by Israil Gurung absolutely unchallenged.         
	Odafe scored his second goal in the 80th minute when he converted a spot kick after substitute Ernest Emako was brought down by goalkeeper Sujith V, which also earned him a red card.         
	Knowing Odafe to be the dangerman, the MEG defenders quickly went for a double cover on the striker but could not stop Bineesh Balan and Hardeep from scoring the second and the third goals in quick succession after Odafe put Churchill in the lead.         
	Poor judgement on part of Sujith also cost MEG dear. He conceded the third goal off a long lob from Hardeep that slipped out of his hands and rolled past the goalline.

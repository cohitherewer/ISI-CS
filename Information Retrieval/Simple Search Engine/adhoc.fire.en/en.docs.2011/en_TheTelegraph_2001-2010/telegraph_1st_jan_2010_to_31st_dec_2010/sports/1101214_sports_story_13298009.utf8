The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hauritz offloads Test gear
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hauritz offloads Test gear
                      
	Sydney: Discarded Australian spin bowler Nathan Hauritz has marked his failure to return to the Test team by giving away some of his cricket gear during a yard sale, a report said Monday.         
	Hauritz, overlooked for inclusion in the Australian team taking on England in the Ashes, was seen sitting in front of a cardboard box on Saturday outside his apartment in Sydneys Coogee area, a local daily said.         
	The 29-year-old gave away some of his heavy woollen Test sweaters during the sale, which included cricket books and generic sportswear among general household items, the tabloid said.         
	I dont play for them anymore, Hauritz simply said.         
	Hauritz has played 17 Tests for Australia, taking 63 wickets, since earning his first call-up in 2004 for the Test tour of India in which Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman were among his first wickets.         
	But after being dropped late in the 2004-05 season, Hauritz had to wait until 2008-09 for his second chance even as selectors struggled to fill the void left by the retirement in early 2007 of spin great Shane Warne.         
	The failure of selectors to choose the right-arm off-break bowler for the current Ashes series, in which Australia are floundering against a confident England, has baffled many particularly given Hauritzs domestic form.

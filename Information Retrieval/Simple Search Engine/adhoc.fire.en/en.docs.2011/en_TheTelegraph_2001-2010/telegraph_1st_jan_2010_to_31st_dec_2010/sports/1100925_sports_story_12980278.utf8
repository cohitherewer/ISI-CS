The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tait likely to return for Redbacks
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tait likely to return for Redbacks

	Centurion: The two most consistent sides of the tournament would be seen locked in a battle for supremacy, when table-toppers South Australia Redbacks take on an impressive Warriors in the second semi-final of the Champions League Twenty20 here Saturday.         
	Michael Klinger led Redbacks were the only team in the tournament to win all four of their group matches, while South Africas Warriors won their first three matches before losing to Chennai Super Kings.         
	For Klingers men, everything has fallen into place so far, but they would have to guard against complacency before Saturdays tough encounter at the Centurion Park.         
	Australian pace spearhead Shaun Tait is likely to be back in their line-up ahead of the crucial tie, after he missed the final group game against Guyana due to an elbow niggle.         
	Tait is the fifth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with six victims in three matches at an average of 14.33 and his presence would mean a lot for the Redbacks, who can use him to stop the furious Warriors captain Davy Jacobs, whose bat has so far yielded 191 runs at an impressive strike rate of 141.         
	Thanks to the start given by Jacobs, Warriors have got 50-plus in first six-over batting powerplay until their last game.         
	The opening pair of Jacobs and Ashwell Prince has provided balance to the side and their veteran wicketkeeper Mark Boucher has given the much-needed support lower down the order.         
	Warriors bowling line-up includes South Africa Test pacemen Makhaya Ntini and Lonwabo Tsotsobe and experienced spinners Johan Botha and Nicky Boje. Captain Jacobs would be expecting another all-round performance from them to break Redbacks batting line-up.         
	While Ntini and Tsotsobe both generate enough pace to frighten the top-order of any team, the spin duo of Botha and Boje are also capable of strangling the opposition in the middle overs.

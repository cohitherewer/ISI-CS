The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | English blow to Pakistan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      English blow to Pakistan 
  - Aussies set Cup record with 12-0 thrashing of South Africa       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Australia's Luke Doerner celebrates a goal against South Africa on Thursday. (AP)      
	New Delhi: Pakistans campaign in the World Cup Thursday suffered a major setback when they went down 2-5 to England in an ill-tempered clash at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium.         
	Pakistan now have a mountain to climb if they are to make the semi-finals from Pool A. At the end of Round III, European champions England are firmly atop with nine points while Pakistan have only three points to show from their lone victory over Spain.         
	Earlier in the day, title favourites Australia strengthened their claim for the second semi-final spot from the group with a 12-0 whitewash of a hapless South Africa.         
	It is the biggest victory margin since the inception of the World Cup in 1971. Australia have six points and, also a goal difference that no other team in the group can match.         
	We are now left with only a 10 per cent chance of entering the semis, admitted Pakistan striker Rehan Butt. We had a chance to get three points but conceded a couple of soft goals in the second half. That was the cause of our downfall.         
	The result would have caused dismay to the huge crowd backing Pakistan. Down by two goals at the breather, the four-time champions made a strong comeback to draw level within 12 minutes of the second session through Shakeel Abbasi and Butt only to give away three more goals when England looked vulnerable for the first time in the tournament.         
	Thus, in the end, it was an anti-climax of sorts for the Pakistan fans who never expected their team to succumb so easily after such a good showing early in the second half. England, who scored through Jonty Clarke and Ashley Jackson in the first half, had even looked panicky for a while after the change of ends.         
	Once Pakistan pulled one back in the 44th minute the England players turned physical. So much so that when midfielder Iain Macky hit Mohammed Irfan on the nose, the altercation that followed threatened to turn into a free for all.         
	The situation was brought under control by the umpires with Macky being shown a yellow card.         
	England, however, were quick to regroup and launched some vicious attacks over the next few minute. They totally tore open the Pakistan defence and struck thrice more through skipper Barry Middleton, who scored two of those, and Clarke.         
	The Australians, who led 5-0 at the half time, scored through penalty corner specialist Luke Doerner (4) Jamie Dwyer (3), Glen Turner (2), Desmond Abbott, Fergus Kavanagh and Matthew Butturini.               
	Fridays matches         
	Pool A: South Korea vs New Zealand (4.35pm); The Netherlands vs Canada (6.35pm); Germany vs Argentina (8.35pm).

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Kochi IPL franchise might stay in the multi-million dollar T20 league, after all.         
	With just two days to go for complying with the BCCIs demand of incorporating a joint venture company to run the franchise, the promoters, Rendezvous Sports World Pvt Ltd, and the investors would be holding a meeting here on Tuesday to thrash out their differences and fulfil the terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement.         
	The indications are positive, said Satyajitsinh Gaikwad, chief executive officer of RSW, on the eve of the meeting.         
	Its not clear what kind of truce will take place, but Gaikwad suggested that a solution would be worked out in time to meet the BCCIs deadline of October 21.         
	The faction-ridden consortium was served a show-cause notice for failing to form a legal entity on October 10 by the IPL Governing Council which scrapped Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab the same day.         
	The crux of the problem for Kochi was the struggle to wrest control between RSW and the rest of the investors  which included corporate firms Anchor Earth, Parinee Developers, Rosy Blue and Film Wave, and an individual, Vivek Venugopal.

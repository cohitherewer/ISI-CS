	Dhaka: Bangladesh all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad was a happy man Sunday as his top score of unbeaten 96 on the opening day of the second Test fetched him kudos from the visiting Indian players.         
	Addressing the media after the days play, Mahmudullah said he lauded by senior Indian players Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh.         
	Yuvraj said it was a good knock and I deserved to get a century. Bhajji said well played. I am very happy, said Mahmudullah, who had said in Chittagong that India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was his role model.         
	Mahmudullah felt that there was something wrong with the Bangladesh top-order as they had a similar collapse in the first Test in Chittagong as well. There is something wrong with the top-order, but the batsmen have been trying to work out the problems at the nets, he said.         
	The right-handed batsman said he was not disappointed at not getting what would have been his maiden Test century.         
	I am not disappointed. I am happy that I have helped the team to put up a good total after losing early wickets, said the 23-year-old. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stojkovic: Showed we are a good team 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Stojkovic: Showed we are a good team 
                  A Serbian supporter celebrates in Berlin                     
	Port Elizabeth: Milan Jovanovics 38th minute strike against Germany sealed a memorable win for Serbia, one that has been long in coming. But no one found the wait more difficult than the goalscorer himself.         
	The second half was not 45 minutes, it was like two years for us, Jovanovic said. We beat Germany after 37 years, and its something real big for us.         
	Jovanovic side-footed a shot past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in the 38th minute to leave both teams with three points in the group.         
	Lukas Podolski had a chance to equalise in the 60th, but his penalty was kept out by Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. It was a difficult game, a very important game for us, said Stojkovic, who was the Man of the Match. This is a great victory for all of us. We have showed we are a good team and we believe in ourselves.         
	Podolski was understandably disconsolate after missing the penalty but added that he wanted to forget about it.         
	It was my fault. I missed, Podolski said. I accept responsibility and I dont want to dwell on it.         
	The last time Germany missed a non-shootout penalty at a World Cup was in 1974, a miss by Uli Hoeness against Poland.         
	If we had conceded a goal on the penalty, it would have had great repercussions, Serbia coach Radomir Antic said.         
	Klose, who was sent off after a rough tackle in the 37th earned him a second yellow card, was incredulous with his expulsion. Football is a contact sport and one factor should be whether there was malice and intention, said Klose, who has 11 World Cup goals. I thought I went after the ball.         
	Spanish referee Alberto Undiano handed out nine yellow cards, the most so far in any game at this years tournament.         
	This was not necessary, there were a couple of fouls that were justified from behind, Germany coach Joachim Loew said. But there were many yellow cards that could have been avoided, that were not malicious.

            A STAFF REPORTER              Sourav                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly feels Zulqarnain Haider shouldnt have fled to England and quit cricket altogether.         
	He should not have done that. Instead, he should have taken them head on. In my playing career, I never came across such people who threatened me over phone. Had there been a case I would have informed the team management and also taken those unwanted people to task, Sourav said.         
	Its very easy to intimidate a youngster who wants to play for the country. But then that young player should also have the guts. You just cannot flee like Haider. Its just not done, he stressed.         
	Sourav expressed surprise over the happenings in Pakistan cricket . In the last three months, lot of things are happening in Pakistan and it has been an eye opener for me. First, the spot-fixing controversy and, now, this Haider issue. Its alarming. But I am sure they will come out of this very soon, he said.

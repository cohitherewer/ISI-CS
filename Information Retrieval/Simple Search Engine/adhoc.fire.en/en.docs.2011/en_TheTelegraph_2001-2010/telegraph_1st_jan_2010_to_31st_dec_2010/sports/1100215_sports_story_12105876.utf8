	Calcutta: Zaheer Khan, with time, has matured in his role as a senior and led the Indian attack with finesse and acumen. Donning the mentors hat, in recent years, he has enjoyed the surge that responsibility brings.         
	At the Eden, on Sunday, he not only showed how vulnerable the South Africans were against quality bowling but also inspired the likes of Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma. It was enough to unsettle the visitors, who, despite a solid hundred on debut by Alviro Petersen and Hashim Amlas second century of the series, finished the opening day on 266 for nine.         
	A turnaround sufficient to encourage the best of scriptwriters as Mahendra Singh Dhonis men came back from the dead to claim a firm grip in the second Test of the Jaypee Infratech Cup.         
	Eight wickets fell for 43 runs as the South Africans looked dazed in the face of the Harbhajan magic. A brilliant V.V.S. Laxman catch and a stunning pick-up-and-throw by Zaheer precipitated the collapse. At one point it seemed like a throwback to the 2001 Test against Steve Waughs men!         
	The wicket, which has endured so much of sinister speculation over the past week, certainly passed the test. The grass was trimmed before the start, but it still retained a tinge of green, enough to enthuse the bowlers. And, as Petersen and Amla showed, it has something for the batsmen, too.         
	More importantly, it has a firm nature with good carry and bounce. Its to be seen if it remains this way during the next four days.         
	Zaheer (3/77) exploited the conditions to the hilt. Working up good pace, he got the ball to move and was consistent right through. Not without reason did Gary Kirsten term him the leader of the pack.         
	Ishant was impressive during a four-over spell after lunch, with a barrage of bouncers that very nearly unsettled Amla. He, however, didnt enjoy the same luck. Harbhajan (3/60), who got drift and bounce, then showed that you can never rule him out.         
	The first hour after tea changed the course of the day. Five wickets went down for 26 runs. South Africa, who till then had looked in firm control, suddenly looked susceptible.         
	Amlas departure on the fourth ball after tea opened the floodgates. Zaheers short delivery was angled across and as Amla went for the pull from outside the off stump, Dhoni held on to the thick edge.         
	Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers seemed to have arrested the slide when Harbhajan broke the partnership. The first Test centurion was deceived by a top-spinner as he went for the slog sweep. Laxman made amends for letting off Amla earlier with a running catch from first slip to the short fine-leg region.         
	It turned Indias way in the off-spinners next over when he very nearly completed his second hattrick at the Eden. Ashwell Prince and JP Duminy were trapped in front by deliveries that drifted in, off consecutive balls, but Dale Steyn narrowly survived when the ball missed his bat and off stump by a whisker.         
	Harbhajans second spell (12-2-21-3) had done the trick. The momentum was back with India.         
	De Villiers succumbed to the pressure, failing to beat a brilliant Zaheer direct hit after rushing out at the non-strikers end.         
	Ishant was rewarded with Harriss wicket while Amit Mishra was lucky to get Steyn.         
	Bad light brought a premature end to the days proceedings with nine overs remaining.         
	India looked to have negated the effect of losing the toss when Zaheer broke through bunny Graeme Smiths defence in the third over of the day. But Petersen, replacing Mark Boucher who was ruled out with back spasms, and Amla held fort.         
	There was no stopping Amla as the Indians erred in line and length. It almost looked inevitable from the moment he walked in and started playing his shots. After Sundays 114 (227 minutes, 14x4, 1x6), he took his tally to 367 runs in the series.         
	Petersen never showed any discomfiture on his debut. Except for a while, when in the nineties, he was at ease both off the front foot and the back. The 100 took 226 minutes and included 16 boundaries.         
	South Africa looked to build on the 209 run partnership for the second wicket when Zaheer showed the way, striking on either side of tea.

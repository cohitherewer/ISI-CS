	Miami: Leander Paes and partner, Czech Lukas Dlouhy, defeated Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi in straight-sets at the Miami Open for their maiden ATP title of the season.         
	The third seeds defeated fourth seeds Bhupathi, Paess estranged partner, and Belarussian Mirnyi 6-2, 7-5 in the final of the event which is an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament.         
	Paes and Dlouhy took an early 2-0 lead after winning points on deuce in the first two games and never let the opponents back into the set.         
	In the second set, they grabbed an early lead again only to throw it away when broken for 3-3. But Paes and Dlouhy broke back at 5-5 and then served out the match.         
	The winners of the French and US Open doubles titles last year, Paes and Dlouhy were beaten finalists in Brisbane and Dubai earlier this season.         
	This was Paess 43rd tour-level title while Dlouhy claimed his eighth.         
	Whats great actually about doing well this week is theres no pressure now for the rest of the clay court season. Weve got to a final in Brisbane and the quarters at the Australian Open. Now theres no pressure. Now were just playing for the cream on the top, Paes said.         
	Dlouhy credited Paes for lifting the team when the chips were down.         
	Playing with (Leander), its always great because he has my back always. When Im struggling with something, hes always with me on the same side and always tells me that nothing happened. We make it like a team. So, it always helps you when you know that you are together, you are like brothers. Thats the magic of the team, I think, he said.         
	Paes has been a runner-up at the Sony Ericsson Open in 2003 and 2007.         
	Earlier Saturday, Belgian Kim Clijsters brought a swift end to Venus Williamss 15-match winning streak with a 6-2, 6-1 win in the Miami Open womens singles final on Saturday. The 14th seed needed only 58 minutes to defeat the third-seeded American, who played with bandaging on both legs and said afterwards she may have trained too hard during the tournament.The match was reminiscent of last years final at Key Biscayne when Williamss sister Serena, also looking short of fitness, surrendered in similar fashion to Belarussian Victoria Azarenka.

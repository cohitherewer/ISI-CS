            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India are among the three teams that have won the ICC U-19 World Cup twice and when this years meet gets underway in New Zealand on Friday, the defending champions will begin their campaign against qualifiers Afghanistan.         
	Australia and Pakistan are the other two teams to have won this competition twice and appear well-placed to challenge for the crown in New Zealand.         
	Speaking ahead of the sides opening match on Friday, India vice-captain Mandeep Singh that expectations would not be an issue for the team.         
	There is no pressure, Mandeep said. That we are the defending champions makes us want to do better and makes us more confident. But I also feel that a slight pressure is necessary for us to perform well.         
	The Indians have had a very satisfactory and encouraging build-up to the U-19 World Cup with the team thrashing Sri Lanka and the hosts en route to victory in a tri-series in South Africa last month.

	Calcutta: Trainer Arti Doctors Snowberry is fancied to lift the 1,200m Wandering Angel Cup, on Sunday, the day I of the winter season. The four-year-old filly, by Serious Spender out of Mulberry, is on the up and also a form horse, against seasoned sprinters like Saarah Alam, Rithambhra and Entrepreneur who are hardly reliable customers. Shailesh Shinde partners the filly. The dark one in the seven-horse field is Solid Success who has reached the striking mark at the weights.          
	In the 1,100m Royal Double Handicap Ajayajeet is expected to justify his runaway victory in his debut run. The horse was subjected to an atrocious ride in his subsequent start, prompting stewards to suspend jockey Kishore Kadam. In the trusted hands of apprentice Shezad Khan, the Eljohar-My Dear Lady son may win untroubled.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ijaz hints at Yousuf return
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ijaz hints at Yousuf return
                      
	Leeds: Pakistan assistant coach Ijaz Ahmed has given the strongest hint yet that a recall for former captain Mohammed Yousuf is being considered.         
	Yousuf and fellow senior batsmen Younis Khan, who has been playing County cricket for Surrey, were both given indefinite bans after Pakistans 3-0 series loss in Australia this year.         
	But the fall-out from Pakistans 150-run loss in the first Test against Australia at Lords last week has led to speculation at least one of Yousuf or Younis could be brought back into the fold.         
	Although Pakistan officials have made it clear the second and final Test against Australia, which starts at Headingley here on Wednesday, will be too soon for either of the former skippers to be recalled, one of them could return for the subsequent four Tests against England.         
	And there is a vacancy to fill after former captain Shahid Afridi, having announced his retirement from the five-day format following the Lords loss, was ruled out of the remaining Tests that Pakistan are playing in England with a side strain.         
	Yousuf can replace Afridi but the management havent decided yet who will come, Ijaz told reporters at Headingley. It could come out in a couple of days.         
	Ijaz added: These are the only two players we are talking about, Younis and Yousuf. Lets see, it might be decided about Yousuf... Yousuf might be coming here.           (AFP)

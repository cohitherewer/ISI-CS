  - Captain for tour of Zimbabwe takes guard         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Suresh Raina                                 
	Calcutta: Suresh Kumar Raina, who will be captaining a new-look Team India on the forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe (tri-series and two T20 Internationals), took questions from The Telegraph, over the phone, on Saturday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q With just a few days to go before leaving for Zimbabwe, what are your thoughts?         
	A The tour, as I see it, is an excellent opportunity for the young players... Its nice that the seniors wanted a break and the selectors took the positive step of picking such a young side. Indeed, one is thankful to the Board.         
	Youve had some days, between St Lucia and now, to think about your assignment...         
	I spoke to Gary (Kirsten, the coach) before leaving the West Indies... We talked about the preparations on getting to Zimbabwe... Yes, Ive been thinking about the job... Ive got a good pace attack, all are young and hungry... The tour will be an opportunity to learn and press for a regular berth in the ODIs and stake a claim at the highest level  Test cricket.         
	Captaining a young team... Is that an advantage or a disadvantage?         
	(Laughs) Look, main bhi young hoon (23)... Ill be backed by an excellent support staff, which has helped take India to No.1 in Tests and No.2 in ODIs... Plus, the players are so eager... The ODIs are different, but we want the World Twenty20 disappointment to quickly become a thing of the past.         
	Biggest challenge?         
	To try and win every game... However, its not that Ill be putting myself under too much pressure... Nor will I put my team under excessive pressure... I realise one has to be disciplined and one must follow the process... The players are full of josh and committed to making a mark... Being the captain, Im happy with that.         
	Whats the kind of captain youll be?         
	By nature, Im very positive and, while on the field, Im high on intensity... Youve seen that... Those things wont change... Ive learnt from some of our best captains  Dada (Sourav Ganguly) and Mahi (Mahendra Singh Dhoni)... There are certain things that you tend to pick up.         
	Do you have a role model captain?         
	As Ive said, Ive learnt from Dada and Mahi... Then, my debut (in 2005) was under Rahulbhai (Dravid)... Dada was the fighter-type, not one to give up... Mahi stays calm... Rahulbhai had his own style.         
	Who makes a good captain?         
	Somebody who gets the team to bond together, somebody who is able to communicate... Also, somebody who has the respect of his players. Respect bahut zaroori hai. To top it all, he has to be able to deliver when the chips are down... Has to lead from the front. When a captain does that, it becomes easy for him to demand the same effort from teammates.         
	Has Dhoni given you tips?         
	Hes asked me to keep things simple... He said that Id done well in IPL III (captaining the Chennai Super Kings), when he hadnt been available for three matches.         
	Stephen Fleming heads the Super Kings support staff. Did you exchange captaincy-related notes with him?         
	Id liked him as New Zealands captain... His advice would always be to be patient and not rush into things, particularly if the moves havent gone well ... Fleming would impart practical things... Ive got a fair idea of captaincy and can assure you Ill be doing an honest job.         
	What did you learn in those three IPL matches?         
	No.1 that captaincy is a big responsibility... I had to lead some very big names (like Muttiah Muralidharan and Matthew Hayden)... I gained from the seniors feedback... I remember Fleming telling me that Id captain India in the future.         
	Has there been any communication between the two of you after you got the India captaincy?         
	Fleming has sent me a do well message.         
	Kirsten, one understands, has been very supportive...         
	Garys himself such a hard worker... Hes very positive and is good at bonding... Indeed, he has solutions for problems.         
	How do you rate Indias chances in the tri-series?         
	Very good... The players, as Ive pointed out, are keen to do well... Im happy with the team... At some level or the other, Ive played with all those whove been selected... U-19, India A, India... I know them and they know me.         
	At the international level, youve been around for five years (90 ODIs, 16 T20 Internationals). What has this period taught you?         
	(Pauses) That hard work pays off... Mehnat ka phal bilkul milta hai... Ive learnt to stay humble... Learnt from watching greats like Sachin (Tendulkar) at close quarters. Simple fundas of life are best.         
	You must be getting impatient for your first Test cap, isnt it?         
	Well, I can only work hard... I was in the squad for the last Test (against South Africa, at the Eden, in February)... I didnt get to play, but felt Id scored a hundred when I returned to the hotel after our win... Test cricket is a great form and the biggest performers get so much respect... Sure, theres something to look forward to.         
	The last one... I assume, in Zimbabwe, nobody will be seen anywhere close to a pub...         
	Nahin, nahin.

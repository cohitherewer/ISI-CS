The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venus charged me up: Serena
                                                                                                                       7                                      Venus charged me up: Serena
                      
	Melbourne: Serena Williams overcame an even-numbered year hoodoo and the fairytale return of an opponent once ranked N0. 1 in the world to claim her 12th Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open on Saturday.         
	The 28-year-old world No. 1, who had won four previous Australian Open titles, in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009, was at her bustling and aggressive best on Saturday, overcoming Justine Henin 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 to snap the jinx.         
	I never thought about it, Williams said of the victory with the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup sitting beside her. I was always okay with winning on the odd years.         
	I was totally okay with losing today (Saturday) or losing in the semis, because it meant that I would win next year. So now I dont know. Im a little nervous. Im like, I dont know if Im going to win next year or not.         
	Williams, who claimed her 11th Grand Slam doubles title with sister Venus on Friday, said the support from her older sibling helped her in the third set.         
	She was really supportive out there today (Saturday). I remember in the third set, I was down, and I heard her say, cmon, Serena. Its okay, right here, right here.         
	That really got me pumped up.         
	Williams was so happy after the match that she made a half-hearted attempt to climb into her box to thank Venus after the match.         
	I was like, okay, thats a hopeless cause. I was thinking about going inside, taking the elevator and then going inside, but theres no way I would have made it.         
	For Henin, Saturday was a bittersweet ending to a fairy-tale run and left her hungry for success in her second career. Of course (Im) disappointed I mean, when you lose in the final of a Grand Slam, especially in three sets, and I got a few opportunities that I wasnt able to take, Henin said.         
	But this feeling of disappointment cannot take advantage on all the things Ive done in the last few weeks. And its just more than what I could expect, I just have to remember that.

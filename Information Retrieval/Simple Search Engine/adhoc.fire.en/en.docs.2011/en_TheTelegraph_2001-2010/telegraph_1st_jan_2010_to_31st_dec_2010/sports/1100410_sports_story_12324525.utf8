The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Momentum with KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                        Momentum with KKR
    - Sourav is fit for crucial tie vs Royal Challengers today           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Will Shane Bond return to the XI?                                 
	Bangalore: If T20 is all about momentum, then that advantage is definitely with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). More reason, then, for the hosts to be wary of a side capable of big things on its day.         
	Clearly, the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) cant bank only on playing at home.         
	Both teams are equal on points, with RCB ahead on the run-rate, and both are desperate for the two points.         
	Tomorrow (Saturday), you will see a side which is determined to stay in the tournament, pointed out RCB senior pro Rahul Dravid, highlighting the significance of the IPL III face-off at the Chinnaswamy.         
	For the record, KKR won the home-leg match, last month, but Sourav Ganguly and his Knights arent putting their feet up. Theres work to be done.         
	Also, nobody has forgotten Brendon McCullums unbeaten 158 in the first edition, which helped KKR rout RCB by 140 runs. But, then, thats history.         
	No team starts as the favourite, nobody is the underdog... Its the performance on the day that matters... Im clear about what we need to do, Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	The good news is that Knight No.1 has recovered from a right ankle problem (he spent much of Friday afternoon applying an ice pack) and wont be sitting out such a crucial game.         
	That the entire KKR camp had been worried over Souravs ankle was reinforced in the morning when, on checking-in at the team hotel, teammates and support staff had just one question: How is it?         
	With so many asking the same question, Sourav spent more time giving the answer (much better) than doing justice to the elaborate breakfast spread at The Cubbon Pavilion.         
	Theres plenty riding on that ankle.         
	Among the more concerned had been coach Dav Whatmore, for whom this is a homecoming of sorts. After all, hed spent a couple of years in Bangalore as director of the National Cricket Academy.         
	No announcement has been made, but the KKR team management is looking at bringing back Shane Bond and omitting Ajantha Mendis, after only one match.         
	The XI in any game cant have more than four players from overseas and that restriction has been causing both headaches and heartburns.         
	Meanwhile, two RCB players, Praveen Kumar and Ranganath Vinay Kumar, whore in the Team India XV for the World T20, didnt practice on Friday. Both were in Chennai to complete visa formalities.         
	Match starts: 8 pm.

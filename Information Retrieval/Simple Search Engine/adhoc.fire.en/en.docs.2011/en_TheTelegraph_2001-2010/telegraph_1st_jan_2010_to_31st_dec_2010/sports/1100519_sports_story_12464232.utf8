	It was a tough season for me, Kaka said. But there is a lot of time until the World Cup for me to get ready. We have examples of players who were not physically fit going into the World Cup but eventually played well, so its not a concern.

	Kakas Brazil teammate Luis Fabiano also arrived in Brazil on Tuesday and also downplayed the injury that is keeping him from playing with Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final on Wednesday.         
	 Its a minor injury, but I didnt want to risk aggravating it, Fabiano said. I wont be fully fit by Friday, but in two weeks I should be fine.         
	Both players will be evaluated and treated at the Sao Paulo club before reporting to Brazils national team on Friday.

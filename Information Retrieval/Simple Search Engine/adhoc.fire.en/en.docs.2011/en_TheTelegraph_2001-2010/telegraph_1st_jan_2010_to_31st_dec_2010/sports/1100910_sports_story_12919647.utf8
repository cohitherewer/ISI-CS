	Calcutta/Johannesburg: Under the watchful eyes of the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), the glitzy Champions League Twenty20 starts Friday with the shadow of the spot-fixing scandal, that has shaken the core of the game, looming large.         
	Featuring the top three Indian Premier League teams and the top two each from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa and the West Indies, the two-week event will open with IPL runners-up Mumbai Indians taking on Highveld Lions (South Africa).         
	Organisers say the tournament will have strict anti-corruption measures in place to ensure that the menace of spot-fixing, which has led to the suspension of three Pakistani cricketers, does not find a mention in the event.         
	Apart from the Mumbai Indians, the other Indian teams in fray are IPL champions Chennai Super Kings and third-place finishers Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Australia will be represented by South Australian Redbacks and Victorian Bushrangers, while South Africa will have the Warriors and Highveld Lions in fray.         
	Central Stags (New Zealand), Wayamba Elevens (Sri Lanka) and Guyana (West Indies) are the other three teams in the field.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis Chennai Super Kings has a formidable line-up of big-hitters such as Matthew Hayden, Mike Hussey, Suresh Raina, Albie Morkel and Justin Kemp.         
	Royal Challengers Bangalore look as though they could be the team to beat. An important point in their favour is the fact that they did very well in the 2009 IPL when it was contested in South Africa. They also have foreign players who should do well in South African conditions in the form of Jacques Kallis, Dale Steyn, and Ross Taylor. To that can be added a South African coach, Ray Jennings, whose local knowledge could be important.         
	Sachin Tendulkars Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, also have a formidable look with their batting having the firepower of South African big-hitter JP Duminy and West Indian Kieron Pollard.         
	We have champions from all cricketing nations, so its as tough as it can get. It is competitive ... and we have world-class players participating, said Tendulkar.         
	The team they face in the tournament-opener, Highveld Lions, can be tagged as the underdogs. Banking on local support and some fireworks from batsmen such as Alviro Petersen and Neil McKenzie to match up to Mumbais might.

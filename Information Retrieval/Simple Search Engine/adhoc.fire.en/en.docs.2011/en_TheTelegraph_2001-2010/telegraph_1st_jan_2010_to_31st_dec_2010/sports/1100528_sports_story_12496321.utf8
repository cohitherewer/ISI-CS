	Essien to miss Cup  
	Accra: Ghana midfielder Michael Essien was ruled out of the World Cup on Thursday after failing to recover from a knee injury. The Chelsea player picked up the injury in January while at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola.   
	An evaluation by a combined team of medical experts from the Ghana Football Association and Chelsea Football Club revealed that Essien will not make full recovery until the end of July, the association said on its website.               
	Work permit  
	London: Britains trade unions are asking companies to let employees watch the World Cup at work to prevent them from faking sickness during England matches. The Trade Union Council says companies should allow TVs in the workplace or introduce flexible working hours.   
	Free flow  
	Brasilia: Brazil has slashed beer duties to avoid shortages during the World Cup, after local brewers warned they would be unable to meet surging demand despite sharply increasing production. The government said on Wednesday it will cut import levies on canned beer to 2 per cent from 16 per cent for the tournament, which Brazil will host in 2014.  
	Malouda wish  
	Lens: Florent Malouda hopes to have the same kind of success with the France in the World Cup that he enjoyed this season with Chelsea. After France beat Costa Rica 2-1 Wednesday, Malouda said that when you have such a great season, where youve shared so much with the fans, you want to experience the same thing with the national team.

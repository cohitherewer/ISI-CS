The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf recalled 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yousuf recalled 
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf has been summoned out of retirement to join the team for the rest of their series in England, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Sunday.         
	A board statement added that uncapped left-arm spinner Raza Hasan, a member of the Pakistan under-19 squad that reached the ICC World Youth Cup final this year, has also been called up.         
	The moves followed Pakistans humiliating 354-run defeat by England on Sunday in the first match of a four-test series.         
	The tour selection committee requested us to rush Yousuf and Reza to England and we are hoping it would be possible for Yousuf to play in the second test starting from Friday, chief selector Mohsin Khan said.         
	There are logistical issues involved in sending Yousuf immediately to England but we are trying our best, as the team management wants him. Yousuf, who turns 36 this month, has played 88 Tests and 282 one-dayers and captained the side in New Zealand and Australia this year.         
	Khan also said leg-spinner Danish Kaneria had been released to play for Essex.           (REUTERS)

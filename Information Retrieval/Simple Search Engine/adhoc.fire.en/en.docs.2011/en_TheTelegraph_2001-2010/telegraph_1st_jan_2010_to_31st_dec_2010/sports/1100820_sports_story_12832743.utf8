	Mason: Roger Federer went through to the third round of the Cincinnati Masters, on Wednesday, in a nearly effortless manner. The world number twos Uzbek opponent Denis Istomin had to retire with an ankle injury when 5-2 down in the first set.         
	Rafael Nadal, meanwhile, urged tournament organisers to make more consistent surfaces for hard court events, after easing past American Taylor Dent 6-2, 7-5 to make the third round. The Spanish world number one came back from 4-2 down in the second set to defeat 83rd-ranked Dent but was unhappy that he had to adjust to a much faster court than last weeks surface in Toronto.         
	It is something (that) in the future the tournaments can work to make the courts more similar, Nadal told reporters.         
	For us, its difficult to adapt, especially if you only have one or two days. When you get to semi-finals or final its not easy to adapt, especially in the beginning of the tournament.         
	So its big change. This first match always is very dangerous, he said.         
	After struggling in the first set, journeyman Dents serve improved noticeably in the second and he threatened to make life complicated for the Spaniard when he broke him to take a 4-2 lead.         
	But Nadal broke twice to go 6-5 up before serving out the match to set up a third-round encounter with Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who defeated Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets.         
	He was joined by third seed Novak Djokovic and fourth seed Andy Murray as the form book proved a reliable guide, despite none of the leading players truly sparkling.         
	Murray needed three sets to deal with Frances Jeremy Chardy, losing his rhythm after winning the opening set 6-3 as his aggressive opponent mixed 53 unforced errors with 44 winners.         
	The Scot lost the second set tiebreak 7-3, but won the third 6-2 after the Frenchman took a medical time-out for foot treatment. Murray agreed that it was tricky to switch to the high-speed court.It can be difficult. You dont have a whole lot of time to get used to the conditions here. Theyre very different. The courts much faster than Toronto and the balls are moving a lot quicker.         
	When you are feeling like that, its kind of difficult to really go for your shots a lot. But I knew I had to in the third set, and played a lot better.         
	Spains Fernando Verdasco was the only surprise victim, losing to 36th-ranked American Mardy Fish.         
	Serbian world number three Novak Djokovic also progressed in straight sets, defeating compatriot Viktor Troicki 6-3, 7-5.           (REUTERS)

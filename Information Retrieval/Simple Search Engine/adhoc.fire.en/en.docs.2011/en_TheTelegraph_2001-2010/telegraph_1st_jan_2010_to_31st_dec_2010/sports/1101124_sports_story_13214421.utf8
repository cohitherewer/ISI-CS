The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus on the right shoulder
                                                                                                                       7                                      Focus on the right shoulder
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nagpur: Sachin Tendulkar hurt his right shoulder not once but twice in the second Test, in Hyderabad, which is why hes been given a break.         
	The same shoulder took two falls and, while I played the final Test, Ive got to give it time to recover, Sachin told The Telegraph on Tuesday, shortly before leaving the city.         
	After an outstanding 10 months of Test cricket, Sachin managed just one fifty in the series, but was pleased with the 1-0 result, achieved earlier in the day. A much needed win (after two draws), he said.         
	Sachin didnt talk about having missed the opportunity to script his 50th Test hundred, in Jamtha, but hed stated the following on the eve of completing 21 years as an International  As I see it, theres more to cricket than 50 Test hundreds... I believe in destiny... Whatever is to happen, will...         
	Even as Sachin was leaving, somebody associated with the Board buttonholed him: Now, Ill have to send you a congratulatory message in South Africa...         
	Sachin doesnt like this attention, or call it hype, but has to live with it. Its a price he has to pay.

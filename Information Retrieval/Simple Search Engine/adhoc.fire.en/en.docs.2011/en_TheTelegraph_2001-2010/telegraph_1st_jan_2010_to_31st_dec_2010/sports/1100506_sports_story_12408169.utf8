The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our focus should be on Asian supremacy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Our focus should be on Asian supremacy
            Stickwork - Gurbux Singh                
	I have been worried, for quite some time, about the absence of fresh faces in the national squad. Now that the selectors have finally chosen youth over experience, I wonder what made them drop the likes of Sandeep Singh, and retain an old warhorse like Prabodh Tirkey, when the job at hand is the defence of the Azlan Shah Cup.         
	The ace drag-flicker was not the only one to get the axe; strikers Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur, too, have been excluded as has goalkeeper Adrian DSouza and midfielder Gurvinder Singh Chandi.         
	All part of the old guard, so to speak. Surprising, though, was the omission of the young Diwakar Ram, who had just graduated to the senior side after a sensational run with the junior team. Frankly, something like this was needed. Moreover, although it was a collective failure, those dropped could not have expected anything better after a below-par performance at the World Cup. So the summons to young blood.         
	But then why recall Prabodh? If the intention is to pick youngsters, then what purpose does this veteran serve? I think Sandeep is a better bet in defence, not to mention in penalty corners, in which he has proven skill.         
	Diwakars reputation, too, stands on his proficiency as a drag-flicker, and he isnt there either. Dhananjay Mahadik is the only established penalty corner specialist in the squad. That, for me, is going one step forward and two steps back. I find this is a 50:50 squad. Half-ageing and half-fledgling.         
	So that is the ingredient at Jose Brasas disposal as he looks to come up with the winning formula for the Azlan Shah Cup and beyond, including the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. We should focus on the latter, for that is the battle for Asian supremacy.         
	The dip in fortunes since our empire in world hockey vanished has disturbed us, and since then, we have looked high and low for solutions. In the meantime, we have also lost our hold over the dominion closest home.         
	Asia has slipped out of our hands. Now we cannot take the field against the likes of South Korea, China, Japan, Malaysia without a slight tingling at the bottom of our spines.         
	Any of these opponents can beat us on their day. Korea, particularly, are far ahead of us. So continental supremacy is of paramount importance. Having fallen, we have to take the ladder a rung at a time and start building from Asia. There is another very practical reason why we, I mean Pakistan, too, must do well in Asia.         
	The current system of qualification for the Olympics and the World Cup is such that now we cannot take participation for granted. We have to deal with the regional threat first, before we take our place at the high table of world hockey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The sun sets on Souravs Knights
                                                                                                                       7                                      The sun sets on Souravs Knights
 KKR end 3rd edition with a 9-wicket victory            KUSHAN SARKAR                      
	Calcutta: As captain Sourav Ganguly and the other Knights took an emotional lap of honour along with principal owner Shah Rukh Khan and his kids Aryan and Suhana  after their nine-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians  a question seemed pertinent. Why does this team flatter to deceive every season?         
	They ended the third edition on a high but the lack of fulfilment was evident as Sourav and Shah Rukh slowly trudged along, acknowledging the standing ovation from their fans. Maybe they did deserve better.         
	The Knights officially bowed out of the third edition of the Indian Premier League the moment Mumbai Indians stand-in-skipper Dwayne Bravo called tails at the toss. He called right and elected to bat, thereby ending the remotest chance the Knights had of making the semis.         
	The target of 134 never appeared a tall order for the Knights. The fans expected a final hurrah from Sourav and Co. and neither did the captain disappoint on Monday. As a result, the Knights finally got lucky on their sixth attempt against the Mumbai Indians, winning by nine wickets and with 15 balls to spare.         
	Sourav, whose contribution on the day was 42 (36 balls, 4x4, 2x6), will surely feel disappointed after having fallen short, by seven runs, of a personal milestone of 500 runs in a single edition.         
	Like in the first edition, Sourav again emerged top run-getter for his team with 493 runs  201 more than the second highest run-getter Chris Gayle (292 runs).         
	The captain started with a six over deep mid-wicket off the third delivery of left-arm spinner Ali Murtaza. With Brendon McCullum for company, Dada ensured there were no hiccups in their pursuit of a final flourish and the 97-run opening partnership was good enough to take the Knights home.         
	McCullum (57 not out) duly completed his first half-century in this edition. Although his was a scratchy knock, the New Zealander played perfect second fiddle to Sourav, curbing his natural propensity for pyrotechnics.         
	With no Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh or Kieron Pollard in the starting line-up, the Mumbai Indians appeared to have justified the dead-rubber description for the tie.         
	The match was over as a contest when the Knights very own 007 struck twice in two overs. Shane Bond looked like the bowler Sourav wanted at the start of the tournament. First, it was wicket-keeper Aditya Tare whose mistimed shot was taken by Murali Kartik at cover after an initial fumble.         
	Shikhar Dhawans dismissal in the third over was a fantastic delivery. Bond dug it in short and it nastily climbed on to Dhawan who was forced to offer his bat only to end up edging it to keeeper Wriddhiman Saha.         
	The Mumbai Indians find of IPL-III, Saurabh Tiwary, and the seasoned Jean-Paul Duminy then came together to add 63 runs for the third wicket. However, they consumed 10 overs in the process. Tiwary (46, 37 balls, 4x4, 1x6) was not in his element. Credit should also be given to Man of the Match Murali Kartik (2/20), David Hussey (0/14 from two overs) and Jaydev Unadkat (1/27) who made sure the Tiwary-Duminy combine was kept in check.         
	The most endearing sight was reserved for the end of the match. Aryan, along with a member of the Knights support staff, walked to the middle of pitch, and then, started tonking anything hurled at him. Maybe the little boy was trying to do what he expected his heroes to do consistently.         
	Pity, Aryan, Suhana and their dad will have to wait one more year.  
	Chances missed by KKR  
	Besides small contributions from most of the domestic players and no outstanding effort from any of the overseas signings, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) let go many moments during their failure to make the semis for the third consecutive time in the Indian Premier League.  
	The following is a chronological summary  
	 Against the Chennai Super Kings at home, they gave away 105 runs in the last 10 overs. Then, an inexplicable batting collapse precipitated the loss.  
	Result: Lost to CSK at the Eden by 55 runs  
	 Against the Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad, the bowlers gave away 22 runs in the last 10 balls. Slow batting by the top-order then complicated the chase.  
	Result: Lost to RR at Motera by 34 runs  
	 Against the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, the top-order failed to put up a big total .  
	Result: Lost to Mumbai Indians at Brabourne by 7 wickets  
	 Against the Delhi DareDevils in Delhi, the bowlers couldnt contain David Warner . The batsmen fared no better.  
	Result: Lost to DD at the Kotla by 40 runs  
	 Against the Kings XI Punjab at home, the bowling hit another low as they failed to defend 200. Became the turning point.  
	Result: Lost to KXIP at the Eden by 8 wickets  
	 Against the Royal Challengers Bangalore away, the middle-order collapsed after the top-order gathered 100 in 11 overs.   
	Result: Lost to RCB at the Chinnaswamy by 7 wickets  
	 Against CSK in Chennai, poor batting by the top-order and poor team combination put paid to their hopes.  
	Result: Lost to CSK at the Chepauk by 9 wickets

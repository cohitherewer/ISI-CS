The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1990s: Exit Diego, enter Zidane
                                                                                                                       7                                        1990s: Exit Diego, enter Zidane

	Soccer in the 90s saw the rise of some of the extraordinary exponents of the modern game. But that was juxtaposed with a backdrop of gloom which marked the end of an era known as Diego Armando Maradona.   
	So while the Romarios, Ronaldos and Zinedine Zidanes danced on the ball to enthrall millions, the receding footsteps of Maradona --- in the 1994 World Cup --- were hard to go unnoticed. More so because of the manner in which the Argentine legend was forced to bid good bye to his art.  
	 The 15th edition of the World Cup in rsquo;94 was in the United States --- a choice which surprised (irked to be precise) many. While fears of less crowd attendance, due to the lack of game rsquo;s popularity in the land of baseball, loomed large on the horizons, the Cup marked a record number of people thronging the stadiums. But a couple of unfortunate events marred the euphoria surrounding the tournament.   
	 First it was the expulsion of Maradona after playing only two games. He was sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping. Argentina, rocked by shock, were eliminated in the second round.  
	 The second incident was the murder of Colombian defender Andreas Escobar. Colombia, who disappointed despite high expectations, were eliminated when Escobar scored an own goal in a group stage match against the US which they lost 1-2. Ten days later Escobar was shot dead outside a bar in the Medellin suburb.  
	 The final, between Brazil and Italy, at the Rose Bowl was devoid of scoring chances and both teams failed to produce a goal. After 120 goalless minutes, the World Cup was decided for the first time by a penalty shootout. After four rounds, Brazil led 3-2, and Roberto Baggio had to score to keep Italy rsquo;s hopes alive. He missed by shooting it over the bar, and Brazil were crowned champions. The Brazilian national team dedicated the title to the deceased Brazilian F1 champion Ayrton Senna, who had died two and a half months prior.  
	 The tournament rsquo;s Golden Boot went jointly to Bulgaria rsquo;s Hristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko of Russia, who scored a record five goals in their match against Cameroon. Both players scored six goals in the tournament. Brazil rsquo;s Rom aacute;rio, with five goals, won the Golden Ball as the tournament rsquo;s best player.  
	 In 1998, France hosted the Cup and won it. For the first time ever, the final featured the host nation and the defending champions. Zidane scored two headers from corners in the 27th minute and in first half stoppage time, and Emmanuel Petit added a late goal in second half stoppage time to give France a 3-0 win over Brazil. An estimated one million people took to the Paris streets to celebrate through the night. France became seventh country to have won the World Cup, joining Uruguay, Italy, Germany, Brazil, England and Argentina.  
	 The golden goal rule was introduced in rsquo;98 to decide knockout matches which went into extra time. Another change in the rules came into effect at this World Cup, stating that as regulation time was about to expire in any period of play the fourth official would use a handheld electronic display to show how many minutes of stoppage time were to be played.  
	 The ZIZOU ZING  
	 Amidst a host of Brazilian stars --- Romario, Roberto Carlos, Rivaldo and Ronaldo --- who lit up the decade, a Frenchman outshone everyone with the brightness of his brilliance. Widely regarded as the one of the game rsquo;s all time greats, Zidane rsquo;s artistry was the key behind the French success in rsquo;98. A playmaker of the highest order, he was equally dangerous near the goalmouth. After being sent off in second match of the tournament, against Saudi Arabia, Zidane returned to inspire a team of hard-workers to triumph.  
	 MEMORABLE MATCH  
	 The rsquo;98 final was eventful both on and off the field. With pre-match debates classifying the encounter as a battle between Ronaldo and Zidane, the world waited anxiously for the showdown. The night before the final, he suffered a convulsive fit. At first Ronaldo was removed from the starting line-up 72 minutes before the match, but he requested to play and was later reinstated by coach Mario Zagallo. Ronaldo did not perform well and he was injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zidane, on the other hand, scored two to be the darling of the French fans.  
	 TRIVIA  
	 Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta, nicknamed Batigol, achieved the unique honour of scoring hattricks in back-to-back World Cups - 1994 and 1998. However, there was a strange coincidence, in fact more than one, connecting both the occasions. He scored the hattricks on the same date (June 21, 1994 and June 21, 1998) and against opponents (Greece and Jamaica) who were World Cup debutants then. Moreover, on both the occasions the third goal came from a penalty kick.

	Sydney: Triple Olympic swimming gold medallist Stephanie Rice has lost an endorsement contract with luxury carmaker Jaguar over a homophobic slur she made on Twitter.         
	The 22-year-old Rice tweeted the derogatory remark after Australias last-minute win over South Africa in a rugby union test match at Bloemfontein on Saturday.         
	Rice, who reportedly is dating Australia flyhalf Quade Cooper, later deleted the tweet and apologised, saying she didnt mean to cause offence.         
	We have terminated our agreement with her, Jaguar spokesman Mark Eedle said in comments. Its to do with how we want to associate our brand and unfortunately this ... is not an association we want to have going forward.         
	Rice has other endorsement deals with an underwear brand, a swimwear brand and a telco.         
	Rice, who won three gold medals at the Beijing Olympics, underwent surgery last week for a chronic shoulder problem and will miss next months Commonwealth Games in India.         
	The Australian swimmer was the second high-profile athlete in as many days to be sanctioned over comments made on Twitter.         
	Englands Kevin Pietersen was fined Monday for making a profane comment on the micro blogging site. The England and Wales Cricket Board said the comments were a breach of the conditions of his employment, but declined to reveal details of the fine.         
	Pietersen had already deleted and apologised for the content of his message, relating to his omission from the England squad for a limited-overs series against Pakistan.

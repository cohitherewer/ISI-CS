The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muralis record will stand, feels Warne
                                                                                                                       7                                        Muralis record will stand, feels Warne
                              
	Melbourne: Legendary Australian spinner Shane Warne showered accolades on Muttiah Muralidharan, describing the Sri Lankan as one of the games great competitors whose world record of Test wickets will be hard to be broken.         
	I dont think it will ever be broken. Even though, so much more Test cricket is played these days, I think Muralis record will stand for a long, long time and probably forever, Warne said.         
	You just have to work it out by numbers. For that record to be broken, someone has to play 140-150 Tests and take 5-6 wickets per Test match. That will take some doing, he was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	Warne said that it was unfortunate that Murali had always been dogged by drama over his bowling action but felt the Sri Lankan was not a chucker.         
	Muralis action has been passed by scientific tests. I always thought, it was probably legitimate. But because of the way he bowled, I was worried that young spinners would try to copy his action and end up bowling illegally, said the Australian.         
	Murali simply loved bowling  he loved challenges and was fantastic for the game. Sometimes, he would pick my brain about different things and, although we always tried to outdo each other, we always got on well, he said.         
	Warne has 708 wickets while Murali is eight away from 800 wickets.           (PTI)

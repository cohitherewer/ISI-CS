	London: On the eve of his first Test as captain, Shahid Afridi insisted on Monday that his Pakistan side is united and that the disciplinary issues that marred the Australia tour seven months ago are a thing of the past.         
	Pakistan meet Australia  who have not lost a Test to Pakistan for 15 years  at Lords on Tuesday in the first of two Test matches. The matches will be played at a neutral venue, but are considered a home series for Pakistan, who are playing their home internationals on neutral territory because of ongoing concerns about the security of teams touring the country.         
	As a captain, I am trying to keep the guys as close as I can, Afridi said. Normally, I will take the boys for a dinner together. The communication problem is not there any more now.         
	Afridi acknowledged his teams lack of experience but is confident the youngsters can perform given an opportunity. Although Afridi said the team will not be named until Tuesday, Azhar Ali and Umar Amin are expected to make their Test debuts.         
	For Afridi and Pakistan it is a fresh start. Afridi is playing his first Test in four years while Pakistans previous Test series was a 0-3 defeat in Australia. Several sanctions were meted out to players following that tour for disciplinary infractions.         
	Ricky Ponting said he was not aware of the infighting among the Pakistanis when they played in December and January, but he is aware of the issues they have had to contend with.         
	You never know but they are a team which is renowned for having their up and down days, Ponting said. (Agencies)

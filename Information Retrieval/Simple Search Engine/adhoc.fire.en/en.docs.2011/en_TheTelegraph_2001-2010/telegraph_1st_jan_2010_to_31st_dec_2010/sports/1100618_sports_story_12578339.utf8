The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hattrick treat from Higuain 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hattrick treat from Higuain 
  - Messi dazzles in 4-1 win over S. Korea
            JAYDEEP BASU                                            Gonzalo Higuains three goals during Argentinas World Cup Group B match against South Korea at Soccer City, in Johannesburg, on Friday. (Reuters)      
	Johannesburg: Now Argentina coach Diego Maradona can count clairvoyance among his many awe-inspiring talents.         
	On Wednesday, the Argentina coach predicted an easy win over South Korea and more goals from his team. His words came true on Thursday when Argentina stormed to a huge 4-1 victory in a Group B match at Soccer City.         
	So mesmerising was Argentinas domination that even their hard-to-please coach could not help but be impressed by the sight of his wards artfully tearing apart the South Korean defence. Gonzalo Higuain had three goals, the first hattrick in the World Cup since 2002, after Lionel Messis free-kick had caused the Koreans to concede an own goal as the Albiceleste took firm control of their group with six points.         
	The capacity crowd at Soccer City, a majority of whom were Argentina fans, was truly entertained by Messi, Higuain and Carlos Tevez, whose creativity and skills in the attacking third constantly kept the Asian giants on their toes.         
	But with Argentina leading 2-0, a horrible defensive lapse from Martin Demichelis allowed Lee Chung-yong to pull one back for South Korea.         
	Maradonas strategy was plain and simple. As against Nigeria, on Thursday, too, he went in with three talented forwards. The 4-3-3 set up created plenty of chances and had the South Korean defence in all sorts of trouble. South Korea switched to a 4-5-1 formation with more emphasis on defending but Huh Jung-moos attempt of countering the rampaging Argentines with pace and work-rate proved of little help.         
	The South Korea coach was definitely a nervous man. Otherwise, he wouldnt have left out right-back Cha Du-ri and opted instead for Oh Beom-Seok, the man who has the nickname king of fouls in Korea.         
	The match belonged as much to Higuain as to Messi. Given his track record for the Spanish giants in the past two seasons, it was surprising to see him miss out as an automatic choice in the first XI. But, after Thursdays show, he cannot be ignored any more.         
	Higuain became only the third Argentine to score a hattrick at a World Cup after Guillermo Stabile and Gabriel Batistuta and the first since Portugals Pauleta in 2002.         
	Argentina opened the scoring in the 16th minute when Messi delivered a telling cross from a free-kick which was turned in for an own goal. Park Chu-Yong was the unlikely hero for Argentina.         
	The Higuain show began in the 33rd minute. South Korea once again conceded a free-kick in the same area and, after a few touches, the ball was played in by Maxi Rodriguez, being further flicked on for Higuain by substitute Nicolas Burdisso. The unmarked Higuain calmly headed it past the Korean keeper.         
	The Koreans were surely hoping to make a comeback in the second half, especially after getting a goal in the dying minutes of the first session. But two more goals by Argentina in a span of four minutes took the game away from them.         
	Messi was everywhere but on the scoresheet. He ran through the middle of the South Korean defence and unleashed a low left-footer that was blocked. When he went in with another attempt, it was Higuain who got the goal after the 2009 World Player of the Years shot came off the post.         
	Four minutes later, Messi picked up the ball in the middle and lobbed it for substitute Sergio Aguero on the left. More famous as Maradonas son-in-law, Aguero, who came on in the 75th minute and had a good game, crossed the ball for Higuian to head home.

	Nyon: Uefa charged Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho with unsporting conduct Thursday over allegations he ordered two players to get themselves sent off in a Champions League match.         
	Uefas disciplinary committee will investigate Mourinho as well as players Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos, Iker Casillas and Jerzy Dudek. Their cases will be heard November 30.         
	Mourinho appeared to send instructions from the bench before Alonso and Ramos received second yellow cards for time-wasting late in Tuesdays 4-0 win against Ajax in Amsterdam.         
	Their expulsions meant they should serve one-match suspensions in a meaningless group match against Auxerre next month, then start the knockout rounds in February with a clean slate.         
	On Tuesday, Mourinho dismissed the idea that he had orchestrated the bookings. (agencies)

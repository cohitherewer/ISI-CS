The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sneijder, fortunes favourite 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sneijder, fortunes favourite 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Cape Town: Fortune is smiling obsequiously on Wesley Sneijder. With 20 minutes left of this World Cup semi-final he hit a shot in one direction that took a deflection off Maxi Pareira in another, grazed Robin van Persies shins and spun agonisingly around the outstretched glove of a diving Fernando Muslera and into the net. He had done it again.         
	Having headed the winner against Brazil in the quarter final, Fifa had even retrospectively decided to reward him further by giving him the Dutch equaliser too, even though it had looked a clear own goal by Felipe Melo. Somebody is looking out for him.         
	Tuesday nights goal, Sneijders fifth of the competition, took him level with David Villa at the top of the scoring charts. In a season when he has won Serie A, the Italian Cup and the Champions League, could he also add the World Cup, the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot? It would be an incredible sweep.         
	A year ago and Sneijder was seen as a useful item for Real Madrid to pawn in order to buy themselves a real galactico. Unwittingly they created one.         
	There was always a lot expected of Sneijder when he was growing up in Utrecht. Small and slight he had superhuman spatial awareness and was elegant off both feet. There was only one place for him to go: Ajax, footballs finest finishing school. The context of those early days at Ajax were key to his development as Ronald Koeman brought him into the team.         
	At 18 Sneijder was a gaunt, shy boy with enormous potential. Eight years on he is one of the most celebrated footballers, with a celebrity girlfriend to boot. While most of his teammates are settled types, Sneijder grew to enjoy the party scene and developed a cockiness. It was evident last night. When Martin Caceres accidentally overhead kicked Demy De Zeeuw in the face, Sneijder was first on the scene, confronting the Uruguayan. Caceres threw himself to the ground and Diego Perez tried to con the referee into thinking Sneijder had thrown an elbow.         
	It was a sign of how desperate Uruguay were to get rid of him. Occasionally, his passing is too good for his teammates. He has certainly picked up the big-time behaviour that a player of his stature revels in  a fine line in exasperated pouting with hands on hips. It is little surprise then that his brazenness can rub his teammates up the wrong way. Still, his ego will be happily indulged if he can inspire Holland to their first World Cup triumph.

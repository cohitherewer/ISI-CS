The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif sets record straight
                                                                                                                       7                                      Asif sets record straight
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Asif Saturday clarified that he had withdrawn his appeal to lift the provisional suspension as he got the documents late from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and not because there was incriminating evidence against him in the spot fixing scandal.         
	Asif said further steps in the matter would be taken after his lawyers go through the details of the documents provided by the sports world governing body.         
	Asif surprised the cricket world Friday by withdrawing his challenge to the ICC suspension, which was due to be heard later this month in Doha, Qatar.         
	I simply decided to withdraw my appeal for now because we got the complete documents relating to the matter late from the ICC and my lawyers want to make a proper and detailed case to the allegations and suspension, Asif said.         
	I have not given up my intentions of challenging these allegations against me. I am innocent and I have done nothing wrong. We will file a detailed explanation not only against the suspension but also against the spot-fixing allegations.         
	The reports (incriminating evidence against him) are untrue. We made the decision because the lawyers need more time to contest the case, the pacer added.         
	Asif, who got married recently, returned from London after meeting with his lawyers.         
	The ICC announced Friday that Asif had withdrawn his challenge to the provisional suspension imposed on him on September 2, pending determination of the charges brought against him under the ICCs Anti-Corruption Code.         
	Asif, fellow pace bowler Mohammed Aamer and Test captain Salman Butt were banned from playing by the ICC for allegedly agreeing to bowl deliberate no balls in the fourth Test, against England, in August. Aamer and Butt are still appealing their bans.         
	I have got married recently and I am starting a new life. The advice I got was not to rush things and take time in dealing with these issues, Asif added.         
	I am confident I will make a comeback to Pakistan cricket. It has given me a lot, the pacer said. (PTI)

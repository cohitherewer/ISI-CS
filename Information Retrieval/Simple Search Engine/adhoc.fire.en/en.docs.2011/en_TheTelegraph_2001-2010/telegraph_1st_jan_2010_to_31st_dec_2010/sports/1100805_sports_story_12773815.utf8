            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF), on Wednesday, decided to go ahead with its plan to launch an U-19 team in the I-League for the next four years despite vehement protests from the majority of the clubs.         
	According to sources, the clubs were against the formation of U-19 team, but AIFF president Praful Patel had his way saying the move would help the budding players to showcase their talent.         
	While it was made clear that two relegated teams  Sporting Clube de Goa and Lajong FC, wont be retained in the top tier, no satisfactory answer was given on the question whether the U-19 team would be in the relegation bracket during its four-year stay in the league, an AIFF source said.         
	The clubs also made a plea that the rule of playing three foreigners and one Asian player for the I-League should also be applicable in all other tournaments. Though the AIFF brass agreed to this request on principle, a final call will be taken by the executive committee.         
	In the meeting, the federation also clarified its stand saying coaches not possessing the AFC A license would not be allowed to train the I-League clubs anymore.         
	The other decisions taken were:         
	 14-team I-League from November 20         
	 Federation Cup in September-October         
	 Delhi based AIFF U-19 team for I-League         
	 Sporting Clube de Goa and Lajong wont be retained in top tier         
	 Only AFC A license holder coaches will be allowed to coach in I-League

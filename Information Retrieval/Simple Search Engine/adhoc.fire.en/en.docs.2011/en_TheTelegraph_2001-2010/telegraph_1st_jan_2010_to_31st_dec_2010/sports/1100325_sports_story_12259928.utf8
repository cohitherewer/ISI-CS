	 Calcutta Customs Club on Wednesday intimated the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) that they were ready for a re-match of their first division league encounter against Kumartuli which was abandoned due to an umpiring error.      
	The two umpires, Subhranil Pakrashi and Supriyo Sarkar, had a miscommunication when one ruled dead ball and the other didnt hear the call. The last Kumartuli batsman was run-out.       
	While Customs claimed a victory, the umpires wanted to revoke the decision after consultation which wasnt acceptable to the club. After the two umpires admitted their fault before the tournament committee, it was decided that the match would be replayed.       
	Customs, though, were not ready to for a replay. However with the league being indefinitely postponed, Customs agreed for the replay.

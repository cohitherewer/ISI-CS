	New Delhi: East Bengal made the semi-finals of the Durand Cup after a gap of six years but not before Salgaocar gave them a scare at the Ambedkar Stadium on Monday. In the semi-final on Thursday, East Bengal will play either Pune FC or Chirag United.         
	Needing just one point for a place in the last four, the Calcutta team won 2-1 after trailing by a goal till the 61st minute.         
	The match also saw their key midfielder Mehtab Hossain earning a yellow card, his second in the tournament, to find himself out of the semi-finals.         
	Its a huge blow we will really miss Mehtab, said East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan.         
	Mehtab is in excellent form and is playing a vital role in every match, said the coach, who looked disappointed even after his team registered the 18th straight win of the season.         
	Morgan was spot-on. The diminutive Mehtab is a vital cog in the East Bengal wheel and Monday was no exception.         
	He was the mastermind behind behind every positive move, including the match-winner in the 67th minute.         
	It was a gem off a through pass from Mehtab that was intercepted by Aussie striker Tolgay Ozebe inside the area before sending it past the goalkeeper Arnab Das Sharma.         
	To make it worse, striker Robin Singh also suffered a cut on the head when he collided with defender Khelemba Metei early in the match and had to be replaced by Budiram Tudu at the breather.         
	The East Bengal coach also informed that midfielder Vashum, who was hit on the back of his right knee against Air India, would be out of action for two weeks.         
	Credit should go to Salgaocar for being able to break East Bengals rhythm for the major part of the first half.         
	They took the lead in the 30th minute when veteran Yusif Yakubu rushed in to head home a flag kick by Rocus Lamare and did not allow the East Bengal midfield to function in their usual smooth style.         
	Conceding early goals is becoming bit of a problem for us, admitted Morgan. I dont know why it is happening. We also made a lot of mispasses.         
	At half time I asked them to concentrate and reduce such mistakes, the coach added.         
	In the second half, East Bengal were more organised and were finally able to reduce the margin in the 61st minute from a spot kick after Tolgay was brought down by Metei.         
	Sanju Pradhan, who made the starting line up in place of Vashum, struck home with confidence.         
	Salgaocar coach Karim Bencharifa said he would praise his boys despite the defeat.         
	We played good football in the middle and matched East Bengal in every move. They won 18 matches in a row but this probably was their toughest encounter, he said.         
	In the other match, JCT beat Garhwal Heroes 2-1 to enter semi-finals where they will meet Churchill Brothers on Wednesday.         
	While Keke Ibrahim scored both goals for JCT, Kamal Rawat was the marksman for the Delhi team.         
	Teams         
	East Bengal: Sandip Nandy; Naoba Singh, Nirmal Chetri, Uga Okpara and Saumik Dey; Sanju Pradhan, Mehtab Hossain, Penn Orji (Sushant Mathew, 76th) and Harmanjit Singh Khabra; Tolgay Ozebe (Ekene Ekenewa, 80th) and Robin Singh (Budiram Tudu, 46th).

	Referee: Bikramjit Purokayastha.

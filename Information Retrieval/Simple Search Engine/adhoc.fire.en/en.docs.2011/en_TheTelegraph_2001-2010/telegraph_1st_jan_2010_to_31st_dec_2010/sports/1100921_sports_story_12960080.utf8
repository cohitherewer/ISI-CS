	Madrid: Lionel Messi will miss Barcelonas next two La Liga matches and may be out for longer after spraining his ankle in Sundays 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid, the Spanish club said on Monday.         
	Tests confirmed ligament damage to the Argentina forwards right ankle and he will be unavailable for the home game against Sporting Gijon on Wednesday and Saturdays trip to Athletic Bilbao, Barca said on their website.         
	Messi was taken off on a stretcher in added time at the Calderon after he was felled by a bad tackle from Czech defender Tomas Ujfalusi.         
	Ujfalusi was shown a straight red for the challenge, which has revived debate in Spain about whether players like Messi and Real Madrids Cristiano Ronaldo need special protection from referees.         
	Messis participation in Barcas Champions League match at Rubin Kazan on September 29 will depend on his recovery, Barca said.         
	The test carried out on Monday also confirmed there was no damage to the bone.         
	Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola called the teams performance spectacular against an aggressive and intense Atletico.         
	We are very pleased with the win but sad about the injury to Leo (Messi), he added.         
	Meanwhile, managing Real Madrid is like reaching the moon, Jose Mourinho said on Monday, and he now wants to have a management career that is as long as that of his former Premier League rival Alex Ferguson.         
	Portuguese Mourinho left Chelsea in 2007 and joined Serie A club Inter Milan a year later before moving on to Real at the end of last season. He marks 10 years in coaching on Monday, during which he won the Champions League with Porto in 2004 and with Inter last term.         
	These 10 years have passed very quickly, Mourinho said at a news conference ahead of Reals La Liga match at home to Espanyol on Tuesday.         
	I think Ill be like Ferguson. Ill be 70-years-old and still have the passion for coaching.         
	The 47-year-old is bidding to become the first coach to win Europes elite club competition with three different clubs and said managing La Liga giants Real was like reaching the moon.         
	Its the most important club on a global level, he said.         
	Its reaching the top of the top but I still have not won anything. Lets see how the story ends. Its a story I have to construct. (Agencies)

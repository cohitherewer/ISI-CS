The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf blames it on Twenty20 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yousuf blames it on Twenty20 
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Mohammed Yousuf, continuing his tirade against Twenty20, Thursday blamed the proliferation of this format for his teams bizarre defeat in the Sydney Test against Australia.         
	Chasing 176 for victory, Pakistan imploded in their second innings for just 139 and Yousuf had no doubt that some of the players are interested only in Twenty20 and lacked the Test match temperament.         
	We had a golden chance to finally beat Australia in Australia and we let it go ourselves due to poor batting. I think the target of 176 runs was perfectly gettable on the Sydney pitch, Yousuf said.         
	I get a feeling that most of the players are more interested in playing T20 cricket. There is no doubt that T20 cricket is affecting the ability of batsmen to play long innings in Tests, he said.           (PTI)

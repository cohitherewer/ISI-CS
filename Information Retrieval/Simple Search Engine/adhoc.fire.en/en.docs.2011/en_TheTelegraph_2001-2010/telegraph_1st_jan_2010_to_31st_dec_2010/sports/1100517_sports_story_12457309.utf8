	Ipoh: Defending champions India and South Korea were declared joint winners of the Sultan Azlan Shah hockey tournament as the summit clash between the two teams was called off due to rain here.         
	The final match was abandoned after six minutes of play as the heavy showers lashed the turf. India had lost only one match, against Malaysia, en route to final.         
	This is the first time in the history of the tournament, which began in 1983, that there have been joint winners. Indian defender Sardar Singh was adjuged the best player of the tournament. The Indian team management, when called by the FIH tournament director Paul Richards, expressed the desire to be given the winners trophy since they had topped the seven team round-robin league with 13 points as well as having beaten the Koreans 3-2 at that stage.         
	However, it was decided to give the winners cup to both the teams. This was the fifth time that India have won the title while Koreans grabbed their second.         
	World champions Australia scored a hard-fought 5-3 victory over Malaysia to win the bronze         
	Meanwhile, midfield trio of Arjun Halappa, Sardar Singh and Gurbaj Singh were included in the Azlan Shah XI which was named after the end of the tournament. (PTI)

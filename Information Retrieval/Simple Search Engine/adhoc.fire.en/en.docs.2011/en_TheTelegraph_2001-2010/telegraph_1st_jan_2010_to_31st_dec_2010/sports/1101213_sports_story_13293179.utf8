            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Penn Orji (in front) and Sanju Pradhan celebrate after the former scored against AIFF XI, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: AIFF XI were not up to scratch against a fighting East Bengal whose second-half fusillade drowned the visitors hopes of a draw, at least, in their third I-League encounter, here, Sunday.         
	East Bengals 4-0 win over the youngsters gave them some bragging rights as it provided them the safety cushion with three straight wins in the championship so far.         
	It was one of the home teams most convincing performances despite being held to a goalless first half.         
	Four goals in little less than 30 minutes in the second session speaks volumes, and despite being pitted against a young and energetic team, the red and gold brigade figured the chink in the AIFF XI armour and rattled them with attacking football.         
	Robin Singh, Penn Orji and Tolgay Ozebe got their names on the score-sheet. The home side were propelled by the energy of Sanju Pradhan and, Penn, who doubled up as the third striker.         
	Robin and Tolgay were equally exciting in their understanding and individual brilliance, though the latter could have bettered his tally of a singular goal.         
	There were wobbles in the AIFF XI defence as the likes of Raju Gaikwad, Inder Preet Singh, Abhishek Das and Lal Rozama failed to patrol the back line and allowed Penn to sneak in.         
	In a move in the 51st minute, Sanju picked up Penn unmarked and moving wide down the right channel. The Nigerian matched his pace with Robin and squared it timely enough for the latter to stab it in.         
	AIFF XI looked completely disoriented after the strike and the scares, which were few and far between in the first half, started coming with an alarming regularity.         
	The visitors misery worsened when Penn doubled the lead in the 69th minute. Six minutes later, Robin had the visitors in more trouble. He scored from a spectacular solo effort, running at least 30 yards.         
	After receiving the ball, the East Bengal striker turned sharply and ran diagonally before slotting a clinical left-footer into the corner of the net.         
	Tolgay finally scored in the 80th minute. Penn aimed his cheeky chip off a throw-in at Tolgay. In fact, had he been lucky, the Aussie could have got the home team ahead by three goals inside the first 30 minutes.         
	East Bengal have nine points from three matches while AIFF XI have one point from as many games.

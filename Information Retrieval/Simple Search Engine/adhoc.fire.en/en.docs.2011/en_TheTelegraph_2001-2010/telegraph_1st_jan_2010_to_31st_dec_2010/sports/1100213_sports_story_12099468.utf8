            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Mehtab Hossain and Raja Sheikh of Calcutta Customs during their CFL Premier Division match                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal, in a span of three days, fell from the peak of dominance to the pits of mediocrity in the CFL Premier division. In stark contrast to their 5-0 drubbing of Peerless SC on Wednesday, the red and gold brigade, on Friday, at the Salt Lake Stadium, had to be satisfied with a 1-1 draw against Calcutta Customs.         
	But the quality of the opposition didnt matter as much in the change of fate as did the sea of missed chances by the East Bengal players.         
	Belgian Phillippe de Ridder didnt have any of the foreign recruits in his scheme of things on the day.         
	However, that didnt appear to affect his boys performance on the pitch as, in the very second minute, Harmanjyot Singh Khabra released a potentially dangerous centre from the right edge of the box. Sanju Pradhan was at the right place but failed to time his jump to perfection.         
	East Bengal were playing with Bijen Singh as the lone forward while Khabra and Pradhan were operating from just behind him.         
	The Federation Cup champions were caught off-guard when, in the 39th minute, Raja Sheikh headed the ball in off a Krishna Das centre to give Customs the lead.         
	Customs glory was short-lived though, as Bijens header from a Pradhan free-kick restored parity for East Bengal in the injury time before the breather.

	Lahore: Pakistan government announced that the country will honour Rohan Bopanna along with his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi for their performance in US Open.         
	Governor Salmaan Taseer informed, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari have consented to my proposal and both players will soon be rewarded for their feat.         
	Meanwhile, Qureshi said he would not mind playing against his good friend in exhibition matches to raise funds for the flood victims.         
	The Pakistani people have seen so much misery and problems in recent times, I am just happy that I could give them some joy and happiness. If these matches are on I am definitely game for it, he said.           (AGENCIES)

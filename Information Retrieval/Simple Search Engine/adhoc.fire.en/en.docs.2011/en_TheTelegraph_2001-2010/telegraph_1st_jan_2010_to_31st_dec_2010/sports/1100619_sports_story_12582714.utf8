The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas have   a solid start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Proteas have   a solid start
                            
	Basseterre: Alviro Petersen hit 52 and captain Graeme Smith contributed an unbeaten 45 as South Africa dominated the morning session on day one of the second Test against the West Indies Friday.         
	The visitors, after winning the toss at Warner Park, went in at lunch on 104 for one.         
	Petersen struck three fours and two sixes before top-edging a sweep off Shane Shillingfords off-spin to be brilliantly caught at deep square leg by Kemar Roach just before the break.         
	Petersen and Smith had quickly dulled a lethargic West Indies attack when play began under overcast conditions.         
	Pace bowler Roach struggled in a four-over opening spell, delivering six no-balls.         
	West Indies skipper Chris Gayle introduced spin in the sixth over but the South Africans hardly played a false stroke.         
	The openers added 99 before Shillingford broke through to provide some comfort for the home team.         
	Smith went to lunch five away from a half century.         
	The left-hander struck five fours and a six in his 87- ball innings.         
	 His partner Hashim Amla was yet to score.         
	Shillingford took one for 21 off six overs.           (AGENCIES)

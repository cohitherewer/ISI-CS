  - Contrasting reactions from Chirag duo Eduardo and Denson after seeing red       A STAFF REPORTER            Chirag United players heckle referee Minangshu Bhattacharjee during the CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Similar decisions, but two opposite reactions.         
	Referee Minangshu Bhattacharjee could have hardly imagined that within seconds, he would get radically opposite reactions from Chirag United players Denson Devadas and Eduardo Chacon after giving them marching orders.         
	If Denson surprised one and all planting a cynical peck on referees cheek, Eduardo Chacon was at his aggressive best as he gave a tight slap to Minangshu while protesting the dubious penalty.         
	He deserved to be kissed after what he did. I kissed him and told aapne marwa diya. (You have killed us). Our challenge died once we were reduced to nine men. It was a return gift for the penalty and the cards he presented us, Denson said as he was about to leave the stadium.         
	Its natural for losing sides to vent their ire against the referee. But if Chirag United players and their coach Subrata Bhattacharya were left sulking, they had every reason to be.         
	You can say that the referee robbed us from what could have been history. Eduardo is confident that he didnt tackle the opponent player from behind (even the TV replays confirmed that). These are pressure matches. A power stoppage for 25 minutes and then you end up getting a bad decision. I know that players shouldnt have reacted that way but they are also human beings. They were less than 25 minutes away from creating history, Subrata who looked emotionally exhausted said at the post match conference.         
	Did he apprehend something like this? The moment referee showed three yellow cards to Bagan players, I knew something is wrong. He was just trying to put up a faade of being fair. I told my boys at the break that be careful and dont concede a penalty. My worst fears came true. I know how it works for the big clubs after being in Maidan for three and half decades.         
	His opposite number Biswajit Bhattacharya also blamed the referee for poor supervision. The goal that Souvik scored was a legitimate one. Plus he didnt give my players enough time to warm-up. The result was a quadriceps injury sustained by Barreto due to lack of warm-up.         
	Match commissioner Bikash Mukherjee confirmed that there was a total 28 minutes (25 for power failure and three minutes for brawl) of stoppage of play.         
	Mukherjee, however, confirmed that a power cut in Salt Lake and its adjoining areas led to the 25-minute break. Asked about the behaviour of the Chirag players, Mukherjee said: I will write everything that I have seen. Dont forget, I wasnt afraid of reporting against a star player during my refereeing days (It was Mukherjee report that sealed the fate of Cheema Okeries playing career in India in early 2000).         
	Asked about quality of supervision, he answered: Thats a confidential thing.         
	IFA general secretary Utpal Ganguli said that the association will act only after getting match commissioner and referees report.         
	Meanwhile, the Chirag authorities may demand for a replay which is likely to be shot down.

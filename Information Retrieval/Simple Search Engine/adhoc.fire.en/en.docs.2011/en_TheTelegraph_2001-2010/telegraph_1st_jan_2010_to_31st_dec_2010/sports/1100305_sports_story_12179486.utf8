            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Englands Katherine Brunt celebrates the winning run as Indians fail to run her out, in Mumbai, on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Indian women failed to hold their nerves in the death overs once again as England snatched a last-ball victory in the first T20 International at the MCA ground here.         
	Having set the visitors a competitive target of 126, the Indians did well to narrow down the rivals chase to two runs off the last ball, with two wickets remaining.         
	But left-arm spinner Gouher Sultana then attempted a direct hit at the non-strikers end as Nicola Shaw and Katherine Brunt scampered for a single, and what resulted was an overthrow, giving Charlotte Edwards team a thrilling win.         
	England had wriggled out of a similarly tight situation to win the fifth one-dayer, played earlier this week, although the hosts won the series 3-2.         
	The visitors owed Thursdays win to Jenny Gunn, whose top score of 34 lifted them from 68/4 and then helped consolidate after the dismissals of Laura Marsh and Danielle Wyatt off successive balls. The Indian camp would also be worried about the ineffectiveness of medium pacer Amita Sharma, whose two overs cost 17 runs, and also to some extent, skipper Jhulan Goswami, whom Gunn hit for a six.         
	They got runs at the start, we came back into the match, but one costly over by me made Englands task easier. It happens in a tight game and all you can do is perform well in the remaining matches, Goswami said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Woakes replaces Stuart Broad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England, on Friday, named its T20 squad to be led by Paul Collingwood and the ODI squad to be skippered Andrew Strauss for the forthcoming series against Australia.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Warwickshire bowler Chris Woakes was the only uncapped player named in the squad and Craig Kieswetter, Luke Wright, Michael Yardy and James Tredwell would join him for the two T20 matches. Woakes will replace the injured Stuart Broad.         
	England national selector Geoff Miller said that while England remained focussed on winning the Ashes, which it leads 1-0 after two Tests, they are excited by the prospect of taking on Australia in the limited-overs format as they are amongst the best in the world in the shorter form of the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gelson basks in goal glory
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gelson basks in goal glory
                  Gelson Fernandes                     
	Durban: Gelson Fernandes can play almost anywhere for Switzerland, except as a striker.         
	So the Saint-Etienne defensive midfielder was as shocked as everybody else when he popped up in the penalty area Wednesday night to give his adopted country a stunning 1-0 victory over World Cup favourites Spain.         
	The Swiss press dubbed him GEILson, which roughly translates to COOLson, while a Zurich tabloid dubbed coach Ottmar Hitzfeld Saint Ottmar.         
	It was only Fernandes second goal in 24 internationals and he said it was a stroke of good fortune he was on hand to tap in the ball after Eren Derdiyoks surging 52nd-minute run was halted by a combination of Iker Casillas and Gerard Pique.         
	To be fair, Im not used to scoring goals, so I was surprised, Gelson said. It was a bit of luck.         
	Hitzfeld said Fernandes forced his way into the World Cup squad with good performances in the qualification matches he played in. Since then, he has developed into a key member of the tightly organised team.         
	Fernandes hopped onto the bandwagon very late  but hes shown great form, Hitzfeld said. Hes a very valuable player  you just love them. He plays in many positions and motivates his teammates.         
	He has never been more valuable than Wednesday, when his goal gave Switzerland their first win over Spain in 18 attempts and an unexpected stepping stone toward qualifying for the round of 16 in South Africa. The significance will take a while to sink in.         
	Ill probably realise this after my career, he said. Its a special moment for our team  the most important part is the team spirit we have.         
	Meanwhile, Switzerlands team doctor says defender Philippe Senderos will miss the sides two remaining group matches because of a sprained right ankle.         
	Team doctor Cuno Wetzel said X-rays and magnetic scans Thursday showed no fractures. (Agencies)

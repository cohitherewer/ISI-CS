The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | There was a request not to score more, says Breitner
                                                                                                                       7                                      There was a request not to score more, says Breitner
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Bayern Munich All Stars XI and East Bengal All Stars XI players before the start of their match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: Paul Breitner is an honest man.         
	When asked at the post-match press conference, whether there was any request from the East Bengal All Stars XI not to score more than 10 goals, he smilingly spilled the beans.         
	I am always honest and speak the truth. There was a request not to score more than 10. But when you get an open net what do you? Breitner said on Wednesday.         
	As promised, we played a neat game and we won. We demonstrated that we are still good enough for 90 minutes of action. In fact, we could have played 30 minutes more, Breitner said.         
	Five years ago, we decided to form this All Stars XI and travel the world. We dont get time to practice together more often but since we all work hard to maintain a certain amount of fitness it becomes easier when we get together, the 1974 World Cup winner said.         
	This match against East Bengal All Stars was their last match of the season. We call off our season. We played six matches and won all of them. When you play for Bayern only thing you can think of is win, the 59-year-old said.         
	Breitner said he was not disappointed by the poor turnout at the Salt Lake Stadium. We would have played even if there was one spectator. For the record, 1,25,000 turned up at the Salt Lake Stadium to watch another Bayern legend Oliver Kahns last match in May 2008.         
	Breitner said the team was okay with the artificial turf. If you are technically sound you dont face any problem on any surface. We adapted well to the conditions here, he said.         
	About the Indian standard of football, the German was diplomatic. I will be in a position to talk about Indian football standard after I come here at least five times. But one thing if you work hard the future is yours. So, may be after 15 years we at Bayern will not connect India with only cricket. Football will also come to the scene.

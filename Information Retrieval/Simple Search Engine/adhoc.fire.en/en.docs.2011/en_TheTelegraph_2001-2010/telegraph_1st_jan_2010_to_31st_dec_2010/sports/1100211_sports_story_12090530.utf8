	Jerez: Formula One title contenders Red Bull unveiled their striking new RB6 for the coming season on Wednesday with driver Mark Webber describing the car as a limousine. Red Bull were second in the constructors championship last year behind Brawn, who have morphed into Mercedes this season, with German driver Sebastian Vettel also second in the drivers standings won by Jenson Button.         
	The RB6 has a sleek look with the nose particularly eye-catching and more pointed than previous years thanks to the design of Adrian Newey, who won plaudits for last years car.         
	A new shark-fin engine cover also makes the RB6 stand out while a ban on refuelling during races this year means all cars are longer than before given the large fuel tanks. This car is a limousine, Webber joked at the early-morning launch at the Jerez track in Spain, where Formula Ones second official test session of the season started on Wednesday.         
	We had only small aerodynamic changes so we didnt go crazy, Webber added despite the cars distinctive look. It shows how clever Adrian Newey is that a lot of people copied our car (last year).         
	Webber said he would reap the benefits of being fully fit for this season after a broken leg upset preparations last year.         
	Red Bull are the last of the existing teams to unveil their 2010 challenger. Lotus hold their launch in London on Friday while fellow newcomers US F1 and Campos are struggling to make the first race in Bahrain on March 14.         
	Red Bull missed the first testing session in Valencia last week to have extra time to work on the car. Basically we felt there was more to be gained off the track, team principal Christian Horner said. We set ourselves aggressive targets. We kept working on our concepts and Adrian has come up with a new, very good car.         
	I think there are four race-winning teams: McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and us, added Horner, who had considered switching to a Mercedes engine before sticking with Renault.

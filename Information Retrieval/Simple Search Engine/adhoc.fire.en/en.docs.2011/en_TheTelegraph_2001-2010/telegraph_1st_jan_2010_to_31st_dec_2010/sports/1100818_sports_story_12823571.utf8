                                                                                                                       7                                        Ali promises Sam 100m for team

	The Indian investor plotting the takeover of Blackburn Rovers says he will give Sam Allardyce up to 100 million in transfer funds as part of a 300 million 15-year investment in Ewood Park.         
	As this newspaper revealed two weeks ago, Ahsan Ali Syed, an Indian investment tycoon, is hoping to take control of Blackburn in the next month.         
	A team of negotiators from his company Western Gulf Advisory arrived at the club on Monday hoping to secure agreement on a four-week exclusive negotiation period.         
	Syed, 36, is the heir to a family fortune estimated at 5 billion controlled by WGA, which is based in Bahrain and the Swiss canton of Zug. Syed says he has targeted Blackburn because of his passion for the club and the English game, and is not seeking a quick return on his investment.         
	For me the investment in Blackburn is more of a passion than a way to make a quick return from the balance sheets, he said. I am not investing to make a return in two years and walk away, I am coming in as a fan to invest for the long term.         
	As part of our first five-year investment we will make 80 million-100 million available to the manager. I am sure that if he is given a free hand with the resources we can provide then Big Sam has the potential.         
	Syed said he had a long-term plan for the club focused on extending its global reach. His plan appears to be based on exploiting the Premier Leagues growing popularity in India, where football is the fastest growing game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya rails at civic body
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dalmiya rails at civic body
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Frustrated with the intervention of Calcutta Municipal Corporation regarding the renovation of Eden Gardens galleries, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Saturday said that if this kind of situation persists, it will be difficult to organise the four World Cup matches.         
	The civic body had served a notice to the CAB asking them to stop renovation. It is very unfortunate that there is constant non co-operation from a certain section. If this continues, I am not sure whether we will be able to organise the World Cup matches, Dalmiya said.         
	Dalmiya also stated that it would be difficult for CAB to bear the huge financial loss it will incur due to stoppage of work. The CAB doesnt have millions in their coffers and it will be difficult to bear the loss due to stoppage of work. We have already sought legal advice in this regard.         
	Incidentally, the CAB has already got clearance from the Army and the PWD (Civil) for the renovation of the galleries.

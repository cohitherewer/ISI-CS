The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav:   I am getting younger
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav:   I am getting younger
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys men snatched a 15-run victory over the Delhi DareDevils at the Eden on Wednesday. After the shock debacle against the Kings XI Punjab the other day, the Kolkata Knight Riders put on an improved performance to outsmart Gautam Gambhirs side.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, Sourav admitted that Virender Sehwags dismissal tilted the match in the Knights favour. And speaking about his own fielding (having effected a crucial run out and taken a good catch), the former India captain said that he was just getting younger!               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Sourav: It was a good game and it was good to win. It is always a difficult decision to leave Shane Bond out. I wasnt sure whom to play, Bond or (Ajantha) Mendis, when we reached the ground. But then on seeing the wicket, I thought Mendis would do well. Even Iqbal Abdulla bowled well. He is a youngster and every time he gets an opportunity, he proves himself. However, I think we should have got 190 today (Wednesday) Were a bit stuck during the middle overs. Till the time (Virender) Sehwag was around, I thought they (the DareDevils) were very much in the match. He is a champion batsman and when he bats, anything is possible. So Sehwag, along with (Gautam) Gambhir, kept them in the match. It was only when Sehwag was dismissed that we began to sense victory. We have been playing well for quite sometime now. Hopefully, we will be able to win the next match Every time we win one, we lose the very next game. And as far as my fielding is concerned  Im getting younger.         
	Gambhir: I think we should have finished the game as we had it in control. With wickets in hand, we should have achieved the target. But that is what happens in this format You tend to panic and then you lose wickets. Thats what happened to us today. But all credit goes to KKR, they played excellently. Obviously, my run-out was the turning point. Till then we were very much in the game. We needed around 90 odd from 10 overs which was absolutely achievable. We got two boundaries in that over and at that point of time we didnt need that single. It was a mistake on my part and it was disaster. But once the opposition gets 180 on the board, its always a difficult task. They (KKR) bowled very well in the first few overs We hardly had any runs on the board during that period. When I play as a batsman, I forget the captaincy bit. My job then is to score runs. Only when I am fielding, I focus on my captaincy. I never believe that I have been under any sort of pressure due to captaincy when I am batting. Even if I think about todays match, we planned to get around 80 runs in the first 10 overs and we got 90 and the target was within our reach. But it was one bad day when I was run-out and it cost us the match.

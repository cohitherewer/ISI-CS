	Chittagong: Alastair Cook made a patient unbeaten century in his first Test as England captain to lift his team to a commanding 374 for three on the opening day of the series against Bangladesh on Friday.         
	Cooks 11th Test century made the hosts regret their decision to bowl first and he had reached 158 not at the close with Paul Collingwood unbeaten on 32.         
	Former captain Kevin Pietersen was out for 99 after adding 170 runs with Cook for the third wicket.         
	Cook, quiet initially, grew in confidence to hit 14 boundaries and smash off-spinner Mahmudullah over long on for the second of his two sixes to reach three figures. His opening partner, debutant Michael Carberry, was first out for 30, unable to cope with the spin of Mahmudullah.         
	The left-hander had clubbed six fours, including three in one over from seamer Rubel Hossain, but was dropped by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim for 30 off Mahmudullah before being trapped lbw in the spinners next over.         
	Jonathan Trott was next to go when he was caught behind for 39, replays suggesting the short-pitched ball from Rubel struck him on the helmet before flying through to wicketkeeper Rahim. Bangladesh brought their fielders around the bat for the struggling Pietersen, but he showed no sign of nerves and drove left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak for a cover boundary to get off the mark.         
	He struck Shakib Al Hasan for a six and two fours in four balls to move into the 90s before his weakness against left-arm spin resurfaced and Razzak bowled him with the right-hander one run short of his 17th test century.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We misread the pitch: Whatmore
                                                                                                                       7                                      We misread the pitch: Whatmore
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                          
	Chennai: Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore said at the post match press conference that the team had misread the pitch on Tuesday. The coach also admitted that they failed to adjust to the conditions well and that contributed to the disappointing loss.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On what went wrong         
	It was disappointing. I guess, we misread the pitch before the game. We picked four medium pacers but they had two. Probably, they knew a bit more than us.         
	The nature of the defeat         
	That is the nature of the game. Teams are winning on form. We need to turn around quickly from one game to the next. Conditions here are different. The 45-minute air travel from Bangalore to Chennai is totally different. We are to deal with different conditions and different opponents. These things contribute to wins and losses. We are on the road for two games and unfortunately we have not picked any points. Twenty over games are very fast and things can change any moment from one over to the next.         
	Reasons for the defeat         
	There will be a decent review. Weve still got two games to go and a lot to play for. We are pretty proud bunch of guys. We may be facing a situation of not being able to qualify, but things are that way. We still have two games to go. We need to press hard.         
	If chances of last-four berth appear dim         
	It appears that way. Teams can still get healthy run rate with seven wins. We have five and two more games to go and we will press very hard from a pride point of view. You need to have a pretty decent run rate to be confident of still making the semi-final berth. We came across so some decent sides plus the conditions were also difficult.         
	Whether the franchise owner would differ from his point of view         
	It is difficult for me to answer that because I am not the owner.         
	If Sourav Gangulys public outburst had affected the team         
	No many a word were spoken in emotion. Everything was done in the best interests of the side.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt sure of a clean chit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Butt sure of a clean chit
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans suspended Test captain and opener Salman Butt said he is confident of having his name cleared in the spot-fixing scandal that shook international cricket.         
	Butt told mediapersons at the National Cricket Academy Friday, that he was looking forward to the appeal hearing being held by the ICC at Doha on October 30 and 31.         
	Salman Butt and fast bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif were suspended by the ICC in the first week of September, while in England.         
	Their suspensions came after the News of the World tabloid broke a story claiming that the agent for the three players, Mazhar Majeed, had on video confessed that he had paid bribes to the trio for spot-fixing in the fourth Test against England at Lords.         
	The trio have appealed against their suspensions and the ICC has now scheduled their hearings in Doha under the supervision of Michael Beloff QC.         
	While the ICC is carrying out its appeal process, the three players continued to be under investigation by the Scotland Yard for alleged spot-fixing and conspiracy to defraud bookmakers.         
	The 26-year-old Butt, who has played 33 Tests and 78 ODIs, claimed the allegations had disturbed him and his family.         
	But I am ready to fight on, and I am confident of positive result at the hearing, he added.         
	Everything was going well when this happened and it was very disturbing and disappointing. But it has also been a big lesson for me, he said.         
	It has taught me a lot about how to deal with the people around you and how to be aware of the people around you. It has made me realise how to differentiate between friends and foes.         
	The opener said he had not given up and was continuing his daily training and practice sessions at the national academy. I keep on training and practising for two hours daily. Because I want to remain in touch. (PTI)

	Lights, camera, action. Focus on New Delhi. Its prime time hockey and as the drama unfolds over the next fortnight, let us hope India emerge the masters of their destiny in this struggle for supremacy.         
	Make no mistake, the world title is the Holy Grail of hockey, matched in prestige and value by only the Olympic Gold. Every other contest in hockey is just a preparation for these two. Like everything over the last year or so has been a build up to this clash of the titans to choose the best among them.         
	Since the talk at such times is of weapons in the arsenal and depth in ranks, I must confess India lack a killer of Sohail Abbass skill or a sharp shooter of Jamie Dwyers accuracy.         
	But we have our trump cards who might have a trick or two up their sleeves. Much depends on the defence; the Indians are notorious for conceding soft late goals and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Sandeep Singh will have to be as adept at the discharge of his duties in this department as in his performance in the role of a world-class drag flicker. The job of marshalling the defence would be his and he would have to think of ways to deal with the swift counter attacking play of the superpowers.         
	In Indias style of play, there is a huge gap in coordination between the attack and the defence with the former seldom in a position to help the team during a counter attack. I hope the team management has given enough attention to the retreating tackle. It is an art that should not be neglected, because an untrained forward can give away a foul in attempting to check an attacker while retreating.         
	We will miss Baljit Singh in goal but Adrian DSouza has been doing a fairly good job in his place.         
	The battle will be won or lost in the midfield, and here, Sardara Singh and Arjun Halappa will have to step up to ensure free movement for India.         
	I dont think a major overhaul in style has been possible in the short time that Jose Brasa has been at the helm, and neither do I feel that any such thing is achievable, especially with the current crop as they have been around and playing together for a long time.         
	Our opponents for the first match, too, are from the old school. In my time, whenever India played Pakistan, it was like the final of the event because these two teams were the world beaters, the absolute champions.         
	An India-Pakistan clash was the games greatest rivalry and adding intensity to that rivalry was the baggage of history that both carried. It ensured that feelings ran unusually high for any India versus Pakistan match.         
	For the players, these matches used to be loaded with pressure and I remember there would be very few words between the rival camps and no love lost.         
	I have featured in four such outings and the record stands: won two, drew and lost one each. I remember each of those games.         
	Time has taken the edge off that enmity and nowadays, an India-Pakistan clash does not reach the fever pitch of earlier times. But a face-off with the old foes still is a big match.         
	Sundays tie can go a long way towards determining how the World Cup unfolds for India. The ability of the deep defence against penalty corners would be up for review, with Sohail Abbas asking questions.         
	The clash against Pakistan is also important because India happen to be in the group of death. There are Australia, Spain, and England, the reigning Europe champions.         
	In the current format, for a place in the semi-finals, you need a minimum of two wins and two draws. If India can manage three wins and one draw, they could prove good enough to keep the Cup back.         
	India would also need to be mindful of the rule changes, for the first time, at this World Cup. Chief among these are the self-pass, where, from a free hit, a player can roll the ball for a small distance and put it in play without having to pass to a teammate; and the prohibition on a free hit travelling straight into the circle from within 23 metres out. These changes have increased the pace of the game.         
	Being in the group of death can also have its benefits, like an upset or a gritty draw that throws all calculations awry.         
	But it never pays to count on that. India are playing at home and weve had the celebrities getting the people behind the team.         
	But as a player, I realised that playing on home turf counts only when you are good on the field.         
	If our team performs strongly on the world stage, the fans will return to the stadiums. Right now, Indian hockey desperately needs a good show.

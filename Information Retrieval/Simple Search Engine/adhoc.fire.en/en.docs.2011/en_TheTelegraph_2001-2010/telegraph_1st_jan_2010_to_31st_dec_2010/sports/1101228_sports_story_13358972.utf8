The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mancini not ready to look ahead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mancini not ready to look ahead
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini admits he does not know where his side stands in the race for the Premier League title despite their win over Newcastle United moving them up to second in the table. Manchester City bounced back from the home defeat to Everton with a 3-1 victory at St James Park, but Mancini is refusing to look too far ahead as he attempts to repay the clubs staggering investment with silverware.         
	Asked where the win at St James Park left his team in the title race, Mancini replied: I dont know. It has been a strange season because there isnt at the moment one team, which has 10 points more than anyone else. Every game is difficult for each team. We must only continue to improve if it is possible.         
	Victory over Alan Pardews side also marked Mancinis one-year anniversary in charge of City. Reflecting on the last 12 months, the Italian said: I like Boxing Day. Last year, we won; this year, we won. I am happy with this first year, but it is my opinion that we need to improve again, we need to work.         
	Only if we do that can we arrive at the top and win something at the end of the season.

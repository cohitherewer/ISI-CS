                                                                                                                       7                                      A clash of greats and raw talent in CLT20
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The differences between the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Champions League T20 are many. However, the CLT20 promises to serve as much thrill as the IPL when the tournament begins at the Wanderers Stadium, on Friday.         
	One of the most fascinating contests of the day could be between Sachin Tendulkar, who will open the batting for the Mumbai Indians, against a Highveld Lions attack that will be spearheaded by the unheralded 23-year-old, Craig Alexander.         
	One of the hallmarks of Tendulkar is to make time almost stand still and over the last 12 months he has graced international cricket grounds with the verve, vitality and enthusiasm that he first displayed as a 16-year-old more than 20 years ago.         
	Watching Tendulkar bat is like listening to a Mozart symphony and thats one of the bonuses that the CLT20 is set to enthral fans with.         
	Tendulkar and the many other international players currently in South Africa tip the CLT20 scale in one direction. The counter balance is provided by the likes of Alexander who is one of South Africas foremost young bowling talents and could well be part of the next generation of international players to emerge from this tournament.         
	Meanwhile, Cape Cobras captain Justin Kemp will replace Sri Lankan seamer Thilan Thushara in the Chennai Super Kngs squad after the latter sustained a groin injury while playing for Sri Lanka A against Pakistan A, late last week.         
	New Zealand champions Central Stags captain Jamie How said that every team thats playing in the CL T20 are here on merit. We see this tournament as a reward for winning our domestic Twenty20 (T20) tournament, and the other teams are here for the same reason.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni praise for Jadeja
            A CORRESPONDENT            Herschelle Gibbs and Hashim Amla, in Gwalior, on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Gwalior: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was all praise for all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja during the press conference on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Virender Sehwags fitness         
	We will see tomorrow (Wednesday). He did bat at the nets, but with the kind of hard work put in today (Tuesday), we will have to see how the back shapes up tomorrow.         
	Ravindra Jadejas performance         
	Jadeja has done really well for us, hes the kind of guy who can bowl ten overs in every game So we are helped by one part-timer, you can say.         
	Virat Kohlis batting order         
	Most of the time, we try to rotate the guys according to the situation. I dont think theres a problem in adapting to the situation. You see his strengths and accordingly give him a slot. Depends on the conditions as well If he bats at No.3, it means hes a technically sound batsman. If we have a long partnership from the openers, then obviously it will be different No. 3 batsman.         
	If India need to rotate players keeping the World Cup in mind         
	We have a jam-packed schedule, and every fourth day we have a new injury cropping up. We try to rotate our players, so we cant just stick to our 15, we need a bigger pool so that we can get the best 15 for the World Cup.         
	Conserving players for the future         
	The problem with the Indian team is that we are expected to win each and every game, and are forced to play with our best XI. So its difficult conserving players for the future and trying to win games. We might be going well, but suddenly just before the World Cup, we might see our key fast bowlers are injured. Under these sub-continent conditions, its important to have your fast bowlers who are smart and experienced.         
	If India are lacking a specialist bowler         
	No, its not about that. Like I said we got this opportunity to play with extra batsmen We have Yusuf (Pathan) or (Ravindra) Jadeja backing up at No. 8. We are not short of bowlers because Jadeja can bowl his overs, so you can frame him as an all-rounder, spinning all-rounder Its not that we are lacking a specialist bowler, its just that Jadeja has groomed into a specialist bowler and has been consistent more often than not.         
	Bowling at the death         
	Its very tough for the bowler as every batsman shapes up differently in every match. We too capitalise in the last ten overs and that puts pressure on them. When bowling, no doubt you lay emphasis on giving as many less runs as possible. If you give 80-100 runs in last ten overs, it becomes too much 60 or 70 runs is quite good. The bowlers have to keep experimenting as yorker is not the only option.         
	Gary Kirstens contribution         
	I dont want to compare him with any other coach but he didnt come in with any fixed mindset or strategy. He came in with an open mind, without coming in and saying that this is how I will coach the Indian cricket team. He came in and learnt what Indian cricket is all about, what the culture is, and how individuals work in the side. Accordingly, he made strategies with our reading and this is something that is working well for all of us. We are really comfortable with the dressing room atmosphere, and he doesnt panic so easily. The best thing about him is the mindset.

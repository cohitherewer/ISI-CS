The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights are on a hattrick
                                                                                                                       7                                        Knights are on a hattrick
    - Wont surprise if bond debut is delayed 
  -  Tiwary injury a worry             A STAFF REPORTER            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Calcutta: Theres a whiff of fresh air in the Kolkata Knight Riders camp. Be it on the field or off it, you can feel the difference.         
	Sourav Ganguly was candid when he stressed on the need to build an atmosphere for the development of the side. Gone are the bickering and controversies that had dogged the Knights; its redemption time for Shah Rukh Khans men.         
	Two out of two has been an ideal start to their Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign. If Sourav and Co. can retain the winning habit against the Chennai Super Kings, at home on Tuesday, they can start dreaming of putting the disappointments of the first two editions behind them.         
	More than what is being billed as a clash between Sourav and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the match could serve to set the momentum for the two teams.         
	Knight Riders performance has made other sides sit up and take notice. There seems to be a different approach this time... To come up well against the in-form teams in the IPL is a challenge. Tomorrow is such a challenge, Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming said.         
	The arrival of Shane Bond, on Monday, has been a shot in the arm for the Knights. The Knight Riders team management, though, was undecided about playing him. Given a choice, Sourav would certainly want to unleash him at the earliest. But it would be no surprise if they go in with an unchanged eleven.         
	A final decision will be taken Tuesday as they begin to deal with a problem of plenty regarding the overseas players. Bond wasnt present during their optional practice session on Monday. The fast bowler has been in good form during the five one-day Internationals and two Twenty20 matches against Australia, and it will only be a matter of getting over the fatigue factor.         
	The Knight Riders bowling combination has paid rich dividends thus far. Charl Langeveldt, Ishant Sharma and Angelo Mathews have been on target in the first two matches and including Bond in the line-up would also mean dropping a foreigner. Brad Hodge and Owais Shah, the other two overseas players in the XI, have been among runs.         
	Bonds former national captain also seemed wary of his presence. He is experienced. Experienced players are very important... Bond falls in that category. He is fast... He is excited about being here. He is a very good buy, Fleming explained.         
	The performance of the Indian players was thought to be the key to the Knight Riders success this season and, as Manoj Tiwary showed on Sunday, they are eager to make their mark this time.         
	There is, however, some uncertainty over Tiwarys fitness. The batsman is yet to recover from the hamstring pull and ankle sprain suffered during his half century. Andrew Leipus will take a call before the start on the morrow.         
	The Chennai Super Kings, after the reversal in their opener against the Deccan Chargers, would obviously wish to put themselves back on track. The problem lies in their batting and a good start will be vital to their fortunes.         
	Matthew Hayden and his Mongoose bat will create a lot of interest. He hasnt been among runs in the first match and it remains to be seen how he deals with the Knight Riders attack.         
	Despite the presence of big names, their bowling could prove to be their weak link and if the Knights can utilise it to the hilt, there will be no looking back.         
	Memories of 2008  when they faced a similar situation with two wins before losing to the Super Kings in the third match that began the slide  will haunt the Knights and it will be up to them to script a different story.         
	Hopefully, like the first edition, the rain wont rob the spectators of an absorbing contest.

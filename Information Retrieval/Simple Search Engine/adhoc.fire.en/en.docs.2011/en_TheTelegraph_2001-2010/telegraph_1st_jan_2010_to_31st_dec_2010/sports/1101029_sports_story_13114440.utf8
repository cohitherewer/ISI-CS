The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Africa keen to have Gary on board
                                                                                                                       7                                        South Africa keen to have Gary on board
    - Having a young family may influence coach to return to his roots           OUR BUREAU AGENCIES            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Calcutta/Johannesburg: While the Proteas are keen to have their former star batsman Gary Kirsten as national teams coach next year, the senior Indian players are reportedly among those pushing to have the South Africans contract as the Team India coach renewed.         
	Kirsten had gained respect and popularity after taking over as coach of the Indian side in March 2008, the Afrikaans weekly Rapport said, adding that this was boosted by Indias victory against Australia earlier this month in the Test series.         
	With Corrie van Zyl having announced his decision to retire as South Africa coach after the World Cup in March next year, Kirsten is one of those being eyed for the position by Cricket South Africa (CSA), according to insiders.         
	Its interesting that every time a vacancy crops up for the post of the Proteas coach, Kirstens name invariably does the rounds.         
	In fact, it was reported by The Telegraph, on February 18, earlier this year, that the South African wasnt keen on an extension with India, post the 2011 World Cup, because he has a young family (wife Deborah, sons Joshua and James).         
	But whether Kirsten would be available when his contract with India ends after the Cup, will also depend on Indias performance in the tournament.         
	Current Indian players, especially the senior members of the team like Sachin Tendulkar, are believed to be so impressed with Kirsten that they might even put pressure on the Board of Control for Cricket in India to offer him a new contract, the weekly reported.         
	At the end of Indias second Test, against Australia, in Bangalore, Sachin had even said that Kirsten had a hand behind his blistering form this year.         
	Gary has helped me and he throws millions of balls at the whole team. The bowling machine and Gary are competing He doesnt seem to get tired... He has played an important role in my consistency, Sachin had said.         
	While Virender Sehwag had hailed Kirsten as the worlds best coach, his opening partner Gautam Gambhir echoed a similar view, on Thursday, as he believes that the South African was the best coach that they have seen for the Indian team.         
	During his tenure as the coach, the Indian team have performed quite impressively. Apart from helping India clinch a bilateral series win in Sri Lanka, against Sri Lanka recently, he also assisted in Indias first one-day International series victory against New Zealand, in New Zealand, after 40 years.         
	It is Kirstens low key approach that has made him popular and successful among the players. India are now the No.1 team in the International Cricket Council Test rankings, while in one-day Internationals, Mahendra Singh Dhonis side are placed second.         
	The report in the South African weekly further said that Kirsten would be able to dictate his own pay cheque if India won the tournament.         
	However, eventually if Kirsten decides against continuing with India because of his family commitments, it would not be surprising at all.

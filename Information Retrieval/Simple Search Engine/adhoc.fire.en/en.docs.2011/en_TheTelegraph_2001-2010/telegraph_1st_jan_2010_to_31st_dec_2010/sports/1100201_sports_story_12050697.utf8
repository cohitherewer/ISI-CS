The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fresh trouble in Pak camp
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fresh trouble in Pak camp
                      
	Karachi: Official version blamed it on a sore knee but the real reason behind Pakistan captain Mohammed Yousufs absence from Sundays fifth ODI against Australia was a bitter row with coach Intikhab Alam over selection issues, sources in the team have revealed.         
	Before the match, the management had advised Yousuf to take a rest from the fifth match so that Shahid Afridi could lead the team and get some captaincy exposure before the Twenty20 match against Australia next week, a source said.         
	But Yousuf flatly refused and insisted he would continue playing, the source said.         
	Apparently, there were differences over the issue of dropping Younis and Kamran Akmal for the match after which Yousuf had an argument with Intikhab and Waqar Younis, and refused to go for the toss or lead the team, the source disclosed.         
	Meanwhile the PCB chairman Ijaz Butt Sunday ruled out a complete overhaul of the team after their disastrous tour of Australia but said a younger skipper will replace Mohammed Yousuf.         
	Now we would like to hand over the reins to a younger captain who can lead the side for a longer period, Butt told a television channel.           (PTI)

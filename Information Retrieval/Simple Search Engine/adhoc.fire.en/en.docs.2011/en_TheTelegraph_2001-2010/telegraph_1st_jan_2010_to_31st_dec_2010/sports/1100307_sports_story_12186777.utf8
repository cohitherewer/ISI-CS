                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev rises 14 places
                      
	Palm Beach Garden: A flawless front-nine helped Jeev Milkha Singh turn in a one-under 69 and rise 14 places to tied 29th after the second round of the $5.6million Honda Classic golf tournament here.         
	Jeev has a two-day total of one-under 140.         
	After parring the first couple of holes, Jeev struck a birdie on the third and gained two more shots on the fifth and seventh to make the turn three-under.         
	The back-nine started disappointingly as he stumbled to a bogey on the 11th hole but he made amends with a birdie on the 12th hole.         
	But his card was marred by bogeys on the 16th and 17th as he settled one-under for the day.         
	At the top, Columbian Camilo Villegas (66) and American Anthony Kim (64) shared the lead with totals of eight-under 132.         
	Fijian Vijay Singh (66) followed them a stroke adrift at the lone third spot. (PTI)

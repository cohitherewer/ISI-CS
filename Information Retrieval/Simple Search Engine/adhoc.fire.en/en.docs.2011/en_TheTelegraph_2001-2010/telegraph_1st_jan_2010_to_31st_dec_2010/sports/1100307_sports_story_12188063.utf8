The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag look to pick up pieces
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag look to pick up pieces
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Its always a big challenge for a team to do well after a debacle. Chirag United are no exception. After their 1-5 drubbing at the hands of Mohun Bagan, its redemption time for Subrata Bhattacharyas boys who take on Churchill Brothers in a 15th round I-League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	The fact that even their rivals are trying to pick up pieces after a devastating 1-4 loss at home against Mahindra United will give some hope to the city outfit. In terms of points, too, there is not much to choose between the two teams. Chirag are placed fifth with 22 points from 14 games, while Churchill are a rung above with a point more from equal number of matches.         
	With 12 matches still to go, this is the best opportunity for Chirag to get their confidence back before hitting the road. They have a couple of away matches scheduled in the next two rounds.         
	Chirag coach Subrata feels even one point will help his boys get back their composure.         
	Churchill are a good side. Apart from Okolie Odafe, they have quite a few matured players. Whenever you have experienced players, they tend to make a difference. On the other hand, my team comprises of youngsters who are still reeling under the shock of the last match. I have asked them to treat the last match as an accident, Subrata who was supposedly gagged from airing his views by the Chirag management, said in presence of the officials who were keeping an eye on the coach.         
	The defeat has also been an eye opener for the home team who would like to play it safe against the formidable opponents from Goa. Jayanta Sen will be starting as the central midfielder in place of Mathew Grbesa, who was a complete misfit as the defensive screen during the last match.         
	Right back Rahul Kumar, who was pretty scratchy during the last match, is likely to be replaced by Dhanrajan. Narugopal Hait will start as the left-back while Eduardo Chacon and Arnab Mondal will be manning the central defence.         
	Apart from Jayanta, there will be Denson Devadas, Shylo Malsawmtluanga and Gouranga Biswas in the midfield. The Brazilian duo of Edmilson and Joshimar will play upfront.         
	Churchill will again depend on their Nigerian sharpshooter Odafe, who has not yet been able to replicate his last two years performance.

	Irene: Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will be out of action for an indefinite period with a back injury, the world champions said Tuesday.         
	The 32-year-old was replaced at half-time in Italys World Cup opener in Cape Town on Monday, a 1-1 draw against Paraguay.         
	He has a bad sciatic problem. We cannot say when he will be able to play again, said an Italian Football Federation statement. Buffon was replaced at half-time by Federico Marchetti.         
	Coach Marcello Lippi said it was too early to judge the seriousness of the veterans injury. He had an ache during the warm-up and then he said he wanted to play, but after the first half he said he couldnt continue, said Lippi.         
	Buffon, who came into the World Cup on the back of a poor, injury-plagued season with Juventus, had suggested after the game on Monday that he might be able to return to training in two days           (AGENCIES)

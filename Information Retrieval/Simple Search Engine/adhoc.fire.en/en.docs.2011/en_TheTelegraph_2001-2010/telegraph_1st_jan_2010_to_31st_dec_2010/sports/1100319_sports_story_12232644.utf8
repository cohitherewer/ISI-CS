                                                                                                                       7                                        Obama sees Tiger bouncing back 
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Miami: US President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he was sure Tiger Woods will still be a terrific golfer when he returns to competition, while one of PGA Tours most senior players urged America to forgive the scandal-hit golfer.         
	In an interview with a television news channel, Obama was asked his thoughts on Woods decision to return to golf at next months Masters, the first major of the season.         
	Woods has not played in a tournament since November last year after disappearing from public view following tabloid revelations about his marital infidelities.         
	I think Tiger has acknowledged that he betrayed his family. It is a personal issue that he has got to work out, said Obama, himself a keen golfer.         
	I hope theyve worked it out and I am sure he is still going to be a terrific golfer.         
	At the PGA Tour event in Tampa, Kenny Perry, who lost in a playoff at last years Masters, agreed that Woods would still be a great player and urged the public to forgive him.         
	We have all made mistakes. Its like any sickness, like alcohol, drugs, you name it; theres so many things out there that people get hung up into and it grabs you and just cant get away from it for whatever reason, said Perry.         
	I hope we are that country that will forgive, and give him a second shot. Everybody deserves a second chance.         
	Perry for one said he would be ready with an emphatic greeting for the world No.1 golfer when he meets him at Augusta.         
	Perry said: Im going to go give him a hug. Im going up there and get right in his face and tell him if I can do anything for him, let me know. Im here to help you.           (REUTERS)

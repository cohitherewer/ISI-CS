The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack gave Germany   their eureka moment
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ballack gave Germany   their eureka moment

	Germanys vibrant assault on a fourth World Cup triumph with their youthful, daring multi-ethnic side was spawned, ironically, during Englands quintessential sporting occasion at Wembley Stadium.         
	 The fact that a nation is now toasting its youngest and most enterprising team in living memory after the thrashing of England can be traced back to the moment when Kevin-Prince Boateng ripped into Michael Ballacks ankle during the FA Cup final.         
	With that one dismal challenge, Joachim Loews World Cup plans were thrown into disarray in the week that followed with the realisation that his captain, midfield controller and experienced figurehead would play no part. The team which was built around his generalship had to be hastily revamped.         
	Here was the turning point in the creation of Loews new Germany. Just one friendly match against Hungary a couple of weeks after the Wembley game seemed to become his Eureka! moment.         
	Forced to try out something different, with Bastian Schweinsteiger and his Bayern Munich colleagues needing rest after the Champions League final, Ballacks midfield pips were handed for the day to Stuttgarts young Sami Khedira, a burgeoning talent but with only three caps to his name.         
	Loew could only watch with delight as Khedira cut Hungarys defence apart time and again with his incisive passing. Suddenly, he saw a youngster with not just the skill, but the hunger and temperament, to make the best of his big chance.         
	And not just him. Up ahead of him, Mesut Oezil, whose place in the final 23 was by no means assured at that point, was excellent, combining well with Miroslav Klose, who after a miserable season at Bayern had not just been offered a lifeline here by Loew but also the captains armband for a night. So, new confidence flooded through an old boy too.         
	I think that Ballack injury was the turning point in the creation of Loews side, Jorg Mebus, a football writer for the German national news agency tells says. But it was more than just Khedira coming in; I think Loew changed his thinking about the team after that.         
	Was this the point he really fancied he could gamble on youth, the moment when he truly felt tyros like Khedira, Oezil, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller could be trusted to carry the burden of a nations hopes?         
	The results, of course, have been spectacular. And one other thing.         
	The final triumph for Loew was that Ballack, the man whose injury started the revolution, was not forgotten either. He was last heard of, helping give Jogi the inside track on his Chelsea colleagues and successfully plotting their downfall.

	According to a report in the Daily Telegraph here, this weeks discussion between the Metropolitan Police and CPS will determine whether further investigation is required in the case or the investigators have enough evidence to nail Salman Butt and pace duo of Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif.         
	The London police had already submitted a second file of evidence to the CPS.         
	The Metropolitan Police had launched the investigation in September after the cricketers were implicated in a spot-fixing sting carried out by the News of the World paper. (PTI)

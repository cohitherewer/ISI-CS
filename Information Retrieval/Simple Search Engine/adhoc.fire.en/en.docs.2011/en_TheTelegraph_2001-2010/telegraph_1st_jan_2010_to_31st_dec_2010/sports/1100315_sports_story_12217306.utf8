            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has finalised a list of around 60 players, who will form the core group of the national teams for the Asian Games in November and the Asia Cup final rounds in January 2011.         
	While around 30 players have been selected to undergo training with chief coach Bob Houghton for the prestigious Asia Cup and the World Cup qualifiers, the rest will remain under Sukhwinder Singh for Asian Games and pre-Olympics.         
	The players in the Asia Cup will be offered a seven-month contract starting June by the AIFF, under which the players would exclusively be available for the national duty as per the Goal 2011 plan.         
	According to sources, there are hardly any surprises in the list drawn up by Houghton for the Asia Cup. Almost the same set of players, who were there in the Dubai camp recently, have been selected with the addition of a few new names like Baldeep Singh and Baljit Sahni.         
	Houghtons squad will camp for a month in Portugal in August, where they are expected to play around 10 matches followed by two friendly matches against Thailand in September.         
	The campers under Sukhwinder would be a combination of the teams which played in the SAFF Cup and the South Asian Games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin was born to play cricket: Dhoni

  - Team India captain hopes Vijay can fill Sehwag void at World T20             Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a promotional, in Mumbai, on Friday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Paying a glowing tribute to Sachin Tendulkar on the eve of the maestros 37th birthday, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Friday said that besides his exploits with the bat the legend was a good fielder who was fitter than his years.         
	He was born to play cricket. I wont speak about his batting because everyone knows about that, but he is a very good fielder and his fitness is such that you wont feel he is 37, Dhoni said on the sidelines of a promotional.         
	Even in the dressing room, he ensures that the newcomers feel comfortable around him, Dhoni added.         
	Virender Sehwag has been ruled out of the World Twenty20 with a hurt shoulder but Dhoni said he was not aware of the extent of the injury.         
	I dont know anything about the injury. It happened during the IPL but I dont know when and how the injury happened. He is a class player. But I have always said that injuries are a part and parcel of sport.         
	He (Sehwag) and Gambhir have been doing a great job at the top of the order. We just hope Murali Vijay (Sehwags replacement) ensures we dont miss Sehwag much, Dhoni said.         
	On the question whether the IPL causes a lot of stress among the players, Dhoni said: All players are smart. You need to rest your body. An Indian cricketer, especially, needs to be very careful with the recovery in such a packed schedule. If you dont take care, it will show immediately or a month later.         
	I think all players know their bodies well. I dont want to speak for other players but I am sure that they ensure they are at their best, he added.         
	The Chennai Super Kings will be vying for the Indian Premier League title against the Mumbai Indians on Sunday and their captain said he was happy the Chennai franchise had made it to the semis in all three seasons.         
	Any captain will like to get to semi-finals early. But then we have managed that in all three editions and I am happy about it.         
	That undoubtedly has a lot to do with Dhonis dynamic leadership, but the one who appears a natural in the captains role said that the most difficult aspect of leading a team was to stay calm under pressure.         
	If I stay cool and calm it helps the bowler. He looks up to me when things are not going right and if he finds me cool and calm, he gets more confidence.         
	It doesnt help if I go and yell at the players. In international cricket, body language is very important and I try and keep my emotions in check, he said.           (PTI)

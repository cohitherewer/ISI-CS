The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pollock: Sachins the best after Sir Don Bradman
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pollock: Sachins the best after Sir Don Bradman
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Graeme Pollock                           
	Durban: Graeme Pollock, whose international career suffered because of South Africas isolation, has picked Sir Donald Bradman ahead of the rest, including Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Look, with a first-class average bordering on 100, youve got to keep Bradman in a different category... The rest cant be clubbed with him... Id say Sachins the best after Bradman. Its incredible that he has 50 Test hundreds, Pollock, now 66, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, the younger brother of Peter and Shauns uncle added: Brian Lara was also a great batsman... Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis are... Kallis, in fact, is the No.2 all-rounder after (Sir Garry) Sobers...         
	Pollock praised V.V.S. Laxman for producing a gem of an innings under pressure. Hes been making big contributions and has the skills and the temperament to deliver in demanding situations... I find him most impressive...         
	Good batsmen have time to play their shots and Laxman has that quality... Hed rank among the best batsmen of recent times.         
	South Africa had lost only one wicket when the interaction took place. At that point, Pollock felt the Test was evenly poised and that the home team would have to bat very well to get 303.

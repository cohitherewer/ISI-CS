	Calcutta: Overnight leader and defending champion Sayantan Das of Scottish Church looks all set to retain the title after the end of the tenth round of the 22nd The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, at Gorky Sadan, on Saturday.         
	Sayantan now has 9.5 points and is ahead of his nearest rivals by a clear one point. He should win the event even if he loses the final round against N. R. Vignesh, as the complicated tie-break, Buccholz, is heavily loaded in his favour.         
	He is followed by five players  N.R. Vignesh, Saurabh Mondal, Diptayan Ghosh, N.R. Visakh and S. Prasannaa  on 8.5 points.         
	The Fide-rating schools tournament is being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chyawanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club.         
	Former world U-12 champion, Sayantan, playing black against Diptayan Ghosh , drew his game, in the all-important penultimate round Saturday in a Ruy Lopez opening.         
	On the second board, second seed Prince Bajaj of Delhi Public School, Ghaziabad was shocked by Saurabh of Jharkhand in a Sicilian defence. Saurabh won Princes queen for two bishops and thereafter nursed his material advantage into a carefully crafted win.         
	Local lad Debankan Dara of Vivekananda Mission School was no match for S. Prasannaa of Velammal Matriculation HS School, Tamil Nadu as he succumbed to a kingside attack by Prasannaa in 31 moves.         
	N. R. Vignesh of Tamil Nadu got the better of Dhriti Shankar in a long game which extended till the 86th move. The underprivileged students of Future Hope School, Firoz Sk. and Mangal Hembrom, have taken their score to 5 points each.         
	South Point, totalling 31 points, is leading the fray for the best schools trophy. Vivekananda Mission School, with 27 points, and Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, with 26.5 points, are in the second and third positions, after the 10th round.

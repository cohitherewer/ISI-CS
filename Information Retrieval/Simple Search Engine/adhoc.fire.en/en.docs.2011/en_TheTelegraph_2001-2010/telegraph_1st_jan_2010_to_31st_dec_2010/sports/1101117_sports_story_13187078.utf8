                                                                                                                       7                                      Unadkat for Zaheer
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: The second India-New Zealand Test, in Hyderabad, saw some stellar performances. Tim McIntoshs century after a pair in the first Test, Virender Sehwags slambang 96 in the first innings, Harbhajan Singh hitting his second Test century on the trot, Brendon McCullums defiant double hundred         
	But perhaps it was Zaheer Khans injury which had the strongest influence on the Test. The pacer had a groin strain on Monday and had to leave the field after bowling merely 4.3 overs. Though he later came back, after tea, he couldnt bowl, for being out of action for 136 minutes.         
	On Tuesday, he could bowl only three overs before he left the field once again, this time without returning.The Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a media release on Tuesday which said that Zaheer would miss the third and final Test, in Nagpur, and will be replaced by Jaydev Unadkat in the squad.         
	Zaheer Khan is injured and is unavailable for the Third Test against New Zealand, to be played at Nagpur, from November 20-24. The All India selection committee has chosen Jayadev Unadkat to replace Zaheer Khan in the squad, the release said.

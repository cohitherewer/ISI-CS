The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morgan: We are vigilant
                                                                                                                       7                                      Morgan: We are vigilant
                      
	Bridgetown: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has insisted officials are extremely vigilant when it comes to spot-fixing after Pakistans Danish Kaneria was arrested in a betting probe.         
	But the ICC president David Morgan, in an interview in Barbados on the eve of the World Twenty20 final between Australia and England, insisted: I can honestly say that I have no knowledge of any spot-fixing that I am refusing to tell you.         
	Kaneria and a colleague at English county side Essex, Mervyn Westfield, have been arrested in connection with a police investigation into betting, a club official confirmed Saturday.         
	Both, leg-spinner Kaneria, 29, and 22-year-old pace bowler Westfield were questioned on Friday before being released on bail.         
	It is understood the match under scrutiny was a 40-over win against Durham last September. The investigation centres on the practice of spot-fixing whereby money is placed on individual details in a match.         
	Ive been aware of the potential problem at Essex for a little while, Morgan said.

	Karachi: Pakistans hockey team leaves on Monday for the World Cup in New Delhi amid warnings from a security expert that there is a genuine threat to the players safety in India.         
	Sohail Khan, a high ranking police official in the Interior ministry who has worked with many foreign cricket teams as their security expert in Pakistan, said the PHF should not relax at all during the World Cup.         
	All the talk about being satisfied with the security arrangements is fine and I am sure the Indians will also be providing good security cover for all teams including Pakistan but we need to be on guard all the time, Khan said.         
	Sohail said the players should remain on guard all the time.           (PTI)

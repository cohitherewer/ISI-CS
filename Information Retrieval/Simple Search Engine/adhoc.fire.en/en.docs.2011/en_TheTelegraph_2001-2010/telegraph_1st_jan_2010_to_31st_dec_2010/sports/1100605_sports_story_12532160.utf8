            WRONG FOOTING                          
	Wily winker               
	The chocolate boy sweetheart got his working class hero clubmate dismissed and then winked his mischief at his fellow Portuguese  sure, Cristiano Ronaldo was in control. This was the quarter final match in 06 Germany. Poor Wayne Rooney, who has had to go out of his way to earn so many red cards, was shown one without having done much.              
	Head over heart         
	Zinedine Zidane might have decided it was no longer funny but it was Marco Materazzi, and the Italians, who had the last laugh. It was a moment of madness from the French captain after the Italian defender had whispered something in his ear. Zidane turned around and rammed the Italian defender with his head in the final of the 06 World Cup. Materazzi flew off his feet and hit the ground hard, writhing in pain. Red card for Zidane in the last competitive match of his career, heartbreak for France.                    
	Spitfire               
	Frank Rijkaard gets cautioned after Germanys Rudi Voeller dives in a meeting in Italia 90. He doesnt like it and as Voeller walks away with an affected air of vindication the Dutchman coughs up a fine blob of phlegm and spits on the Germans head. That was one. Later, after both had finally been expelled for trouble-making, Rijkaard has another go on the way out and is on target again.              
	Knee-jerk reaction               
	Turkish defender Hakan Unsal kicked the ball to Rivaldo in a group match at the 02 World Cup in South Korea/Japan. It hit his knees and the Brazilian almost died of concussion. Whereas it was an attempt on life, Rivaldo did not press charges and the Turk got away with a red card. The Brazilians, of course, won that match and beat the Turks again, in the semi-final.

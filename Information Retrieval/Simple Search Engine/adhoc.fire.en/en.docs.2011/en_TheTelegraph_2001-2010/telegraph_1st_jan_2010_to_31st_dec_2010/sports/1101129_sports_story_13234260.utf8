The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A scare for   England   cricketers 
                                                                                                                       7                                      A scare for   England   cricketers 
                                  
	Brisbane: Coach Andy Flowers skin surgery to remove a melanoma had sent a scare through the England team, skipper Andrew Strauss said on Sunday. Flower missed the second and third days play of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane to have a melanoma removed from his right cheek.         
	All of us have had a bit of a scare on it. We did get tested recently but we may need second opinions on that, Strauss said after scoring his first Ashes Test century in Australia on Sundays fourth day to get his team out of trouble.         
	It does put everything into perspective and how quickly Andy had to get this stuff done showed thats not something to be messed around with.         
	Strauss said Flowers enforced absence did not greatly upset the team routine during the first of the five Ashes Tests at the Gabba. I dont think it made a huge amount of difference, to be honest, probably the dressing room was a bit more light-hearted while he wasnt there, he quipped.

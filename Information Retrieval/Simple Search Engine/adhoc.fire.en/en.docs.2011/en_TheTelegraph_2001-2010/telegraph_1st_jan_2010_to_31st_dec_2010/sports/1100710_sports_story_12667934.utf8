            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Johannesburg: Unhappy memories will return to haunt Spain when they see English referee Howard Webb walking onto the pitch to supervise their maiden World Cup final against the Netherlands at the Soccer City Stadium on Sunday.         
	The 38-year-old English referees appointment for the most crucial match of the World Cup has been cleared by the Fifas referees committee. He will be assisted by two other Englishmen  Darren Cann and Michael Mullarkey  on the lines.         
	[It caps a remarkable season for the trio. Only seven weeks ago Webb and his team were appointed to the Champions League final in Madrid, in which Inter Milan defeated Bayern Munich 2-0, adds The Daily Telegraph, London.         
	[Webb is the first Englishman to officiate in a World Cup final since Jack Taylor in 1974, when West Germany defeated Holland 2-1, and the first official to do the double of European Cup/Champions League and World Cup in the same year.         
	[Webb, Cann and Mullarkey officiated in three earlier matches in South Africa, after which they received widespread praise, but they did not get a game in the quarter-finals or semi-finals. It was widely thought that they might get the third-place play-off in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. However, Spain enhanced the Englishmens chances of being awarded the biggest match on the planet by beating Germany on Wednesday.         
	[This is a tremendous achievement for Howard, Mike and Darren, Mike Riley, general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the elite referees governing body, said on Thursday. Its recognition for their excellent tournament so far and also the progress they have made internationally over the last four years.         
	[Their appointment is fantastic recognition for English refereeing and should act as an inspiration for all young referees wanting to enter into the game.         
	[Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, said: We see the hard work and professionalism of Howard, Darren and Mike week in, week out, so it is great to see their fantastic season topped off with the ultimate appointment.]         
	Two Asian referees  Yuichi Nishimura and Toru Sagara  both from Japan have been named as the fourth official and the reserve assistant referee, respectively.         
	Though Webb, whose father Billy was also a referee, has an impeccable reputation, the Spanish camp is extremely unhappy with the Englishmans appointment. They strongly feel the entire group of referees for the finalWebb and his two English assistants  were responsible for Spains shock defeat, their only in the World Cup so far, in the group league match against Switzerland.         
	Spain claimed the Switzerland striker Gelson Fernandes was offside when he scored the winner. They also felt Webb should have sent off Stephane Grichting for a foul on Andres Iniesta when he was the last defender.         
	Though the Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque chose to remain silent on the referees appointment for the final, he criticised Webb after the Switzerland game.         
	The Swiss scorer was offside but the referee did not pull him up  it was unfortunate. We were at the receiving of a few decisions, the Spanish coach said.

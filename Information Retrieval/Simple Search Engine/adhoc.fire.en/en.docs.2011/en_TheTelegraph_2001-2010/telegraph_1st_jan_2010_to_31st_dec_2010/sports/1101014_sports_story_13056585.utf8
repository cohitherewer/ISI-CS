            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has not found any compelling evidence of corruption against any player or support staff in the Sept. 17 one-day match between England and Pakistan at The Oval. The ICC said on Wednesday the investigation was complete for now but if new and corroborating evidence came to light, its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) would reopen the case.         
	... the ACSU has verified all the available information and concluded that there was no compelling evidence to suspect individual players or support staff, ICC said in a statement.

	New Delhi: Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf is in awe of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and rates the India skipper as the most exciting and entertaining cricketer in world cricket.         
	Though Sachin Tendulkar is the worlds most consistent cricketer, Dhoni is the most entertaining and exciting, Musharraf said in an interview to a television channel. Once I praised his hair style. Now, he has gone for a shorter haircut. But he is still exciting to watch, Musharraf added.         
	The former Pakistan president also praised the Indian cricket team for its consistent showings over the past few years.         
	Though I am pained to see the state of Pakistan cricket, I am really impressed with the way Indian cricket is progressing. I must say you do have great players at your disposal, he said.         
	Musharraf, while voicing his concerns about the state of affairs in Pakistan cricket, said: The team is down and it is unfortunate that on an everyday basis, some new controversy crops up involving the team.

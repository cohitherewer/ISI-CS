	Bengal selectors Sambaran Banerjee, Malay Banerjee, Devang Gandhi and Mintoo Das submitted a letter to CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya about senior off-spinner Sourasish Lahiris animated jibe at Sambaran and Malay during his team, Kalighats CAB league match against Mohun Bagan at JU (Salt Lake ground).       
	Although Devang and Mintoo were not present, it has been learnt that it was a collective decision to lodge a complaint with the president as they are feeling terribly insulted. CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra admitted that they have received a letter.      
	I have forwarded it to the president and he will take a decision in this regard, Mitra said. The match in question ended in a dull draw as Bagan never really went for the chase.

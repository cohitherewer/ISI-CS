	Calcutta: West Indies off-spinner Shane Shillingford has been reported for suspected illegal bowling action, according to an International Cricket Council (ICC) media release, Saturday.         
	The 27-year-old bowler Dominican was reported after the first Test against Sri Lanka, which ended in a draw at Galle on Friday.         
	The umpires report has cited concern over the straightening of Shillingfords arm while bowling some deliveries to the degree that may constitute an illegal action, the ICC said in a statement.

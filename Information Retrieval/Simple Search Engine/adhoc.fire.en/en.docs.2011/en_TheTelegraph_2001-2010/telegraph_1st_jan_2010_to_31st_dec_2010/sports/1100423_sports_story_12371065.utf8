The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beto nets a brace in Dempo victory
                                                                                                                       7                                        Beto nets a brace in Dempo victory
                  Beto                     
	Margao: Beto scored twice to guide Dempo to a 2-1 victory over Sporting Clube de Goa in a 22nd round I-League match at Nehru Stadium, here on Thursday.         
	Beto first cancelled out Adil Khans 22nd minute goal five minutes after the break. He later scored the winner in the injury time to guide Dempo to victory. Dempo are now seven points clearer from second-placed Mahindra United.         
	Dempo have taken their tally to 44 points from 22 matches.         
	Dempo started in right earnest as they moved the ball well and had the early chances to score when Beto surprised goalkeeper Felix De Souza with a long ranger.         
	Felix failed to collect the ball cleanly and it landed on Joaquim Abranches but the latter drove the ball over.         
	Sporting made a counter attack but Agnelo DSouza, who was unmarked inside the box, saw his effort blocked by Dempo goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal.         
	Sporting shot into the lead in the 22nd minute when Adil Khan headed in a free kick taken by Bisheshwor Singh.         
	The goal galvanised the Sporting team as they found their rhythm and attacked the rival goal with a series of moves. They got two chances to increase the lead but first Dempo goalkeeper dived to his left to palm away Juniors free kick and later Joseph Pereiras shot missed the target narrowly.         
	Dempo found the equalizer in the 50th minute through a solo effort from Beto, who beat a host of rival defenders after collecting a throw in from Valeriano Rebelo. (PTI)

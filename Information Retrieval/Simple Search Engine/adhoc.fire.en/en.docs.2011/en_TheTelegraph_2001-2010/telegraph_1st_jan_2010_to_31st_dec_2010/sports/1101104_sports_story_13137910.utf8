	Mumbai: Ramesh Powar (5/109) grabbed five wickets but it was a lower-order who batsman hogged the limelight, once again, as Pratik Mehtas unbeaten 100 helped Saurashtra make 364 for seven against Mumbai, on Wednesday.         
	It was Mehtas maiden first-class century, one which has consumed 147 balls and was punctuated with 17 hits to the fence, so far.         
	If I played one match, I used to sit out four matches, the Rajkot-born player, who was playing in only his 23rd match of his career at the age of 32.

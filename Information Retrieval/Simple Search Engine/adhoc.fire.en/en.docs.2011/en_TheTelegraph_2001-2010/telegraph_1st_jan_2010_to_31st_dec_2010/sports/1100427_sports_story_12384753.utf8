	Guwahati: Winning has become a habit with Tarundeep Rai of Services but the 26-year-old from Sikkim was more than overjoyed when he won the recurve gold in the 30th Senior National Archery Championship (recurve and compound) that concluded at the Sarusajai Sports Complex here this evening.         
	After all, it was Tarundeeps first individual gold, a dream realised after seven attempts. The women recurve gold went to defending champion Deepika Kumari of Steel Plant. Ratan Singh of Services also won his first compound gold while Namita Yadav of the Railways bagged the womens compound gold.         
	Rahul Banerjee (recurve) and Jhanu Hansda (compound) were the defending champions. Both lost before the medal round started.         
	Having won medals at the world, Asian and SAF meets, World Cup-bound Tarundeep was desperate for the national champions tag. I have tasted success at international meets but I have always dreamt of winning the national gold. That was realised today.         
	I am very happy, more because it was achieved in windy conditions, always a challenge for us . It should stand me in good stead at the Porec World Cup next month as conditions there will be similar, Tarundeep said after beating A. Raju of Railways 6-4. Mangal Singh Champia finished third.         
	The 16-year-old Deepika, who beat Olympian Bombayla Devi of Railways in 5-8 in the shoot-off, was her composed self. It feels good as it came against a good player and was my second straight national gold... Could have done better had it not been for the wind which was coming from all directions, Deepika, the world cadet champion, said.         
	In the teams men compound, Andhra Pradesh ( 214) finished first followed by hosts Assam (209) and Services (212), while in the womens section, Bihar (207) took top honours followed by Railways (190) and Jharkhand (202). Services in men and Jharkhand in women had won the team titles last year in Balewadi.         
	The seasoned Dola Banerjee finished third followed by Chekrovolu Swuro of Nagaland 7-3. Namita Yadav of the Indian Railways regained the compound gold she lost to Jhanu Hansda in 2009 by beating Nive Kerketta of ITBP ( 6-2).         
	The weather was pleasant but windy conditions severely tested the archers. It got acute towards the evening.

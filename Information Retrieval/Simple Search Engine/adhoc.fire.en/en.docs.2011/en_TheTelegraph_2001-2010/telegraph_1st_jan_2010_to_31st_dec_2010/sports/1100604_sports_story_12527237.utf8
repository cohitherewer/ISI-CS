The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa reign at Anfield ends 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rafa reign at Anfield ends 
                      
	London: Rafa Benitez, whose reign as Liverpool manager ended on Thursday, will always be remembered on Merseyside for winning the Champions League in 2005 at the end of his first season at Anfield.         
	He boosted his status with Liverpool fans a year later when Liverpool beat West Ham United in the FA Cup final.         
	Although, they lost two finals on the following season to Chelsea in the League Cup and AC Milan in the Champions League, it seemed the fans had found a man who would bring them the coveted the English league title.         
	The problem for Benitez, though, was that the glory days were already over.         
	The arrival of the clubs new owners, Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett in 2007 three months before the second Champions League final against Milan, began a long period of uncertainty between Benitez and the board, who he publicly criticised for a lack of support.         
	Their courting of Juergen Klinsmann, the former Germany coach to replace him in November 2007, did nothing for the inner harmony at Anfield, but Benitez saw off the threat and revealed some of his own inner steel.         
	I cannot control everything, he said after the approach to Klinsmann became public.         
	I would rather concentrate my efforts on getting the best out of the players. I have been a manager for 21 years. That has helped me learn to cope with things like this. (Reuters)

            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: India retained the second position after their 1-0 series victory over Australia in the ICC ODI team rankings while Virat Kohli rose 11 places to career-best 13th in the batsmens chart.         
	India gained two rating points by winning the Visakhapatnam one-dayer on October 20 against Australia to take their tally to 117.         
	Australia, who lost an ODI series against India for the first time after 1986-87, dropped two rating points though they are still at the top of table with 130 points.         
	In the batsmens chart, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni dropped from second to fourth while Sachin Tendulkar jumped two places to joint eighth though he did not play in the just-concluded ODI series. Virender Sehwag also gained one place to seventh to be the second highest-ranked Indian after Dhoni.         
	Kohli, who scored a match-winning 118 against Australia in the second ODI in Visakhapatnam, rocketed 11 places into his career-best 13th position which makes him the fourth highest-ranked Indian batsman.         
	Kohli is the fourth highest-ranked India batsman after Dhoni, Sehwag and Sachin. The overall batsmens chart is led by South Africas AB de Villiers, also ICC ODI Player of the Year.         
	De Villiers, who scored 21, 101 not out and 109 against Zimbabwe in the three-match ODI series, has achieved his career-best rating points of 820.         
	He is the 44th batsman overall and fifth South African after Gary Kirsten (903; October 1996), Hansie Cronje (836; December 1994), Lance Klusener (829; September 1999) and Daryll Cullinan (809; November 1997) to achieve the 800-point mark, which in ranking terms, is the benchmark for every batsman in ODI cricket.

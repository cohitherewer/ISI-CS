	Kochi: Sreesanth said Sunday that he was recovering fast from his injury, and is hopeful of playing the second Test against South Africa, starting on February 14 in Calcutta.         
	Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function here, Sreesanth, who was not picked for the first Test due to a hamstring injury, said he would start bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore, by Wednesday or Thursday.         
	There is nothing serious and I am having very good training sessions at the NCA. Im very happy with my progress and Im recovering very fast, Sreesanth, who was on a days visit here, said.         
	I have started running sprints and will start bowling soon, may be by Wednesday or Thursday. Everything is looking good and hopefully I should be fit for the second Test. I really dont want to miss any game be it against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or South Africa, he added.         
	The temperamental pacer, who was sent home from Bangladesh after suffering a hamstring strain during the first Test in Chittagong, said the series against South Africa will be closely contested.         
	Ill not say it will be 2-0 for us, but I am sure it will be a good contest. Im looking forward to play if I get fit and if I get selected, he said.(PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA dismisses talk of Warne comeback
                                                                                                                       7                                        CA dismisses talk of Warne comeback

	Perth: England coach Andy Flower Monday laughed off suggestions champion leg spinner Shane Warne could make a shock Ashes comeback as Australia become increasingly desperate to find a way to win back the prized urn.         
	Cricket Australia (CA) chief James Sutherland has dismissed calls of Warne return as fanciful. The Warne sideshow has reached fever pitch in Australia as the once dominant cricket nation contemplates a worrying 1-0 deficit after two Ashes Tests, leading to growing calls for the 41-year-old to return in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.         
	Speaking ahead of the third Test at the WACA ground in Perth, starting on Thursday, Flower laughed off any thought of Warne resuming his 145-Test career after almost four years out of the game.         
	I am not surprised that it wont go away, he said of the Warne speculation with a broad grin. But it is not going to happen.         
	Australian debutant Michael Beer, who will become the 10th spinner tried by Australia since Warnes retirement, also dismissed talk of a comeback by the legend. They bring that up three times a year, dont they? he said.         
	CA chief Sutherland said octagenarian television commentator Richie Benaud, who last bowled a ball on the Test stage in 1964, was as likely to pull on the baggy green cap again.         
	Shane retired from Test cricket almost exactly four years ago and, by his own admission, he hasnt touched a cricket bat or ball since the (Indian Premier League) IPL early this year, Sutherland said.         
	CA hasnt spoken to him about playing and, while the selectors operate independently of CA management, I am not aware of them having any intention of talking to Shane.He is Australias greatest-ever bowler and he was always going to be irreplaceable. World cricket is unlikely to see the likes of him again in our lifetime.         
	There has been a lot of passionate debate about cricket since Adelaide, some of its sensible and some of it fanciful.           (AGENCIES)

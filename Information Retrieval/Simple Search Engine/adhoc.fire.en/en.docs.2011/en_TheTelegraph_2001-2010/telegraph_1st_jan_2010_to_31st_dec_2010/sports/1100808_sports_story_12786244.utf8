                                                                                                                       7                                      Im not a puppet: Isaac
                      
	Melbourne: New Zealand Cricket chief Alan Isaac, who has been nominated for the ICC vice-presidents post, insisted on Saturday, that he would not let himself become a puppet in the politically diverse body.         
	Despite being a late pick, Isaac said he does not feel like a last-choice candidate.         
	I dont feel like second or third pick and if you talk to anyone who knows me, Im not a puppet, I am my own person, Isaac said.         
	Id like to think Im judged on what I achieve or what I dont achieve in two, three or four years time, he said.         
	The 58-year-old said one of his priorities after getting the ICC member nations nod for the job would be to improve the governing bodys image.         
	Talking about the furore that followed Howards rejection for the post, Isaac said the former Australian PM should have been given an explanation on why his name was not acceptable to the financially powerful Asian and African bloc.           (PTI)

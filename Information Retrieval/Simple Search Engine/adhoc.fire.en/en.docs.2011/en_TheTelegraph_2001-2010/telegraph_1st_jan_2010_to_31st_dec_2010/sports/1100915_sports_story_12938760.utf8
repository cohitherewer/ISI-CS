The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes-Bhupathi first choice, says Misra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Paes-Bhupathi first choice, says Misra
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  Leander Paes with Rohan Bopanna in Chennai, on Tuesday    
	Mumbai: Rohan Bopanna might be the toast of Indian tennis after his stupendous show at the US Open, but when it comes to the Davis Cup ties, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi are still the first choice combination.         
	Leander and Mahesh would be the first choice to play the doubles rubber, captain Shiv Prakash Misra told The Telegraph from Chennai ahead of the World Group play-off starting on Friday. Bhupathi joined the team from Mumbai on Tuesday.         
	Bopanna reached the final at the US Open in the company of Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and the performance has catapulted him to 19th in world doubles rankings.         
	Even as he scotched any speculation about Bopanna partnering either Paes or Bhupathi, the non-playing captain was all praise for the 30-year-old from Coorg.         
	Rohan has been playing excellent tennis recently. Even the last tie against Russia, he won the reverse singles, Misra said. Importantly, he is very keen to go out and perform, he knows a lot depends on him. He came straight to Chennai even when his parents were stranded in New York because they didnt get flight tickets. He is really focused and has been hitting the ball really well in practice.

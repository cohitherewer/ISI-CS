    - Clijsters starts her big w campaign with a bang; sania crashes out           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Roger Federer after winning against Alejandro Falla on the opening day at Wimbledon, on Monday. (AP)                                 
	London: Six-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer had to battle like never before at Wimbledon Monday to avoid the ignominy of a first round defeat to Colombias little-known clay court specialist Alejandro Falla.         
	Federer had never won from two sets down at Wimbledon before but he quickly found himself in such a position with Falla having opportunities to win in the third and and serving for victory in the fourth.         
	Eventually however Federer powered to victory in the fifth, over-coming an opponent playing way in excess of any known form. The reigning champion eventually prevailed 5-7, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, 6-0.         
	You have to draw from your experience and physical strength in these situations, Federer said afterwards.         
	Indias Sania Mirza crashed out in the first round of the women singles after losing to Angelique Kerber of Germany.         
	Sania, who is making her comeback after a three-month injury lay-off, lost 4-6, 1-6 to the 55th ranked Kerber in little more than an hour.         
	She will be playing the doubles with Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki. They play their opener against local British players, Anne Keothavong and Melanie South of Great Britain.         
	No. 7-seeded Nikolay Davydenko also overcame a two-set deficit, along with Kevin Andersons 36 aces, and won 3-6, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 7-5, 9-7.         
	Kim Clijsters won easily in her first Wimbledon match since 2006, beating Maria Elena Camerin 6-0, 6-3. No. 11 Marin Cilic lost to Florian Mayer 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (1), and No. 17 Ivan Ljubicic was beaten by Michal Przysiezny 7-5, 7-6 (5), 6-3. No. 16 Jurgen Melzer and No. 21 Gael Monfils advanced, as did Americans Mardy Fish and Brendan Evans.         
	Dustin Brown, the first Jamaican man to play in a Grand Slam tournament since 1974, lost to Melzer 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.         
	Clijsters has been sidelined since late April with a left foot injury, but showed plenty of spring in her step playing the opening match on Court 2.         
	Seeded eighth, the Belgian dominated from the baseline and with her return. She never faced a break point and won 12 of 15 points on Camerins second serve. Clijsters ended a 2 1/2-year retirement last August and won the US Open in September.         
	Federer and Falla had met before on centre court in 2004 when Federer had lost just four games as he breezed to the easiest of wins and the Swiss has twice beaten Falla with plenty to spare in recent tournaments but there was a much different atmosphere around Centre Court Monday.         
	As the match unfolded a sleepy crowd came alive and by midway through the second set it was full-on finals day madness before lunch on the first day.         
	Falla  compact, courageous and composed  produced calm almost flawless tennis for the first two sets and in a reverse from the norm it was Federer who found himself under the cosh and pressurised into mistakes In particular his backhand seemed to malfunction on key points and he found the net with unusual regularity         
	Almost from the start you wondered if something was afoot with Federer looking edgy and making Falla appearing to be the Wimbledon veteran. And it was no surprise at all when Falla broke to 30 at 5-5 to see the alarm bells ringing in the first set to get lay down the challenge proper. Federer definitely raised his game at this point but the momentum was with Falla and he served out in some style to take the set 7-5.         
	Surely normal service would now be resumed? But no. Falla didnt miss a beat and continued in similar vein throughout the second set as Federer who had a 51-5 win record at Wimbledon going into this tournament searched desperately for his A game. On occasions he didnt seem far short but Falla, playing at a level he has never approached before, kept coming at him.         
	Falla remained rock solid until the moment came to close out the set at which point, for the first time, he showed displayed his nerves as he blew three set points before he finally put a simple volley into the wide open spaces to take an extraordinary 2-0 lead.         
	The moment of truth had arrived for Federer who has never had to come back from two sets down at Wimbledon before. Although not at his absolute best, he was still playing pretty well. Amazingly the truth was the he was being outplayed by the world number 65 who was having the game of his life.         
	Centre Court, which hadnt been full to start, was now overflowing as news spread but Federer dug deep in the third set like the champion he is, especially at 4-4 when Falla had three break points. It looked like Roger and out but somehow he clawed it back and then at 30-30 and then deuce he managed to scrape home. Falla leading two sets to one and already we were slap-bang in the game of the tournament.         
	Falla still came at Federer with everything he had and quickly regained the initiative by breaking a bemused Federer straight away, closing out the game with a sensational forehand.         
	Tense as tense could be as both players fought to hold serve. Fella maintained his intensity superbly while Federer veered from the sublime to the sloppy although a beautifully manufactured drop shot to close to 4-3 when danger was again imminent was a shot of genius.         
	Going into the fifth set and after three hours of absorbing tennis Federer at last seemed to be on the front foot, breaking Falla in the first game.         
	He broke again in a brutally contested third game and suddenly there was daylight between him and Falla and the Federer fans could breathe easily again.

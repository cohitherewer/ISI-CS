                                                                                                                       7                                      Tricky trip for United
                      
	London: Hampered by injury absentees and a humiliating FA Cup exit, Manchester United face a tricky match at Birmingham in the Premier League on Saturday.         
	The cup loss to third-tier Leeds capped a patchy first half of the season for United, who remain second in the standings in their bid for a fourth straight Premier League title.         
	Uniteds dip in form is reflected in their last 11 league results and becomes glaring when compared with those of newly-promoted Birmingham. Both sides have won seven, but while United have lost four, Birmingham are unbeaten after four draws.         
	Injuries have added to Uniteds problems, with Nemanja Vidic being ruled out for 10 days after tweaking a nerve in his leg and joining fellow centre back Rio Ferdinand on the sidelines.         
	The match at St. Andrews is set to survive Britains coldest conditions for more than 30 years. But three other Saturday fixtures have fallen victim to the weather  Fulham vs Portsmouth, Burnley vs Stoke and Sunderland vs Bolton  and Sundays match between Liverpool and Tottenham has been postponed because of safety concerns over the icy roads and paths leading to Anfield.         
	Chelsea begin a run of league matches at Hull without four key African players. Top-scorer Didier Drogba, along with fellow striker Salomon Kalou and midfielders Michael Essien and John Mikel Obi, will be absent for much of this month because of the African Cup of Nations.         
	Arsenal had to call off their match against Bolton on Wednesday, but remain hopeful that the Emirates Stadium can host Everton.         
	In Saturdays other scheduled match, sixth-place Aston Villa are at Wigan, while relegation-threatened sides West Ham and Wolverhampton are due to meet at Upton Park on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have to improve fielding: Raman
                                                                                                                       7                                      Have to improve fielding: Raman
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Outsiders might consider Bengal lucky to have earned a point for Mumbais decision to play for a draw, but Woorkeri Raman thinks otherwise. The Bengal coach said his boys were game for the follow-on as there was not much on offer from the dead wicket at the Eden Gardens.         
	I would have fancied my batsmen to bat out the day. Because, if you look at it, theres hardly anything in the pitch. One innings here and there, and, a couple of other things went wrong, that was the reason.         
	But if you saw how the tail-enders batted, there is no room or cause for any alarm. The only thing is, I would like our top-order batsmen to get a few more runs. But theres no point in crying over spilt milk, Raman said.         
	Bengal have dropped too many catches since their first match against Delhi, and a few dropped chances at crucial junctures put the hosts in trouble against Mumbai.         
	Thats one area where we have to improve and there are no two ways about it. Hopefully, all this is going to end here itself. Its also an indication that we were not run down badly. Our bowlers had created chances on dead tracks like this, which augurs well, he said.         
	Raman felt the result could have been different had his boys latched on to the edges. Its a question of us making the mistake at the wrong time. Probably, if we could got those catches that came our way, the scorecard could have been different, the script of the match would have been different, he said.         
	The Bengal coach lauded the tailenders efforts and praised Sourasish Lahiri for adding useful runs at the end.         
	It always helps a team if the bowlers can hang around in the middle and add some useful runs. It is not a surprise to me because I always felt he was one who could bat usefully, and thats exactly what he did, Raman said.

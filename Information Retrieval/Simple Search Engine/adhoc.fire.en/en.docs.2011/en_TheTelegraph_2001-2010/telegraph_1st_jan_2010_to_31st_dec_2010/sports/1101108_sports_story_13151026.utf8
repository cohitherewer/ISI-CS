The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inter Milan held by Brescia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Inter Milan held by Brescia
                      
	Rome: Samuel Eto converted a hotly disputed penalty to earn injury-hit champions Inter Milan a point in a disappointing 1-1 home draw with newly-promoted Brescia, on Saturday.         
	Andrea Caracciolo had given stubborn Brescia a first half lead but Eto notched his 17th goal in 16 games in this incredible season for the Cameroon captain after he himself went down in the box. However, TV replays showed Eto had fallen over after treading on the ball under pressure from Gaetano Berardi.         
	Brescia coach Giuseppe Iachini and goalkeeper Michele Arcari complained about the penalty award.         
	For the way the game developed, for what we did tacticcally and our performance, yes theres bitterness because we could have had three points, said Iachini.         
	Its a shame because after the game against Roma we havent been lucky, things went against us.         
	Arcari added: Maybe it was a penalty but there was a foul beforehand on Berardi, but were at the San Siro and were Brescia.         
	The draw means second-placed Inter closed the gap to leaders Lazio to three points. Inter coach Rafael Benitez, unsurprisingly, saw things differently. From the bench it seemed a penalty to me, he said.         
	However, what he could not hide from was Inters third successive home draw in the league.         
	Inter have scored just 12 goals in 10 Serie A games, less than half the 26 they had at the same stage last season. We can talk about (Diego) Milito, Eto, (Goran) Pandev, all these players have to score goals, thats the difference (to last year), said Benitez.         
	Milito has scored only twice this season after 30 in 51 games last time, while Pandev has scored none, although he managed only three in 27 in the previous campaign.         
	With a dearth of fit central midfielders, Benitez was forced to play Wesley Sneijder in an unfamiliar defensive midfield position but he still had the first sight of goal, forcing Michele Arcari into a low save from his free-kick.

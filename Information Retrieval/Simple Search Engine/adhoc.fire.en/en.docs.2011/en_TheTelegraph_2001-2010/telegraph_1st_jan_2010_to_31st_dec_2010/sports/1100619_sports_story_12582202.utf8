The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germans Serb-ed a notice
                                                                                                                       7                                      Germans Serb-ed a notice
            Guest Column - Shyam Thapa                
	Joachim Loews face said it all. After all, what exactly can a coach do if his key player spurns chances like a millionaire. Within three minutes from 57th to 60th, Lukas Podolski blew away three of the most easiest chances, including a penalty which was saved by Serbian goalie Vladimir Stojkovic.         
	May be the missed penalty was an indication that the Germans didnt have the luck going their way against Serbia in Port Elizabeth on Friday. But there shouldnt be any arguments about how shoddy Germany were against Serbia on the day.         
	If they are in trouble after their 0-1 defeat, the Miroslav Kloses and Podolskis should take the entire blame on their shoulders.         
	Such has been the German dominance over the years, that this is the first time since 1986 World Cup that they have lost in the group league stage. The last time was against Denmark, when Germany, in their bid to avoid Spain in a last-16 clash, lost the match.         
	Discipline and professionalism have always been the two pillars of Germanys soccer ethos. Strangely, that was entirely missing against the Serbians during a match which wasnt short of drama ---- thanks to card-happy Spanish referee Alberto Undiano who showed as many as nine yellow and a red-card to the most prolific German striker Klose.         
	I have no doubt that Klose deserved a second yellow card for tackling Dejan Stankovic from behind.         
	 It was an unnecessary tackle when the player was in no position to score and it was uncalled for. Klose should take the responsibility for spoiling the momentum and balance of his team.         
	Its always takes some time to recover from the shock of a send-off and that exactly happened with Germany. Within the next minute, they conceded the goal.         
	Although Milan Jovanovic scored the goal, Milos Krasic deserves equal credit for that beautiful cross and so does the giant Nikola Zigic standing at six ft 7 and half inches headed the ball down for Jovanovic to score a historic goal for Serbia. It is certainly party-time for the Serbian forward who has recntly signed for Liverpool.         
	So what went wrong with Germany? May be it was something to do with complacency after brushing aside the Socceroos 4-0 in the first match.         
	The first 45 minutes against Serbia was a big let down. They were slow and their cautious approach wasnt needed. There was absolutely no purpose in the build-ups.         
	The speed with which the midfield operated against Australia was also missing. And, then, the red card happened!         
	Klose, who has scored 11 goals for Germany since 2002 World Cup, must hear some tough words from Loew and his mates.         
	The Bayern Munich forward should understand that his absence will be a blow for Germany when they meet Ghana in the final group league encounter.         
	The Germans also One should also severely criticise the shooting in 18-yard box. Podolski alone looked like a zombie as his booming pile drivers were either hitting the side of the net or were sailing above the horizontal.         
	I strongly believe that instead of Podolski someone else should have taken the penalty. His miss was the first since Uli Hoeness missed one against Poland back in 1974.         
	He missed two sitters and was low on confidence before taking the penalty. Loew could also have introduced strikers Mario Gomez and Cacau a bit earlier.         
	It was also shocking to see one of the best centre-backs in the world, Nemanja Vidic, doing something as immature as handling the ball inside the box.         
	Alex Ferguson wont certainly be amused while watching the Manchester United defender do something as foolish as this.

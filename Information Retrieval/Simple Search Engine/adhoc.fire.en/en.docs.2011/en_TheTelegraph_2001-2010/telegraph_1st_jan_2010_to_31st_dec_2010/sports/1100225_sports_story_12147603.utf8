The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atkinson clears Daljit Singh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Atkinson clears Daljit Singh
                      
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council pitch consultant Andy Atkinson has held the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) responsible for last years Kotla pitch fiasco while absolving curator Daljit Singh.         
	Atkinsons report comes after he visited the stadium to suggest corrective measures for the pitch, deemed too dangerous during an India-Sri Lanka match which was eventually abandoned in December last year.         
	Atkinson said the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s former pitch and grounds committee chairman Daljit had given the right suggestions but the DDCA had over-ruled him.         
	...The decision to use Perennial Rye grass was the only option left at a very late stage in an attempt to obtain some grass cover for the ODI on the 27th December and was recommended by Mr Daljit Singh quite correctly as an emergency measure, Atkinson said.         
	Unfortunately the then local authority of DDCA did not agree with that course of action and went ahead and planted some local Cynodon grass, creating damage to the surface levels in doing so. As predicted, this grass did not grow then..., he added in an eight-page report sent to BCCIs chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty.         
	Soon after the incident, the ICC slapped a one-year international ban on the venue.         
	Atkinson felt the pitch surface had been damaged by the use of a heavy roller.           (PTI)

	On 186, McCullum registered his highest score in Test cricket. His previous highest was 185 vs Bangladesh in Hamilton in February 2010.

	McCullum becomes the only second visiting player to score a double hundred in India in the second innings. Earlier, Andy Flower had made 232* in Nagpur in 2000-01. Like McCullum, Flowers double hundred, too, came on the fifth day.

	 497 for five, England in Kanpur, 1961

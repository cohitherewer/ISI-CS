The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Menezes is Brazils new coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Menezes is Brazils new coach
                      
	Sao Paulo: Mano Menezes, a specialist in leading big clubs out of the doldrums, but little-known outside his own country, became the coach of Brazil on Saturday when he accepted an offer from the five-time world champions.         
	The 48-year-old, currently coach of Corinthians, confirmed he had said yes to the Brazilian football confederation (CBF), which had been turned down by Muricy Ramalho Thursday after his club refused to release him.         
	For the whole of Brazil, I say that I officially accept the invitation, Menezes told a news conference at his club.         
	Menezes, who replaces Dunga in the hot seat, will have the huge task of trying to rebuild Brazils national team, discredited after their quarter final exit from the World Cup against the Netherlands three weeks ago, and win a sixth world title when they host the 2014 World Cup.         
	Winning their own World Cup is seen as an obligation by Brazils 190 million inhabitants. With Brazils failure to win on home soil in 1950 still being mentioned regularly, the pressure on Menezes and his team will be greater than ever.         
	Menezes made his name in 2005 when he led former South American champions Gremio out of the second division.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is   a run machine: Latif
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin is   a run machine: Latif
                            
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captains heaped praise on Sachin Tendulkar for becoming the first man to score 50 Test hundreds.               
	The following is what they had to say (alphabetically):         
	Moin Khan: I have always admired his competitiveness and hunger for runs. He also highlights the fact that as long as a player has passion for cricket and confidence in his skills and is fit, age is never a barrier in international cricket.         
	Rashid Latif: Sachin can now rightly lay claim to the title of being the greatest batsman in cricket history. He is a run machine and his 50th Test hundred is a testimony to his endurance and passion for the sport.         
	Javed Miandad: I am happy for Sachin. It was clear to us even when he walked out to bat in that Test as a teenager that he had talent. The fact that he has been around for 21 years and done justice to that God gifted talent in both forms of the game is an achievement any cricketer would be proud off.         
	Hanif Muhammad: I try to watch every match he is playing because I have not seen anyone gifted with such natural technical batting excellence. He has combined that with his hardwork and commitment. He is a role model for every young batsman. (PTI)

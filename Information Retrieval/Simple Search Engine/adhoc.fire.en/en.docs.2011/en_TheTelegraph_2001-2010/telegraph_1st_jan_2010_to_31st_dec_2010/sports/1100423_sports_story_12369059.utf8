	London: Aston Villa kept alive their slim hopes of Champions League qualification with an easy 2-0 Premier League win at relegation-threatened Hull City on Wednesday.         
	Gabriel Agbonlahors smart finish inside the box gave Villa the lead on 14 minutes but Kevin Kilbane missed a great chance to equalise for the hosts.         
	Hull striker Jan Venegoor of Hesselink was carried off on a stretcher in the second half following a clash of heads and James Milner added a penalty for Villa 12 minutes from time.         
	Were in the mix. Were going for everything and guaranteed nothing, Villa manager Martin Neill told reporters.         
	Where Ive been pleased with the team is theyve responded fantastically to the defeat at Stamford Bridge.         
	The team has shown a great deal of character all season and I think that was epitomised tonight.         
	Hull should have equalised in the 24th minute, however, with three chances in the same move.         
	Venegoor of Hesselink, who later needed lengthy treatment and was taken off with a head injury, saw a shot blocked by goalkeeper Brad Friedel. The ball fell to Kilbane whose drive was again saved by the American keeper. Kilbanes follow up attempt was deflected over the bar by Villa defender James Collins.         
	Villa doubled their lead when Milner was felled by George Boateng in the area and promptly drove home the penalty.         
	The result means that the race for fourth place is getting hotter. Villa moved above Liverpool into sixth on 61 points from 35 matches and trail Tottenham Hotspur, who occupy the fourth and final Champions League qualifying spot, by three having played one game more.         
	Hull, in 18th place with 28 points, are three points adrift of safety with just three games left.           (REUTERS)

            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Maharashtra Cricket Association has offered a lucrative deal to Bengal speedster Ranadeb Bose to represent their state as a professional for the forthcoming Ranji Trophy season. The lanky medium pacer is yet to take a call, although he termed the offer as a lucrative one.         
	It is true, that I have received an offer to play Ranji Trophy for Maharashtra, Ranadeb informed on Tuesday. When asked about the nature of the offer, he replied: I am not in a position to tell you about the amount that I have been offered. But, I can tell you that the offer has come from the Maharashtra Cricket Association president Ajay Shirke. He has offered me a three-year contract, he added.         
	However, Ranadeb categorically said that he wont take any decision in this regard without consulting with the Cricket Association of Bengal president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	I am not going to take any decision without speaking to Mr. Dalmiya. There is no denying that I have gained recognition as a cricketer playing for the Bengal. Therefore, I will not be in a position to take a call without consulting with the CAB president, he said.

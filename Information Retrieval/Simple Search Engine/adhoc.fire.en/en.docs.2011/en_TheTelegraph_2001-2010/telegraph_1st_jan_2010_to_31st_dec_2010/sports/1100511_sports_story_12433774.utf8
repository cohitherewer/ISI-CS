The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An exciting win: Clarke
                                                                                                                       7                                      An exciting win: Clarke
                      
	Bridgetown: Australia captain Michael Clarke Sunday said their self-belief has driven them on their unbeaten run after four matches in the World T20.         
	Australia once again drew on their middle-order batting strength to crush Sri Lanka by 81 runs in their Super Eights clash. The win virtually assured Australia of a place in the semis.         
	Man of the Match Cameron White smashed a career-best 85 not out as Australia recovered from 67 for five to score 168 for five. Sri Lanka managed just 87 in 16.2 overs.         
	With the strength of our squad, weve spoken about any situation we get in, we believe we can win, Clarke was quoted as saying in a Melbourne daily. (Agencies)

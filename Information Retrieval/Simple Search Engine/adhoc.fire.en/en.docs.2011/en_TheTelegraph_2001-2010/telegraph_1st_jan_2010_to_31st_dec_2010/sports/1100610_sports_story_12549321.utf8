	Home to some of the countrys most fanatical group of supporters, the Free State Stadium is likely to be the centre of attention during the World Cup. The stadium was given a plush new look for the Confederations Cup. It hosted the memorable semi-final match between Spain and USA where the latter scored one of the biggest surprises of the tournament by sending the European champions packing in front of a capacity crowd. The Free State Stadium was upgraded from being a 38,000 capacity venue to one that can seat 45,000. The stadium has hosted numerous major football and rugby union matches, and Bloemfonteins natives are renowned for their passion for sport.

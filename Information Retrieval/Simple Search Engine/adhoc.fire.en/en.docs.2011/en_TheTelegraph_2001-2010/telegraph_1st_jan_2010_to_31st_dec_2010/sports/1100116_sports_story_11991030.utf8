The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gunners sign Sol
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gunners sign Sol
                      
	London: Sol Campbell was given a chance to re-launch his career on Friday when Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger announced the 35-year-old had signed a contract with his former club until the end of the season.         
	The former England central defender has been a free agent since quitting League Two (fourth division) Notts County in September, just one match into a five-year contract.         
	Campbell will not feature in Arsenals match at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday, having played just 45 minutes in a reserve match this week, but could provide useful cover for William Gallas and Thomas Vermaelen in the months ahead.

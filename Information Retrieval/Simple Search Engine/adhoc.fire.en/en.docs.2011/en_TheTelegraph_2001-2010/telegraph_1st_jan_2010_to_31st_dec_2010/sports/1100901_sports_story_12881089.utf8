The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rathore to miss CWG
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rathore to miss CWG
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Olympic medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore will not be a part of the Indian team for the Commonwealth Games, as he did not show up for the double trap selection trials at the Karni Singh range, on Tuesday.         
	Not in his best form now, the Athens Olympic silver medal winner had a chance of making the squad had he managed a 145-plus score in the trials. Given his current average score of 130, there is no way Rathore could be considered for selection.         
	Miffed with the selection policy adopted by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), Rathore said he preferred to skip the trials. There are obvious reasons why I did not take part, he told The Telegraph.         
	The other shooters have been affected as well because of the environment created by certain policies, said Rathore. He is obviously upset by the NRAI policy of selecting shooters based on their average scores in the past few months.         
	NRAI secretary general Rajiv Bhatia said it was sad that the ace shooter could not make the cut. But the policy is made for everyone. It cannot be changed for an individual. If Rathore did not like the selection policy, he should have informed the NRAI earlier.         
	Though the selection will only be done on Wednesday, Ranjan Sodhi and Vikram Bhatbnagar are likely to be picked in double trap as no other shooter could match their average scores in the trials.         
	In the trap event, Manavjit Singh and Mansher Singh are likely to get the nod. Leading shooters like Beijing Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang, who has already booked a berth in the 2012 London Olympics, had all appeared in the three-day trials.         
	The national selection meeting will be held, on Wednesday, and Rathore, a double trap shooter, is sure to miss the cut. Since he did not turn up at the trials, he stands disqualified for selection. He has not spoken to us why he missed it, NRAI secretary Rajeev Bhatia said. The NRAI had made it clear that only those shooters will be considered for selection, who will appear in trials.         
	National coach Sunny Thomas said it was important for Rathore to put up a good show at trials as his average score in international event was not good enough. I also dont know why he did not come. It was important for him to do well and get selected, he said.

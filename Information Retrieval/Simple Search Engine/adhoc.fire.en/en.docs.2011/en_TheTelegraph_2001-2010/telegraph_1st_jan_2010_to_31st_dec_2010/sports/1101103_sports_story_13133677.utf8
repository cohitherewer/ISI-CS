	Kiev: After three wins in their last three matches, Arsenal can secure a place in the last 16 of the Champions League by winning another on Wednesday at Shakhtar Donetsk.         
	The Gunners, who won their last two Premier League matches and another in the League Cup, are perfect in the Champions League with a maximum nine points. They beat the Ukrainian champions 5-1 at the Emirates Stadium two weeks ago.         
	We have a very technical team and that suits the Champions League, especially in the group stage, where we have technical superiority, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. We feel that is our natural level. We have the confidence to beat teams, and that makes the difference.         
	Arsenal have never won in Ukraine, losing on three of their four previous visits. Wenger is monitoring the fitness of captain Cesc Fabregas, who played the full 90 minutes in the 1-0 win over West Ham despite having a hamstring problem. Center back Thomas Vermaelen and striker Robin van Persie are still absent while midfielder Aaron Ramsey is not expected to return from a broken leg for at least another month.         
	But winger Theo Walcott is likely to start against Shakhtar after coming off the bench on Saturday and midfielder Jack Wil-shire, who signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal on Monday, is available after suspension.         
	Chelseas Yuri Zhirkov will have an added incentive to beat Spartak Moscow on Wednesday after the Russian clubs owner made a dig at him in local media.         
	Russian Zhirkov scored a spectacular volley into the top corner to set the English champions on their way to a 2-0 win over Spartak at Moscows Luzhniki stadium in the first encounter two weeks ago.         
	It was his first goal for Chelsea since moving to Stamford Bridge in July 2009, prompting Spartaks billionaire owner Leonid Fedun to quip: Zhirkov shoots like this once every five years. Unfortunately, it happened in our match.         
	Zhirkov, who played for Spartaks bitter Moscow rivals CSKA for five years before joining Chelsea, said he wanted to prove Fedun wrong.         
	Ive read these comments by Mr. Fedun and want to prove to him that he really underestimates me, the Russian international said.         
	Chelsea top group F with a maximum nine points from three games. Spartak are second on six points.         
	Meanwhile, Bayern Munich travel to Romania for their Champions League tie against CFR Cluj without injured defender Holger Badstuber and with a depleted squad of only 15 players.         
	Holger Badstuber did not join the team to Romania, a club official said.         
	Central defender Badstuber picked up a hip injury during warm-up in their Bundesliga win over Freiburg at the weekend. He will most likely be replaced by Argentine Martin Demichelis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A good start vital: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      A good start vital: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Saddled with injury worries, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to play down the issue saying that the youngsters would have to step up the gas and fill the void. At a pre-match news conference on Friday, he also said that there wont be any additional pressure on the No. 1 side in the world.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The injury problems         
	Injuries are beyond our control and can happen anytime. Nothing much can be done about it. VVS Laxman is an uncertainty with his injury. Though he had a net session today (Friday), we are yet to decide on him. Well have to discuss with the physio before taking a final call.         
	If he would push himself up the order in the absence of Rahul Dravid         
	I dont think so I will stick to my slot. But we need to assess the situation as it comes. Well see how the match progresses and decide accordingly.         
	On the South Africans being a better fielding side         
	Were a good catching side. Of course they are better in ground fielding But actually, it all depends on bowling well and adapting to the situations.         
	On slip fielding         
	Of course, well miss Dravid in the slips. And Laxman, even if he plays, wont be fielding in the slips.         
	On the series being just a two-Test affair         
	We are quite happy with what we have got. Even the two Tests were actually not scheduled. A third, of course, would have been better for both the sides.         
	The game plan         
	A lot will depend on a good start, whether we are bowling or batting. If we are batting, a solid start will help our bowlers to put pressure on the opposition. But at the same time well also have to see their plan and adapt accordingly.         
	On comparisons between him and Graeme Smith as a skipper         
	(Laughs) Im a better keeper, hes a better opener. Its a team sport and involves all the players. Even the support staff play a crucial role. So its not really about me and Smith, its more about India and South Africa.         
	If the injury problems have made them the underdogs         
	Weve never called ourselves anything... Its just that we go with a mindset of winning...

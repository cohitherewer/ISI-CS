The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal hit rock bottom
                                                                                                                       7                                        East Bengal hit rock bottom
  - RED AND GOLD BRIGADE GO DOWN 0-4 VS AL NEJMEH TO LOSE ALL SIX TIES IN AFC CUP       KUSHAN SARKAR            Action during East Bengals AFC Cup match against Al Nejmeh of Lebanon, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Lebanese club Al Nejmehs players were trying to prove one point on Tuesday  left is always right. The first three goals they scored against East Bengal were all left-footers. Al Nejmeh scored one more as they thrashed East Bengal 4-0 in the red and gold brigades final AFC Cup group league encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe De Ridder was in a mood to make a mockery of an international match; the Belgian named only 15 players for Tuesdays tie, keeping in mind the I-League match against Sporting Clube later this week. (Not that his boys have done anything noteworthy in the I-league either).         
	With Al Nejmeh wanting to pump in as many as possible, the manner in which the local giants played in the first half seemed to suggest that East Bengal were hell bent on breaking Mohun Bagans ignominious record of conceding 19 goals in a single campaign. East Bengal did a shade better, conceding 20.         
	Before the boys in red and gold jerseys could even get into the groove, the Lebanese side struck in the third minute.         
	A long ball from wide right by Akram Moghrabi fell just outside the box with none of the East Bengal back three in position. Al Nejmeh captain Abbas Atwi pounced on the delivery and, before his opposite number Saumik Dey could close in, finished with a rising left-footer. The Lebanese international could have added one more to his tally had his long ranger not flown inches over the horizontal.         
	With nothing at stake, De Ridder experimented with a three-man defence which as usual backfired, like most of his ploys this season. The trio of Govin Singh, Saumik and Saheb Ali Gharami didnt have a clue about how much ground to cover and showed no sense of positioning.         
	The Al Nejmeh midfield, especially skipper Atwi and Senegalese central midfielder Papa Cisse, took complete control of the proceedings. The easiest of chances was missed by striker Ali Nasserddine whose left-footer sailed way over the crossbar with Priyant at his mercy.         
	In the 36th minute, Papa wrongfooted Mumtaz Akhtar before unleashing a left-footer that hit the upright before going in. Up by two goals, the Lebanese boys attacked with greater gusto and their skipper got his second goal of the match in the 41st minute.         
	Again it was a long ball and one that again caught Saumik out of position. By the time he realised, Abbas was well and truly on his way to scoring his teams third goal with another left-footed placement.         
	Down 0-3 at the break, there was little left for the home team to do. De Ridder effected a couple of changes and from 3-5-2, the Belgian reverted back to the usual 4-4-2 format in an effort to stem the rot.         
	The fourth goal in the 67th was a top-class long ranger from Bilal whose 30-yard shot rocketed into the net as the whole East Bengal defence froze in their positions. Such was the ferocity of the drive and the beautiful trajectory it took, the pint-sized Priyant could have done precious little to prevent the goal.         
	The only silver lining was Bhaichung Bhutia playing a full match. But he did nothing of note apart from trying an acrobatic volley that soared over the horizontal.

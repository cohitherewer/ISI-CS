The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Becket for Derby
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Becket for Derby

	Bangalore: Of the 12 horses vying for the 2,400m The Poonawalla Bangalore Derby, on Tuesday, the four four runners who merit attention are Becket, Cabriolet, Youre So Beautiful and Star Assembly.          
	On paper Becket (Hawk Wing-Boiling River) looks outstanding but he is going over the Derby trip for the first time. The Padmanabhan trained hor-se, to be ridden by David Allan, has not faltered in his careers three starts. His Derby preparations are also brilliant.          
	Star Assembly (Alnasar Alwasheek-Name Of Love) from S Ganapathys stable had finished third to Becket in one of his earlier runs. Luck favouring, he may turn the table.          
	Trainer Neil Darashahs Youre So Beautiful (Tirol-Ellway Dancer) was unlucky to have lost by a short-head to Systematic in the Bangalore Oaks. The filly, ridden by Suraj Narredu, has served notice.          
	Cabriolet is a final entry. Trained by Shroff and ridden by Richard, Hughes, is a highly rated horse (Glory Of Dancer-Highland Ghillie), who had finished a good third to Onasis, over 2,000m in Mumbai.           
	The Derby is, therefore going to be a close affair, but all of them may have to beat Becket.

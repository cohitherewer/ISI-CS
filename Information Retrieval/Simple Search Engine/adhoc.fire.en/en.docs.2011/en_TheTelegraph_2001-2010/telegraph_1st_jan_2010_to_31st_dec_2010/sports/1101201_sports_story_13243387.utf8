The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori: Have learnt from our mistakes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettori: Have learnt from our mistakes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       
	Jaipur: Injury-hit New Zealand had something to cheer about on Tuesday when their captain Daniel Vettori declared his availability for the second one-day International, against India, at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium.         
	With Brendon McCullum still a doubtful starter and Darryl Tuffey ruled out for the remainder of the matches in the ODI series, Vettoris return to the playing 11 would certainly come as a boost for the visitors, who are yet to register their first win in this tour.         
	We have lost the first match but the tour is yet not over, said the New Zealand captain after the practice session. We had our chances in the first match but couldnt capitalise on them. We have learnt from the mistakes and things are hopefully going to change now, he added.         
	Asked about Tuffey, he replied: Tuffey is out of the tour. I am coming in but Im not sure about Brendon I havent seen him training but will find out. We are waiting on his fitness.         
	Talking of positives from the first match, Vettori praised Andys McKays efforts with the ball and Ross Taylors innings that threatened to take the game away from India. But it did not matter much as ultimately it is the result which glosses over everything. McKay bowled beautifully and Taylor too batted well, he said.         
	Vettori was hopeful that he would be able to make an impact on Wednesday. On subcontinent wickets, the spinners always play a crucial role. I hope I will be able to contribute in a big way, hoped Vettori.         
	Asked whether the dew factor would be of any importance in the match, Vettori said: Yes, it is... But I am not too aware of the things here. We are mainly dependent on the feedback we have received from the locals.

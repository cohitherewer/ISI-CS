	Port Elizabeth: Substitute Mark Gonzalez headed in the only goal in the 75th minute Monday, giving Chile a 1-0 win over 10-man Switzerland at the World Cup.         
	Gonzalez headed in a pass from Esteban Paredes, who had rounded the Switzerland defense and crossed to Gonzalez at the back post.         
	Switzerland played a man down from the 31st minute, when midfielder Valon Behrami was sent off with a straight red card for violent conduct.         
	Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said: The red card was not a red card by my standpoint and accused the Chilean players of putting on quite a performance.         
	Before Chile scored, Switzerland set a World Cup record in the 69th, going 551 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal. The win gives Chile six points and first place in Group H. Switzerland, which upset European champion Spain 1-0 in their opening match, have three.

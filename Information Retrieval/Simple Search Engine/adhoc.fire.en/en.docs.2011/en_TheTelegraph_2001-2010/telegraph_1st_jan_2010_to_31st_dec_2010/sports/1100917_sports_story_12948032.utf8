The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Srinivasan:Lets wait for order
                                                                                                                       7                                      Srinivasan:Lets wait for order
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The observations of Justice Gyansudha Mishra, one of the Supreme Court judges hearing A.C. Muthiahs case against Narayanswamy Srinivasan, have caused more than a flutter but the latter sounded quite calm when contacted by The Telegraph, late on Thursday.         
	Srinivasan, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary, who is expected to succeed Shashank Manohar as president next September, said: The hearings are on and my lawyers are doing their job... Lets wait for an order to be passed... I dont wish to offer a comment... Right now, as you know, the matter is sub judice...         
	Muthiah, best known for being the BCCI president when the Mohammed Azharuddins got banned for match-fixing, in late 2000, has raised the conflict of interest issue.         
	Ironically, not many years ago, Srinivasan was seen as Muthiahs protege in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association circles.         
	Much water has, of course, flown down the Adyar since equations changed rather dramatically in Chennai.         
	Nobody from the BCCI was willing to go on record, but a source pointed out that the observations need not, in the end, necessarily constitute a part of the Supreme Courts views.         
	In fact, if Srinivasan actually has to choose, he may not hesitate to put away the Chennai Super Kings hat till such time that hes associated with the BCCI.         
	The picture is likely to get clear on Tuesday.

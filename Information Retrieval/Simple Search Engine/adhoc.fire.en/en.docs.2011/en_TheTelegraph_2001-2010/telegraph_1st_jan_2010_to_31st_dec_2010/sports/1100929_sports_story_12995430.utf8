  - Sehwag, Gambhir resume practice; Dhoni, Raina and Vijay to arrive today             Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh during a practice session in Mohali, on Tuesday                           
	Chandigarh: Harbhajan Singh, along with Indian openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, took part in the practice session, at the Sector 16 Stadium, here on Tuesday.         
	Harbhajan, who Monday underwent an MRI scan at a private hospital in Mohali after suffering a side sprain, had a bowling and batting session for about an hour.         
	The off-spinner bowled in his natural rhythm and later batted as well for a while.         
	Harbhajan has been cleared to play and if something comes up regarding his fitness, we will issue a press release in this regard, team manager Mayank Parekh said.         
	Harbhajan has a terrific record against Australia, scalping 79 wickets from 14 Tests.         
	At PCA stadium, in Mohali, on Monday, Harbhajan was seen limping during the practice session with his ankle bandaged.         
	However, he took part in the training after taking a break. He had also bowled at the Sector-16 Stadium nets after the conclusion of the match between Australia and Board Presidents XI.         
	Then he went to the Fortis Hospital, in Mohali, for the MRI scan. The hospital sources had said that there was no serious injury but since he got a sprain, it would be advisable to take rest for the next few days.         
	Meanwhile, Sehwag batted with ease after having hurt his right knee while facing speedster Ishant Sharma during Sundays net session, at the PCA Stadium.         
	Left-handed batsman Gambhir, who was on Sunday rushed to a hospital here after being hit on the right wrist by a Ben Hilfenhaus delivery, also had a knock on the day.         
	Gambhir didnt field or bat on the final day of the warm-up match against Australia. The opener appeared to be in good touch as he looked like stroking the balls well during the net session.         
	Rahul Dravid, who arrived here on Tuesday, straightway headed for the nets. The pace duo of Ishant and Zaheer Khan bowled with full steam during the three-hour session.         
	The trio of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina and Murali Vijay, who were busy with the Champions League T20 in South Africa, are expected to arrive on Wednesday.

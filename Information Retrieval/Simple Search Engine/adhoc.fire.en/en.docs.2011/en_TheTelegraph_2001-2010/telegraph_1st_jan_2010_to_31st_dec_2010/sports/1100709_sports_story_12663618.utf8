            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Contests are going to be close in Fridays six-event card, featuring the 1,000m Glotik Cup which has attracted 12 runners. However, the race appears to be a three-way contest among the two youngsters  Ocean Element and Must Be Magic  and Baskerville, a four-year-old, who is yet to reveal his true potential since migrating from western India. The Arti Doctor-trained horse, who will be ridden by Md Islam, is also at weight advantage.

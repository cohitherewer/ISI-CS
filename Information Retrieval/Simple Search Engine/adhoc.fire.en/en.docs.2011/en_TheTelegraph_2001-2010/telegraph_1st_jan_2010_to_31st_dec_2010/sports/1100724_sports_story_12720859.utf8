The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jwala just a good friend: Azhar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Jwala just a good friend: Azhar
                  Jwala Gutta                     
	New Delhi: Former Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddin Friday denied being in a romantic relationship with Jwala Gutta, saying the shuttler was just a good friend.         
	Azharuddin was responding to reports that he has been dating the 26-year-old Jwala and was on the verge of filing for divorce from Sangeeta Bijlani, his wife of 14 years. Azharuddin, the Congress MP from Moradabad, rubbished these reports and termed them baseless, fabricated and in bad taste.         
	These reports are baseless and in bad taste. I am very hurt by all this. I know Jwala, she is a good friend of mine and to write such reports, which are completely false and fabricated, is disgusting, a livid Azharuddin said.         
	[The former India captains comments notwithstanding, the buzz actually is that the two are more than just good friends. Its to be seen how things unfold in the near future.]         
	Azharuddin said these stories had been circulated by those in the Badminton Association of India (BAI) who wanted to tarnish his image. Azharuddin had tried to contest for the post of BAI president last month but backed out at the last minute.         
	These stories (have been) planted and motivated by people who are against me in the Badminton Association of India. I think they should look into their homes first before casting aspersions on others and make such allegations, he said.         
	Jwala is a very good player and she is a great prospect for the country. She has been doing well and, in future, will win many medals for the country. So, I just want to request everybody to leave her alone and not drag her into this cheap controversy, he added.         
	Jwala, the world No.7 mixed doubles player, is married to ace India shuttler Chetan Anand, currently the national champion.         
	According to one report, which quoted a source from the Andhra Pradesh Badminton Association, Jwala was seen more than once with Azharuddin after her practice sessions at the Gachibowli stadium.         
	The 47-year-old cricketer was also spotted with Jwala during the Asian Badminton Championship in Delhi.         
	Azharuddin played 99 Tests and 334 ODIs for India and has two sons  Asaduddin and Abbasuddin  from his eight-year marriage to first wife Naureen.         
	After divorcing Naureen, he married Bollywood actress Bijlani.           (AGENCIES)

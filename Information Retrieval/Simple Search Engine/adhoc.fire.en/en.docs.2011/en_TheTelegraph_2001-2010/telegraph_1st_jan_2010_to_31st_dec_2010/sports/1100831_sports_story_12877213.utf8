The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barca triumph
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barca triumph
                      
	Madrid: Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and David Villa scored as Barcelona opened their Spanish league campaign with a comfortable 3-0 win at Racing Santander. Real Madrid were held to a 0-0 draw by Mallorca in Jose Mourinhos first game as a Liga coach.         
	After just four minutes at Santanders Sardinero Stadium, Messi gathered Iniestas through pass and raced into the area before chipping past goalkeeper Antonio Rodriguez, on Sunday.         
	Iniesta also lobbed Rodriguez with a perfectly placed first-time shot in the 33rd minute, before Villa scored his first league goal for Barcelona, heading in unmarked from Daniel Alvess cross in the 63rd.         
	This team was already great and it has won everything, so what I wanted to do was settle in as soon as possible at the beginning, said Villa, who moved from Valencia earlier this summer for a fee of euro40 million.         
	Mourinho said his Madrid side had not played at the kind of level they can reach, although he was pleased they made opportunities. Among the positives I take from this game are the enormous number of chances that we created, mainly in the second half, he said.         
	Mourinho had another disappointment when forward Cristiano Ronaldo suffered an ankle injury during Sundays match. He will be out of action for around three weeks, the Spanish club said on their website on Monday.         
	The worlds most expensive player will miss Portugals Euro 2012 qualifiers at home to Cyprus and away to Norway as well as Reals league game against Osasuna and their Champions League opener against Ajax.         
	Also Sunday, Pablo Osvaldo scored twice as Espanyol beat Getafe 3-1, Real Sociedad beat Villarreal 1-0, Deportivo La Coruna drew 0-0 with Zaragoza and Osasuna were held 0-0 by Almeria.Gerard Pique partnered Eric Abidal in central defense for Barcelona, as injured captain Carles Puyol was rested. The team had a different look up front. After Zlatan Ibrahimovics move to AC Milan was secured, Villa joined Messi and Iniesta in attack.         
	New arrival Villa fitted smoothly into the Barca line-up and nearly scored in the 19th when Messi fed him a long ball into the area, although Rodriguez beat him to the ball.         
	Santanders Francisco Francis Perez won a penalty in the 35th, going down in the area under a light challenge by Maxwell. However, Valdes stretched to his right to parry Mohammed Tchites spot kick. Messi was the leagues top scorer last season and again looked threatening.

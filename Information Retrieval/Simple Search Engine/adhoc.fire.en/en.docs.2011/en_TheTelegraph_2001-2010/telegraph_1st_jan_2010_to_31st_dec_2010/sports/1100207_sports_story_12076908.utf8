                  West Zones Yusuf Pathan and brother Irfan celebrate the formers double century, at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, in Hyderabad, on Saturday. (PTI)                     
	Hyderabad: Yusuf Pathans scintillating double century fired West Zone to a three-wicket victory as they chased down a mammoth 536-run target for the Duleep Trophy title with a world record effort.         
	An unbeaten 210 by Yusuf, his maiden first-class double century, steered West to a sensational win as they scored 541 for seven to lift the Duleep Trophy for the 16th time on an eventful final day.         
	The win enters record books as the highest successful run chase in first class cricket although the total, 541 for seven, is not the highest fourth-innings total. Teams have scored more in the fourth innings but those chases were not successful.         
	England had scored 654 for five chasing 696 against South Africa in Durban, way back in 1938-39. The match was drawn after 10 days.         
	Maharashtra had scored 604 in their second innings in their chase of an impossible 959 against erstwhile Bombay, in 1948-49, in Pune.         
	It all depended on Yusuf when West resumed at 379 for six and he did not disappoint, standing like a rock till the job was done.         
	Resuming at a personal score of 84, along with overnight partner Pinal Shah, Yusuf cashed in on the three reprieves he was allowed to make the South Zone bowlers pay heavily.         
	Yusuf was dropped by C. Ganapthy off his own bowling when the batsman was on 102 and, then, K.B. Pawan grassed a sitter off Aushik Srinivas when the Baroda marauder was on 125. Ganapthy coaxed another chance when Yusuf was on 170 but this time Muralidharen Gautam was the offender.         
	Yusufs innings had an incredible strike rate of 110.52, and took 190 balls. His knock was studded with 19 fours and 10 sixes.         
	Shah (16) provided able support and, although not contributing much in terms of runs, he saw off 116 balls, something that would have definitely helped Yusuf.         
	By the time Shah was trapped leg before, the duo had put up 105 runs for the seventh wicket, reducing the gap substantially.           (PTI)

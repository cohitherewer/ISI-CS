The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salman was a model player
                                                                                                                       7                                      Salman was a model player
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Mohammed Asif has been controversial and little is known about Mohammed Aamer, except that hes brilliant in his trade and comes from a humble background.         
	So, while there hasnt been much surprise over Asifs name figuring in the spot-fixing scandal and no clear reaction on Aamers alleged involvement, except that non-Pakistan batsmen would be happy to see him banned, theres been shock at Salman Butt being dragged into it all.         
	The 25-year-old Butt, after all, has always come across as different from many of his teammates: Well-educated, hes quietly passionate and was seen as captaincy material years before he got the job, in Tests, last month.         
	Butt, incidentally, played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPLs inaugural edition, in 2008. He made the XI seven times and averaged 27-plus, with a best of 73, at the Eden (against the Chennai Super Kings).         
	I saw him as a model player... Calm, quiet... A good kid... Butt never gave us any trouble and it was a pleasure working with him... I dont know whats the truth in this scandal, but I hope things get sorted out, the Knights team director, Joy Bhattacharjya, told The Telegraph.         
	Thats a certificate everybody, who has interacted with Butt, would give.         
	Meanwhile, thanks to the News of the World expose, the IPL franchisees may again avoid players from across the border even if relations between New Delhi and Islamabad improve.         
	The Knights, though, have reached an understanding with rookie quick Mohammed Irfan. But that was before Sunday...

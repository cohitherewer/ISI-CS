                                                                                                                       7                                      Showcause notice for three teams
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Kochi IPL franchise seems to have landed in trouble even before playing their first match.         
	A breach of franchise agreement, because of a split among its stakeholders, has invited a showcause notice from the BCCI on Wednesday.         
	The BCCI, after its annual general meeting here on Wednesday, also issued showcause notices to Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab for various irregularities.         
	While Royals and Punjab had changed their ownership pattern without the Boards prior approval, the Kochi franchise were yet to form a legal entity as per the terms and conditions of the bid.         
	The bid for Kochi franchise was filed by individuals and although they formed a consortium, there was no legal entity. So we asked them to incorporate a company but they havent done that so far, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said after the AGM.         
	They have a recent dispute between the five persons in the consortium regarding the shares, sweat equity and other things  and they are not been able to resolve those issues.         
	Two groups have sent letters to the Board saying not to recognise the other group. The Board cannot work with such a franchise.         
	The Board has asked Kochi to set up a joint venture entity within 10 days or face stern action.         
	Manohar clarified that what action needs to be taken, including revoking their franchise rights, would be known only after the franchises replied to the showcause notice.         
	Ominously, Manohar said that the Board was prepared for the worst case scenario. We might play with nine teams or eight teams, we dont know, he said.         
	All issues would be resolved before the fresh player auction in November this year, he added.         
	The members were also apprised of several irregularities discovered during the audit of IPL 3 accounts.         
	The members unanimously decided that a complaint must be lodged with the police in the matters of sale of tickets by Ticket Genie, contract with Visual Impact for security vans among others, Manohar said.         
	The BCCI chief took a dig at Lalit Modi, who was officially stripped of all his posts in the Board.         
	He (Modi) is just like you (media), he can come here generally. But he is out of the Board. He cannot claim to be IPL commissioner and chairman suspended, Manohar said.         
	Manohar also revealed yet another instance of alleged fraud by Modi.         
	The Bandelier watch company has sent a mail saying we suffered a huge loss because of our contract with the IPL. We were able to sell only 35 watches out of which 24 were taken free by Modi. he said.         
	Manohar, however, sidestepped a question on the Supreme Courts recent observation that secretary N Srinivasan should choose between his position in the Board and being a vice-chairman and managing director of India Cements which owns Chennai Super Kings.         
	There were 10 other observations made by the Supreme Court. We are happy with the way we are, he said.         
	On a significant note, the Gujarat Cricket Association was represented at the AGM, not for the first time though, by Narendra Modi, the states chief minister.

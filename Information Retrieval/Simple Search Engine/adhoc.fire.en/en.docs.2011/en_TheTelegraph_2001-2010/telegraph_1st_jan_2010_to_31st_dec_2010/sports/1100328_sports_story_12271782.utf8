	Miami: Former champion and world No. 2 Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Sony Ericsson Open on Friday, falling 2-6, 7-6, 4-6 to Belgian Olivier Rochus in his opening match.         
	After two rain delays that forced organisers to reschedule some matches to Saturday, Rochus secured his biggest win since he beat then world No. 2 Marat Safin at Wimbledon in 2002.         
	Spanish fourth seed Rafael Nadal was in no mood to be upset, breezing through his match with a 6-4, 6-3 win over American Taylor Dent.         
	In late matches, Andy Roddick ousted Russian Igor Andreev 6-4, 6-4 in a match that stretched into early Saturday morning, and Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Spains Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-4, 6-3.

	New Delhi: Indias most successful female tennis player Sania Mirza Thursday revealed that she will quit the sport after getting married.         
	Sania, who got engaged to childhood friend Sohrab Mirza in July 2009, did not elaborate when she plans to marry but said she will bid adieu to the game after tying the nuptial knot.         
	As of now, I dont intend to play professionally after marriage but that is still some time away, Sania said.         
	Before getting engaged to Sania, Sohrab had said that Sania will have complete freedom in making her career decisions. She has my complete support and backing in whatever she wishes. It is completely her decision for how long she wishes to play, Sohrab had said in June.         
	So when asked if it was purely her decision to quit the game after marriage, Sanias father Imran Mirza said, Its her decision for now. If later she decides to play after marriage, it is her choice.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gill: IPL running business
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gill: IPL running business
                      
	New Delhi: Lashing out at the Indian Premier League for using cricket as an instrument of business, sports minister MS Gill has accused the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) of changing the rules of the game to allow the cash-awash Twenty20 league run a commercial venture.         
	Gill said the rules of cricket had been changed by the IPL, and acquiesced by the BCCI, by way of giving batsman advantage over bowlers to promote entertainment, allowing mongoose bat and shortening boundaries, all to earn profit.         
	What the IPL is doing, the bowler is only the victim and the bat  now you have a mongoose bat and I look forward to a cobra bat. The boundaries have been shortened... The whole thing is to entertain the masses. And the bowler is just an instrument for this promotion. The IPL is fundamentally business, Gill said.         
	Its focus is earning money. Now two new teams have been bought and one of the gentlemen who has bought said look this is business, we bought it for business and our job is to earn from it.

	Melbourne: Dean Jones ex-mistress has claimed that the former cricketer lied about his marital status when they began their decade-long on-and-off affair, which has left his reputation in shreds.         
	Revealing her identity, international flight attendant and part-time model Kerri-Anne Hamilton said she tried to end the secret affair which began in 1998 and led to the birth of a child, Koby, after knowing three months into their relationship that Jones was married.         
	Back in 1998 it was a bit like were in the dark ages; there was no google, no internet ... the only information I would get was from people I asked, said Hamilton from Sydney at Channel Nine Networks programme, A Current Affair. I changed my phone number, I wouldnt take his calls, I did many many things to end it through the years but he just dangled the carrot.         
	The affair began 12 years into Jones 24-year marriage. In August last year, Hamilton gave birth, but she denied the conception was planned. (PTI)

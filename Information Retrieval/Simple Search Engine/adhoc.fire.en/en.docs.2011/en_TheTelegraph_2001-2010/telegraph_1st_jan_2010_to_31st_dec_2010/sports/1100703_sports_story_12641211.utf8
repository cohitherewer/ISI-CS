            GUEST COLUMN - Shyam Thapa                
	A Black Friday for the Selecao! Imagine how difficult it is to watch Brazil losing a quarter final match at a World Cup.         
	Come to think of it, it is even more difficult to imagine what must be going through the minds of the Arjen Robbens and Wesley Sneijders after they accomplished the unthinkable.         
	Oranje, take a bow. The scoreline read 2-1 in their favour but had Dirk Kuyt, Robin van Persie and Sneijder been a bit more alert, it could have been even more humiliating for Dungas men.         
	After maintaining a rather uncharacteristic subdued approach in the first 45 minutes, Bert van Marwijks men altered their tactics after the change of ends.         
	If the first 30 minutes of the match was the worst the Dutch have produced in this competition, the last 40 minutes was a show of dazzling football with the supremely talented Robben leading the charge.         
	What exactly did the Netherlands do in that particular phase?         
	They outthought, outpaced and finally outclassed their opponents. As a result, this is the second time since the 1980s that Brazil have failed to qualify for the semi-finals of successive editions.         
	 The customary flair was only there for half-an-hour and the deep blue jersey didnt take much time to turn pale.         
	More than Brazil deserving credit for taking the lead, it is the Dutch who should be criticised for conceding a silly goal.         
	Agreed Felipe Melo essayed a million-dollar through pass for Robinho, but I was aghast to find that neither Robben nor last-minute inclusion Andre Ooijer bothered to close down on the striker who finished with a deft placement.         
	However, after the goal, save a miss from Juan and a dipping shot by Kaka, which drew an awesome save from Dutch keeper Maarten Stekelenburg, Dungas men didnt do anything extraordinary in the match.         
	Perhaps the Brazilians took it a little bit easy when they saw that the early pressure had someone like Sneijder falling back to help out his defence in the first half.         
	The Dutch decided to play the way they know best. To attack and break down any resistance. They did just that, with a little help from Melo and Julio Caesar.         
	Just a month-and-a-half back, Caesar and Sneijder were seen celebrating Inter Milans victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final.         
	On the day, Caesar might have thought it was up to him to make a present to his clubmate. Otherwise, its inexplicable as to why he rushed out like a madcap to intercept an innocuous floater from Sneijder that was deflected into his own goal by Melo.         
	A silly goal and things took a different turn. Suddenly, the Brazilians found Robben too hot to handle. Robbens nicely swerved flag-kick which Sneijder nodded home was another example of poor defending.         
	The biggest flop for Brazil was undoubtedly Kaka. Much of Dungas Cup hopes depended on how Kaka performed. It was evident he wasnt fit enough and sadly the others in the centre of the park lacked creativity.         
	Dunga has brought a workman-like culture in his team but more often than not it is sheer talent that makes a difference.         
	May be a buck-toothed genius responding to the name of Ronaldinho will agree. The Melos and Dani Alves are not even half as good as the AC Milan player. It might have been different had Ramires not been out with a double booking.         
	Another area where the Brazilians lacked real firepower was in the striking zone. Fabiano is no Romario and neither does he come close to Ronaldo. Brazil played ugly in 1994 but had a Romario upfront. Ronaldo was in a different league during the 2002 World Cup. Sadly, Fabiano doesnt fall in the same category and Dunga will perhaps realise that on the return flight.

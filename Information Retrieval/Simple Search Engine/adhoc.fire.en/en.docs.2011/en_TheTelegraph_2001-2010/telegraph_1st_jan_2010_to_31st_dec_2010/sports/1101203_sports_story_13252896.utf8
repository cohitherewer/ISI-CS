The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon is still not fit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brendon is still not fit
                      
	Vadodara: New Zealand, struggling to stay alive in the five-match rubber, going into the third ODI here against India on Saturday, are sweating over the availability of injured opener Brendon McCullum for the must-win encounter at the Reliance Cricket Stadium.         
	Brendons condition is being monitored constantly. Hes improving, said visiting teams media manager Ellery Tappin, adding nothing can be said Thursday whether the hard-hitting batsman would be able to take the field in the do-or-die tie on December 4.         
	McCullums absence due a troublesome back was sorely felt by New Zealand in the first two ODIs at Guwahati and Jaipur which they lost to go down 0-2 in the series in which the last two ties are to be held at Bangalore (Dec 7) and Chennai (Dec 10).         
	The wicketkeeper-batsman, who has given up his glove work in Tests but continues to perform the job in the limited overs game, accumulated 370 runs at an average of 74.00 in the three-Test rubber that New Zealand lost 0-1 against India.         
	McCullums unavailability for the first two ODIs has left New Zealand short-staffed in batting.           (PTI)

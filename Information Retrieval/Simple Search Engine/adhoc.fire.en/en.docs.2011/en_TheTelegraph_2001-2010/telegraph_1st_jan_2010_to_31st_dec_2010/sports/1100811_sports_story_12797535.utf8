The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eriksson keen on Villa job
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eriksson keen on Villa job
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Sven-Goran Eriksson will make himself available to Aston Villa, should they decide to contact him in the wake of Martin Neills departure, The Daily Telegraph can reveal.         
	The former England manager, who has been installed by bookmakers as the second favourite for the vacancy at Villa Park, is understood to have already made his interest known.         
	Eriksson has been out of work since resigning from his post as manager of the Ivory Coast after their elimination from the World Cup in the summer. He is keen on a return to the Premier League.         
	The Swede had been hoping to join after Rafael Bentez resigned, but a source close to him, last night, described the idea of moving back to the Midlands  he was the director of football at Notts County last season  with Aston Villa as an interesting proposition.         
	Bob Bradley, the coach of the U.S., has been installed as the favourite despite having no experience in the English game after reports suggested that Lerner might favour appointing a compatriot at Bodymoor Heath. A string of other names, including recently appointed Fulham manager Mark Hughes, have been mentioned.         
	Neill resigned on Monday, understood to be a response to being informed that he would not be furnished with the proceeds of the imminent sale of James Miller to Manchester City.         
	The timing of Neills exit came as something of a shock as he left Villa understandably furious just four days before the start of the season. Also, his relationship with owner Randy Lerner had been deteriorating progressively.

	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has constituted a special six-member committee to conduct background checks and verify integrity of players before they are considered for any national team.         
	Zakir Khan, a senior PCB official and a member of the committee, on Saturday said it had been tasked to keep a close watch on activities of all players, officials and even board employees as part of the new anti-corruption measures.         
	The committee will check on the background and disciplinary record of players in international and domestic cricket and clear them for selection, he said.         
	Zakir said the committee, formed on the recommendations of ICCs special task force on Pakistan cricket, would also play its role in keeping domestic cricket free of corruption.         
	We have a broad based agenda and our main purpose is to ensure anti-corruption measures are effectively implemented and in future our cricket does not face the same problems it faced in England, the former Test bowler said.         
	All the members of the committee headed by PCB chairman Ijaz Butt are board employees. It includes director domestic cricket operations Sultan Rana, chief selector Mohsin Khan and security specialists in the board, Colonel (retd) Waseem Ahmed and Major (retd) Khawaja Najam.

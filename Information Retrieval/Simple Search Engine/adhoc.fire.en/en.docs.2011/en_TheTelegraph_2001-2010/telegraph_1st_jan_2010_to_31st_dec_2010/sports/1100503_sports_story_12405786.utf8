	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his South African counterpart Graeme Smith both admitted at the post-match presentation ceremony that 75 runs scored by Indians during the last five overs of their innings was the turning point of the match.         
	Dhoni also praised his bowlers, especially the spinners, for keeping their nerves.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Dhoni: It is definitely a better start than the 2007 ODI World Cup. But we need to ensure that we continue with this form in the coming matches. Frankly speaking, I never expected that we would score 75 runs in the last five overs. The pitch was on the slower side and that is the reason we played only two seamers. It was a pitch where slow bowlers would have been useful. Our spinners really did well as they bowled as many as 15 overs among themselves.         
	Smith: We did some good and some really bad things today (Sunday). We gave away as many as 75 runs in the final five overs and that was way too many. Also, we left it a bit too late in the end during the chase. On this wicket, I think 160 was around par. But Suresh (Raina) batted well. He made us pay for that no-ball (bowled by Morne Morkel).         
	Suresh Raina: I have had a great year and it really feels good to be among runs. My plan was to hit as straight as possible and it paid off. I never tried to hit any pre-planned stroke. I always knew that if I can play 40-45 deliveries, I can score 80-85 runs. Yuvraj (Singh) also gave me tremendous support. So did Dinesh Karthik, who rotated the strike. I knew that as a No. 3 batsman, I had to bat till the end.

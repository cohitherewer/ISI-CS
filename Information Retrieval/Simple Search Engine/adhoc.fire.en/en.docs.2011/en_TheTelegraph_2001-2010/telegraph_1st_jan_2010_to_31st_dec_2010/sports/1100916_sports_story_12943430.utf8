	Centurion: Aaron Finch stole the show with a breezy unbeaten 93 and singlehandely powered Victoria Bushrangers to a sensational seven-wicket win over Central Stags in their second Group A match of the Champions League Twenty20 cricket tournament here, on Wednesday.         
	Finch was at his destructive best as he clobbered the bowlers for 11 fours and three sixes en route his 60-ball match-winning innings.         
	The 23--year-old right-hander was ably supported by Victoria skipper David Hussey and Andrew McDonald, who made an identical 17-ball 18.         
	Chasing Central Stags challenging 166-run target, Victoria rode on Finchs brilliance to romp home in 19.4 overs and bring back their campaign on track after the opening 28-run loss against Warriors in the Twenty20 event.         
	For Central Stags, it is their second consecutive defeat in the tournament after their 57-run loss to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and now stands on the brink of elimination.         
	Earlier, riding on captain Jamie Hows unbeaten 77, Central District overcame a scratchy start to post a competitive 165 for five.         
	How decorated his 55-ball unconquered stay at the crease with 10 fours and three sixes. Victoria started their chase on a steady fashion with Rob Quiney and Aaron Finch adding 40 runs in 4.3 overs.         
	But if not for butterfingered wicket-keeper Tim Weston the scenario could have been different as he dropped a regulation catch off Quiney in the fourth over.         
	But it was not to be Quineys day as he failed to cash in on the opportunity and clipped one straight to Michael Mason at short-fine leg off Seth Rance in the next over.         
	Rance seemed to emerge as the lucky bowler for Stags as his next over too produced a wicket but this time, courtesy a run out. Victoria wicket-keeper Mathew Wade was the unlucky as he fell to a mix up with Finch.         
	Finch, however, remained steady at the other hand and dealt mostly in singles and twos with occasional boundaries in between. Together with captain David Hussey, he stitched a 51-run third wicket stand to keep the Australian side in the reckoning.         
	However, poor fielding was the order of the day for the New Zealand side as Worker dropped dangerman Finch on 43 off his own bowling.         
	But just when it seemed, the match was slowly going away from Central Districts grip, Doug Bracewell came up with the big wicket of Hussey, caught by Weston of a short delivery.         
	Earlier, electing to bat, How led from the front with an unbeaten 77 to take Central Districts to a challenging score after they were two wickets down in the opening over of Peter Siddle.         
	How took the onus on himself to guide his team out of danger and build two crucial partnerships  first with George Worker (29 off 25) and then with Brendon Diamanti (19 off 11) to take the Kiwi side past 150-mark.         
	Together with Worker, How ressurected the Stags innings with a 48-ball 53-run fourth wicket stand.           (PTI)

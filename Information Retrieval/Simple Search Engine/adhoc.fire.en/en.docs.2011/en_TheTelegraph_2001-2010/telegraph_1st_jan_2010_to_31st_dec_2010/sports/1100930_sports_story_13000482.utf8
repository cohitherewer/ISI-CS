 - IM NOT SURE WHATS GOING ON, SAYS PATAUDI            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri      
	Mumbai: Former captains Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Sunil Gavaskar havent found a place on the reconstituted governing council of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	There is, of course, one vacancy.         
	Among the ex-players, only Ravi Shastri, also a former captain, has been retained in the pruned down body.         
	Till late on Wednesday, nobody from the Board had contacted either Pataudi or Gavaskar to, at least, get their views on the latest decision  to not pay the ex-players on the governing council.         
	Im not sure whats going on... Unless theres an official communication from the Board, I wouldnt like to comment, Pataudi told The Telegraph, from New Delhi, at 9 pm.         
	Some 15 minutes later, Gavaskar went live on television, insisting that hed been getting all the news from the media, not from anybody in the Board!         
	Around half-a-dozen calls to his residence here, through the evening, went unanswered.         
	On television, however, Gavaskar made the point that hed be willing to serve Indian cricket in an honorary capacity and that he hadnt taken a Rupee on many occasions.         
	That contradicted everything said at the Boards AGM, earlier in the day, at the Cricket Centre.         
	According to well-placed sources, Gavaskar had asked the Board to honour a promise made by Lalit Kumar Modi that hed get Rs 5 crore per year for each of the five years of the contract.         
	Board president Shashank Manohar put that before the AGM and the house unanimously agreed that nobody would get a Rupee.         
	There was, it seems, an uproar of sorts.         
	Till now, Pataudi, Gavaskar and Shastri had each been getting Rs 1 crore (after the tax deduction). An astounding amount by itself.         
	Armed with the unanimous decision, Manohar spoke to Shastri, who promptly agreed to continue, this time in an honorary capacity.         
	Manohar alone can answer why Pataudi and Gavaskar werent contacted.         
	Officially, Manohar has been empowered to nominate one cricketer of repute. The question, though, is why werent the three former captains, whove been on the body for the last three years, not even briefed before the AGM?         
	Surely, that was in order. More so, as their contracts were for the first five years of the IPL.         
	Manohar, clearly, hasnt handled this issue in the manner he should have.         
	Out of the general council are Union minister Farooq Abdullah, ex-Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra (very close to Modi) and Niranjan Shah.         
	And, yes, theres no Modi.         
	Bindra is the lone loser, and for obvious reasons, for Shah is now a vice-president of the Board and Abdullah has been accommodated as chairman of the marketing committee.         
	Member of Parliament (MP) Anurag Thakur, Ranjib Biswal and Ajay Shirke are the new faces.         
	Arun Jaitley and Rajeev Shukla, MPs both, have been retained.         
	THE 2010-11 GC         
	Chairman: Chirayu Amin; Members: Arun Jaitley, Rajeev Shukla, Anurag Thakur, Ranjib Biswal, Ajay Shirke; Ravi Shastri. The Board president has been empowered to nominate the second cricketer.

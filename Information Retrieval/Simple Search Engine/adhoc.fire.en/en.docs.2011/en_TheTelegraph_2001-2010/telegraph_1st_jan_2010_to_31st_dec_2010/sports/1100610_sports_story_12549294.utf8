	Port of Spain: South Africa have every reason to start their three-Test series with West Indies at Queens Park Oval in a confident mood.         
	The South Africans swept the preceding limited-overs matches, comprising two Twenty20 and five One-day Internationals.Though the visitors would concede that Tests are far different, they enter the series with the confidence of returning to the winning habit, and the full knowledge that their opponents appear to be in disarray. But the Proteas vice-captain Jacques Kallis was still cautious about a West Indies side, which is quite unpredictable.         
	Teams         
	West Indies (from): Chris Gayle (capt), Dwayne Bravo (v-capt), Sulieman Benn, Darren Bravo, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Narsingh Deonarine, Travis Dowlin, Brendan Nash, Nelon Pascal, Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Darren Sammy, Shane Shillingford.         
	South Africa (from) : Graeme Smith (capt), Jacques Kallis (v-capt), Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, Mark Boucher, Abraham deVilliers, Jean-Paul Duminy, Paul Harris, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Alviro Peterson, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.

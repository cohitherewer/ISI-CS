                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina breaks into top 5
                  Saina Nehwal                     
	New Delhi: Shuttler Saina Nehwal Thursday touched a new high with a career-best fifth spot in the world rankings.         
	The Indian ace has broken new ground after her sensational run at the All England Badminton Championships earlier this month, where she became the first woman from her country to make the semi-finals at the prestigious meet.         
	Saina, whose previous best was the No.6 she attained last year, took everyone by surprise with some inspired performances before eventually losing to Tine Rasmussen of Denmark in the penultimate round.         
	Saina, who turned 20 on Wednesday, has had a good 2009 with victory in the Indonesian Open Super Series Tournament and semi-final finish at the World Super Series Masters Final being the highlights of a fruitful year.         
	In addition, quarter-final runs in the World Championships, Malaysian Open, Denmark Open, French Super Series, Swiss Open, Indian Open and Singapore Open in the same year made her a name to reckon with on the badminton circuit.         
	Saina had won the Phillippines Open in 2006 and the Yonex Chinese Taipei Open in 2008.         
	But it was in England where Saina made the strongest statement of intent with a spirited performance. Owner of the world No.7 ranking at the time, Saina defeated German Juliane Schenk in straight games in the quarter finals, taking just 27 minutes to set up a tough semi-final clash with former world No.1 Rasmussen at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham.         
	Saina showed a lot of heart in the last-four clash but Rasmussen outplayed the gutsy Hyderabadi 21-19, 21-17.         
	She had beaten Judith Meulendijks of the Netherlands and Korean Seung Hee Bae in the first two rounds.         
	Former All England champion and national chief coach Pullela Gopichand is one person who has seen the changes in Sainas game bring about better results. Saina is a much improved player than last year, said Gopichand recently. She has been working on her strokes.         
	Riding on her fantastic show at the All England, Saina has gained a couple of spots on the latest list with 58516.7646 points in her kitty.         
	It is the Chinese who dominate the top half of the womens rankings with Yihan Wang leading the pack followed by Wang Lin, Xin Wang and Jiang Yanjiao respectively.         
	In mens rankings, Chetan Anand dropped a rung to 10th while P. Kashyap rose by one to be 29th. Arvind Bhat remained static at No.36. Anup Sridhar slipped to 40th, a loss of one position.         
	In mixed doubles rankings, Jwala Gutta and V. Dijus pair slipped one spot to 10th.         
	Womens top-5         
	1. Yihan Wang (Chn); 2. Wang Lin (Chn); 3. Xin Wang (Chn); 4. Jiang Yanjiao (Chn); 5. Saina Nehwal (Ind).           (PTI)

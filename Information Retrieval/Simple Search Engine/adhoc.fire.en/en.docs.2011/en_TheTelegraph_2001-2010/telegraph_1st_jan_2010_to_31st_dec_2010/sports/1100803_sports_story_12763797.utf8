The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumacher apologises to Barrichello
                                                                                                                       7                                      Schumacher apologises to Barrichello
                      
	Frankfurt: Michael Schumacher has acknowledged that his impeding manoeuvre against former teammate Rubens Barrichello at the Hungarian Grand Prix was too hard and has apologised to the Brazilian driver.         
	The seven-time champion said Monday he had no intention of endangering the Williams driver and that he was sorry if Barrichello had that impression.         
	Directly after the race, I was still in the heat of the moment, but after seeing the scene against Rubens again I have to say the stewards were right with their assessment: the maneuver was too hard, Schumacher said on his website.         
	Of course, I wanted to make it difficult for him to overtake me. However, I indicated quite clearly that I wouldnt let him pass me from inside, but logically I never meant to endanger him with my manoeuvre. If he has that impression, then sorry, that was not my intention.         
	Schumacher was penalised 10 places on the grid for the next Formula One race, the Belgian Grand Prix on August 29.         
	The Mercedes driver, in his first season back racing following a three-year retirement, was ruled to have illegitimately impeded Barrichello.         
	Schumacher appeared to try to force Barrichello in the direction of a concrete wall at Hungaroring circuit as they fought for 10th place, the last point-scoring position.         
	Barrichellos car was forced onto the pit lane exit and he was heard saying that was horrible on Williams team radio and called for Schumacher to be shown the black flag, which orders a driver to return to the pit and usually means his exclusion from the race.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Salgaocar beat Mahindra 2-1
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United seem hell bent on dying a painful death. The Mumbai club, which would be wound up at the end of the season, crashed to a 1-2 defeat after conceding the winner in dying moments to Salgaocar, in a penultimate round clash of the I-League here on Monday.         
	Substitute Manjeet Singh, who came off the bench in the 89th minute, capitalised on the Mahindra defences slackness to score from the left with seconds to go for the final whistle.         
	The three points from this game ensured Salgaocar would stay in the top tier of the national league for the next season.         
	For the second time in a row, Mahindra lost after being in front. They had led Sporting Clube de Goa 2-0 before letting in three goals in an away game last week.         
	On Monday, they took the lead in the 29th minute when Muritala Ali headed in a corner-kick. But the visitors equalised through the perfect combination of Milagres Gonsalves and Ekene Ikenwa. Gonsalves raced into the penalty area and foxed Justin Stephen, who was in tow, with a nice back-heel, and Ikenwa was in position to shoot home.         
	Mahindra had some positives to take home. Monotosh Ghosh, their third goalkeeper, showed alacrity under the bar to be adjudged the Man of the Match, while 18-year-old Colin Abranches, who was part of the clubs under-19 team, was impressive at the back.         
	The fact that the team had the upper hand for the most part despite missing key players  Steven Dias, Dharmaraj Ravanan, Sushant Mathew (suspension) and Kalialaudeen Nishtar (injury)  was in itself creditable.         
	For Salgaocar, it was their first away win of the season, while for coach Karim Bencharifa, his fourth career win against Mahindra United with various teams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 6 off Steyn is special
                                                                                                                       7                                        6 off Steyn is special
  - Manoj Tiwary thanks Sourav for supporting him despite first-ball duck vs Chargers         A STAFF REPORTER            Brad Hodge, on way to his half century, at Eden Gardens, on Sunday                                 
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary would like to believe his half-century against the Royal Challengers Bangalore Saturday is the start of his comeback among the big boys of cricket.         
	I missed the major part of the last IPL after fracturing my finger. I guess I was slowly fading out from collective consciousness. This innings is a reassuring factor for me that I am still very much around, Tiwary told The Telegraph just after the match.         
	Tiwary remarked that this is the most satisfying knock of his career.         
	I have had some good knocks at the first-class level. But this ones surely special. Look at their attack. Dale Steyn, Jacques Kallis, Praveen Kumar and Anil Kumble.         
	When you score runs against a quality attack, you feel that you belong to this level. Also the fact that I was even more positive after pulling a hamstring.         
	I didnt want to think about the pain, he said.         
	Between his two sixes, hitting Dale Steyn over long off meant more for him.         
	That will be my favourite. Steyn was bowling at a brisk pace. Hitting a bowler of his calibre obviously invokes a special feeling.         
	Was there a bit of pressure on him after the first-ball duck in the first match?         
	When you are playing top-level cricket, you should know how to handle pressure. Otherwise, theres no point playing at this level.         
	Dadi (Sourav Ganguly) has been very encouraging. He was the one who told me that one innings doesnt make a difference, and Ill get more chances. Also, coach Dav Whatmore gave me a lot of confidence.         
	For him, not opening the innings before this has not been a problem.         
	I know that I am not a specialist opener. From the moment I came to know Ill be opening, I worked on my mental approach.         
	The most important aspect is being able to convince oneself that one can play the new ball. I did just that, Tiwary explained         
	Asked about the talk in the cricket fraternity that his focus is not entirely on cricket as he has developed other priorities, he said: I would just like to tell them to shut up.         
	I dont need to think about those who hardly know me and are unaware of my abilities as a cricketer.         
	What are his thoughts about KKRs next match against Chennai Super Kings?         
	I just want to savour this moment for the time being. Ill start preparing for the match tomorrow (Monday), was the reply.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi: Haiders behaviour was childish
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi: Haiders behaviour was childish
                      
	Karachi: Zulqarnain Haider has come in for sharp criticism from his ODI captain Shahid Afridi, who termed the wicketkeepers step to desert his team midway through a series citing death threats from match-fixers as childish.         
	I just dont understand what he (Haider) is trying to do. He has behaved very childishly. He has behaved just like Yasir Hameed had done in England. What is he trying to achieve? In the end he will gain nothing and will lose out as a player, he told reporters here.         
	Even if he didnt want to come to me or the team management, he should have spoken to Abdul Razzaq, who is close to him. They play for the same club in Lahore. He has taken the decision of an unstable person, Afridi said.           (PTI)

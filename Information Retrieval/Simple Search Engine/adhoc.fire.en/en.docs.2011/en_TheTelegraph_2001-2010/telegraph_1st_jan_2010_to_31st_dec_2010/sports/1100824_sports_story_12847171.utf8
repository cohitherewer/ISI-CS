The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imperative to beat India, says Ponting
                                                                                                                       7                                        Imperative to beat India, says Ponting

	Coolum: With all the usual hype of the forthcoming Ashes series with England, Australia skipper Ricky Ponting and vice captain Michael Clarke are careful not to diminish the importance of a two-test series in India.         
	We have to make sure we dont get too Ashes-focussed, Ponting said on Monday at a team camp north of Brisbane.         
	Australia will play India in Mohali from October 1, Bangalore from Oct. 9, along with three limited-overs matches later in the month at Kochi, Visakhapatnam and Goa.         
	Its important to beat them, a rivalry is a rivalry, and they are the No. 1 team in the world, Ponting added. You have to judge yourself by them.         
	Clarke also said it was important that his side stay focussed on the India series.         
	I know its the old cliche, but my experience from Test cricket is as soon as you take your eye off the ball, that rusty gate comes back and hits you in the face, Clarke said.         
	I think its really crucial ... Playing India anywhere in the world is very tough, let alone playing them in their own conditions.         
	Ponting admitted there has been animosity between the sides in the past.         
	Theyve got a few prickly characters that have sort of got under our skin a little bit, but we have to get over all that stuff, he said. When things like that happen, it makes everyone else just want to beat them, there is more motivation.         
	Ponting said any security concerns over playing in India shall be handled by Cricket Australia and its staff.         
	We will rely on what the experts have to say and trust their judgement, Ponting said, adding that a pre-tour visit will be conducted by security staff to check out hotels and venues.         
	The Commonwealth Games will be held in New Delhi from Oct. 3-14. There have been heightened security concerns in India since terror attacks in 2008 .         
	Clarke has mostly pleasant recollections of India, particularly Bangalore, where he played his first Test for Australia on October 6, 2004.

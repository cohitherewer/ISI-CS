            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Something must have gone horribly wrong for East Bengal this season. Otherwise how can one explain why the Federation Cup champions are lurking dangerously close to the drop zone in the I-League.         
	Champions in one premier tournament and limping in the other, in the same season, is a weird record.         
	However, amidst this gloom, the die-hard East Bengal fans might just find a reason to smile with ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia looking set to return to action when they take on Mumbai FC in an I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	The prolific marksman, who was suffering from a hamstring injury, was included in the 18-member squad by coach Phillippe de Ridder on the eve of the crucial tie. Crucial because, having lost five of their last six league encounters, a negative result would endanger their status in the premier division of the league.         
	But the Belgian De Ridder was tight-lipped about his first XI for Thursdays tie. Bhaichung, then, may not start but might be used in the later stages of the match.         
	Goal scoring has been a definite problem for De Ridders boys. Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu has been off-colour and the others have simply failed to deliver. They may, however, take heart from the fact that their last two CFL matches yielded nine goals.         
	Its not that we have been playing poorly We have been creating chances, but unfortunately havent been able to convert them into goals. I hope we will do well tomorrow, De Ridder said on Wednesday.         
	Mumbai FC have dished out a mixed fare so far in the league. After a sluggish start, Khalid Jamils team recovered somewhat during the middle stages only to nosedive again.         
	They have garnered 21 points, same as their Thursday opponents, but have played a match more.         
	Jamil will be missing defender Prem Kumar and striker Kayne Vincent with injuries. In New Zealander Vincents absence, Abhishek Yadav will play an important role upfront for the Mumbaikars.

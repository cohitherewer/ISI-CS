                  Ranadeb Bose                     
	Ahmedabad: Hosts Gujarat scored 162 for three against Bengal at stumps, on the second day in a Group A Super League match of the Ranji Trophy being held at the Sardar Patel Stadium, in Motera.         
	After the first day, which was a complete washout, only 52 overs were possible on the second after Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary opted to bowl. Opener Priyank Panchal (63, 10x4) was the star for Gujarat on Thursday, scoring his second first-class half century.         
	For Bengal, veteran seamer Ranadeb Bose who showed signs of coming back to form picking up three for 42 in his 15-over spell. When stumps were drawn, captain Parthiv Patel (23 batting) and Bhavik Thakkar (11 batting) were at the crease.         
	If there isnt any rain for the next couple of days, then one can expect an intriguing fight as both teams are fighting for a place in the last eight. The match is more important for Bengal as they have logged only two points from their two home matches. Gujarat will definitely look to post a challenging total and have enough time at their disposal to get all-important three points from the match.         
	The match started after lunch and Bose got into the act straightaway dismissing opener Jay Desai (5), who was caught by Anushtup Majumdar in the slips.         
	 However Priyank and experienced Neeraj Patel (44, 7x4) got together to add 96 runs for the second wicket before Bose got his second victim castling Patel. Bose finally got rid off the 20-year-old Priyank when he was caught by debutant Arnab Nandi. Parthiv and Bhavik played out the last hour without much trouble.

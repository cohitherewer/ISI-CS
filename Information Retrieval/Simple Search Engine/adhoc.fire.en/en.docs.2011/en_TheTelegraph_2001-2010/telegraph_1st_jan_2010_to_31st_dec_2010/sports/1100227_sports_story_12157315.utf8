The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karun deal imminent: Campos
                                                                                                                       7                                      Karun deal imminent: Campos
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Campos Meta, the new Formula One team which was recently taken over by Jose Ramon Carabante, are very close to finalising a deal with Karun Chandhok.         
	We have been very impressed with Karuns performance in GP2 and are close to finalising a deal with him. India is a great country and it would be great for the sport to have an Indian driver on the grid.         
	My aim now is to make sure that we are there on the grid in Bahrain, which will be a huge achievement in itself. We are moving in the right direction and will do everything in our power to make sure we are running in Bahrain, with Karun in the car, Team principal Colin Kolles said on Friday.         
	The 26-year-old Indians father and manager Vicky echoed Kolles.         
	We are in talks with Colin and hope to confirm a deal very soon. We have known Colin for a number of years and we are absolutely amazed by his determination and passion to get the car on the grid in Bahrain.         
	We have utmost faith in him and are hopeful to confirm things in the next few days, said Vicky.         
	Karun, who has been a regular in the GP2 Series, has victories in Spa, Monaco and Silverstone circuits. Prior to the GP2 series, he was the Asian Formula Renault V6 Champion in 2006.         
	He was also the youngest Formula Asia Championship in 2001. In 2000, the Chennai-born lad was the youngest national racing champion.         
	Karun may get to partner Aryton Sennas nephew, Bruno, if the deal is finalised. However, it all depends on whether the team is ready in time.         
	Now, only time will tell if Karun manages to become the second Indian to race in Formula One, after Narain Karthikeyan raced for Jordon in 2005.

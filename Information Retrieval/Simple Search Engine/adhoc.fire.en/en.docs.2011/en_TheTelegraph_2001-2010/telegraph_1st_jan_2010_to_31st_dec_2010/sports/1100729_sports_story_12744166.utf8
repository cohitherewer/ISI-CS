The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin, Raina keep India afloat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin, Raina keep India afloat
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Colombo: Virender Sehwag played Wednesdays worst shot, when on 99. Some hours later, though, he gave the days best quote.         
	Trust him to swing from one to the other.         
	Sachin (Tendulkar) still has the hunger of a debutant... When both Suresh Raina and he were batting, kaun debutant tha kehna mushkil tha... The point about Sachin is that when he gets down to playing, its as if hes in his first match...         
	Just as well, for the hunger of the senior-most pro and the grit of the debutant, who was only three when the accumulator of hundreds played his first Test, helped take India close to target No.1: Avoiding the follow-on, at the SSC.         
	Challenging Sri Lankas awesome 642 for four declared, India were 382 for four at stumps on Day III of the second Test, a handsome recovery from 173 for three and 241 for four.         
	If the repair work continues, India should be able to save the Test, thereby staying afloat in the three-match series for the Micromax Cup.         
	Starting the day on 95 for no loss, India were on course to take to lunch with the openers, Sehwag and Murali Vijay, unseparated.         
	However, with the break not far away, Sehwag decided to send debutant Suraj Randiv out of Colombo and ended up being stumped by Prasanna Jayawardene. Vijay then played back to Ajantha Mendis and was plumb leg-before. Rahul Dravid went the same way, becoming victim No.2 for Randiv, seen as Muttiah Muralidharans successor.         
	So, within five overs, three wickets went for as few as eight runs. Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman took to lunch without further damage, but the blows had been telling.         
	The hosts bowled to a plan, with a better understanding of the length, frustrating Sehwag as he approached what wouldve been his 21st Test hundred. He couldnt capitalise on a let off on 89.         
	Yes, Im disappointed... Not that I got out on 99, but because the day couldve been very good for us... We had a great opportunity (because of the wicket) to post a big total, but let it go... Thanks to Sachin, were in a good position, Sehwag, who was outsmarted by a doosra, said.         
	Seven Indians have tripped one short of 100. Overall, it was the 77th such instance.         
	Randiv, who has started his Test career with Sehwags scalp, felt it was a privilege to begin in such a manner. To get the wicket of a player of his calibre is great, is how he put it.         
	Sehwags 99 came in 186 minutes and 101 balls (15x4). His partnership with Vijay, who didnt try and compete, but complemented, was worth 165. Yet another biggie from a combination which teams up when Gautam Gambhir isnt available.         
	Vijay scored 58.         
	The period between lunch and tea was one of recovery and while Sachin went on to profit from a catch put down by the keeper (on 29, off Dilhara Fernando), Laxman fell to a somewhat dubious leg-before decision by Rod Tucker.         
	That was minutes before tea, taken at 243 for four. Sachin was on 39, with Raina yet to open his account.         
	If the first two sessions belonged to Sri Lanka, the visitors wrested the initiative in the last one. Having authored his 48th Test hundred, Sachin will start afresh, on 108. Raina will be looking to match Sourav Ganguly, the last Indian left-hander to get a hundred on debut. Hes on 66.         
	Raina, by his own admission, was a nervous starter. Thats par for the course for a debutant. What obviously helped him was Sachin being at the other end.         
	Randiv confessed that the quality of Sachins batting made it tough for him. At times, he came forward... Hed also go back... Bowling the right line and length became difficult.         
	Sri Lankas priority would be to quickly see Sachins back.         
	Sachin has played another important knock... Of course, we gave him the opportunity, by dropping him... I didnt know that he hadnt scored a Test hundred in Sri Lanka in the last decade, though, veteran Mahela Jayawardene told The Telegraph.

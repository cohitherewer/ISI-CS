                                                                                                                       7                                        Eden makes century more special: Alviro
  - Debutant attributes success to hard work in last two years       A STAFF REPORTER            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and VVS Laxman, at the Eden, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Sitting thousands of miles away in his Port Elizabeth residence, taxi driver Isaac Petersen will definitely feel proud of his son Alviros achievement of scoring a hundred on Test debut. At the media conference after the days play on Sunday, a beaming Alviro attributed his success to his hard work in the last couple of years.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the dream debut         
	Its a special feeling to get a hundred on Test debut. What makes it all the more special is that I scored the runs at a fantastic venue like Eden Gardens.         
	Any nerves         
	Not really. I was 99 per cent confident when I was told yesterday (Saturday) that I was playing. That gave me a whole evening to plan my approach. In the morning, we won the toss and opted to bat. So I was out in the middle straightaway. Once I crossed the boundary ropes, it was all about my batting.         
	Any special tips from captain Graeme Smith         
	Obviously, Graeme has played a lot of cricket. He kept on telling me that I should wait for the loose balls and we should try and take the team to a strong position.         
	Dedicating the century...         
	To myself. Because, its me who has put in all the hard work in the last couple of years.         
	If he can be the answer to South Africas opening woes         
	Its always a special feeling to play for the country, and becomes extra special if one gets a hundred on debut. But its up to the selectors to decide whos the answer to the opening woes.         
	Whether he had become complacent after completing the century         
	I believe it was a good delivery. On hindsight, one can say that I could have left the delivery, but that was in my scoring zone.         
	On the batting collapse         
	Its not a typical Indian wicket. It wasnt really easy to bat on. I would say the collapse was result of some poor shots as well as good bowling. However, there are four days left and still a lot of cricket to be played. We shouldnt reach any conclusion until both teams have at least batted once.         
	Who was the best among the bowlers         
	Its difficult pick one. All of them bowled well         
	If the ball was reversing         
	I wasnt batting after tea so I dont have an idea. All I can say is that it wasnt a normal Indian wicket where the ball gets scuffed up.         
	On the positive start         
	I guess the Indian bowlers were trying to set us up, and in the process, bowling quite a few boundary balls. Maybe it has got to do with their failure to break partnerships during the Nagpur Test.         
	His take on the pitch         
	Theres good bounce and carry. It was impressive to see Sharma (Ishant) bowling short stuff when the ball was 40 overs old. We would definitely fancy Dale Steyns chances.

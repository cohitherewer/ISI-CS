The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bob is no racist: Bhutia
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bob is no racist: Bhutia
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia on Saturday came out in support of national coach Bob Houghton saying the British coach did not make any racial comment against the fourth referee in the India-Yemen match at Pune on October 13.         
	Talking to the newspersons on the sidelines of the launch of Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools at Noida, the Indian captain blamed fourth referee Dinesh Nair for making false allegations against the coach.         
	In no way Bob can make such comments against any individual. I dont believe this. I was there in the match, Bob might have said something and Dinesh interpreted it in a wrong way. I think Dinesh had crossed the line and took it too far, said Bhutia.         
	I am playing under him (Houghton) for the last three years and can assure that Bob is not racist. Ask any of the 30 players in the national camp and then will also say this, Bhutia added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rio, Nemanja fit for United
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rio, Nemanja fit for United
                      
	London: Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic are fit and available again to resume their central defensive partnership as Manchester United aim to bounce back from Saturdays loss to Everton with a victory over West Ham on Tuesday.         
	The Ferdinand-Vidic linkup was one of the strengths behind Uniteds three consecutive league titles. But they have rarely played together this season because of injuries.         
	With Ferdinand back from a four-game suspension and Vidic finally over a leg injury, manager Alex Ferguson was able to name both in his squad on Monday and, after some poor defending against Everton on Saturday, the duo is expected to start against West Ham at Old Trafford.         
	Although the defeat left United four points behind Chelsea and allowed Arsenal in third to close to within two points of Fergusons team, the manager is convinced his team will revive its push for another title.         
	While defensive lapses let United down, the performance of top scorer Wayne Rooney was another big disappointment.         
	With the League Cup final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday looming, Ferguson might be tempted to give Rooney a rest and field Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen against West Ham, but he has named his top striker in the squad.         
	Nani is suspended, however, and Ryan Giggs is still recovering from a broken right arm. West Ham come off a 3-0 victory over Hull, only the first time this season Gianfranco Zolas team have won two games in a row.

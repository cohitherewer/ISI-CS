The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag are aiming for full points 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag are aiming for full points 
                      
	Margao: Chirag United and Churchill Brothers will be looking to keep the momentum going when they meet Viva Kerala and Sesa Football Academy respectively, in the Group B quarter-final league matches of the Federation Cup, at the Tilak Maidan, in Vasco, on Thursday.         
	Chirag, who managed to collect full points against Sesa Football Academy thanks to Denson Devadass strike, faced a stiff challenge from the young Goan side.         
	Coach Subrata Bhattacharya, although not fully satisfied with the low score line, said that the win was good enough.         
	Viva Kerala did not have a good start and lost 0-4 to Churchill. Hopefully we will get an early goal on Thursday, Bhattacharya added.         
	The new-look Churchill team lacked the creativeness in the midfield to open up the rival defence and they clearly lacked the absence of Kalu who has left for Dempo this season.         
	Striker Odafe Okolie and Koko Sakibo also needs to settle down quickly although both have scored against Viva Kerala. For Sesa, Pratesh Shirodker and Inacio Colaco have controlled the midfield admirably.

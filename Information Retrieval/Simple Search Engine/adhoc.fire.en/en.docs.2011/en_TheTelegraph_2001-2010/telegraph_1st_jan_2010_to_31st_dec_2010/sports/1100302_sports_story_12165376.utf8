	Mumbai: Two debutants, opener Heather Knight and Danielle Wyatt down the order, turned out to be the stars for the England womens team who clinched a thrilling two-wicket victory with a ball to spare against India at the MCA ground here on Monday.         
	With Jhulan Goswamis team having already sealed the series 3-1, it was pride that the World Champions were left to play for in the inconsequential match. And Knight and Wyatt achieved exactly that as they helped the visitors overhaul the target of 207.         
	Knight laid the foundation for England with a steady 49 off 101 balls and featured in crucial partnerships at the top with Ebony Rainford-Brent (17), Beth Morgan (19) and Lydia Greenway (26).         
	The Indians, however, kept themselves in the hunt with regular breakthroughs, thanks to some tidy bowling by Sonia Dabir, Goswami, Rumeli Dhar and Gouher Sultana, all of whom picked two wickets each.         
	But with 20 runs needed from the last four overs, Wyatt (28 ..) held her nerve through some tense moments to steer her team to the coast.         
	Earlier, Mithali Raj (50) and Harmanpreet Kaur (84) helped the Indians recover from a disastrous start which saw them slump to 26 for four.         
	Raj, who had made a match-winning 84 not out in the fourth ODI, and Kaur put on 90 runs for the fifth wicket.         
	Kaur then added further 71 runs with Dabir (31 ..) to see the scoreboard breach the 200 mark for the first time in the series. It proved to be in vain in the end, though.         
	Goswami was happy with the teams overall performance, but was worried that the batting had come to depend too heavily on Raj.         
	Yes We need to support Mithali, there is too much pressure on her. It has not helped that Thirush Kamini got injured in the second match and she has not been available after that, the captain said.         
	The teams will next clash in three T20 games, all at the same venue, with first scheduled to be held on Thursday.         
	Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Monday rewarded the Indian team members with a bonus payment of Rs one lakh each for winning the ODI series.

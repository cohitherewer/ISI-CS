	Sofia: The seventh game of the World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Veselin Topalov ended in a draw, here, on Monday         
	The fourth white in seven games gave the world champion some anxious moments as Topalov unleashed a sacrifice and followed it up with a counter-attack.         
	The 58-move draw had its ups and downs throughout, but Anand managed to keep the one-point lead.         
	The seventh game got off to an interesting ceremonial start as former world champion Anatoly Karpov, who came to Sofia on Monday, made the first move on behalf of Anand.         
	Topalov looked determined to test Anand in a special variation in the Catalan Opening when he sacrificed an exchange on move 12 to get a counter-attack for black.         
	The move was picked up from a game between Boris Gelfand of Israel and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the Amber tournament earlier this year. That game, incidentally, was drawn after 33 moves.         
	Topalov reeled off his opening moves quite fast suggesting the variation was studied and prepared well at home.         
	Anand took a break after blacks 15th move and spent 40 minutes for his next move. The world champion had apparently analysed all variations and decided that it was better for him to give back the exchange and resume normal service.         
	Topalov pressed hard in the centre by giving his knight for two pawns and created connected pawns to further push Anand. The Bulgarian seemed to bank on his chances to play on the nerves of Anand but the world champion showed incredible balance.         
	He was down on the clock by almost an hour but that did not bother him as long as the position was under control.         
	Topalov seemed to have lost his way at this point and looked in danger after his pawns in the centre got blocked. With a strong rook move, Anand controlled the seventh rank.         
	However, the Bulgarian came back strongly with a bishop move that upset whites blockade of the pawns. Now Anand had to fall back on defence.         
	Though, Anand avoided drawing chances and fancied his chances in a piece-up ending, Topalovs passed pawn was a constant thorn in whites plans. The draw was an inevitable result.

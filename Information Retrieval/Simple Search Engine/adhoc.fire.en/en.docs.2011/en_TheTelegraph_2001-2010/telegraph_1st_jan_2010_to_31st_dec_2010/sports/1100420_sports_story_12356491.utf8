The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eto waiting to have a go at Barcelona
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eto waiting to have a go at Barcelona
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Samuel Eto and his Inter Milan team-mates are relishing the opportunity of moving a step closer to winning an historic treble as they host Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final first leg at the San Siro on Tuesday.         
	Jose Mourinhos side are just a point off Roma at the top of the Serie A table and have made it through to the final of the Coppa Italia, so victory over Barcelona across the two legs of the final four stage would doubtless make them favourites to win their first European Cup since 1964.         
	Acknowledging the challenge he and his team-mates face against his former club, Eto said: Were nourishing the dream of making history. Barcelona are the best team at the moment but every game has its own story and we want to write our own story against Barcelona.         
	How do you prepare to play Barcelona? With calmness. We have to try to get our heads into the game before it starts because games like this are almost played more with the head than with the feet.         
	If I was to score at the San Siro of course Ill celebrate but maybe if I score in the Camp Nou I wont.         
	Inter will be more than aware of the destruction Barcelona are capable of having seen them annihilate Arsenal 4-1 at the Nou Camp. But Nerazzurri captain Javier Zanetti believes his team have what it takes to get a result.

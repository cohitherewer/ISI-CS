The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky Ponting looks   good after practice
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ricky Ponting looks   good after practice

	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting tested his broken finger in a one-hour batting session Friday as he seeks to prove his fitness ahead of the fourth Ashes Test against England beginning Sunday.         
	Ponting batted against a bowling machine in the indoor nets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before heading outside to face some throw-downs from coach Tim Nielsen and also face some of the net bowlers.         
	He showed no signs of discomfort despite fracturing his left little finger while fielding in the slips during last weeks win over England in the third Test in Perth.         
	The five-Test series is even at 1-1, with England able to clinch a successful Ashes defence by winning in Melbourne or Sydney. The first Test in Brisbane was drawn, England won the second in Adelaide by an innings and 71 runs and Australia took the Perth Test by 267 runs.         
	Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said he was confident of attracting a world-record crowd of 91,000 for Sundays first day of play. Vice-captain Michael Clarke said Ponting told him he was pleased with how Fridays session went.         
	He said it felt pretty good after facing some balls on the machines and facing the bowlers (in the nets), Clarke said.         
	Were all confident. Unless they cut his finger off, its going to be really hard to leave Punter (Ponting) out.         
	He will wait until Saturday to see how it pulls up after having a bat on Friday. But hes pretty happy with how things went.         
	Ponting has struggled in this Ashes series and could be the first Australian captain to lose the Ashes series three times. However, Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin said Ponting played a key role in rallying the side for their confidence-boosting win in Perth last week, despite Clarke taking the field as skipper on the fifth day when an injured Ponting sat in the pavilion.         
	Hes our leader and we get a lot of inspiration from him, Haddin said. You just have to see the turnaround we had from Adelaide to Perth to see the effect he has on the team.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss said his side would not be playing for a draw in either Test. Weve got two Test matches to go and we want to win them both  it is as simple as that, Strauss said.         
	Were going for the outright win, absolutely. The majority of Test matches arent drawn, so there are going to be results in these last two games, and we want to make them both positive for us.

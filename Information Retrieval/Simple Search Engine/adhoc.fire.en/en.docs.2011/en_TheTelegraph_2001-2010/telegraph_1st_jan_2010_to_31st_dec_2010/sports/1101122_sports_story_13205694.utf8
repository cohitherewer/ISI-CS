The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwags an impact player: Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sehwags an impact player: Gambhir
  - Opener says he would rely on instincts, more than anything else, as captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid, on way to his unbeaten 69, on Sunday                                 
	Nagpur: Gautam Gambhir feels his leadership qualities would be guided by instincts. The opener, who scored a fluent 78 on Sunday, said at a press conference that a lead of around 300 would be enough to put New Zealand under pressure.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	On being named captain for the ODIs         
	I am really excited. I think it is a dream come true whatever opportunity I will get of leading the team is great Hopefully, I can do well personally and also as a team. Hopefully, we can win the series.         
	His thoughts on captaincy         
	Ill try to be relaxed The experience of captaining Delhi DareDevils and the Delhi Ranji team is always of great help as Ive seen and handled the ups and downs as a captain. But everyone has different ways and I personally feel it is the instincts that make the difference in the middle. You cant think beforehand that this is what I am going to doItll all depend on the situation. You should back what you think is the right move.         
	 On the Nagpur wicket         
	I think its a slow wicket It didnt deteriorate from the way it was turning on the first day. If we have a 300-run lead on this wicket, we have a very good chance with two quality spinners in our sideWe can put a lot of pressure on them.         
	Both openers missing out on a hundred         
	Yeah, very disappointing because as opening batsmen we both have felt that once you get settled, you have to get as many runs as possible. The new ball is definitely a challenge, and we both keep discussing that if we get set, we have to make as many runs as possible. Hopefully, we can get the hundred in South Africa.         
	If Sachin Tendulkar would get to his 50th Test hundred tomorrow         
	I think it is going to be the biggest achievement for any cricketer. Hopefully, he can go on and score it.         
	The impact Sehwag makes as an opener         
	Obviously, he is an impact player. The way he sets up the game... The way he sets up the run-rate. He bats in the same way in all three formats of the game. I dont think that there are a lot many players in the world who can bat the same way in all the three forms. He is someone special. I dont see anyone matching him. He attacks the opposition from the word go, which is something I havent seen in Test cricket as normally you take time to settle down and then go for your shots.         
	On batting with Sehwag when not in form         
	When you are not among runs, it is always difficult to bat with anyone. First of all you need to score runs to be confident. It is about scoring the runs... Hes of great help he kept me giving a lot of confidence in Hyderabad and I always needed it. I am thankful to him for that.         
	His way of getting back to form         
	We both are different kind of players and we both think differently. May be, Virus way of coming out of a bad patch is different from mine. I might like to play more balls in the middle and start getting the confidence back. But he is someone who wants to attack whether he is scoring runs or not. It is different with every cricketer. You cant have a set pattern to get back into form.         
	On going through a rough patch         
	To be very honest, I didnt play much cricket at a stretch... After the Asia Cup, I played one Test match and got injured, and then I played another Test and again got injured. I dont think I had too much of match practice I always thought if I could play three or four Test matches in a row it would help That is what has happened.         
	Getting out a few times in the very first over         
	I still remember that I had three ducks in the second innings this year. As an international cricketer it keeps getting back into your mind. I kept telling myself that it is not about one over, it is about each and every ball and taking one ball at a time.         
	On fielding at forward short-leg         
	Honestly, if you see there is no one else who can field at that position in the current combination of our side. Till we get anyone I will have to field there. At one point, it used to bother me a lot. Once it was a pretty serious injury, and standing at forward short-leg for one-and-a-half days and with two spinners hardly gives your body the time to recover. It is a bit of concern, but that is also the responsibility you need to take for the team. Till the time we dont get anyone else, I will have to be there.         
	If he would still stand at forward short-leg as skipper         
	Yes, I will

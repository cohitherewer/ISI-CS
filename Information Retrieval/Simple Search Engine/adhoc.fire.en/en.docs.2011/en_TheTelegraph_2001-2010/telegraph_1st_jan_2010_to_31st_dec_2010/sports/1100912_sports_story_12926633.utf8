  - Dhonis boys have a cakewalk against unfancied Central Stags             S. Badrinath on way to his unbeaten 52 on Saturday                           
	Durban: S. Badrinath struck an unbeaten 52 to save the batting blushes before a disciplined effort by the bowlers as Chennai Super Kings (CSK) spank Central Stags by 57 runs in the Airtel Champions League Twenty20 match, here on Saturday.         
	Badrinaths counter attacking 52 from 42 balls was mainly responsible for CSK reaching 151 for four after they were down five for two in the second over and 48 for three at halfway mark after electing to bat.         
	He got ample support from Anirudha Srikkanth (42) and the duo shared 73 runs from 49 balls for the fourth wicket to take CSK score past 150 on a spongy Kingsmead pitch which saw odd balls kicking up to trouble the batsmen.         
	Later, CSK bowlers complemented the good work done by their batsmen by skittling out Central Stags for 94 in 18.1 overs to start their campaign on a winning note.         
	Chasing 152 for a win, the New Zealand champion side initially looked like they would stand up for a challenge but after they lost their first wicket in the fourth over they were never in the chase.         
	Pacer Laxmipathy Balaji was the most successful CSK bowler with three for 20 from his four overs while Muttiah Muralidharan, Ravichandran Ashwin and Doug Bollinger claiming two apiece. Opener Peter Ingram was the first Central Stags batsman to go in the fourth over for six as he top-edged an Albie Morkel delivery to Suresh Raina at cover. The team total was 12. Ingram was earlier dropped on one by Ashwin.         
	Next over, George Worker fell to Balaji for four and at team score of 22 for two with Muralidharan taking an easy catch at mid-on.         
	CSK captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni introduced off-spinner Ashwin in the sixth over and got the result immediately in the form of Jamie Hows wicket.         
	The captain of the New Zealand champion side, who was dropped by Raina when on five, misread a delivery which straightened up before cleaning up his off-stump. Central Stags were reeling at 35 for three at that stage.         
	Sri Lankan spin wizard Muralidharan then claimed two wickets in the space of three balls to leave Central Stags run chase in tatters as they were reduced to 37 for five in the eighth over. Mathew Sinclair (10), who hit Ashwin for a six in his first delivery, followed suit his captain soon as he fell to a superb catch by Matthew Hayden at slip while attempting a reverse sweep off a Muralidharan delivery.         
	Muraliddharan, who recently retired from Test cricket, scalped his second wicket two balls later with Noema-Barnettas (0) edging a sharp turning delivery for Dhoni to take a fine catch behind the stumps.         
	Central Stags, who were 43 for five at the halfway mark, were dealt another blow with Dhoni effecting a smart stumping of Brendon Diamanti (4) after Ashwin had drawn the batsman out of the crease.

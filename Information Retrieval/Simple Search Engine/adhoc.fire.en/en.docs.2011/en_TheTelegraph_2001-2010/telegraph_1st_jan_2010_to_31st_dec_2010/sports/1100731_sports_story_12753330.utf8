The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alan Isaac set to make it smoothly 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Alan Isaac set to make it smoothly 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Isaac                      
	Colombo: Alan Isaac, the New Zealand Cricket (NZC) chairman, will be the next vice-president of the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	Hell also be succeeding Sharad Pawar, as the president, in the summer of 2012.         
	Isaac is the new joint nominee of Cricket Australia (CA) and NZC, after first-choice John Howard had been rejected by the world bodys Executive Board.         
	Actually, hes New Zealands nominee, who has Australias support.         
	The Asia-Africa group and the West Indies wont have any objections... Thats my understanding, a well-placed source told The Telegraph, late on Friday.         
	India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the West Indies had, it may be recalled, said no to Australias former Prime Minister.         
	A royal snub if ever there was one.         
	As the fresh nomination from CA and NZC has come well within the August 31 deadline, the Executive Board could give its approval via a telephonic hook-up.         
	After all, the Executive Board isnt scheduled to meet till October and it would make sense for Isaac to get down to business at the earliest.         
	Its not clear, by the way, whether hell have to relinquish his NZC position.

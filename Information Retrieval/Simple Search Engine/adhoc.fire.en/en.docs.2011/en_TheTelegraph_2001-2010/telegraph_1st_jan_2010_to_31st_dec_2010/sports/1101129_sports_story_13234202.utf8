	It was not easy. The bloated appearance of Englands second innings scorecard might give that impression  and indeed the pitch remained amiable for batting throughout day four  but lesser England sides have cracked in such a match-situation, especially at the Gabba. And Shane Warne was delivering verdicts in the commentary box, not leggies and toppies. It was a different game, for that one simple reason, from any in the last four Ashes series in Australia  for even when Warne missed a few games, Stuart MacGill was a fine replacement.         
	Nevertheless, the runs had to be scored, and England made them in such style and quantity that Australias sense of superiority had evaporated long before the close, when England were nothing less than 309 for one wicket.         
	It was Andrew Strauss who raised the siege with a cavalry charge, followed by infantrymen Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott. England had been 19 without loss after 15 overs on Saturday evening, and could not continue at that rate without sinking into a hole.         
	Strauss took the attack to the Australians, firstly with his square-cut then  when the seamers pitched up  with drives through extra-cover and mid-off. And with every one of his 15 boundaries, Englands hope grew from seed to sapling that they would escape the Gabba without the defeat that had seemed likely after the ground record stand of 307 between Mike Hussey and Brad Haddin.         
	It was an inglorious end when Strauss was out, stumped off a tame offspinner. But the point is that he had lived by the sword when fainter spirits would have not, and the fruits of his labours became apparent  if they were not manifest already in the Australians dispirited air  when the second new ball was taken.         
	This was the last threat, and if Strauss and Cook had batted timorously, and England had still been behind when that second ball was taken, it could have been potent. But the siege had been raised: in other words, the field had been spread. Thus Cook and Trott were able to push well forward at the new ball, scotching any swing or seam movement, without a short-leg anywhere in sight, for Ponting had retreated - to leave no more than two slips and a gully on sentry duty.         
	Cook had batted through the first 65 overs of the match, when the ball had been swinging and the position precarious. A hundred second time round, notched in the 80th over, was nothing less than he deserved.         
	It made for perhaps the finest match double  67 and 132 not out  recorded by an England opening batsman in Australia since Herbert Sutcliffe, who was also sleek and handsome. When Strauss and Cook had added five runs to their overnight total, they had overtaken Hobbs and Sutcliffe as Englands most prolific opening pair: the old uns had put on 3249 Test runs together in less than half the number of innings, but then it was an even higher-scoring age.         
	It helped that Australias two best allround fielders are 35-year-olds confined to being close to the wicket, Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey. Their juniors dropped three catches - each of Englands batsmen once.         
	Cook was dropped by Peter Siddle at fine-leg when he hooked the second new ball, but Cook was in three figures by then and Australia a state of despondency. Michael Clarke, diving to his left, dropped Trott at point when he cut at Siddle.         
	The opening stand of 188 by Strauss and Cook broke the joint record of 114 for England at the Gabba, shared by Sutcliffe and Douglas Jardine before the Second World War, and by Geoff Pullar and David Sheppard afterwards. It broke Australias growing self-esteem too, and made them realise that this Ashes series is going to be one long attritional fight.

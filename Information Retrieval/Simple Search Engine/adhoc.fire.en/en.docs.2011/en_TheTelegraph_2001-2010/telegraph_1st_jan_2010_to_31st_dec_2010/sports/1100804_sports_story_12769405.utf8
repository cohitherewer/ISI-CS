    - Sangakkara top scores with 75; Ojha snares two wickets           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              FRUIT-FUL DAY?
  Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar during a   break on the opening day of the third and final Test,   against Sri Lanka, in Colombo, on Tuesday. Sachin added yet another feather to his cap by   becoming the most-capped Test player in the world with 169 appearances. (Reuters)                                  
	Colombo: With three of their four wickets falling to errors in judgement (one by umpire Rod Tucker), Sri Lanka had cause for some regret on the opening day of the final Test.         
	India, on the other hand, could give themselves a mild pat on the back for restricting the hosts powerful line-up to 293 for four when play was called off, at the P. Sara Oval, for insufficient light.         
	That was six minutes after the scheduled close, but 3.1 of the mandatory 90 overs remained.         
	With the wicket already affording much turn (theres bounce, too), its highly likely that the third match of the Micromax Cup will produce a decisive result.         
	That being such a strong possibility, runs in excess of 400 are going to be very handy for Sri Lanka, as the visitors would have to bat last.         
	After the yawns at the SSC, it was pleasing to see more or less an even contest between willow and leather.         
	The closer we get to 500, the better... That would set us up for a victory. If you look at the average scores, 350-400 is (itself) pretty good, maintained Stuart Law, the former Australia bat who is now Sri Lankas assistant coach.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni lost the toss yet again, making it seven on the trot for him, and it surprised nobody when a beaming Kumar Sangakkara chose to bat.         
	Conditions were somewhat overcast, which helped Ishant Sharma and Abhimanyu Mithun get reasonable movement. A snick was waiting to go to hand and Tharanga Paranavitana, otherwise in form, obliged.         
	Fifteen for one made it Sri Lankas worst start of the series, but the repairs began immediately. Clinically as well.         
	However, Tillekaratne Dilshan, who doesnt have the temperament of an opener, scripted his own downfall minutes before lunch. Believe it or not, he ran himself out, on a no ball from Pragyan Ojha.         
	All credit to the fielder, Murali Vijay, at silly point. Its a position which calls for men with super reflexes and he wasnt found wanting.         
	So, instead of taking to lunch at 100-odd for one, Sri Lanka did so two down for 102. Dilshan gifted his wicket, is how Law put it.         
	Suresh Raina, too, was in the mood to gift: He dropped Sangakkara, on 23 (Mithun being the sufferer), when the catch was actually heading for V.V.S. Laxman.         
	Sangakkara, whod begun to control the innings in his flamboyant manner, was the only one dismissed in the second session. After a hundred in the first Test and a double in the next, hed been heading for another three-figure knock when he found Virender Sehwag in the deep, off Ojha.         
	An utterly soft dismissal, which is why Sangakkara (No.1 in the ICCs rankings) kept shaking his head. His 75 came in 173 minutes off 114 deliveries (5x4, 2x6).         
	Laws take  a lapse in concentration.         
	Vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene, sound as ever, then took charge and was looking for plenty more when Tucker adjudged him leg-before, on 56, much to Ojhas joy. Replays showed the ball would have gone over the stumps.         
	A howler, really.         
	One may not pay a premium to watch Thilan Samaraweera, but one would love to have somebody as solid as him in the XI. At stumps, he was unbeaten on 65, focused on his first hundred of the series.         
	Keeping him company was Angelo Mathews, who is turning out to be an all-rounder of class.         
	Surprisingly, spinners Ojha and Amit Mishra, who ought to have got much bite, overstepped as many as 10 times. In fact, its criminal for the slow bowlers to do so.         
	I changed my run-up and then it was fine... Initially, yes, there was a problem... Senior bowlers (Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan) are being missed, but its the best opportunity for me to prove myself... If I deliver, it would be one of the best things to happen, Ojha said.         
	The left-arm spinner, whod been most unimpressive in the first two Tests, added that the Kookaburras seam often disappeared very quickly, unlike the SG used back in India. Bowling with the Kookaburra is a challenge...         
	Harbhajan, meanwhile, felt slightly better on Tuesday.         
	Yesterday, I had difficulty moving even in my room... Im slightly better... This (right) calf muscle injury couldnt have come at a worse time...Ive had to miss a Test where there has been turn from the opening day! Kismat ke aage kuch nahin hota, he told The Telegraph.         
	In a different context, Yuvraj would agree.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin a great ambassador, says Graeme
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin a great ambassador, says Graeme
                      
	Johannesburg: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has termed Sachin Tendulkar as a great ambassador of the game and said his desire to become a cricketer got wings after watching the Indian maestro during his childhood.         
	Smith was an 11-year-old kid when Tendulkar first toured South Africa following the countrys re-admission to the international fold after decades of isolation because of apartheid.         
	But on Thursday, Smith will lead South Africa in the first Test against India at Centurion in what could well be Tendulkars last tour to the country.         
	He (Tendulkar) is a world class player and a great ambassador for the game, Smith said at an official reception for the Indian team here Monday night.         
	As a youngster, I watched the games and thats where all my dreams started. You see the players (like Tendulkar) on TV and you think that I want to be like that one day, and here we are, he said.         
	India are currently touring South Africa for three Tests, one-off Twenty20 International and five ODIs.         
	Smith also lauded former South Africa opener and now India coach Gary Kirsten, saying he commands great respect in the cricketing fraternity.         
	Gary was one of my heroes while I was growing up, so obviously it was great to get the opportunity to play with him, he said.         
	Hes a guy that I respect a hell of a lot and Im sure the Indian team itself respects him. That respect will also go onto the field. Its about playing well for South Africa, but that respect will always be there, the home skipper added.         
	India speedster Sreesanth too was full of praise for his coach.         
	Hes (Kirsten) been a great motivator and a great friend to each and every player, Sreesanth said.         
	Sreesanth described as spot on Kirstens recent comments that India could be a world class team only if they beat South Africa on their home turf.         
	Sreesanth spoke for the Indian team during the function after captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni opted to send the Kerela speedster up on the dais to join Smith.         
	He also said that the team would be benefited in the series by some of its players previous experience of playing in South African conditions.         
	I did not play in the Champions League but other team members have played. They know how to acclimatise with the conditions.         
	Dhoni led the Chenai Super Kings to Champions League title here earlier this year and he had also helped us in our preparation, Sreesanth said. (PTI)

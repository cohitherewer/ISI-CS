The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stress is on preparations
                                                                                                                       7                                      Stress is on preparations
                      
	Johannesburg: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni downplayed the role of Sachin Tendulkar Monday, ahead of the three-Test series against South Africa.         
	Much of the media hype before the first Test, from Thursday at Centurion Park, centres on the showdown between Tendulkar, seeking his 50th Test ton, and South Africa pace ace Dale Steyn.         
	But Dhoni told a media conference that the clash between the top-two Test sides in the world was not about individuals. Cricket is a team sport and not about individuals. We place more importance on the process and how we are preparing for the Tests, Dhoni said.         
	We know how much talent is there in the Indian squad... Preparing well and adapting well... These are the areas we are concentrating on right now.         
	South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl backed the Indian captain. It is an excellent Indian team and if you are talking about them, you cannot single out individuals.         
	Dhoni was upbeat about the wickets amid reports that South Africa were preparing pace-and-bounce-friendly ones to aid their seamers. Most of our cricketers are used to playing here, whether it is the shorter forms of the game or Test cricket. We will assess the wickets and decide how we need to play.         
	The skipper said the Indian attack had impressed at home and abroad on wickets that were not always supportive with the bowlers adapting quickly and successfully to trigger victories.         
	He also dismissed statistics showing India have won only one of nine previous Tests in South Africa, stressing the series was not about history or past achievements. (Agencies)

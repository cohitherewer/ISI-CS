The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is available for ODIs 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin is available for ODIs 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, Little Master II, is available for the three-match ODI series against South Africa.         
	Im definitely available, Sachin, whod opted out of the tri-series in Bangladesh last month, told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	That remains Indias last engagement in ODIs.         
	The selectors will be meeting here on Tuesday to pick XV for possibly all three ODIs  in Jaipur (February 21), Gwalior (February 24) and Ahmedabad (February 27).         
	According to well-placed sources, Yuvraj Singhs availability wasnt known till late on Monday. A wrist injury has kept him out of the ongoing two-Test series.         
	If Yuvraj isnt fit, then Abhishek Nayar or Yusuf Pathan could benefit. Young Manish Pandeys name is also doing the rounds.         
	The selectors, one learns, are in the dark, but lead spinner Harbhajan Singh is understood to have informed the Board that he wouldnt be available for the first two ODIs, owing to a wedding in the family.         
	Tamil Nadus Ravichandran Ashwin, an all-rounder who bowls off-spin, may well take Harbhajans place.         
	Meanwhile, its not clear whether Sreesanth, coming off an injury, is going to be in the XV. Theres some uncertainty over Ishant Sharma as well.         
	The certainties are: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag (vice-captain), Sachin, Gautam Gambhir, Dinesh Karthik, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Sudeep Tyagi.         
	Footnote: The buzz is that a communication gap has developed between the team management and the quintet headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth. If that indeed is true, then the misgivings need to be cleared quickly.

	New Delhi: After his failed effort to play for Coventry City and Celtic Football Club, India striker Sunil Chetri is now making yet another attempt to don the jersey of a foreign club.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the diminutive forward has gone to the United States for trials in a couple of clubs in the Major League Soccer (MLS), the premier soccer championship in the US.         
	Chetri had left the Indian camp a day before it ended in Dubai to go to the US, an AIFF official said.         
	He had special permission from the team management to do so, he added.         
	While Chetris family members remained tight-lipped, a Dempo official said he was aware that Chetri had gone to the US for trials.         
	We have no detail information. All we know is that he is supposed to come back on Friday, he said.

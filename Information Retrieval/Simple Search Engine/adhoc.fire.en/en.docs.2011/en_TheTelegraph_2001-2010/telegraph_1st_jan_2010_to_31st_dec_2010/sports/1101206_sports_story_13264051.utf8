                                                                                                                       7                                      Rikard: I am really happy
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Delhi Golf Club course has turned out to be a happy hunting ground for Rikard Karlberg. Eight months ago at the same venue, the Swede bagged the SAIL Open trophy and he repeated his performance on Sunday with a convincing display in the Indian Open.         
	Yes, I feel comfortable when I am play on this course, said Karlberg later. Even when I was struggling today (Sunday), I felt confident. I am really thankful for the support and I really like it here, he said.         
	It was a roller coaster ride. The first day, it felt solid and then I struggled a bit. You have to fight a bit but my short game has been unbelievable. I feel comfortable on the greens. The putting was just unbelievable in SAIL Open but here, my chipping and bunker shots were also good. Im really happy to be where I am now, said the Swede.         
	Karlberg now plans to go back to his hometown Gothenburg during the Christmas and celebrate the victory with his family. Nobody from my family was here to watch me win the biggest title of my career..I know they are very happy. I am looking forward to go back and show them my trophy, he said.         
	Overnight leader Baek Seuk-Hyun, who was relegated to the second spot, blamed himself for the defeat. In the first hole, I missed from two feet. It was an easy putt and then I missed some tee shots ... it was really bad, said the Korean.         
	Baek said Karlberg was the deserving winner. He played really good in the last two holes for those two birdies. He hit a really good chip. As far as I am concerned, I was really nervous until the par five where I made an eagle ... but I bogeyed the 16th . It killed my chances, he said.

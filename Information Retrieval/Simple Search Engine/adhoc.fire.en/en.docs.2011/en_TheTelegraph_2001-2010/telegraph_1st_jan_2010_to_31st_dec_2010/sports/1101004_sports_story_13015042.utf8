The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Was a collective effort: Johnson
                                                                                                                       7                                      Was a collective effort: Johnson
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Mitchell Johnson did the star turn for Australia pinning down India with his reverse swing.         
	The left-arm fast bowler, who claimed five for 64, attributed the success to the research that went behind it.         
	We talked about it among ourselves in the meetings We also watched carefully how the Indians were reversing the ball. Today (Sunday) we looked after the ball well. We kept it as dry as we could. That helped us in doing that properly, Johnson, while speaking about reverse swing, said, at the media conference, on Sunday.         
	Praising his teammates, he said: It was a collective effort. We stuck to our job pretty well all through the day. (Doug) Bollinger was bowling excellently and (Nathan) Hauritz was unlucky a couple of times. At the end of the day, I am quite happy with the way things have panned out for us.         
	Asked for their plans on Monday, Johnson said: We will try to put up as many runs on the board as we can. Its going to be a big day for us.         
	According to the fast bowler, it is very difficult to handle Indian conditions. The pitches dont offer you much, and the outfields are hard. The hot conditions leave us absolutely cooked at the end of the day, Johnson said.         
	Asked why did the Australians not test Suresh Raina with short deliveries, he said: With the ball we had, it was difficult bowl short and get the ball to rise

                                                                                                                       7                                      Styris out to cement spot
                      
	Wellington: Scott Styris, the New Zealand all-rounder, is determined to force his way back into the starting XI at the World Twenty20.         
	Styris is not a guaranteed starter despite having been part of the squad for the previous two tournaments, as well as after a successful return to the ODI squad against Australia in March, during which he averaged 49.00 with the bat.         
	I didnt make it for the home season, so at no stage have I thought Im in the playing XI, he told a New Zealand daily.         
	I have to go out and put good performances on the board, otherwise Ill find myself sitting watching these games, which is not what I want.         
	New Zealand open the tournament on April 30 with a fixture against last years finalists Sri Lanka.           (AGENCIES)

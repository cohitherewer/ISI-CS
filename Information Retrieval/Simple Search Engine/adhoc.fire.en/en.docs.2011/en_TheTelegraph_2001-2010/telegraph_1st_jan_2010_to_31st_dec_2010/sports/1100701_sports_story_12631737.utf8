	London: Michael Clarke was left stranded on 99 not out as Australia reached 290 for five against England on Wednesday in the fourth one-day International at The Oval.         
	Clarkes 106-ball knock included seven fours, but he was denied a century when Steven Smith (18 not out) faced the last five balls of the innings.         
	Clarke earlier shared a third-wicket partnership of 155 with Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who made 92 from 93 balls, including 10 fours.         
	England, who hold an insurmountable 3-0 lead in the five-match series, won the toss and put Australia in to bat on an Oval wicket that appeared typically helpful for batsmen.         
	For the first time in the series, the visitors failed to put on 50 for the first wicket.         
	Tim Paine made eight from 22 balls before his frustration induced a rash stroke off Tim Bresnan, with Eoin Morgan taking the catch at extra cover.           (AGENCIES)

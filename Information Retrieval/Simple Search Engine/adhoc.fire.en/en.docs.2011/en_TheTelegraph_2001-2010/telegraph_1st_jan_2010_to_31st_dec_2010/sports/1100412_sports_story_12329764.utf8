	Wembley: Portsmouth reached the FA Cup final by scoring two extra-time goals to beat Tottenham 2-0 on Sunday, a day after the 2008 winners were relegated from the Premier League.         
	Frederic Piquionne broke the deadlock in the ninth minute of extra time, and former Spurs midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng added another from the penalty spot 18 minutes later at Wembley Stadium.         
	Portsmouth manager Avram Grant will come up against former side Chelsea in the May 15 final after the defending champions beat Aston Villa 3-0 on Saturday.         
	It will be a remarkable conclusion to a miserable season for debt-ridden Portsmouth, which became the first Premier League team to seek bankruptcy protection last month and has a court-appointed administrator trying to find a buyer for the club.         
	This season encapsulates just about every emotion you can have as a footballer and today (Sunday) has been absolutely superb, said goalkeeper David James, who was the only remaining player in Sundays starting line-up from the 2008 team that won the title.         
	Beating former manager Harry Redknapps Tottenham will result in Portsmouth receiving 900,000 ($1.4 million) in prize money, not to mention what is raised in ticket revenue from the semi-final.         
	Portsmouths FA Cup win two years ago under Redknapp  the clubs first trophy since 1950  led to a financial implosion due to overspending on players.Drastically cutting the squad couldnt prevent Portsmouth entering financial administration and a nine-point deduction.         
	Relegation to the League Championship was confirmed Saturday after West Hams victory over Sunderland ended any faint hopes of survival.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shane Bond is ready to fire
                                                                                                                       7                                        Shane Bond is ready to fire
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Shane Bond woke up at 3 am in the morning to catch up with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) match against Deccan Chargers and the New Zealand paceman cant wait to get into the thick of things.         
	It was really an exciting match against the Deccan Chargers. It got really close but I was relieved to see that we did well to win it. Its been a really good start for us in the tournament and we have to ensure that we can keep the momentum going in our favour, Bond, who reached the city on Monday told The Telegraph.         
	Bond, who has joined the squad after playing the two T20 Internationals and five ODIs against Australia, stated that he is fit and ready to come hard at the Chennai Super Kings batsmen if given a chance.         
	I am fit and ready to play. But our team has done really well so I am not sure whether I will be playing tomorrow (Tuesday). I am ready to wait for my opportunity and grab it with both hands. But if I get an opportunity tomorrow, then there will be a nice little battle against my old friend Stephen Fleming.         
	Although he wont be on the field but he is a shrewd tactician and will put in all his experience for his team. Personally for me, it will be a nice experience as I have played most of my international cricket under his captaincy, said Bond who will be turning 35 this June.         
	Bond, who took three wickets from two T20 matches against Australia and nine wickets from five ODIs in the recently-concluded Chappell-Hadlee series, feels that his primary objective will be to bowl quick but not at the cost of erring in line.         
	I have had decent T20 and ODI series against Australia. I was pretty satisfied with the pace that I worked up. My job is to bowl quick. But there is very little margin for error in a T20 game. So one has to be accurate.         
	As it was a long journey for the speedster after playing the final one-dayer in Wellington, he was desperate to catch up with some sleep after touching the city. He could only catch up with his teammates in the evening.         
	I met Dav after reaching the hotel. We discussed a few points. I will also need to catch up with the boys and know them well as we will be playing together for the next month. Also I intend to sit with Sourav (Ganguly) and discuss my role, he said.         
	Someone whose career has been plagued by injuries, what is he doing on that front? Trying to be disciplined on and off the field. Follow a strict training regime.         
	Since I am not bowling 18 to 20 overs per day now, chances of getting injured are pretty less. Its not a problem bowling four overs in a T20 match or 10 overs in an ODI, he concluded.

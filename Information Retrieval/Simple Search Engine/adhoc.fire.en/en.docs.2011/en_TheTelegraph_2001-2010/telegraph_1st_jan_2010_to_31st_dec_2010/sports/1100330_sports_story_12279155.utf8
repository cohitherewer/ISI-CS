The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB in free fall
                                                                                                                       7                                        EB in free fall
                  Sanju Pradhan scored the lone goal for EB                     
	Margao: Ekene Ikenwa scored two goals as hosts Salgaocar inflicted a humiliating 4-1 defeat on East Bengal in their 18th round I-League match at the Nehru Stadium on Monday.         
	Salgaocar scored through Cajetan Fernandes (10th minute), Rouhollah Samienia (14th) and Ekene M Ikenwa (51st, 58th). The Calcutta side reduced the margin through Sanju Pradhan.         
	East Bengal, who are in danger of falling in the drop zone, fought back in both halves but failed to add to their tally after creating a handful of chances.         
	The win takes Salgaocar to 21 points from 18 matches, same as East Bengal, but the red and gold brigade are behind the Goan side in the 11th spot on goal difference.         
	Salgaocar settled down to a rhythm early in the match with their strikers and midfield linking well to make inroads into the rival half. The hosts scored two goals in a span of four minutes to put pressure on their opponents.         
	After Mehrajuddin Wadoo brought down Ekene on the left, the hardworking Francis Fernandes floated the ball into the box which was headed in by Fernandes in the 10th minute.         
	Four minutes later, Wadoo brought down Keita only for Salgaocar to be awarded another free-kick. Lestor Fernandess took a low shot that was diverted into the net by Rouhollah Samienia with a glancing header.         
	The early goals were a wake up call for the visitors, who regrouped and took control in midfield. East Bengal made a series of moves and reduced the margin in the 27th minute but not before Beingaichoo Bekhokhei wasted a couple of chances.

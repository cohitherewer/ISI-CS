The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schoeman apologises for monkey comment
                                                                                                                       7                                      Schoeman apologises for monkey comment
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: One may find it ironic that Suresh Kalmadi was jeered as he handed over a silver medal to Roland Schoeman. The South African swimmer found himself in the middle of a racial storm when he blasted the crowd for going on like monkeys. But while the former world champion was applauded for his 100m freestyle dash, the Organising Committee (OC) chairman had to endure whistles and boos.         
	Schoeman later accused the Australian media of blowing things out of proportion.         
	There has been a terrible mistake. I was really disappointed by the way the Australian media blew things up. If I knew it was a racial slur, I wouldnt have used the word (monkey). In South Africa, we use it all the time when people misbehave. And I only meant one individual. For the first time in my life I had someone scream out as we were going to start the 50m freestyle. he said after the medal ceremony.         
	The spectators have been fantastic here, he had earlier tweeted. But he did refer to the Games as a joke a day earlier, when he didnt get a towel to dry himself after he a false start.         
	Lalit Bhanot, the OC secretary general, condemned the remarks as unfortunate, because these are the friendly Games, but that was after he made yet another gaffe.         
	At first, he misunderstood the reporters question and said, There are monkeys in that area and we are trying to get them out of there. Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Mike Fennell added that racist rants would not be tolerated.         
	Meanwhile, the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) said the teams chef de mission, Patience Shikwambana, cleared Schoeman of any breach of conduct.         
	Given the media enquiries, there definitely has been a misinterpretation of what he said, Shikwambana said in a statement. Sascoc said he had been frustrated at the noise.

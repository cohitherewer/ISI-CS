The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwarys double earns 3 points
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tiwarys double earns 3 points
            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary led from the front to score 233 not out as the visitors managed to log home three points against Saurashtra, in their crucial Ranji Trophy Super League Group A encounter, at the Khanderi Stadium, on Saturday.         
	Bengal now have 12 points from six matches and would like to go for the kill against Railways in the final encounter which will be played at the Karnail Singh Stadium, in New Delhi, from Wednesday. Saurashtra, meanwhile, face the threat of being relegated to the Plate League.         
	Tiwary, who batted close to 10 hours, faced 405 deliveries while hitting 20 boundaries and two sixes. Bengal scored 569 for seven in reply to Saurashtras first innings score of 423. Tiwarys previous best was 210, against Mumbai, in the 2006-07 season.                     
	The Bengal captain continued his good work from Friday, but was also cautious in his approach as the visitors still needed 128 more runs for a first innings lead. If Tiwary deserves credit for guiding Bengal, off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri should also be praised for notching up his maiden first-class century (103 off 202 balls, 12x4, 2x6) and adding 209 runs for the seventh wicket, which proved to be decisive in the end.         
	Resuming at 295 for five  Tiwary and former Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla (45) added 66 runs for the sixth wicket and in the process safely played out the first hour.         
	I dont think that I have ever batted for 596 minutes (four minutes less than 10 hours) in any first-class match.         
	There was pressure as we needed to keep our chances of qualifying alive. I had to curb down my aggression and a play a restrained innings. I am happy that I was able to do that, Manoj said after the match.         
	He, however, termed his innings of 210 against Mumbai as his best first-class knock till date. This one is definitely satisfying but the innings against Mumbai was a better effort in my opinion, the skipper said.

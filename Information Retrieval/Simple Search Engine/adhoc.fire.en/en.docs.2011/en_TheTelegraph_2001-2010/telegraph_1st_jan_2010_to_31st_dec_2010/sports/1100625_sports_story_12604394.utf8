	Nelspruit: Australia can be proud of their World Cup, picking themselves up after a big loss in the opening match against Germany, coach Pim Verbeek said on Wednesday.         
	But ultimately that 0-4 loss cost them a place in the second round and they have only themselves to blame, he said after a 2-1 victory over Serbia in Nelspruit, as reported in Thursdays Late City edition. Tim Cahill and Brett Holman scored the goals for Australia.         
	A great result today, a great performance again but not in the final 16 ... I am disappointed, he said. I am very proud of my players and the unbelievable support of the fans.         
	 Verbeek said the Germany match was possibly the teams only bad performance of the last 25 games and they paid for that . Losing 4-0, that was not in the planning. We can only blame ourselves for this.

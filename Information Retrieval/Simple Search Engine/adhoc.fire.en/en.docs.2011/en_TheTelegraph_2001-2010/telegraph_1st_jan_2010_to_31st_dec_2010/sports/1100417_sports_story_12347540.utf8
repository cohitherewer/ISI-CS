The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan, AI play only for pride
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan, AI play only for pride
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: When a team placed sixth on the league table is pitted against one three rungs below, there is little at stake save pride. That is exactly what Mohun Bagan and Air India would be playing for when they meet in an I-league match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	Both are out of contention as far as the title race is concerned. In the current scenario, the main aim for both would be to consolidate their position on the league table.         
	While Bagan have 26 points from 19 matches, Air India have 24 after playing a match more. The green-and-maroon brigade havent won a single match after their 5-1 drubbing of Chirag and would surely be looking to get back to winning ways.         
	Coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said: We will definitely give our 100 per cent. Each and every team plays to win. Its no different for us. That is irrespective of whether we are in the fray (for the title) or not. The players realise they have their own reputations to defend. A sportsman takes pride in his or her achievements and its no different for the Bagan players.         
	However, there is some bad news for Bagan as right back Surkumar Singh is out with an injury while a double booking will keep Rakesh Masih out.         
	India international N.S. Manju may partner veteran Deepak Mondal at the heart of the defence while Zenith Genius may replace Surkumar. Surkumars absence will definitely hurt Bagan going forward as he can also double up as a right winger.         
	Saturdays encounter will also be redemption time for Jose Ramirez Barreto who is going through the most critical time in his career as a Bagan player. Having missed a penalty against Salgaocar, it has been learnt that Barreto might not take the penalty were the home team to be awarded one.         
	Meanwhile, Lajong FC will face Mahindra United in Shillong on Saturday.

  - South Australia bank on Tait to utilise pace and bounce on Durban wicket         A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Sachin Tendulkar during a practice session, in Durban                                 
	Calcutta/Durban: After a stunning loss in the tournament-opener, Sachin Tendulkars Mumbai Indians would be determined to post a win when they take on South Australia in a Champions League Twenty20 Group B match here Tuesday.         
	The Indian Premier League runners-up started their campaign in the showpiece event on a disappointing note, going down to Highveld Lions by just nine runs in Johannesburg in the first match of the tournament.         
	But Lions then fell prey to South Australia, who beat the local side by 11 runs in another keenly-contested encounter in Centurion.         
	Batting is not a worry for the Mumbai team with in-form Tendulkar opening their innings with Shikhar Dhawan, followed by experienced players like South African J P Duminy and the hard hitting West Indian Kieron Pollard coming down the order.         
	Tendulkar cracked a 62-ball 69 in the previous match and took the team close to a win but his effort went in vain as the lower middle-order failed to contribute with the bat.         
	Ambati Rayudu, who is playing at No.3, and R Satish also have to find their touch as soon as possible to help the team post a fighting score or chase down a stiff target.         
	Left-arm pacer Zaheer Khan will spearhead the Mumbai attack, while the team will also expect early breakthroughs from fast bowler Ryan McLaren.         
	Seasoned off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga can also make batsmens life miserable at the floodlit Kingsmead ground.         
	But high on confidence after starting their campaign in style, the Michael Klinger-led South Australia would put up an all-out effort to beat their Indian opponents.         
	Klinger, who top-scored for the Redbacks with 78 runs, said he thought a team like the Redbacks might have an edge over the two Indian Premier League teams, the Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Weve got them back to back in Durban, he said. Weve seen the wicket has a bit of life and a bit of bounce, which may suit us against them. Someone like Shaun Tait, whos a really quick bowler, will enjoy that wicket, and weve still got some really good quicks who havent played yet, who may be in contention for those games.         
	The Mumbai Indians are going to be a really tough battle. It was great to see the Lions knock them off the other night, and hopefully we can do the same and put them out of the competition.         
	Klinger was very happy with the performance of Callum Ferguson, who was playing his first match following knee reconstruction surgery. He and Ferguson shared a third wicket partnership of 97 off 58 runs.         
	Hes been out of action for 12 months, and for him to come out and play like that was just fantastic, said Klinger. Unfortunately, I dont think were going to see too much of him this season  hes going to be playing for Australia, I would think.         
	South Australia need a good opening partnership against the Mumbai Indians and Daniel Harris has to play his role along with skipper Klinger.         
	Tait opened the bowling attack for South Australia in the last match and scalped three wickets for 36 runs but his new-ball partner Gary Putland was not that economical.         
	 As Klinger said, the quicks will hold the key against Tendulkar and Co. on Tuesday.

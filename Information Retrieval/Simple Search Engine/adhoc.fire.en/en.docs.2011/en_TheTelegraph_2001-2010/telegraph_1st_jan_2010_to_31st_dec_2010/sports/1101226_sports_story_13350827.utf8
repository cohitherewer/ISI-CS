            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former kabaddi international Shiekh Anzar Ali, who died of heart attack in train while travelling from Nagpur to Howrah early on Friday, never bothered to have a medical check-up, his friend, colleague and former international Kishore Patra said on Saturday.         
	He used to complain of chest pain but never bothered to consult a doctor. I think the fatal heart attack could have been avoided had he consulted a doctor, Patra said from Burdwan.         
	Anzar, a national selector, was returning from Nagpur where an inter-railway meet was going on and suffered a massive heart attack in the train. Anzar was part of the 1990 Asian Games gold medal-winning team.         
	We are in a shock. Cant believe he is not there, Patra said.         
	West Bengal Kabaddi Association secretary Sujit Chakraborty said it was shocking to learn about the demise of the 45-year-old Railway employee. He was not only a nice man but an extremely talented player, Chakraborty said.         
	Anzar was born in Kalna and was residing in Ichapur before his untimely death.

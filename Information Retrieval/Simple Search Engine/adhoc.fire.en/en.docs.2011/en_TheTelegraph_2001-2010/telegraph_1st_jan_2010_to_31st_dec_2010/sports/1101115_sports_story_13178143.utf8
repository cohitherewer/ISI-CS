The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two tribunals are different: Lorgat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Two tribunals are different: Lorgat
                      
	Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) CEO Haroon Lorgat has advised the three suspended Pakistani players and their lawyers not to mix the hearings of the ICC tribunals, the one held last month and the one scheduled in January.         
	Asked about the reservations shown by the lawyers of Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer over the fact that the Chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct commission, Michael Beloff, would supervise the tribunal hearing in January, being held to look into charges against the suspended trio, Lorgat said they were separate things.         
	The lawyers have raised concerns over the presence of Beloff, pointing out that he had already supervised the hearing of the appellate tribunal in October and had dismissed the appeals of the players.         
	Lorgat said in Dubai that the outcome of the appeal hearing would have no bearing on the hearing scheduled in January.         
	The appeals hearing was held to see whether the provisional suspensions on the players were justified. It had no relevance to the charges against them, Lorgat said. In the hearing in January, the tribunal will determine whether the charges brought against the players have substance or not. It will decide if the players are guilty or not of violating the ACU Code of Conduct.         
	He insisted there should be no concern from anyone as under the ICC Code of Conduct commission rules, its Chairman had to sit in tribunal hearings.         
	The ICC tribunal comprises Michael Beloff (England), Justice Albie Sachs (South Africa) and Sharad Rao (Kenya) and will meet in Doha between January 6-11, to decide on charges of alleged breaches of the Code by the three cricketers.

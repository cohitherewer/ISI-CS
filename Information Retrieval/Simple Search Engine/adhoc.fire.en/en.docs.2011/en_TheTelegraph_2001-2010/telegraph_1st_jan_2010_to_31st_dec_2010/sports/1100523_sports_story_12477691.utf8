The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fixing talk dismissed by Aussies 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fixing talk dismissed by Aussies 
                      
	Melbourne: Shocked by speculation of match fixing during Pakistans tour here, Australias Test and ODI vice-captain Michael Clarke and former skipper Steve Waugh hoped that the devastating claims turn out to be false as they didnt sense anything fishy during the series.         
	The ICC has acknowledged that the series, especially the Sydney Test, was under the suspicion but Clarke said he is confident that nothing suspicious happened during the series.         
	The Sydney Test was a wonderful Test win. I can only talk personally. I certainly had no suspicions. Looking back it was a wonderful Test match and a huge win for us, but I certainly had no suspicions, Clarke was quoted as saying.         
	Waugh said he didnt see any deliberate under-performance in the Sydney Test, during which Pakistani wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal dropped four catches besides missing a crucial run out.         
	I thought it was a great Test match, the former captain said. I would be devastated like all sports fans, if there was an element of match-fixing to it because it was a fantastic Test. It fluctuated, and thats what Test matches are all about, to have someone come out and say it wasnt quite right, that would be very damaging to the game and also to Pakistan, he added.         
	Waugh said Australias come-from-behind victory was not unusual in any way as the world champions have proved themselves time and again.         
	First day I said if you want to see a great victory I would back Australia now because thats the sort of situation Australian cricketers like. They like to be behind the eight ball, the odds against them, and thats when they produce their best cricket, so I wasnt surprised by the end result.         
	The former captain said match-fixing is any way difficult to prove.         
	Theres a lot of mistakes made because they are human. A lot of great things happen. How you distinguish between those I dont know. Unless youve got hard evidence you are better off keeping your mouth closed because sport is like that. If its too predictable no one would watch it, Waugh said.         
	Meanwhile, Cricket Australia has sought from the ICC the details of its investigation into Pakistans tour but insisted that the series was won fair and square by the hosts.

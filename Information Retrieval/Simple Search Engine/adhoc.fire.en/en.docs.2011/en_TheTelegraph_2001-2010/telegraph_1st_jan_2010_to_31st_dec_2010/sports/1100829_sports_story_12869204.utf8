            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Dhoni                           
	Dambulla: Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes winning the International Cricket Council (ICC) awards would be a nice way to cap off what has been a remarkable year for Indian cricket.         
	Winning as many awards as possible would be a nice way to end the year Having seven nominations is a true reflection of the way we have been performing, the Team India captain told The Telegraph.         
	Seven Indians (men) have been nominated in different categories of the ICC awards to be announced in Bangalore on October 6.         
	While Team India have risen to the No. 1 spot in Test rankings this year, they are No.2 in the one-dayers (before Saturdays final).         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have been nominated in the Cricketer of the Year, Test Player of the Year and ODI Player of the Year categories, while Virat Kohli, Pragyan Ojha and Ravindra Jadeja are in the Emerging Player of the Year category. Suresh Raina has been nominated in the Best T20 Performance of the Season category.         
	Dhoni, who has been the ODI Player of the Year in the last two editions, will complete a hat-trick if he wins it this time. Would feel nice to get recognized. Hopefully         
	Frankly Im not sure who all have got nominated for the other categories It will be a big boost for any of the youngsters who get it, he said.         
	The other Indians who have won in the three main categories are Rahul Dravid (Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year, 2004) and Gautam Gambhir (Test Player of the Year, 2009).

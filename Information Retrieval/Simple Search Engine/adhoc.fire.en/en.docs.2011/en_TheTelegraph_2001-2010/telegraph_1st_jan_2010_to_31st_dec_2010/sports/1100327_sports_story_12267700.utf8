                                                                                                                       7                                        Want to learn: Chetri
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sunil Chetri                           
	New Delhi: Diminutive striker Sunil Chetri on Friday signed a contract with the Major League Soccer (MLS) side Kansas City Wizards, thus becoming the first Indian player to play in the US league.         
	Wizards, however, made it clear that Chetris contract is subject to obtaining P-1 visa and International Transfer Certificate (ITC). In addition, the Wizards still need to make room for him on their roster, which has players from 10 foreign countries.         
	The Wizards coach and technical director, Peter Vermes confirmed that the signing of Chetri gives the Wizards 10 international players  one more than their allotted nine slots. Right now we have 10 international players, but I dont see that being the case in a week or so, Vermes said.         
	Nobody has to go right now because he (Chetri) is not on the roster until his paperwork gets approved, the coach added.         
	Chetri said: Im blank, I dont really know what my role is on the team. I just want to learn, do what the coach wants me to do on the team.         
	Interestingly, the US club have recruited Chetri from Dempo Sports Club without having to pay any transfer fee. According to Dempo sources, they had to release their highest goal scorer of the season in the middle of the I-League that, too, without receiving any money because of a clause in Chetris contract with Dempo.         
	Chetri, who thanked Dempo and the AIFF during a news teleconference, said: I am happy to be in this club. I am proud to be the first Indian to get a chance to play in the MLS. I think it will take some time for me to settle down. I am quite sure that I will be able to perform well here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A milestone for Ashish Nehra
                                                                                                                       7                                        A milestone for Ashish Nehra
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Nehra                           
	Ahmedabad: He has always been considered as one of the best swing bowlers that India have produced in the past decade. However, when Ashish Nehra went into oblivion after playing his 72nd one-dayer for India back in September 2005 (against New Zealand in Harare), not many would have fancied that he would make a comeback.         
	The Delhi speedster, however, fought his way back into the national ODI side after nearly four years (June 26 last year against the West Indies) and is on the verge of a personal milestone.         
	Nehra is all set to make his 100th ODI appearance for India against South Africa, here on Friday.         
	Its obviously a great feeling to complete 100 matches for the country. But in a way, its an under-achievement on my part. I lost three seasons due to injury. In a way I feel bad as I should have played at least 175-180 ODIs like my contemporary Zaheer Khan, Nehra told The Telegraph on the eve of the third ODI.         
	One could gauge the sadness in his voice. Sehwag, Zaheer and myself played lot of cricket together. I am not comparing myself with Viru as he is batsman and batsmen dont get injured often like fast bowlers do. But I could have easily matched Zaheer in terms of ODIs. But really cant help it... Chalo theek hai. Kamse kam sau toh pure honge (At least I am completing a century of matches), said the pacer who has taken 130 wickets from 99 matches.         
	Asked whether it is a fair record for a bowler like him having played only 17 Tests ? Look, I was never out of the side because I lacked quality or I had a slump in form. It was always because of one injury or the other. For the time being, I am not even thinking of playing Test matches.

    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Inspirational quick says he wouldve loved to work with India             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    Allan Donald      
	Chittagong: Eric Simons has taken charge as Team Indias bowling consultant, but inspirational compatriot Allan Donalds name had also been doing the rounds.         
	Donald, who has been shuttling between South Africa and the UK for a number of years, spoke to The Telegraph on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	QWhat made you say that, if an offer came from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, youd consider it?         
	A Simply because of the talent which is there in India and the chance to work with gifted bowlers.         
	For now, Simons is the chosen one...         
	I wouldve loved to work with India, but thats life. Im sure there would be another chance at some point.         
	How did your experience with England, in 2007, go?         
	I didnt have hassles, it was like working in any (professional) organisation... The boys and I got along with each other and I really did enjoy the four months... The England and Wales Cricket Board offered me a two-year contract, but I declined.         
	Why?         
	Because of family reasons... At that point in time, it wouldnt have been fair on them if Id again started being on the road. That has been sorted out now.         
	Frankly, at the highest level, just how much can a bowling coach/consultant do?         
	Play the role of a motivator... Encourage the bowlers and keep dropping little notes every now and then... Of course, a coach or consultant is also a technical sounding board and can definitely play a crucial role.         
	With specialist coaches being employed by every team, why have a general coach? Arent they becoming somewhat redundant?         
	These days, I think the head coach has his hands full... I also feel its important for him to be surrounded by people having knowledge... He can bounce ideas off them... Modern-day cricket, dont forget, has changed quite a bit. The likes of John Buchanan and Duncan Fletcher had good people around them.         
	You worked with Sreesanth at Warwickshire last summer. What was that experience like?         
	Id recommended Sreesanths name as he has awesome talent... Sure, hes done a few silly things, but that shouldnt be held against him as hes capable of firing up the team... Can ignite... He didnt take a whole bag of wickets, but bowled well and was great in the dressing room.         
	So, you didnt find Sreesanth temperamental?         
	I did tell him that I didnt like his training habits... I gave him honest advice, told him he must control his emotions... Hes quite hyped up and it can become difficult if, on the field, emotions take over...         
	What else did you tell Sreesanth?         
	That if he lost his cool, hed be letting his captain and himself down... I found him responsive.         
	Did you expect Sreesanth to make such an impact-making comeback to international cricket  getting a fiver in the first innings of the Kanpur Test against Sri Lanka and being adjudged the MoM?         
	Wasnt surprised... Sreesanth was hungry and had promised that hed soon be back in the India dressing room... Hes the positive sort... Personally, Id thought his comeback could take some time.         
	Where does Sreesanth need to improve?         
	Get better with his training methods... He needs to be particular even about small things... Training is a very important part of any sportsmans career. In fact, the training ground is the biggest area for development... Even doing the push-ups properly is important.         
	How do you rate the other India quicks, Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma?         
	Ive been quite a fan of Ishants... Hes been through a lot lately, but I expect him to get better with experience... He excites me... Zaheer has been around for quite a few years... I see that hes happy to take responsibility and doesnt let the team down... Hes happy playing the senior bowler. He doesnt have great pace, but manages both the new and old balls well.         
	Is it the end of the road for Makhaya Ntini?         
	The change of guard has taken place... Makhaya has been struggling... The tank is empty and its time for him to move on.         
	Dale Steyn is seen as your worthy successor...         
	He is, indeed... I hope he goes on to take 450-500 wickets... Steyn, Morne Morkel, Friedel de Wet... In the near future, our attack will be built around them.         
	One is surprised that Cricket South Africa hasnt used your services. Why have you not been involved?         
	Dont know... Youve thrown a difficult question... I dont know whether my media commitments have been a factor... The bowlers have been doing well, though... Seem to be working well with (bowling coach) Vincent Barnes.         
	 Lastly... A number of teams have a good pace attack. Your choice for No.1?         
	(Laughs) I agree... Its difficult picking the best... Pakistan, South Africa, Australia... There are other teams too. Whats pleasing for me is that there are so many with talent in the business of bowling fast.

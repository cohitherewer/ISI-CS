The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haye faces Ukrainian challenge 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haye faces Ukrainian challenge 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Brothers Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko have issued a joint statement saying they will fight Britains world champion David Haye in 2011.         
	Wladimir holds three of the current world heavyweight belts, Vitali one and Haye the other.         
	A fight between the 30-year-old Londoner and one of the Ukrainians has been in the offing for a long time, with Haye having already withdrawn from a 2009 bout with Wladimir due to a back injury.         
	But, after Wladimirs fight with Dereck Chisora was called off 10 days ago owing to injury, the showdown has once again risen to the top of the agenda - and the Klitschkos have now given the clearest indication yet that an agreement is imminent.         
	We promise that in 2011 the fight against Haye will come, read the statement, released through Bild.de.         
	We want this fight at all costs. He may choose against which of us he wants us to step into the ring to lose his world title.         
	Vitali had said, on Tuesday, that his brother was ready to take on the Londoner, prompting Hayes manager Adam Booth to respond: We are now perfectly positioned to get together and make this fight with Wladimir Klitschko.         
	Despite the fact we know we bring more UK television money to the table, David and I are happy to split the entire pot 50-50 and grant Wladimir the deal he has wanted since day one, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Final one of the best moments: Bopanna
                                                                                                                       7                                      Final one of the best moments: Bopanna
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: After sending out peace messages, it was time for some tennis. Though they lost their maiden Grand Slam final, Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi showed, on Friday, that their racquets too can do a bit of talking.         
	The Indo-Pak Express went down 6-7 (5) 6-7 (4) to the worlds No.1 pair, American twins Bob and Mike Bryan, in the mens doubles final of the US Open.         
	It was the Bryan twins third title at the Flushing Meadows, following their wins in 2005 and 2008, and their ninth Slam together, which put them second in the all-time list behind the legendary Australians Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge who have 11 majors to their name.         
	As the scores suggest, it was a closely fought encounter in which Bopanna and Qureshi were hardly outplayed. In fact, the 16th seeds were never broken in the match and had the only break point in the third game of the first set.         
	Nothing went wrong. They played good points, served well and came up with good shots at crucial moments in the game, Bopanna said via a conference call from New York after the match.         
	The wind was there throughout the two weeks, so to say it was a major factor today would be wrong. We tried hard, our level best. All credit goes to them for pulling off the big shots at the right time.         
	It was the Bryans big match experience which proved to be a decisive factor, particularly in the two tie-breaks where the Indo-Pak duo let slip a minor advantage.         
	Aisam and I generally play great at tie breaks. So far thats normally been our strength. They had the upper hand in this match. They had great reflex and thats what made the difference, the 30-year-old Indian said.         
	Irrespective of the result, nothing was going to stop the pair from celebrating. Basically the whole experience was unforgettable, we have to now believe that we can beat the top teams, Qureshi said.         
	With wins against some of the top 10 teams this hard court season, including beating the Bryans in Washington, we have a lot of positives. This being our first Slam final and us pushing the Bryans all the way, I think the credit goes to us!         
	This (maiden Grand Slam final) is one of our best moments ever, Bopanna added.         
	The Indo-Pak partnership has been the talking point the whole summer and the two countries ambassadors to the United Nations were present to watch the final, as they did during the semi-finals.         
	Bopanna clarified that although they had carried banners reading Stop War, Start Tennis at tournaments, they were not trying to make any political statements.         
	Qureshi rued the interference of politics in sports. No politics or religion should ever come in to sports. I feel cricket is affected because of the strong political aspect to it, he said.         
	Both countries have cricket loving people and only political reasons are stopping the teams from not playing each other. I remember when India toured Pakistan, they had great support. The atmosphere was unbelievable. I really hope the governments keep political aspects out of sports.         
	Come October, the two may be seen on opposing sides of the court during the Commonwealth Games. We are professionals, we know that we will both try our best. Its a part of the game and will not cause any differences between us as teammates or friends, said Qureshi.

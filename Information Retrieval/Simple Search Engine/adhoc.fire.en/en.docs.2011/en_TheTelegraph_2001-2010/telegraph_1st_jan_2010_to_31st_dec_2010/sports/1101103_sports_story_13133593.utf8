            OUR BUREAU AGENCIES            Gavaskar                           
	Calcutta/New Delhi: The payment dispute between Sunil Gavaskar and the BCCI took an ugly turn on Tuesday with the former India captain hitting out at the board for not paying him for his role in the IPL governing council.         
	Gavaskar, who was not included in the governing council in September, claimed he had not been paid for the past three years. But BCCI president Shashank Manohar and secretary N. Srinivasan rubbished it, saying it was not factually correct.         
	The BCCI did not give any reason for Gavaskars ouster from the IPL governing council during its AGM in September, but there were reports that it could be a result of the payment dispute.         
	Gavaskar created a flutter by stating that he had not been paid for the past three years, which forced him to send a gentle reminder about the non-payment to the BCCI.         
	I am yet to be paid by the BCCI for my role on the IPL governing council. I have not been paid at all by the BCCI, since I took on the offer. All I have been doing is that sending a gentle reminder about the non-payment... I am just reminding them of what was offered to me, Gavaskar said.         
	I have just been told that Sharad Pawar (ICC president) will organise a meeting between Manohar and me in his presence to sort out the matter and that for me is good enough, he said.         
	The BCCI president, however, said that he wasnt aware of any such meeting and no appointment had been sought.         
	Manohar and Srinivasan insisted that the former India captain had been paid as per the contract. Asked whether there was a miscommunication , Srinivasan said: There is no misunderstanding. I am just stating the facts.         
	On whether Gavaskar had asked for Rs 20 crore for his five-year term , Srinivasan said: He had sent a mail to the BCCI president mentioning that amount. It was placed in the AGM, but since there was no prior agreement or any understanding, it was not paid. The BCCI had not made any commitment.         
	We had a contract with him for Rs one crore plus taxes and weve paid that to him, he added.

	New Delhi: East Bengal continued their dream run in the current season by defeating Air India 4-1 in their opening group D match of the Durand Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium on Saturday.         
	Down by a 14th minute goal, the red and gold brigade hit back in style to notch up their 17th back-to-back victory. All the Federation Cup champions need now to reach the semi-finals is a draw against Salgaocar in their next match.         
	While Turkey-born Australian striker Tolgay Ozebe scored twice, Ekene Ekenewa and Penn Orji got the other two goals in a match that was mostly dominated by the Calcutta side.         
	The good number of East Bengal fans who came to cheer their favourite side were shocked to see the Mumbai team taking the lead through Yousuf Ibrahim, who headed in a long throw-in from Uttam Singh.         
	East Bengal took time to settle down but once they had the proceedings under control, the Air India defence could do little to contain their rivals.         
	Conceding the goal was the turning point of the match, said a pleased East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan later. Initially, they were pressing us a lot and were forcing us to commit mistakes. Once we could weather the storm, things became easier, he said.         
	All said and done, East Bengal looked rudderless till they could score the equaliser a minute before the half time, when Tolgay headed in a flag kick from Mehtab Hossain after Robin Singhs swift backheader caught the defence on the wrong foot.         
	For the rest of the first session, East Bengal were unsure in the midfield and never looked the team that has not even drawn a match throughout the season.         
	However, the 16-time winners were a transformed lot in the second half. They attacked in waves and came close to scoring several times in the first 20 minutes.         
	Yet, they had to wait till the 71st minute to take the lead through Tolgay again. It was Penn Orji, who did all the hard work to pave the way for Tolgays second strike.         
	He chased down defender Amritpal Singh on the left and snatched the ball to cross it for Tolgay to push in with a deft left-footed touch.         
	Since Salgaocar had earlier beaten Air India 3-1 in the three-team group, East Bengal supporters were hoping for a better result to be placed favourably in the group.         
	Their prayers were answered in the last two minutes when Penn and substitute Ekene struck in quick succession to complete the rout.         
	In the days first match, JCT bla-nked Sporting Clube de Goa 3-0 with Daniel Bidemi (2) and Ajay Singh, the only Indian player to get his name in the scoresheet on Saturday.         
	On Sunday, Churchill Brothers will play Army Red and Chirag United will clash against Pune FC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jagtar likely to replace Jeje
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jagtar likely to replace Jeje
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After losing to Kuwait 0-2 in the opener, India are planning to adopt defensive tactics when they play defending champions Qatar in the Asian Games group D match at Guangzhou on Tuesday.         
	Coached by former Senegal tactician Bruno Metsu, Qatar are regarded as one of the best teams in the under-23 competition, but were surprisingly held to a goalless draw against Singapore in their first match.         
	Against Kuwait, we played an open game, but that may not be our tactics against Qatar, said Indias chief coach Sukhwinder Singh. Qatar are a good team and we should guard our citadel first before going for counter attacks, he said.         
	In Tuesdays match, India are likely to make only one change from the team that played against Kuwait. Striker Jeje Lalpeknlua, who was not at his best, may have to make way for Jagtar Singh.         
	Jagtar is also good in falling back and supporting the midfield, Sukhwinder said. However, we will take a final decision on this in the (Tuesday) morning, the coach added.         
	The top two from each group and four of the best third-placed teams advance to the round of 16. India are in group D along with defending champions Qatar, Kuwait and Singapore.

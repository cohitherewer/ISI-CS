                                                                                                                       7                                      Indias warm-up ties vs Australia, NZ 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian team will play two warm-up matches before the start of the World Cup next year. According to a media release issued by the International Cricket Council (ICC), 14 warm-up matches will be played across the three host countries from February 12 to 18.         
	India will play Australia on February 13 in Bangalore and New Zealand on February 16 in Chennai. The other venues where matches will be played are Nagpur, Chittagong, Dhaka, Colombo and Pallekele in Kandy.         
	Reigning world champions Australia will take on South Africa February 15 apart from playing India. Sri Lanka, the 1996 winner and one of the co-hosts, will meet the Netherlands and the West Indies on February 12 and 16, in Pallekele and Colombo, respectively. Pakistan will meet Bangladesh and England in Dhaka on February 15 and 18, respectively.         
	ICC president Sharad Pawar believes that next years event will turn out to be the most successful. The start of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 is exactly six months away, he said. Let there be no doubt whatsoever that the ICC, along with the three co-hosts, will ensure that the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 is the best of all the World Cups staged so far.         
	Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal who is supporting the parent bodys flagship event cant wait for February 19 when his side will take on India in the tournament opener.         
	This will be my second ICC Cricket World Cup but definitely the one I am longing for. We have the opportunity to make the country proud, said the left-hander. Tamim was part of the side which defeated India by five wickets in the last edition of the event in Port of Spain.         
	Sri Lankas legendary off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan not only rated his record 800 Test wickets as high as being a World Cup winner but also credited the 1996 glory for transforming him into a better cricketer.         
	Obviously winning the tournament in the Indian sub-continent in 1996 is something I rate as highly as my 800 Test wickets and reaching the final in the West Indies three years ago was also by no means a small achievement.         
	Meanwhile, to commemorate the six months to go milestone, the ICC announced that several exciting ticket packages are available from Thursday on its website iccevents.yahoo.com.

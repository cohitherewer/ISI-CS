The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goal relief for Wayne
                                                                                                                       7                                        Goal relief for Wayne
                  Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring, on Wednesday                     
	London: Holders Inter Milan earned their coach a reprieve to lead a group of seven teams through to the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday, a night lit up by Lionel Messis customary finesse and Wayne Rooneys goalscoring return.         
	While Inter secured a nervous 1-0 win at home to Twente Enschede, a result that will come as a huge relief to Rafa Benitez, and Manchester United were grateful for Rooneys late penalty for a 1-0 victory at Rangers, Barcelona showed effortless command in beating Panathinaikos 3-0.         
	The last three Champions League winners were joined by Valencia, Tottenham Hotspur, Olympique Lyon and Schalke 04 in securing their places in the next round, meaning there is just one remaining place up for grabs in Groups A-D.         
	Valencia tore Bursaspor apart 6-1 to go through along with United, Tottenham made light work of Werder Bremen in a 3-0 win at White Hart Lane in Inters group and Schalke beat Olympique Lyon by the same scoreline, sending both sides through.         
	AC Milan and Olympique Marseille secured their qualification on Tuesday to join Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Real Madrid, who had already made certain of their places.         
	With one round of matches to go, 12 of the 16 teams for the next round are now known, with most of the tournament heavyweights already having done enough.         
	Messis Barcelona were easily the most impressive of that elite group on Wednesday, although coach Pep Guardiola was at pains to play down the performance.         
	United struggled to create clear chances before Rooney, making his first start since suffering an ankle problem in September, converted the late spot kick, meaning they keep a three-point lead over Valencia at the top of Group C with a match at home to the Spanish side to come.         
	Inter looked nervous against modest Twente in Group A before Wesley Sneijders free kick was deflected into the path of Esteban Cambiasso, who calmly fired home from inside the box on 55 minutes to thrill a half-empty stadium.         
	Reports had said the Spaniard could be sacked if they lost against the Dutch champions but Benitez can now rest a little easier.         
	When we are in difficulty like we have been this week, I dont read the papers or watch the TV, weve just concentrated on the job in hand, Benitez told a news conference before being asked if he had seen club president Massimo Moratti.  
	Wednesday rsquo;s results  
	 Group A: Tottenham Hotspur 3 Werder Bremen 0; Inter Milan 1 Twente Enschede 0; Group B: Hapoel Tel Aviv 3 Benfica 0; Schalke 04 3 Olympique Lyon 0; Group C: Valencia 6 Bursaspor 1; Manchester United 1 Rangers 0; Group D: Barcelona 3 Panathinaikos 0; Rubin Kazan 1 FC Copenhagen 0   (REUTERS)

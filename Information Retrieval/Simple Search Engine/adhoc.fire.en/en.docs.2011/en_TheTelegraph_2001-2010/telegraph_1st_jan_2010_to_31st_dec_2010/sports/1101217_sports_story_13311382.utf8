The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ryan sets world record
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ryan sets world record
                  Ryan Lochte                     
	Dubai: Ryan Lochte, on Thursday, set the first individual swimming world record since high-tech bodysuits were outlawed.         
	The American won the 400-metre individual medley at the short-course world championships in three minutes, 55.50 seconds, smassshing the previous record set by Laszlo Cseh of Hungary a year ago by nearly two seconds.         
	While Chinas womens squad set a world record in the 800-metre freestyle relay, on Wednesday, no other world marks  none in the long-course pool  have been set in 2010, with the bodysuit ban installed at the beginning of the year. By contrast, in 2008 and 2009, nearly every record in the sport was broken multiple times.         
	Olympic 1,500-metre champion Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia finished second, a distant 1.90 seconds behind, and Tyler Clary of the US was third, 2.06 seconds back.         
	The victory marked Lochtes second consecutive individual gold of the meet after opening with a victory, on Wednesday, in the 200-metre freestyle.         
	The rubberised bodysuits that revolutionised swimming the past two years ended up rewriting the record books almost completely.         
	Of the 32 current long-course world records, all but four of them were set in 2009  and only one  Grant Hacketts mark in the 1,500-metre freestyle from 2001  came before 2008.         
	In the shorter 25-metre pool, all but 10 of the 42 world marks were set in 2009 entering this meet; and at the last short-course worlds in Manchester, England, two years ago, a whopping 18 world records were set.         
	Numbers like these prompted swimming governing body Fina to ban rubberised suits at the start of 2010 and limit men to wearing suits covering the waists down only to the knees. Womens suits must now be sleeveless and not go beyond the knees.           (AGENCIES)

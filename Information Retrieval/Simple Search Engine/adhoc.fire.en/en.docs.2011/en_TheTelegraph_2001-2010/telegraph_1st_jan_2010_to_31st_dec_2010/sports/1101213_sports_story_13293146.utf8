The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL contract likely to   hurt players purse
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL contract likely to   hurt players purse
                                  
	Wellington: The fresh Indian Premier League (IPL) players contract has several clauses disadvantageous to the cricketers and the take-home pay of those who sign it could be reduced to as little as 50 per cent of the signing amount, a report said Sunday.         
	A report in Sunday Star Times said the player agreement of this season differs substantially from that in the first three years and New Zealands leading cricketers could earn just 50 per cent of what they sell for at the auction likely to be held in February.         
	New Zealand Cricket Players Association boss Heath Mills has reviewed a draft version of the playing agreement and raised a number of concerns with the Black Caps players who have put their names forward.         
	The two-page document stipulates that if the players are bought by big-spending franchises at the auction, they will be committed to signing a playing agreement for the next three years.         
	In the original contract, players received the majority of their fee they have been bought at, whether they played or not as long as they were available for their franchises.         
	In the new contract, according to the newspaper, 20 per cent of a players salary will be withheld and paid only if his team is one of the three that qualify for the Champions League from the Indian competition.

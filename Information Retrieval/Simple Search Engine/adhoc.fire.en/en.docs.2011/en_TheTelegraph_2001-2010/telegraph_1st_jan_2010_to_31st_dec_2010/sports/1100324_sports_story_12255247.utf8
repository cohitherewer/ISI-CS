            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for breaching the Code of Conduct during the second Test between Bangladesh and England, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday.         
	Siddons went to see Match Referee Jeff Crowe to express his frustration after spinner Abdur Razzak was denied an lbw appeal against Englands Matt Prior during the third days play.         
	The coach later criticised the umpires publicly for denying Bangladesh at least three confident appeals on the third day. Siddons was charged with a Level 1 offence under article 2.1.3 of the Code, which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision during an international match.

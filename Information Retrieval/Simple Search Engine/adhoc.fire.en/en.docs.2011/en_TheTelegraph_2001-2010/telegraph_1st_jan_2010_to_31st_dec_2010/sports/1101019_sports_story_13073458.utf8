The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poonia is game for Samuels challenge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Poonia is game for Samuels challenge
                      
	New Delhi: Commonwealth Games gold medallist discus thrower Krishna Poonia is not aware of any $20,000 winner-takes-all contest with world champion Dani Samuels of Australia, but she is ready for it if it materialises, her husband said on Monday.         
	Australian media reports said Samuels was hurt by Poonias pre-Games comment that her poor form was the reason behind her pull out from the just-concluded CWG and she now wants a revenge match.         
	A sponsor has offered $20,000 winner-takes-all, making it the biggest cash prize for a discus event in the world. The prestigious Diamond League offers $10,000 prize money Well, weve doubled that to give Poonia her shot at the champ, Australian media quoted Samuelss coach Denis Knowles as saying.         
	Poonias husband and coach Virendra said they have not been contacted for such a contest so far but are ready for it provided the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) agrees to it.         
	We have not been contacted as yet But we are are ready if such a contest is happening, Virendra said from Jaipur.         
	We are leaving for NIS Patiala to train for next months Asian Games. We have to take permission from the AFI if a proposal for such a contest is there, he said.         
	Krishna had beaten Samuels at a competition at Salinas, in California, United States in 2008. So, we are ready for such a contest, he added.         
	The Australian media reports said Sydney Olympic Parks world-class athletic centre would host the contest and Samuelss coach said he would appoint an agent to secure Indian television coverage of the duel.         
	Poonias throw of 61.51m not only made her the first Indian track-and-field athlete to win a Commonwealth gold medal in 52 years, but also she became the first Indian woman to win a CWG gold.         
	During the CWG, Poonia threw despite having a knee swelling.         
	Poonia has a personal best of 63.69m, which she did in April while Samuels has a best of 65.84m which she threw in February.         
	The CWG gold medallist had said that she needs to work on her fitness and develop the muscles of her lower body.         
	Poonia is, however, hopeful of a medal in the Asian Games, in November. She had claimed that she was at par with the other throwers of the world. Not only is she aiming for an Asian medal, but her long term plan also includes an Olympic medal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi rattled by Railways
                                                                                                                       7                                      Delhi rattled by Railways
                                  
	New Delhi: A distinct lack of application by the Delhi batsmen helped Sanjay Bangar-led Railways win an exciting sixth round Ranji Trophy Super League Group A encounter by 22 runs, at the Roshanara Club ground, on Saturday.         
	Chasing a modest victory target of 136, the Delhi batsmen failed to show any stomach for fight on a seaming track as they were shot out for 113 in only 44.2 overs.         
	The result is pretty awkward for Delhi considering the fact their opener Unmukt Chand scored 151 in the first innings and new-ball bowler Sumit Narwal had taken seven wickets in the an innings.         
	The defeat means that Delhi, who stay put on 13 points, will now have to grab as many points as they can against defending champions Mumbai in their last group league match.

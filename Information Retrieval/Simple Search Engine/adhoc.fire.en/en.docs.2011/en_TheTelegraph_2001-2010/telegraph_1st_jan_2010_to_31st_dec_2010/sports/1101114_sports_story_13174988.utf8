            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its a rare phenomenon when there are no sparks before a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal derby final. Even though the city giants face off in an invitational meet (Platinum Jubilee Cup), there was tension following a dispute over the teams to be fielded by the clubs before Sundays summit clash. The tiff began after East Bengal wanted to register two players, reportedly Mehtab Hossian and foreigner Uga Okapara, for Sundays final.         
	They have no right to bend rules like this just before the final, said Bagan official Debasish Dutta. Both clubs met for a meeting later in the evening where the Indian Football Association (IFA) ruled that East Bengal would have to continue with the same set.         
	We accept the decision, but it felt unfair since this has happened before in tournaments like Durand Cup. said EB secretary Santosh Bhattacharya.

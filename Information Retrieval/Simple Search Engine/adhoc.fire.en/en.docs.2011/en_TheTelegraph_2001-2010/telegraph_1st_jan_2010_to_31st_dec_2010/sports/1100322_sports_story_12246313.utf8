The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi: Was all about nerves
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvi: Was all about nerves
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: The Kings XI Punjabs winless streak in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) finally came to an end on Sunday when they beat the Chennai Super Kings in their own den.         
	The Punjab sides first triumph in four matches came via the Super Over as chasing the Super Kings 136 for eight, Kumar Sangakkaras boys were tied at the same score losing seven wickets. Requiring 10 runs for their maiden victory in the Super Over, Kings XIs winning run was scored when Yuvraj Singh reverse-swept Muttiah Muralidharan to the boundary.         
	Sangakkara picked Matthew Haydens dismissal, during the post-match presentation, as the turning point of the match while IPL debutant Juan Theron of South Africa walked away with the Man of the Matchs trophy for his miserly spell.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sangakkara: It wasnt pretty We got ourselves into a difficult position. But the bowlers performed brilliantly to restrict them (Chennai Super Kings) (Matthew) Haydens wicket was the turning point. With him dismissed, you can bowl a lot more dot balls to the other batsmen. In T20s, once the run rate is in 6-7s, you are in with a chance. Im very proud with the way the team responded. We didnt play according to our potential, but we want to enjoy this win, especially after three losses on the trot.         
	Suresh Raina: It was a good game of cricket. The target was chaseable but we didnt bat well in the middle overs. Parthiv (Patel) batted well, but should have stayed more at the crease. But Im happy at the boys performance and its not really the end of the road. With our batsmen doing well and our body language upbeat, we are not worried.         
	Theron: I didnt expect to experience such a game (in my first IPL match). The excitement and passion surrounding cricket in India is unbelievable. Keeping things simple is the key to successful bowling in T20s. If you get hit, its either your mistake or its a good shot from the batsman. So, one should keep it simple.         
	Yuvraj: We needed a win badly after three successive loses. We bowled well today (Sunday), especially at the death. It was all about nerves Cricket is a funny game and we knew we had a chance. We stuck to our task. Hopefully we will win a few games from here on.

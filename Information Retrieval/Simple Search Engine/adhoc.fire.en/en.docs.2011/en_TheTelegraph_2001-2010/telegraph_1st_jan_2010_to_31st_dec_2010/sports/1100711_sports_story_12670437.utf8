The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spaniards have the talent to wow world
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spaniards have the talent to wow world

	This World Cup has been an enjoyable tournament but not yet an epic one. South Africa 2010 will always be remembered for the wonderful fans, and for how the hosts laid on a magical party from Cape Town to Durban, Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg, but it desperately needs a memorable final to be considered a truly stellar event.         
	After the nadir of Italia 90, when the average was 2.21 goals per game, the lowest ever, USA 94 saw the average rise to 2.71 but it has declined steadily ever since. France 98 saw 2.67, Japan/South Korea 2.52 and Germany 2.30. (The peak was 5.38 in Switzerland in 1954).         
	With two games remaining, the tally is 139, the average is 2.24 and eight goals are required to reach the 147 of 2006. If both games squeeze out only two goals then South Africa 2010 will statistically be the worst World Cup for goals ever. The Jabulani ball can expect another kicking.         
	On the pitch, the tournament has not been graced by a superstar, certainly no one to compare with a Diego Maradona in 1986 or Ronaldo in 2002. This has been the tournament of the team, of well-coached units like Holland and Spain, Germany and Uruguay. It has been the World Cup of tactics, of systems like 4-2-3-1, of young ideas and the death of old teams like England, France and Italy, who seemed to think they had entered a Veterans competition.         
	For all the frustration at the low goal returns and the absence of a player who deserves naming rights to a World Cup, troupes of good performers have toured the fine South African stages. On Friday, Fifas Technical Study Group released the 10-strong list of candidates for the Golden Ball and even the serially cantankerous would struggle to take issue with nine.         
	Wesley Sneijder has been elegantly effective in compiling his five goals for Holland, matching the return of David Villa, such a threat when cutting in from Spains left. Two others, Diego Forlan and Asamoah Gyan, also play with a smile, a dynamism and an eye for goal.         
	Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Mesut Oezil have treated the ball as a friend, ushering it towards friendly feet in the danger zone. Bastian Schweinsteiger has been liberated by Michael Ballacks unfortunate injury and charged between boxes. Like Sneijder, the pacy, technical Arjen Robben will test Spain.         
	But Lionel Messi? The main plotline of this 2010 drama is that the leading lights, Messi and Kaka, Ronaldo and Rooney, have not shone. Messi has sparkled in parts but he is not deserving of top 10 status, particularly when Thomas Mueller has been limited to the young player category.         
	Xavi, Villa and Sneijder appear the main candidates and a bravura display from one in Soccer City will surely seal a World Cup winners medal and the best player trophy. Lets just hope that nerves are left in the tunnel, that all seize the moment to lay on a spectacle.         
	For those more used to watching England it will be a pleasure and a privilege to admire how Xavi, Iniesta and Xabi Alonso circulate the ball for Spain, and observe how such heavyweight, occasionally bruiser-weight sentries as Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong seek to deny them.         
	We will have to break their midfield and stop their playmakers from playing, said Van Bommel.         
	Each player will have his private motivation. For Van Bommel it will be the hurt of losing the Champions League final. For Dirk Kuyt it will be the memory of his father, my biggest fan, who passed away three years ago, the anniversary of which fell a week ago. For Gio van Bronckhorst it will be his final game. Spain certainly have enough players to make it a final to remember, and a World Cup never to be forgotten.

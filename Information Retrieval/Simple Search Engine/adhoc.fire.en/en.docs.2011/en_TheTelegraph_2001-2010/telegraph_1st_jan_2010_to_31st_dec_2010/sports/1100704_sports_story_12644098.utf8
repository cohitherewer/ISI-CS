	Pennsylvania: Overnight joint leader Arjun Atwal slipped to tied 14th after carding a disappointing two-over 72 in the second round of the AT amp;T Nationals golf Tournament here.         
	The Orlando-based Indian, who is playing on a sponsors exemption from good friend and practice partner Tiger Woods, has a two-day total of two-under 138.         
	Off the blocks with a birdie, Atwal was pulled back by bogeys on the fourth, seventh and eighth. On his way back, Atwal fetched one birdie against a bogey to sign off a modest day.         
	Englands Justin Rose shot the best score of the tournament Friday, a 6-under 64, to build a one-shot lead over Australian Jason Day and Charlie Wi.         
	Rose won his first PGA Tour event last month at the Memorial, and was poised to win again in the Travelers Championship last week until losing a three-shot lead in a disastrous final round.         
	Woods, who won this tournament last year at Congressional, hit the ball well for the second straight day. He again got nothing out of it, however, and missed a 30-inch putt late in the round to finish with a 70. He was at 3-over 143, which made the cut on the number, although he was never in serious danger of going home early.         
	Im driving it on a string right now, and thats fun, Woods said. But if you dont make putts, no matter how good you hit the golf ball, youre not going to shoot good scores.         
	The scoring improved slightly in the second round, especially in the afternoon as the wind began to calm at Aronimink Golf Club. Rose said his round was helped by being in the same group with Sean Hair (68) and J.B. Holmes (69), who also played well. They combined for 13 birdies and only one bogey over the 54 holes they played collectively.         
	For Rose, the timing could not have been better. In his first tournament since winning the Memorial by closing with a 66, Rose had a three-shot lead at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut, when it all fell apart. He shot 39 on the back nine for a 75 and tied for ninth.         
	I turned up here Monday morning feeling like I was a better player than I was on Sunday, because you learn, he said. My game doesnt go away overnight. You have an experience like that, and if you ask yourself the right questions and if you deal with it in the right way, you become better.         
	It might have been different had he not just won his first title in America. That allowed him to take the collapse in stride, and he hit his stride Friday on another gorgeous afternoon outside Philadelphia.         
	He never had a par putt longer than 5 feet, and he seized the outright lead late in his round with a 30-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th, making it two straight weeks with the 36-hole lead. The idea how is close better.         
	Woods is nowhere near the lead, even if it looked as though he would get right in the mix.         
	Morning wind kept anyone from putting together a good score, and when Woods finally found some momentum with back-to-back birdies on the third and fourth holes  the latter with a 30-foot birdie putt  he was at 1 over and closing it on his goal of getting back to even par for the tournament. Then came a shot that covered the flag and landed 5 feet away.         
	The trouble was, Woods was trying to land his 7-iron on the par-3 fifth about 15 short of the hole because the green was so firm. It hopped hard and went into the rough behind the green. With a delicate chip, he advanced it only about 10 feet, still in the rough, then chipped some 7 feet past the hole and had to make that for bogey.

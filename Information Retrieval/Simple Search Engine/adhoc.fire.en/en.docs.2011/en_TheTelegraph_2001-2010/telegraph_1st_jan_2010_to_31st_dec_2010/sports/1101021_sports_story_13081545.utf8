The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian track on course: Ecclestone
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian track on course: Ecclestone
                      
	New Delhi: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone Wednesday said that the Indian Grand Prix track at Noida was well on course for completion for next years race and it would not be a cause of concern like the controversy-marred build-up to the Commonwealth Games.         
	Ecclestone, who paid a visit to the track, said the progress of the construction at the track was even more than what he had thought.         
	I dont want to praise what I have seen. If the race is going to be held next month I am happy to say that it will be there. So the conditions are very happy (about the track). I have no fears about the circuit. We can do justice to the Indians, he said, here on Wednesday.         
	The Indian GP is scheduled for October 30 next year.         
	After the (negative) reports of the build-up to the Commonwealth Games, people told me to be careful, but I am so happy about the progress of work. It is going to be much better than many tracks. It is a very creative track. It will give India a chance to showcase its people, he added.         
	He hoped Formula One will be successful in India but said he would want a regular Indian driver in Force India or a good team so that people come out in large numbers to watch the race.

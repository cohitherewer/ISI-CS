The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India face an uphill task
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team India face an uphill task
                      
	Galle: The Indians have to produce something special to save the first Test against Sri Lanka with spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan having scalped six already in his farewell match to put his team within sniffing distance of victory.         
	Asked to follow on, the Indians were struggling at 181 for five at stumps on an eventful penultimate day, still 63 runs short in their bid avoid the embarrassment of an innings defeat.         
	Murali claimed five for 63 in the first innings and added another wicket in the second to be just two shy of the 800-wicket mark as India were skittled out for 276 in their first innings in response to the hosts total of 520 for eight declared.         
	The visitors lost Gautam Gambhir (0) and first innings centurion Virender Sehwag (31) early and it took the experienced duo of Rahul Dravid (44) and Sachin Tendulkar (84) to bring some relief with a 119-run partnership.         
	But Lasith Malingas dismissals of Dravid and Tendulkar at fag end of day means Sri Lanka are once more in control. To make matters worse, Yuvraj Singh (5) perished just before close of play to leave India staring into an abyss.         
	With one day remaining in the rain-hit Test, the Indians will have to bat out of their skins to save the match. Much will depend on V.V.S. Laxman and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and how long they are able to hold fort on Thursday.         
	India had largely relied on Sehwag, who hit his 20th Test century, and with Yuvraj Singh (52) and Dhoni (33) was responsible for most of the scoring in the first innings.         
	Earlier, resuming at an overnight 140 for three, the Indians lost wickets at regular intervals to allow the home team to dictate terms.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Jyoti hits 5-under
                      
	Gurgaon: Ace Indian golfer Jyoti Randhawa shot a clinical five-under 67 to emerge as the leader after round one of the DLF Masters 2010 golf tournament, on Thursday.         
	Defending champion Gaganjeet Bhullar, Himmat Singh Rai and Karanjit Singh Sandhu fired identical four-under 68 to lie in tied second place at the DLF Golf and Country Club.         
	Randhawa, the two-time DLF Masters champion, got off to a flying start at his home course, as he made six birdies against a lone bogey.         
	Randhawa made birdies on the 12th, 16th, 17th and a bogey on the 13th to be two-under at the turn. He consolidated further on the front nine with birdies on the first, fourth and sixth. This is a very good start to the tournament. I have been playing in Europe for the last few weeks so in that context I feel I adapted to the conditions pretty quickly, Randhawa said.         
	Bhullar birdied the second, ninth, 15th and 18th holes to bring home a bogey-free 68 to be tied second and he said it was a good start to the tournament. Its a good start to the tournament and gives me a great launch-pad for the rest of the week, Bhullar said.         
	Himmat Singh Rai and Karanjit Singh Sandhu, both from the DLF Golf and Country Club, joined Bhullar in tied second place as they too shot scores of 68, thanks to some brilliant hitting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Consolation win for Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Consolation win for Pakistan
                      
	Christchurch: Pakistan humiliated New Zealand in the third and final Twenty20 international in Christchurch on Thursday as the Black Caps slumped to their lowest ever total in the ultra-short form of the game.         
	New Zealand collapsed spectacularly chasing Pakistans six for 183, with the top four batsmen all dismissed for ducks as the tourists shrugged off the form slump that saw them lose the first two matches of the three-match series.         
	Scott Styris was the only New Zealander who offered any resistance, scoring 45 off 34 balls as Abdul Razzaq and Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi tore through the batting line up.         
	None of his teammates reached double figures, dispelling the optimism that lifted the New Zealand camp after coach John Wrights appointment before the series.         
	New Zealands total of 80 after 15.5 overs was its lowest in Twenty20 internationals and Pakistans 103-run winning margin was the largest ever between two Test playing nations.

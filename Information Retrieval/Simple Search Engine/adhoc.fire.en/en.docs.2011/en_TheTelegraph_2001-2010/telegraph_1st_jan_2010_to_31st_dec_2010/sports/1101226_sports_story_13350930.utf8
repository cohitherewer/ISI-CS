The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rajasthan are in the driving seat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rajasthan are in the driving seat
                      
	Jaipur: Opener Vineet Saxena hit his ninth century in first-class cricket and added 206 runs for the undefeated second wicket stand with captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar as Rajasthan finished second days play at 236 for one, as Mumbais chances of making it to the Ranji Trophy semi-finals appear to be in trouble.         
	With only dismissal of the day being veteran opener Aakash Chopra (17), Saxena (111 batting, 284 balls, 415 minutes, 14x4, 1x6) and Kanitkar (96 batting, 255 balls, 380 minutes, 14x4) made the opposition bowlers toil throughout the day.         
	With only 18 runs required to take the all-important first-innings lead, Rajasthan will be gunning for a huge lead in order to bat the defending champions out of the title race.         
	Although the duo scored runs at a pretty slow pace (run rate being 2.48), that was of little relevance as they eliminated the risk factor by not going for fancy shots. They came out of their shell only when they were provided with loose deliveries.         
	Mumbai started the day with India discard Ajit Agarkar getting Chopra out in the 11th over of the innings. However, after that breakthrough, the next six hours and 20 minutes proved to be frustrating for the Mumbai bowlers.         
	Though none of the Mumbai bowlers went for too many runs, they also failed to take wickets. None of the bowlers could bowl an incisive spell.         
	While Agarkar went for 57 runs in his 22 overs, Aavishkar Salvi and debutant Aaquib Sheikh gave away 34 and 42 runs respectively. Salvi bowled 20 overs while Shiekh bowled 14.         
	Even offie Ramesh Powar and left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla sent down 13 and 10 overs respectively without much success.         
	In Indore, Karnataka strengthened their chances of making it to semi-finals by taking a healthy first innings lead against Madhya Pradesh as their batsmen complemented the good work done by bowlers on the first day.         
	Replying to Madhya Pradeeshs 200 all out, Karnataka were 306 for eight at stumps, on day two, with a lead of 106 runs.         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Indore: Karnataka 306/8 (Amit Verma 85, KB Pawan 49, Manish Pandey 49; J Saxena 3/31) vs Madhya Pradesh.         
	 In Jaipur: Mumbai 252. Rajasthan 236/1 (VA Saxena 111n.., HH Kanitkar 96n..)         
	 In Rohtak: Haryana 379/6 vs Tamil Nadu         
	 In Vadodara: Railways 248. Baroda 303/4 (KH Devdhar 122n..)         
	All matches to continue           (AGENCIES)

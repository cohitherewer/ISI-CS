The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sneijder all set to do a Pele
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sneijder all set to do a Pele
                      
	Johannesburg: Wesley Sneijder will join Pele in one of footballs most exclusive clubs if he can help Holland win the World Cup and complete a remarkable personal haul of four major trophies in the same year.         
	This year has already seen Sneijder win Champions League, Serie A and Italian Cup titles with his club Inter Milan, and if Holland get the better of Spain at Soccer City, the Dutch playmaker will have had the kind of year that only one player has ever enjoyed before.         
	It was in 1962, when Pele, then 21, won league and Copa Libertadores titles with his club Santos.         
	He then helped his country to claim a second consecutive World Cup before finishing on the winning side in Santoss Inter-Continental Cup clash later that year.         
	Franz Beckenbauer came close to emulating the Brazilian great in 1974 but, while he skippered West Germany to World Cup glory and Bayern Munich to Bundesliga and European Cup titles, the Kaiser missed out on the German Cup.         
	Sneijder, 26, is also in the running to finish as the World Cups top scorer. He currently shares top spot with Spains David Villa, both of them having found the net five times.         
	But he insists such thoughts have not entered his head. All these statistics are the least of my worries. Believe me Ive not thought for a second about breaking records. What I want is to win the World Cup, end of story!         
	I also get asked about being the Player of the Tournament or the top scorer. But, if I go on to the pitch with all these things in my head, Ill forget how to play football.         
	Sneijders success has already been the subject of some banter with his old Real Madrid team-mate Sergio Ramos, who will be one of the defenders trying to contain the Dutch playmaker on Sunday. I got a text from him saying youve already won enough trophies this season. Its time to calm down! Sneijder revealed.         
	He has no intention of being so obliging.         
	We are going to beat Spain, he said. If we are not convinced of that, we will never do it.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lula asks fans to cheer up 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lula asks fans to cheer up 
                      
	Brasilia: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told his countrymen on Monday to forget the early elimination from this years World Cup and look ahead to 2014 when Brazil will host the month-long tournament.         
	Silva tried to cheer the country in his weekly radio address, which was recorded in the west African country of Equatorial Guinea. He is on a tour of Africa, which will conclude when he attends the World Cup final on Sunday. Of course, he had hoped to see Brazil playing. Instead, the five-time champions were beaten 2-1 in the quarter finals on Friday by the Netherlands.         
	Silva said Brazil still played the worlds best football, and he predicted a sixth title in 2014.         
	Crying over spilled milk is for those who are not used to winning, Silva said. Brazil is used to winning. Brazil is a five-time World Cup champion and its the country with the worlds best football.         
	Silva will participate in Sundays hand-over ceremony, when South African organisers pass responsibility for the next World Cup to Brazil.         
	We can be sorry only because Brazil didnt win, Silva said. But we have to lift our heads and prepare ourselves to win the 2014 World Cup. I want to be alive to participate in the opening ceremony and the party when we win our sixth title.         
	This marked the second straight time that Brazil have been knocked out in the quarter finals, which prompted the firing Sunday of national team coach Dunga.         
	I imagined that Brazil were going to play in the final, but it didnt happen, Lula said.         
	Although they were well beaten by Arjen Robben and Co. on Friday, Brazils exit from the World Cup, as usual, led to much heartbreak and disappointment. Brazil were in a tough Group - the proverbial Group of Death - in South Africa but qualified with some ease after beating North Korea and Ivory Coast and splitting points with Portugal in their preliminary round matches. Kaka, it is true, failed to fire in 2010 but other stars emerged, most notably Luis Fabiano who scored some great goals in the group stages.         
	Brazils team doctor said Kaka was not fully fit to play at the World Cup.         
	Jose Luis Runco told Brazilian media Sunday the playmaker never completely regained his best physical condition following a series of injuries ahead of the tournament in South Africa.         
	Runco told Brazilian media after arriving in Brazil that quot;in a different situation Kaka wouldnt even play quot;. He said the Real Madrid midfielders physical fitness quot;was at about 85 per cent quot;.         
	The doctor praised Kakas quot;dedication quot; and said he did quot;all he could quot; to perform well in the tournament.           (AGENCIES)

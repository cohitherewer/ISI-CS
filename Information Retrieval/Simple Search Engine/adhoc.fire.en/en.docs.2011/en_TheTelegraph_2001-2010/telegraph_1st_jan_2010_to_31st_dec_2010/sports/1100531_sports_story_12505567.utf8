	Roseau: Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Dale Richards hit half-centuries as West Indies posted 303 for six against South Africa at Windsor Park in the fourth one-day International.         
	Richards (59) provided the early momentum in an opening stand of 64 with captain Chris Gayle (29) and scored seven fours and a six in his 73-ball innings.         
	Gayle struck four boundaries in his 28 balls before skewing Morne Morkel to backward point when trying to hit over the top.         
	Richards and Chanderpaul (66) consolidated the innings, adding 51 between them off 74 balls.Richards eventually provided Lonwabo Tsotsobe with the first of his two wickets, driving to extra cover, but West Indies continued to flourish with Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo (46) putting on 76 for the third wicket.

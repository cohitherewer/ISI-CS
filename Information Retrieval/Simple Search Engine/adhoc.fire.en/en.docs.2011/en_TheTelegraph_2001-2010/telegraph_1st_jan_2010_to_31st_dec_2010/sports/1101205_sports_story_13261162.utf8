                                                                                                                       7                                      I will be nervous, admits Baek
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Baek Seuk-hyun holds a slender one shot lead at the end of the third round in the Indian Open, but the Korean rookie is determined to convert it into a winning score when he goes for the final battle on Sunday.         
	So confident is Baek that he described the Delhi Golf Club (DGC) a perfect course. Its a perfect course and am looking for a perfect finish, he said. In the SAIL Open, I didnt do too well. But Sunday would be different, said Baek. I will just play my game and not look around. I just want to enjoy my game, go for birdies and hit some good shots.         
	Its only one shot  I know I will be nervous but I will concentrate on my own game. I think thats the best way, said the Day III leader.         
	Equally confident was Swedens Rikard Karlberg, a shot behind Baek. I am feeling comfortable  I was last time here in the SAIL Open. I like it here and I showed today (Saturday) that even after a bad start, I can make a comeback, he said.         
	On sixth (hole) I hit an eight iron to eight feet. From there I really got comfortable with my game. I hit rescue on eighth (hole) where I had a good eagle chance. I should be able to carry on like this, he commented.

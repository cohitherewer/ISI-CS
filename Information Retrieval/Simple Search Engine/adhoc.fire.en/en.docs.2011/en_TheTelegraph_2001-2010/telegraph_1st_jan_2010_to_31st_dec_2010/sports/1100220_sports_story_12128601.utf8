            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford is expected to rule Saturdays seven-event card, featuring the 1,600m Governors Cup which, however, has been re-slotted for 3.15pm in view of the trophy presentation ceremony. The trophy, in fact, may turn out to be a mere formality for trainer Vijay Singhs ward Silver Fox who is not only favourably placed by the terms of the race, the horse is also looking well and knocking at the door.          
	Alfords other chance rides, include Adamaris in the 1,400m Mayors Cup. In his last outing, the Darius Byramji-trained horse went down by a narrow margin to Grand Madame, a classy filly. Spanish Sahara and Queen Of Rhythm are Alfords other rides who merit attention in their respective events  the C.R..S Cup and the Bookmakers Association Cup. The two horses are looking much improved since their last outings.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

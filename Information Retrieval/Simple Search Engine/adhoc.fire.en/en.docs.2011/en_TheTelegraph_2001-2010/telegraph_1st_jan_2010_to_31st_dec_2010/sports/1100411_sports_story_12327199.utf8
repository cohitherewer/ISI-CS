The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amid all the attention, Woods is   right at home
                                                                                                                       7                                      Amid all the attention, Woods is   right at home
            BILL PENNINGTON                            
	Augusta: When Tiger Woods completed his second round Friday, after a workmanlike two-under-par 70 put him squarely in contention for his fifth Masters title, he was asked if he liked where he was.         
	It was a question essentially about the leader board at the halfway point, which had Woods tied for third at six under, two strokes behind the leaders Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood. But as Woods paused to answer the question, it was as if he was considering all the ways he could respond, or might respond.         
	It has been a whirlwind week at Augusta National for Woods, with dramatic news conferences, stinging rebukes, admiring galleries on the ground and taunting airplanes overhead. He had made his comeback to competitive golf and he had re-entered public life.         
	Did he like where he was? Woods chuckled without a response. He had played two well-executed rounds. Was this actually a golf question? Yeah, I do, Woods finally answered. And then another pause, another grin and a sideways glance that seemed to say, are you kidding?         
	Yes, he said.         
	If Thursday had been the first day of his comeback, then Friday was more than the second day because it was just another day. Friday was the day that his Nike television commercial seemed odd but not newsworthy. Friday was the day that fans cheered him and were drawn to him, but they were also caught up in a changeable leader board that lured thousands of spectators away from Woods and toward Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim.         
	If Woods came to the 2010 Masters seeking normalcy, Friday was the day that he actually disappeared for a while as he chased rare birdies on a blustery day.         
	He was no longer the story, he was trying to become part of the story. I got myself into contention, Woods said. And that feels really good.         
	On a day when he was not at his best, Woods succeeded in putting himself in an enviable position, lurking behind Poulter and Westwood heading to Saturday, known as moving day. The Sunday champion almost always positions himself with a competent or stirring third round.         
	It was an interesting day to say the least, Woods said. I felt more comfortable because I had more control of the ball.         
	He had more control. Period.         
	From the start Woods knew he had walked onto a different Augusta National Golf Club, and not just because the jittery atmosphere of Thursdays first round had given way to a subdued crowd that waited to see what magic Woods could perform. They did not wait long.         
	Woods wore sunglasses between shots, a rarity for him in competition. The Augusta area this week has a high pollen count that leaves a coating of little specks of yellow on everything. Woods spent the day sneezing and said he used the sunglasses to keep the pollen out of his eyes.         
	The pollen was killing me, he said.         
	Otherwise, Woods seemed to settle into a relaxed rhythm. Woods did not press even though Poulter and Westwood were vaulting up the leader board. At the par-5 13th hole, he laid up even though he had only 218 yards to the front of the green.         
	It didnt make sense to go for it, he said, explaining what proved to a prudent decision at a time when the long string of pars might have frustrated another elite golfer.         
	When his third shot to the 13th green stopped 18 feet from the hole, Woods again did not panic. He just rolled in the uphill birdie putt.         
	His round was energised from there and he converted a stunning two-putt for par across the width of the 14th green from nearly 70 feet. At the 15th hole, he made another mistake with an inelegant short chip from behind the green but serenely sank the 12-footer he left himself for birdie.         
	That put him at six-under par and though he would miss a makeable birdie putt at the 16th hole and leave a 140-yard approach shot at the final hole 50 feet short, Woods was steady. And when it was over, he was more than a contender or a part of the story, he was Tiger Woods back and near the lead at the Masters. And who was going to look away this weekend now?         
	That is where he was, or as he said, I like where Im at.

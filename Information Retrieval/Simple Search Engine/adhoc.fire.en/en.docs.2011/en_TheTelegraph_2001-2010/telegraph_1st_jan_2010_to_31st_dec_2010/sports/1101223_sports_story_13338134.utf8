            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Trainer Pesi Shroffs hot-favourite, Delphi (C. Alford-up), scored a back-to-back victory, treating her 10 rivals with little respect in the upper division of the 1,100m Freelancer Cup. Her margin of victory was, however, a mere three-fourth of a length, over Kings Desire, which could have been multiplied 10 times, had her jockey desired to do so. Alford also guided Vijay Singhs favourite to an easy win in the lower division of the trophy.RESULTS

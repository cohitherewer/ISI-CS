The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaushik case is now with police 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kaushik case is now with police 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Maharaj Kishan Kaushik found himself in deeper trouble on Saturday when Hockey India (HI) concluded that the sexual harassment charges against the coach were credible and decided to refer the case to Delhi police for further investigation.         
	We are taking seriously the complaint by Ranjitha. Her written replies had specific charges and they are credible. It is for Delhi police to start the investigation immediately by filing an FIR or the government can also take suo moto action, HI secretary general Narendra Batra said.         
	This is perhaps the only way we can take the matter to its logical conclusion, Batra said.         
	The HI appointed enquiry committee, however, was noncommittal in its report and only called for a showcause notice to be served on Kaushik beside recommending that team manager Madhu Yadav be asked to appear before them.         
	Yet, HI had no option but to refer the matter to police as its decision to appoint a majority male enquiry committee came under heavy criticism from several quarters including the Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) and Member of Parliament Brinda Karat.         
	While DCW said it was ready to assist in the investigation, Karat demanded an FIR be filed against the coach.         
	To make matters worse, Sports Authority of India (SAI) sources indicated that action could be taken against Kaushik by SAI where he is currently on deputation from the Haryana government.         
	If found guilty, action could be taken against the coach. It, however, could take time as everything has to be done as per the procedure, an official told The Telegraph.         
	Kaushik, who had been coaching the national womens hockey team for nearly 20 years, was forced to resign after Ranjitha Devi, a former member of the national team, accused the coach of seeking sexual favours.         
	On Saturday, while forwarding the report of the enquiry committee to the ministry of sports, Batra said the written complaint submitted by Ranjitha Devi commanded high credibility with specific charges levelled against the coach who stepped down after this scandal hit the headlines.         
	Batra said that HI had been compelled to refer the issue to Delhi police since the enquiry committee did not have the coercive power to pursue the issue.         
	The proposed enquiry under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code can be conducted only by the police hence we are marking a copy of this letter along with all enclosures to the commissioner of Delhi police Batra said in a statement. He also said that HI would never enlist the services of Kaushik and videographer Basavaraja again.         
	HI also made public the written submission of both Ranjitha Devi and Kaushik.         
	While the player explained in detail the sexual harassment faced by her, Kaushik responded to each and every allegation saying it was a plot to defame him.

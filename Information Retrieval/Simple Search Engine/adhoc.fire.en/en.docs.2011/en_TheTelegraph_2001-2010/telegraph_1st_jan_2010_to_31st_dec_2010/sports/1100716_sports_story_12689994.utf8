            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sania Mirzas career plunged to a new low on Thursday, when she lost in straight sets in the second round of a $25000 ITF womens tennis event in Woking, Great Britain.         
	Sania, whose world ranking has slipped to 132, went down 4-6, 4-6 to 17-year-old Hungarian Timea Babos, who is ranked 379th in the Womens Tennis Association list.         
	Sania had raised eyebrows earlier when she opted to play in the low category tournament.         
	Her entry into the hard court event sparked speculations that her tennis schedule may have been influenced by husband Shoaib Maliks travel itinerary as a member of the Pakistan cricket team.         
	Pakistan are currently hosting Australia in a two-Test series.         
	The first Test is currently in its third day at Lords. Lords is 14 miles away from Sanias match venue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson insists Rooney was fit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ferguson insists Rooney was fit
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Alex Ferguson insists he did not put any pressure on the Manchester United medical staff to declare Wayne Rooney fit for Wednesdays Champions League loss to Bayern Munich.         
	After declaring Rooney had no chance of being involved barely 24 hours before the game, Ferguson named the England star in his United starting line-up for the quarter final second leg tie.         
	Ferguson confirmed the decision had only been taken following consultation with his medical team and Rooney, all of whom agreed that the risk to the ankle he damaged during the first leg in Munich a week previously was minimal.         
	As it turned out, Rooney went over on the same ankle in the first half and was clearly struggling before Ferguson substituted him with over half-an-hour remaining following the dismissal of Rafael.         
	Ferguson is confident the 24-year-old will be fit for the Manchester derby at Eastlands on April 17, although he is unlikely to make Sundays trip to Blackburn.         
	That assessment should at least ease the concerns of England manager Fabio Capello, who was at Old Trafford on Wednesday, with Ferguson adamant the correct procedures had been followed.         
	I never force the medical staff into anything, said Ferguson.         
	Their job is difficult. It is important they make the right decisions about players fitness. They made the right decision. The medical staff did not see any problem.         
	Although Rooney did not add to his 34 goals, he was a central figure in Uniteds flying start, that seemed certain to secure them a semi-final berth.         
	His presence alone galvanised the Old Trafford crowd, which Ferguson also recognised as he went through his starting line-up.         
	Wayne was keen to have a go and it did have an impact on the crowd, said the United manager. It gave them all a lift.         
	As to the recurrence of the injury, Feguson was confident it was nothing serious.         
	Its similar to what he had last week. Its a burst blood vessel just below the ankle joint. He wont be out for too long, Ferguson said. Hes unlucky he went over on it. He had a couple of challenges and I dont think he got any protection (from the referee).         
	Rooney, who missed Uniteds costly 1-2 home defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday, is now unlikely to play against Blackburn Rovers this weekend.         
	His injury caused widespread concern in England, with even British Prime Minister Gordon Brown referring to it.

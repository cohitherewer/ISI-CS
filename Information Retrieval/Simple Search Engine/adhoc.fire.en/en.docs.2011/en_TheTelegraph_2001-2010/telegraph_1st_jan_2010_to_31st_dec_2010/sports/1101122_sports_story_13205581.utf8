	Calcutta: Chirag United are fast becoming East Bengals bogey team.         
	The red and golf juggernaut, that stumbled to Chirag in the Durand Cup semi-final  their first defeat in the season  once again got stuck against the same opponent, here.         
	On Sunday, in a Calcutta Football League match at Salt Lake Stadium, Subrata Bhattacharyas men rallied to hold East Bengal to a 1-1 draw.         
	The alarm bells are ringing in the East Bengal camp as decent outfits are repeatedly exposing chinks in the red-and-gold armour.         
	On Sunday, Chirag took full advantage of a near vacuum in the midfield created by Mehtab Hossains absence.         
	Mehtabs absence allowed Chirag to come back in the game after trailing by Tolgay Ozebes eighth-minute conversion. Penn Orji evaded side-back Bapi Saha and crossed from the left towards Tolgay, who out-jumped Denson Devadas to head home.         
	But then suddenly, the zing in the East Bengal attacks was missing.         
	Team-game gave way to needless display of individual skills that gradually made matters easier for the men in purple. Chirag regrouped and repeatedly caught East Bengal offguard on the break.         
	A goal was coming any time. And, in the 27th minute Arnab Mondals well-directed floater found the target, beating goalkeeper Jayanta Paul.         
	East Bengals defending also left a lot to be desired as Mondal was unmarked when he received Munna Malliks pass.         
	Once Chirag got the equaliser, Bhattacharya crowded the backline and that made the going tougher for the red and gold brigad..         
	Tolgay though was a tad unfortunate when his right-footed grounder came off the post late in the second session after substitute Ekene Ikenwa (replacing Alvito DCunha) set him up with a superb diagonal ball.         
	Naoba Singh too had an opportunity to regain East Bengals lead early in the second half, but his right-footer sailed over the crosspiece after Alvitos corner rebounded off a melee.         
	The Durand champions too had their share of chances.         
	Just at the hour mark, Joshimar had an open chance with the East Bengal defence caught napping once again. The Brazilian failed to control the ball and it went to Denson. Bengals Sanotsh Trophy hero also failed to convert despite being only a few yards away from the target.         
	The stalemate though does not tinker with the standings as Trevor James Morgans men are still atop with 37 points from 13 matches.         
	Mohun Bagan, who have 34 from 13 matches, take on against Peerless S.C. on Monday.         
	We tried everything to win but we werent good enough, Morgan said.         
	The League is still ours to lose. Everything is still in our hands. We could have won the match but we wasted opportunities, he added.

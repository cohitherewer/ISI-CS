The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Just wanted to be positive, says Angelo
                                                                                                                       7                                      Just wanted to be positive, says Angelo
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Angelo Mathews, who eventually played a match-winning knock in Kolkata Knight Riders 11-run defeat of the Deccan Chargers, said the lessons learnt from the recent tour of India with the Sri Lankan team stood him in good stead on Friday.         
	Its not easy to play in India. We learnt a lot from that series. We did not give easy wins in the one-dayers and T20s, Mathews said after the Knights win at the DY Patil stadium.         
	We did not have any total in mind, just wanted to be positive. We wanted to score runs and not hang around  We wanted to put on a partnership, Mathews said of his undefeated 130-run stand with Owais Shah.         
	Coach Dav Whatmore said Adam Gilchrists dismissal was the turning point.         
	We would have liked that to have happened a bit earlier, he said tongue-in-cheek, referring to the difficult chance that Brad Hodge grassed at second slip with the Australian was on two.         
	Whatmore also did not believe the strategic timeout played a significant role. Its not too long. The players can have a quick word and come back. Its a bit early to tell, he said.

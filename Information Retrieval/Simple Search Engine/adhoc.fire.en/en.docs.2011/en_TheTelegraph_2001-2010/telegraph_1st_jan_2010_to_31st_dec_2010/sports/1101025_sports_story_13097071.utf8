            A STAFF REPORTER            Shukla                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal maintained their all-win record in the East Zone leg of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 tournament when they beat hosts Orissa by 18 runs in the last match, in Cuttack, on Sunday.         
	Bengal had earlier defeated Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura. However, both the teams had already qualified for the knockout stage on Saturday.         
	[In another tie, Assam defeated Jharkhand by five wickets. Chasing a 139-run target, Assam made 142 for five with four balls to spare.]         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla had a fantastic day for Bengal shining with both the bat and ball.         
	Batting first the Manoj Tiwary-led side made 132 for six in their 20 overs. Openers Sreevats Goswami (43) and Anustup Majumdar (27) combined well for a 60-run first wicket partnership. Shukla was unbeaten on a well-made 35.         
	In reply, Orissa could manage 114 for eight in their 20 overs. The Bengal bowlers once again did a good job as they stifled the Orissa batsmen. None of them could convert their starts into bigger scores.         
	For Bengal, while Ashok Dinda and Shukla claimed two wickets each, Iresh Saxena, Shami Ahmed, Arnab Nandi and Tiwary picked up a wicket each.         
	Tiwary couldnt have hoped for a better start as captain and he praised teammate Shukla for his superb performance on the day. I know Laxmi is a champion He can win you matches single-handedly. He excelled in whatever he did today. Im proud to have him in the team.         
	Coach Woorkeri Raman, however, was of the view that it was very important for the team focus on the upcoming Ranji Trophy. T20s and Ranji Trophy are different. We need to shift our focus back on the longer format, Raman said.

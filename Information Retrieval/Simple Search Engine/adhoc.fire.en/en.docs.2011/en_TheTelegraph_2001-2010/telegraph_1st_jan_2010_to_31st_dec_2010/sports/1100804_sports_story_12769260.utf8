	New Delhi: After Gagan Narang, it is now wrestler Ramesh Kumars turn to come out all guns blazing against the Ministry of Sports.         
	The 28-year-old grappler, who created history last year by becoming the first Indian in 42 years to bag a bronze medal in the World championship in Denmark, is now mulling legal action against the government for not awarding him the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award.         
	Considering my achievement last year, I should have been given the award, he said.         
	Instead they have given it to someone who didnt do much in 2009. I am consulting my lawyers and may send legal notice to ministry soon, said the 74 kg freestyle wrestler.         
	Four sportspersons  Gagan Narang, Ramesh Kumar and two physically challenged athletes  were recommended by their respective federations for the countrys highest sports award but the selection committee headed by PT Usha decided in favour of Saina Nehwal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. to miss Dipendu
                                                                                                                       7                                      Md. Sp. to miss Dipendu
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali was a distraught man on Thursday evening. And he has every reason to be so.         
	Late in the evening, the club got a letter from the Indian Football Association (IFA) that in-form striker Dipendu Biswas would not be eligible to play the Calcutta Football League derby against Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. He has a double booking and we didnt know that, he said.         
	You cant blame Mohammedan Sporting for missing out though. After all, these days IFA is organising CFL matches in the most irregular way.         
	When did I see two yellow cards I dont remember. Honestly, the man, who will miss the Friday clash, said.         
	With no Dipendu, Shabbir will give a start to the young and talented Nilendra Dewan.         
	Mohammedan Sporting will be hoping the Brazilian striker Eduardo Escobar will be in his mood on Friday and he promised to do something similar against the team his compatriot, Jose Ramirez Barreto, plays for.         
	The green and maroon brigade will be playing their first big match under new coach Satyajit Chatterjee.         
	We cannot take Mohammedan Sporting for granted. They have a set team and on their day, Sporting can be dangerous, Chatterjee said on Thursday.

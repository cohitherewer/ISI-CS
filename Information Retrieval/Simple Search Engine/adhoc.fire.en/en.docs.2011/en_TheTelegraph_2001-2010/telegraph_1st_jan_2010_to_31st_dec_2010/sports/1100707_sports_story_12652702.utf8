The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Irked Blanc out to set things right
                                                                                                                       7                                        Irked Blanc out to set things right
                  Laurent Blanc                     
	Paris: New France coach Laurent Blanc was outraged by the behaviour of certain players during the World Cup debacle and plans to rebuild the national team with only players he can trust.         
	Blanc inherited a team devoid of confidence, as Raymond Domenechs troubled six-year reign ended with rifts and infighting after the team went on strike at a training session shortly before their World Cup ended in the group stage.         
	What bothers me is that, after the World Cup, a new coach should be able to lean on a hard core (of players), Blanc said on Tuesday at his first press conference. This hard core is not even a melons pip... My task is to find a hard core within this team.         
	Blanc plans to meet with players shortly so he can sort out who forms a part of his future plans. I cant act like nothing happened in South Africa, it wouldnt go down well. I followed the events, as you all did, with a lot of sadness, Blanc said. I was outraged by certain behaviour... its a delicate situation, there are certainly meetings to be had.         
	Blanc is fully aware that the climate is so bad that he is immediately under huge pressure. Everyone wishes me luck. I get the impression Im heading towards suicide, or the guillotine, Blanc said. I hope this climate will change with results.         
	Blanc has some key decisions to make, and little time.         
	Federation official and former international Lilian Thuram  Blancs teammate at the 1998 World Cup and at Euro 2000  has already said defender Patrice Evra should never play again for France because he was the captain who led the strike.         
	Evra was stripped of captaincy by Domenech and dropped for the final game against South Africa, which France lost 2-1.         
	Blanc intends to speak with Evra, and others like Franck Ribery, Thierry Henry, William Gallas and Eric Abidal  reportedly the five main instigators in the mutiny  before deciding whether he picks them again.         
	There are very few people who can tell you what really happened. I think I know a few of them, he said. And knowing them well, I think if I have a meeting with them, they will tell me what really happened.         
	Blanc insists only those with the right mentality and team spirit will be chosen as he rebuilds the team and designates the new leader. Its possible that the captain changes in every match in the games to come, he added.

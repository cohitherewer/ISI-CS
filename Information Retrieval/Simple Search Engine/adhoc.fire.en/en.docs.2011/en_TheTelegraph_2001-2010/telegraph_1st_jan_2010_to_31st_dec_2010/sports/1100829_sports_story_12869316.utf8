The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney hits the target, at last
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rooney hits the target, at last
                  Didier Drogba celebrates his goal, on Saturday                     
	London: Wayne Rooney scored his first goal since March as Manchester United beat West Ham United 3-0 in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Saturday.         
	Rooney, who had not found the net since the Champions League quarter final first leg against Bayern Munich, converted a first-half penalty after Ryan Giggs was brought down by Jonathan Spector.         
	Nani doubled Uniteds lead five minutes into the second half with a superb finish from Rooneys clever lay-off and Dimitar Berbatov completed an easy victory to leave West Ham without any points and bottom of the table.         
	Earlier, Chelseas goal-rush was staunched by Stoke City but the Premier League champions maintained their perfect start to the season with a 2-0 home victory despite a missed penalty by Frank Lampard.         
	The England midfielder saw his spot kick saved by Thomas Sorensen but Florent Malouda fired Chelsea ahead just past the half hour mark and Didier Drogba tucked away a second-half penalty to seal a win that was much harder work than their 6-0 thrashings of West Bromwich Albion and Wigan Athletic.             Results      Arsenal 2 Blackburn 1; Blackpool 2, Fulham 2; Chelsea 2 Stoke 0; Wigan 1 Tottenham 0; Wolves 1 
  Newcastle 1; Manchester United 3 West Ham 0.      
	Carlo Ancelottis side top the table with a maximum nine points and a 14-0 goal difference while Arsenal moved to seven with an impressive 2-1 victory at Blackburn Rovers where Theo Walcott scored his fourth goal of the season.         
	The surprise result of the day came a White Hart Lane where Wigan Athletic hit back from two crushing defeats to beat Champions League qualifiers Tottenham Hotspur 1-0.         
	Hugo Rodallegas late goal decided a fixture that Tottenham won 9-1 last season.         
	Blackpools first home match in the top flight since 1971 ended in a 2-2 draw with Fulham while Andy Carroll was on target again for promoted Newcastle United who drew 1-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers.         
	Chelsea have been unstoppable so far this season but Stoke proved a much tougher proposition than they did at the back end of last season when they were hammered 7-0 at Stamford Bridge.         
	Lampard wasted the chance to put the hosts in front when his poorly-struck penalty, awarded for a foul on Malouda by Ryan Shawcross, was saved by Sorensen.         
	Malouda spared Lampards blushes soon afterwards when he latched on to John Terrys pass to score but Stoke never looked like capitulating.         
	The visitors almost levelled when Matthew Etheringtons shot was blocked on the line by Drogba and then Glenn Whelans powerful shot struck the crossbar.

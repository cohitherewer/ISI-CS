The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia extend lead to 277 runs
                                                                                                                       7                                        Australia extend lead to 277 runs
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH             Simon Katich                           
	Australias bid for a record-equalling 12th successive Test victory against Pakistan is at the mercy of Hobarts notoriously fickle weather as well as a flat Bellerive pitch after skipper Ricky Ponting surprisingly elected not to enforce the follow-on on day three.         
	After part-time spinner Simon Katich grabbed three quick wickets  his first Test scalps for nearly a year  to enable Australia to steamroll the Pakistan middle order following a courageous century from day two bad boy Salman Butt, Australia led on the first innings by 218 runs after bowling the visitors out for 301.         
	But despite the forecast of rain for days four and five and the fact Australia will need maximum time to take another ten wickets on a pitch that has coughed up just 19 wickets in three days, Ponting chose to bat again even though he said at stumps on day two that he would enforce the follow-on if given the opportunity.         
	Australia ended day three at 59 for one  with Shane Watson the man out for one  an overall lead of 277 with two days remaining.         
	A victory by Australia here would equal the world record for most Test wins in succession against the same opponent  12 currently held by Sri Lanka against Bangladesh  as Australia look to complete their fourth successive 3-0 whitewash against Pakistan.         
	But if Pakistan are to emerge from this game with a draw they will have opener Butt to thank as well as a stubborn last wicket stand of 53 between fast bowlers Umar Gul and Mohammed Asif, which kept the Aussie bowlers out on the field until just after tea and no doubt had an influence in Pontings decision not to bowl again.         
	Butt certainly made amends for costing his team the key wickets of skipper Mohammed Yousuf and young gun Umar Akmal on day two by his refusal to run on both occasions as he brought up his third Test century and his second against Australia.         
	With recalled former skipper Shoaib Malik providing great support the tourists  who resumed at 94 for four  at one stage reached 213 four before a collapse costing them four wickets for 14 in the space of eight overs, sparked by Katich, proved their undoing.         
	Katichs rare visit to the bowling crease only came about as Ponting sought to get through the last few overs before the second new ball was due at the 80-over mark.

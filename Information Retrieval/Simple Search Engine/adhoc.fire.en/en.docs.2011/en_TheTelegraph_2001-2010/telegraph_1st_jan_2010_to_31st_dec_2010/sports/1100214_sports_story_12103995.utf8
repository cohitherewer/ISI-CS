            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who wanted to offer puja at the famous Kalighat temple, failed in his bid due to the presence of hundreds of fans who had got information of the stars arrival.         
	However teammate VVS Laxman, who left the hotel before Sachin, managed to offer puja quietly.         
	He (Tendulkar) went in a private vehicle and wanted to enter the temple premises through a separate entrance rather than the VIP gate where there was elaborate security. But the crowd spotted him inside the vehicle and he could not enter the temple, a CAB source said.         
	Laxman, however, entered the temple through the VIP entrance amidst elaborate security arrangement, he added.         
	In the evening, Sachin and Zaheer Khan went to watch Shah Rukh Khans latest film, My Name Is Khan, directed by Karan Johar.

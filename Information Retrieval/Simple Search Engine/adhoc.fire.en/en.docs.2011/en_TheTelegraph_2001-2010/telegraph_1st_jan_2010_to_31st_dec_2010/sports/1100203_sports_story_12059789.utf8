            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Ballantyne is fancied to score on Wednesday. The Vijay Singh-trainee takes on nine rivals in the upper division of the 1,600m Memorable Day Cup. Ballantyne was caught unaware by Malikah in his maiden try over a 2,000m race. That experience gained there may help the Flitch colt clinch the issue in the hands of apprentice B. Mahesh.          
	The lower division of the trophy may see a straight contest between Javed Khans filly Flirting Eye and Daniel Davids ward Star Luxurious. The former, however, has the edge in view of her recent workouts.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

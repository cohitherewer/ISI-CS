The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No time to recover for boxers
                                                                                                                       7                                      No time to recover for boxers
                      
	New Delhi: Indian boxers packed a powerful punch in the Commonwealth Games with an unprecedented medal haul.         
	However, replicating the performance in next months Asian Games would be tough as they have got very little time for rest and recovery, national coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu said on Monday.         
	Indian boxers fetched seven medals  three gold and four bronze  at the just-concluded Games.         
	The historic performance has raised expectations of a rich medal haul in the Asian Games scheduled to be held from November 12 to 27 in Guangzhu.         
	But Sandhu said the CWG performance would be a tough act to follow.         
	The Asian Games are too close. Had there been a little more gap and our boxers got a little more time to rest and recover, it would have been better, said Sandhu.         
	World No. 1 Vijender said: Asian Games are traditionally tougher then the Commonwealth Games. Commonwealth Games are always easier because there is no Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan.         
	The Indian team for the Asian Games remains the same except for three changes.         
	Chhote Lal Yadav comes in for Akhil Kumar in the 56kg division, Vikas Krishan replaces Jai in 60kg and S. Santhosh Kumar has been included in place of Manoj in 64kg.         
	Manoj felt the gap should have been bigger. Similar was the view of Amandeep and Dilbag, both of whom are in the Asian Games team.           (PTI)

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Kevin Pietersen                           
	London: England batsman Kevin Pietersen has been fined an undisclosed sum for his comments on Twitter after he was left out of the Twenty20 and one-day International (ODI) squad for the series against Pakistan.         
	Pietersen, who offered an unreserved apology, was fined an undisclosed amount following a disciplinary meeting at Lords on Monday.         
	The England batsman inadvertently broke the news last week that he was to be dropped from the limited-overs squad to face Pakistan, several hours before the list of names was officially announced.         
	He told followers of his Twitter feed: Done for rest of summer!! Man of the World Cup T20, and dropped from the T20 side too. Its a f--- -up ...         
	Pietersens faux pas followed a similar one from former England under-19s captain Azeem Rafiq, who was fined 500 and banned from all cricket for a month.         
	It preceded a third unfortunate tweet on Sunday from Dimitri Mascarenhas, who has also been fined 1,000 by his county Hampshire, on Sunday. Mascarenhas is also likely to face further disciplinary action following his Twitter outburst on chairman of selectors Geoff Miller.         
	Miller was the subject of two separate posts on the Twitter page of the Hampshire all-rounder, which led to England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) launching a probe into the explosive remarks.         
	An ECB spokesman said: We are aware of the tweet and we are investigating the matter.         
	Mascarenhas is not a centrally-contracted England player but he has previously featured in ODIs and Twenty20 for the national side.         
	England coach Andy Flower travelled from his teams current base in Cardiff  where they will face Pakistan in the second Twenty20 International Tuesday  to attend Pietersens hearing in London. Hugh Morris, managing director  England Cricket, was also present.         
	An ECB statement this afternoon read: The hearing considered two charges against Kevin Pietersen relating to recent comments made on Twitter following his omission from the one-day squad for the series against Pakistan.         
	Pietersen pleaded guilty to both charges.

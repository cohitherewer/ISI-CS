	North Sound: South Africa rode on twin centuries by Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers to put up a formidable 280 for seven in the first one-day International against the West Indies here on Saturday.         
	A delayed start due to rain reduced the match to a 48-overs-per-side affair.         
	Opening the innings, Amla hit a 109-ball 102 to guide his team after the Proteas lost captain Graeme Smith Jacques Kallis cheaply.         
	He was ably supported by De Villiers who hit an identical score of 102 (off 101 balls) and shared a 129-run partnership for the third wicket with Amla.         
	For the hosts, Dwayne Bravo returned the best figures of three for 40 while Jerome Taylor and Ravi Rampaul snared two wickets each.         
	Earlier, Smith had called incorrectly at the toss and were invited to bat first by Chris Gayle.         
	The visitors had wrapped up the Twenty20 series 2-0 with wins on consecutive days at this ground during the week.         
	The West Indies are missing middle-order mainstay Shivnarine Chanderpaul.         
	Chanderpaul took a painful blow to the wrist while attempting an innovative reverse-paddle to left-arm seamer Lonwabo Tsotsobe in the second Twenty20.         
	Bowlers Sulieman Benn and Kemar Roach are also out of the playing XI, with Ravi Rampaul and Nikita Miller getting the nod.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes wins; Bhupathi bites dust
                                                                                                                       7                                      Paes wins; Bhupathi bites dust
                      
	Paris: Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna scored contrasting wins with their respective partners but Mahesh Bhupathi made a shock exit along with Max Mirnyi from the mens doubles event of the French Open here today.         
	Defending champions and third seeds Paes and Lukas Dlouhy of Czech Republic booked a pre-quarter final berth with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over unseeded pair of Swiss Yves Allegro and Andreas Beck of Germany.         
	Paes and Dlouhy were trailing the deciding set 1-3 but turned around the second round match by winning five games on the trot.         
	However, Bhupathi and Mirnyi had disappointment in store as they lost 4-6, 6-7 (4) to Spanish pair of Marc Lopez and Pere Riba in the second round.         
	Its now eight years that Bhupathi had won a mens doubles Grand Slam title. He last held a winners trophy in his hands in 2002 when he triumphed at US Open along with Mirnyi.         
	Earlier, Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi scored an easy 6-2, 6-3 win over Italian Fabio Fognini and American Michael Russell.         
	It took them just 59 minutes to win the first round contest and will next meet 15th seed and local favourite Julien Benneteau and Michael Llodra.         
	Paes also moved up in the mixed doubles. Paes and partner Cara Black began their French Open mixed doubles campaign with an easy straight-sets win over the local pair of Pauline Parmentier and Marc Gicquel.         
	The second seeded Indo-Zimbabwean pair needed just 59 minutes to dispatch their local opponents 6-3, 6-3 in the first round of the clay court Grand Slam.         
	Paes and Black broke their rivals thrice in the opening set while dropping their serve once. Placed comfortably, they then broke the local team twice to seal the match in their favour.         
	In mixed doubles too Bhupathi lost. Partnering Lizel Huber, the top seeds made a shock first-round exit with a straight-set defeat at the hands of Yung-Jan Chan and Eric Butorac. Bhupathi and his American partner Huber came up with a listless performance against their unseeded rivals to lose the match 1-6, 4-6 in 55 minutes at Roland Garros.

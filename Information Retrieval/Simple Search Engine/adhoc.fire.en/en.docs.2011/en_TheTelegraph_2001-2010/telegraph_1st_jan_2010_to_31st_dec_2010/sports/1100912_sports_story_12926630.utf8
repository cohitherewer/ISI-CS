The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All players indulge   in spot-fixing: Latif
                                                                                                                       7                                        All players indulge   in spot-fixing: Latif
                  Irate Pakistanis in Lahore, on Saturday                           
	Melbourne: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif feels that cricketers from all Test-playing nations indulge in spot-fixing and some matches are scripted like movies.         
	Latif, who retired in 1994 tour to protest suspected match-fixing by his teammates, said Pakistani cricketers are not the only ones involved in such shady dealings.         
	It is widely believed that only Pakistani players are involved in this practice (spot-fixing), but I have seen it all very closely and I can easily say that players from every country do it, Latif told an Australian daily.         
	There are clever ways to manipulate the game and maximise profits if players are involved. For example, some cricket matches have been scripted, like movies or plays, where it is decided that so many runs are to be scored in the first session of a Test, or how many in a certain over, and so on, he said.         
	His comments come amid the raging spot-fixing controversy which has led to the suspension captain Salman Butt and pacers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer for their alleged involvement in a betting ring exposed by a British tabloids sting operation.         
	Latif said he was suspicious about the dismissal of two Australian batsmen in a Test match but the newspaper did not disclose who the players in question were.         
	I am not saying that both players were involved in spot-fixing, but the sequence of events was enough to create a doubt in my mind. I want to say that a player is called a cheat only when he is caught, otherwise nobody points a finger at him, and believe me 50 per cent of the players fall in this category, Latif said.

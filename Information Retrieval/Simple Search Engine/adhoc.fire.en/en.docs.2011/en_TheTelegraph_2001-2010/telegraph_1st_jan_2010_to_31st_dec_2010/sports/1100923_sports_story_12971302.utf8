	Port Elizabeth: Chennai Super Kings defeated Warriors by 10 runs in a crucial Group A match and qualified for the semi-finals of the Champions League Twenty20 here Wednesday.         
	Electing to bat, Mike Hussey (50 off 39) and Murali Vijay (35 off 27) shared a 63-run opening stand before skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni came up with a late 21-ball 31 to guide Chennai Super Kings to 136 for six in their allotted 20 overs.         
	The CSK bowlers then rose to the occasion and restricted the Warriors to 126 for eight. The Warriors needed 15 off the final over, but managed just four and lost two wickets.         
	With this victory, CSK have secured a place in the first semi-final against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Durban on Friday.         
	Even though Warriors lost the match, they too have qualified for the last four stage, pipping Victoria Bushrangers on net run rate. Warriors will meet South Australia in the other semi-final on Saturday.         
	Chasing the modest 137, Warriors needed 109 to book their place in the semis and they finally went on to score 126 for eight.         
	For Warriors, Justin Kreusch turned out to be the hero as he first picked up three wickets for 19 and then scored valuable 25 with the bat to help his sides cause at St Georges Park here.         
	Warriors chase never got going as they were dealt with the first blow in the fourth over in the form of Ashwell Prince.           (AGENCIES)

	Port of Spain: South Africa completed a 163-run win over West Indies in the dying stages of the fourth day of the opening Test at the Queens Park Oval on Sunday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	The Proteas faced stiffer resistance from the West Indies in their second innings but were still able to earn a day off as the home side were dismissed for 293 from 80.3 overs with 2.3 overs remaining in days play.         
	Chasing 457 to win, West Indies showed significantly more fight than they had done in their first innings when they capitulated for 102.         
	Chris Gayle led from the front with a power-packed 73 from 106 balls with nine fours and one six while his deputy Dwayne Bravo entertained with 49 from 74 balls with four boundaries and a pair of sixes.         
	Sulieman Benn recorded his highest Test score  42 from 55 balls  as he put on 66 for the eighth wicket with Shane Shillingford (27). Dale Steyn had a match haul of eight for 94.

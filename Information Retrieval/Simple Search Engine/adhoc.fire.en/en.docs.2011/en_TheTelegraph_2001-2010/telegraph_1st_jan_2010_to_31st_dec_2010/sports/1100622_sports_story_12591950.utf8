The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridis 124 is too much
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridis 124 is too much
                      
	Dambulla: Captain Shahid Afridi smashed a blistering 60-ball 124, his second century in the tournament, to steer Pakistan to a resounding 139run win over Bangladesh in an inconsequential Asia Cup match here Monday.         
	Powered by Afridis blitzkrieg and useful half-centuries from Imran Farhat (66), Shahzaib Hasan (50) and Umar Akmal (50), Pakistan made an intimidating 385 for seven, their highest score in ODIs, after electing to bat.         
	The target being too huge for them, Bangladesh settled for batting practice, making a listless 246 from their 50 overs at the Rangiri International Stadium.         
	According to statistician Mohandas Menon, Afridi, who hit four sixes Monday, surpassed Sanath Jayasuriyas record (270) of maximum sixes in ODIs. Afridi now has hit 272 sixes. Sourav Ganguly is placed third with 190 hits.         
	Afridi, who was involved in a 137-run association for the fifth wicket with Umar Akmal (50), struck 17 fours and four sixes to help Pakistan raise a record total.         
	Pakistans highest total in one-day Internationals was also the highest at this venue, bettering Sri Lankas 312 for four against Bangladesh last week. Building on the sizzling 81-run start provided by Shahzaib Hasan (50) and Imran Farhat (66), Afridi initially played himself in before unleashing an array of strokes which drove the Bangladesh attack to despair. He was merciless at the square, driving, cutting and pulling with panache.         
	Left-arm spinner Adbur Razzak was the lone Bangladesh bowler to command respect from the 30-year-old who carted the rest of the attack to all parts of the park during his imperious essay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Odafe earns Churchill a point
                                                                                                                       7                                        Odafe earns Churchill a point
            A STAFF REPORTER                Barreto,Odafe                             
	Calcutta: By Churchill Brothers coach Carlos Pareiras own admission, he never expected his team to log a point against Mohun Bagan on Friday.         
	But when you have someone like Okolie Odafe on your roster there is no reason to have a creased forehead.         
	The prolific striker, who has been hogging the headlines for his mid-air antics, let his form in front of goal silence the critics. Clearly, Odafe knows a thing or two about how to thrive in adversity.         
	The Churchill skipper scored a brace as the reigning champions rallied to hold the green and maroon brigade to a 2-2 draw in their I-League match at the Barasat Stadium. Jose Ramirez Barreto scored both Bagans goals.         
	The Nigerian put Churchill ahead in the eighth minute when he headed home a Dan Ito free-kick. Custodian Sangram Mukherjee and the Bagan defence looked unusually static when the free-kick flew in and Odafe is not someone who would let such an opportunity go a begging.         
	Jose Ramirez Barreto restored parity in the 35th minute with a glancing header off a Marcos Pareira centre.         
	Five minutes into the second-half and Bagan were up 2-1. Ryuji Sueoka theatrically went to ground inside the Churchill box after getting past Arindam Bhattacharya and referee S. Suresh pointed to the spot.         
	Barreto, who had muffed a penalty against East Bengal in the Federation Cup semi-final the other day, did not make any mistakes and coolly slotted it home past a diving Bhattacharya.         
	Up 2-1, but the Bagan fans who were wishing their club managed full points were in for a shock. Rakesh Masih brought down Ogba Kalu a yard outside the penalty box. Odafes low, accurate free-kick flew past Sangram Mukherjee and nestled into the near corner.         
	Incidentally, Odafe was practising something similar on the eve of the match and was overheard joking to Bhattacharya that he would score one like this against Bagan!         
	Bagan should have won this match and coach Karim Bencharifa was not hiding his disappointment. Here was a team looking down the barrel and the home side let them off the hook!         
	The Moroccan started with Sueoka on the right in place of James Singh. Marcos and Masih were at the centre of the park.         
	Obviously, Bencharifa was aware of the Kalu threat in midfield and wanted to use Marcos and Masih to stifle him. While Masih, barring a few hiccups, was okay, Marcos was fantastic. He worked tirelessly, made an assist and almost curled one in from 30 yards out, which Bhattacharya saved well.         
	Sueoka, however, was not up to the mark and Bencherifa could have replaced him much earlier.         
	Barring the penalty, Sueoka did nothing worthwhile and since his frame is frail, he was easy meat for the Churchill defence. By the time James was brought in, for Ishfaq on the left, it was too late.         
	Neither did Bagans profligacy help their cause. Barreto missed a sitter early on while Chidi spurned at least three chances. It was not his day either. It was Odafes day all through.

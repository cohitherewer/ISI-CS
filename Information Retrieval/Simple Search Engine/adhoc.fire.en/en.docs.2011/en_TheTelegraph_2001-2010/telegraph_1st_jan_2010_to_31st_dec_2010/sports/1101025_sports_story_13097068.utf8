The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir and Ishant   likely to be available
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gambhir and Ishant   likely to be available
  - VVS Laxman is fit for selection versus New Zealand       OUR BUREAU                Gautam Gambhir (top) and Ishant Sharma                                        
	Calcutta: A historic series against Australia over, it is time for Team India to focus on their next mission, against New Zealand.         
	And complementing the success of a clean sweep against the Aussies was the good news of the possible availability of two key players for the series against the Black Caps.         
	Gautam Gambhir and Ishant Sharma, who missed the second Test, against Australia, in Bangalore, owing to knee injuries, are expected to be available for selection when the selectors meet in Chennai, on Monday afternoon.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and colleagues are to pick the squad for the first two Tests of the three-match series. While the first Test begins on November 4, in Ahmedabad, the second is to be played in Hyderabad from November 12.         
	If Gambhir and Ishant are available as expected, then Tamil Nadu batsman Abhinav Mukund and young Saurashtra pacer Jaydev Unadkat, who were drafted in for the second Test, against Australia, will face the axe.         
	V.V.S. Laxman, it is learnt by The Telegraph, is also fit for selection. Laxman, who was instrumental in India winning the first Test, against the Aussies, in Mohali, couldnt play the second because of back problems.         
	Laxmans unbeaten 73 and Ishants defiant 31, in the second innings, in Mohali, ensured India snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.         
	If Laxman makes the cut, India will have a full strength side at their disposal the Black Caps who were humbled by Bangladesh 0-4 in an ODI series earlier this month.  
	Likely squad  
	 Batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay, Suresh Raina, Cheteshwar Pujara  
	 Wicket-keeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.)  
	 Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha  
	 Medium pacers: Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma

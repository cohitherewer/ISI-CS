The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spin is on both teams minds
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spin is on both teams minds
                      
	Old Tafford: England face a trial by spin in Fridays second Test at Old Trafford after Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said he felt a couple of their batsmen, including Kevin Pietersen, were vulnerable.         
	Pietersen, Englands best batsman, has been dismissed 16 times by left-arm spinners in just over two years.         
	He will need to be braced for an extra challenge afer Siddons told a news conference on Thursday that left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak could replace a pace bowler.         
	The Old Trafford pitch favours the slower bowlers and left-arm spinner Monty Panesar bowled England to victory against New Zealand in the last Test here.         
	Siddons said captain Shakib-al Hasan, another left-arm spinner, could be a real threat. England captain Andrew Strauss said he expected his spin bowler Graeme Swann to pose more of a threat after he failed to take a wicket at Lords.         
	Their batsmen all played Graeme well but when we faced their spinners on the last day at Lords there was no spin whatsoever, Strauss said.           (REUTERS)

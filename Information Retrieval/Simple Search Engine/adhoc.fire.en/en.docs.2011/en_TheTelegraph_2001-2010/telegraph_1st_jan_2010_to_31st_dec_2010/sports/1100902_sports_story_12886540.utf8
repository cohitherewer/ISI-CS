The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi claim dismissed by Rajasthan Royals 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modi claim dismissed by Rajasthan Royals 
                      
	New Delhi: Rajasthan Royals Wednesday dismissed reports that suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi talked their captain-cum-coach, Shane Warne, out of bidding for Andrew Flintoff in the second players auction to fix the bid in Chennai Super Kings favour.         
	A reported e-mail exchange between Modi and the Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary and Chennai Super Kings owner, N. Srinivasan, suggested that the bid was fixed to ensure that Chennai won the bid for Flintoff after back-door negotiations with Warne and his team.         
	But Rajasthan Royals rubbished the reports.         
	The Rajasthan Royals participation in all of the IPL auctions has been entirely transparent at all times. Our cricket management team is responsible for determining the auction targets and the structure of the team. They fulfil this role without any external influence, the team said in a statement.         
	The team also denied reports that Modi influenced Warne, insisting if true, the suspended IPL commissioners views are his own.         
	We would like to reiterate that no one from the team, including our captain Shane Warne, has ever been spoken to by anybody in the past regarding influencing the bidding process. The views expressed by Modi are his own and do not represent that of Rajasthan Royals in any manner, the statement read.

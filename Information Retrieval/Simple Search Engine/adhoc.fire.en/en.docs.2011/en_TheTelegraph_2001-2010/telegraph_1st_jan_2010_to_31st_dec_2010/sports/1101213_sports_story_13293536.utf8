The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We dont think we are infallible, says England offie   Ashes, not rankings,   is Swanns concern

  - We dont think we are infallible, says England offie       Steve James            Graeme Swann                                       
	Deep in the bowels of the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday night, Englands resident comedian was up to his usual tricks. Graeme Swann was about, and hilarity was never far from his side.         
	Poor old Ian Bell was trying to conduct a press conference of his own when Swanns grinning face  and rather large chin!  appeared at the door. Bell was not just distracted; he could barely speak. His conference was wisely curtailed. It was time to speak to Swann instead.         
	But not before he had been briefed by the England media liaison officer. But I never put my foot in it, cursed Swann jokingly. Indeed he doesnt. He just entertains, whether playing the clown off the field or bowling like a magician on it.         
	Even before he took five second-innings wickets to clinch victory in the second Test at Adelaide, Swann was a star of the tour, with his video diaries for the England and Wales Cricket Board website achieving cult status. They are quite brilliant; encapsulating the relaxed atmosphere surrounding this current England team.         
	Of course, such behaviour is always more readily tolerated when on-field success accompanies it. And you wouldnt want too many Graeme Swanns in your side. That would be rather draining; its probably best that the skipper [Andrew Strauss] only refers to one of his charges as a buffoon.         
	But these days Swann knows when the laughs must stop and when the work must begin. Take Saturday morning, for example. Not involved in the three-day match against Victoria, he was asked to report to the ground to attend to some twelfth-man duties.         
	But first there was some lung-bursting sprint work with Jonathan Trott. Swann is a little fitter than he once was. I saw a video of myself the other day from a few years ago, he says, and I looked a right porker. Youre not going to mess around with our fitness trainer Huw [Bevan]. When he says go do some running, you just do it.         
	It is remarkable to think that it is only two years ago  almost to the day  that Swann made his Test debut. So much has happened since. So much success. And Swann makes it sound all so simple: You get better as you play more Test cricket, he says. Its exactly the same game as county cricket; its just that the pressure is ramped up tenfold and that can cause funny things to happen. The best batsmen, I believe, are the ones who treat Test matches as if it is a knock in the back garden and thats what I try and do with my bowling.         
	But it is easier being 31 and having bowled for 12 years. I dont have to worry about my action. I can just try to block everything out apart from getting the bloke out.         
	Indeed. And that works rather well on a regular basis. Currently Swann is ranked No 2 bowler in the world. By the end of the year he could be No 1.         
	Im fed up of telling Alastair Cook that I dont believe in stats, he says, But if theyre going to put me there then maybe Ill have to start believing in them. I know this might sound like a cliche, but I dont give a monkeys where I am in the world as long as we win the Ashes.         
	And goodness England are nearing that goal. But Swann has a word of warning; about the Headingley Test of last year when the Ashes were in reach, and England were hammered.         
	One of the problems then, he says, was that so many people started picking up wind of the fact, hang on, if we win this game, we win the Ashes. The second you do that ... well, the old Chinese proverb says: He who looks at the clouds takes his eyes off the plough.         
	Im not sure it does, but the sentiment is logical. We certainly dont think were infallible, he says, because we had that excellent win over South Africa in Durban [last winter] and then ended up hanging on for the rest of that series. We know that weve got to play some great cricket just to keep this series as competitive as it has been.         
	But Swann goes to Perth confident of the conditions, after playing in the warm-up match there earlier in the tour against Western Australia.         
	He bowled rustily in the first innings, but took four wickets in the second. Any time that you have played on a ground before it is a massive help, he says,         
	Theres some bounce there but maybe not the pace of old, and you get a lot of drift because of the wind. There is a slight camber on the pitch too. But Im looking forward to it. Had I not played there, Id be quite nervous.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

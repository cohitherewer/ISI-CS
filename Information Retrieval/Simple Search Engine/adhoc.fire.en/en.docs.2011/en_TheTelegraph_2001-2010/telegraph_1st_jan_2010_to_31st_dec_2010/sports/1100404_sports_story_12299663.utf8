	Sepang: Mark Webber has secured pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix but Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton will have their work cut out to salvage something from the race after becoming victims of the weather in a qualifying session that was seriously affected by rain.         
	After a deluge had delayed the final phase of qualifying, Webber took a gamble to switch to intermediate tyres and it paid off as the Australian clocked a time of one minute 49.327 seconds.         
	Mercedes Nico Rosberg starts on the front row after securing second place while Sebastian Vettel completed a pleasing day for Red Bull as he lines up third.         
	It will be even more pleasing for Red Bull that rivals McLaren and Ferrari start from towards the back of the grid after their drivers failed to progress from Q1.         
	Showers began to fall shortly before the session got under way and both teams decided to delay sending out their drivers in the hope the rain would subside.         
	It proved a costly error of judgement, however, as Button spun into the gravel to bring a premature end to his session and he lines up 17th on the grid Sunday while Hamilton struggled to find the pace he needed and will start from 20th.         
	We made the wrong call and we paid for it, said Button afterwards.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil takes fourth place on the grid with Williams rookie Nico Hulkenberg securing fifth while Renaults Robert Kubica claimed sixth. Rubens Barrichello lines up in seventh in his Williams with Mercedes Michael Schumacher eighth.         
	Kamui Kobayashi secured his place inside the top 10 for the first time this season and starts from ninth in his BMW Sauber while Force Indias Vitantonio Liuzzi starts from 10th.         
	Renaults Vitaly Petrov takes 11th place while BMW Saubers Pedro de la Rosa begins from 12th place on the grid.HRT duo Karun Chandhok and Bruno Senna start from 22nd and 23rd with Virgin Racings Lucas di Grassi in 24th place.

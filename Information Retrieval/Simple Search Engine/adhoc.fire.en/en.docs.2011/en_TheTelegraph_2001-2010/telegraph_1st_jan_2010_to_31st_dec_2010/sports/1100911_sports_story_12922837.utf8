                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian GP circuit will be one of the fastest
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The race track for next years Indian GP will be one of the fastest in the world, the organisers of the nations first Formula One race said on Friday.         
	Addressing a press conference in Greater Noida, some 50 kilometres from the capital, where the construction of the 5.14 kilometres race track would be completed by the middle of next year, the vice president (operations) of JayPee Sports International (JPSI), Mark Hughes said: It will be one of the fastest circuits and will pose great challenge for the drivers.         
	It was a flat land and we moved some four million cubic tons of earth to bring in elevation which can be up to 14 metres. The drivers are all excited. Its wild at that point. One mistake and you will be out of the race, Hughes said.         
	The 2011 F1 season will start with the Bahrain GP on March 13 and will conclude on November 27 with the Brazilian GP.         
	From the first turn to the third, the track goes up 14 metres, which will give a challenge to drivers. Turn No. 10 and 11 are very fast corners and cars will move 200 kilometres per hour in these courses, Hughes added.         
	The track will have 16 turns and would need superb skills to negotiate, said Hughes. The ongoing construction work is being carried out as per the guidelines set by the FIA.         
	The organisers have taken great pains in designing the track and inputs from some of the top Formula One teams and drivers were incorporated in the final plan.         
	So far, (Hispania driver) Karun Chandhok has visited the track but over the next 12 months, we will invite some other Formula One drivers. (Force India chairman) Vijay (Mallya) is interested too as it would be their home track, Hughes said.         
	Boris Lazaric, who is in-charge of the construction work, said the facility would accommodate 100,000-plus spectators. The main grand stand will house 20,000, the temporary grand stands will accommodate 70,000, while another 5000-6000 can sit in the pit building. Besides, there will be three natural grand stands, which are basically hillocks where people can sit and watch.         
	The race allotted to India is subject to FIA homologation but Hughes is confident that world governing body (FIA) will approve the circuit.         
	Homologation is the approval process a race track must go through to be part of a league or series. The regulations and rules that must be met are generally set by the series sanctioning body  in this case the FIA.         
	Homologation process is not (a matter of) one day. It takes a number of weeks. It will happen in May next year. The FIA team will come and verify if the work has been done according to the design approved by them.         
	There is a specific set of guidelines and they follow it strictly. They will see safety measures and if they are happy, it (homologation) is over, Hughes said.         
	Asked how only one race in a year would make the project commercially viable, the managing director JPSI, Sameer Gaur said his company has planned to open a racing school and academy so that the youngsters can come forward to take up the sport.         
	Gaur said that his company would conduct MotoGP races at the same place where the Formula One event will take place.

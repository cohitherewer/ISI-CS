	Nottingham: Raqibul Hasan hit a patient 76 as Bangladesh made 250 for nine from 50 overs against England in the first ODI on Thursday.         
	Raqibuls innings lasted 95 balls and included seven fours, while Junaid Siddique made 51 from 70 balls, including five fours.         
	Englands James Anderson claimed three for 74, while Tim Bresnan took two for 40 and Stuart Broad two for 43.         
	Bangladesh won the toss for the opening game in the three-match series and opted to bat in front of a disappointing crowd at Trent Bridge, which was only around half full.         
	Openers Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes started aggressively, scoring 22 from the first couple of overs and hitting James Anderson out of the attack.         
	However Tamim, who struck fours from the first two balls of the innings, was out leg before to Stuart Broad with the first ball of the sixth over. Tamim scored 28.         
	 The scoring rate slowed and when Anderson returned he had Imrul caught by Eoin Morgan at cover in the 14th over.           (AGENCIES)

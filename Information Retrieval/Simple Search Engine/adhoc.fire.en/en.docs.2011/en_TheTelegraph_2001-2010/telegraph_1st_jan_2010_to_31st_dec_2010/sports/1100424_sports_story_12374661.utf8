The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand out to defend title
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand out to defend title
  - Indian gm to start with black pieces                             
	Sofia: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand will have black pieces against local favourite Veselin Topalov in the first match of the 12-game World Chess Championship here on Saturday.         
	Travel-weary Anand had requested a three-day postponement after arriving here four days late due to the air traffic disruption caused by the ash cloud from the volcano in Iceland, but the organisers pushed back the event at the Military Club in Sofia by just one day.         
	I am very happy to be here, it was a longer trip than what Id expected. The main thing I came here for is to play chess, the Indian wizard had said ahead of his first match. I want to thank FIDE for the understanding and I hope chess fans will see a good match.         
	Anand has won the title on three occasions  2000, 2007, 2008  while Topalov is the 2005 winner.         
	The match consists of 12 games and the first to score 6.5 points will be the winner. In case the scores are equal at 6-6, four tiebreak games will be played in the Rapid format on May 13.         
	A rest day is scheduled after every two games. The prize fund is euros 2,000,000, the highest ever in recent times and will be shared by the two players.         
	Pananqiotis Nikolopoulos of Greece is the chief arbiter. The head-to-head count favours Topalov who has a slight edge over Anand, having won on 11 occasions to Anands 10 out of the 44 encounters against each other.         
	In terms of match experience, Anand is the favourite and showed sparkling form in 2008 against Vladimir Kramnik in Germany. Topalov, on the other hand, had lost to Kramnik in the Reunification Match in 2006. Anand will be backed by an eight-member team but he has not divulged the names of seconds.         
	While Topalov had earlier said that Anand is unlikely to change his team from his last championship clash against Kramnik, speculation is rife that the Indian will spring at least one surprise.         
	GM Peter Heine Nielsen is definitely there, as Anand had said earlier, and since Surya Sekhar Ganguly is not participating at the Asian Championship at Subic Bay in the Philippines, he too looks like being on Anands team.         
	Anand had won his first world championship in 2000, but the chess world had been split by Garri Kasparov who walked out of the official body, Fide, in 1993 and formed a rebel association. The rival bodies unified in 2006, enhancing the value of the title.

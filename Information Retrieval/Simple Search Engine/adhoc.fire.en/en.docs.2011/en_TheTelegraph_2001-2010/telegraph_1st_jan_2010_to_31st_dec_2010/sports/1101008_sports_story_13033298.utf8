The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Medical staff not good, says Akhil
                                                                                                                       7                                      Medical staff not good, says Akhil
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: Bantamweight boxer Akhil Kumar once aga-in dropped a bombshell on Thursday when he said the medical staff with the Indian boxing team for the Commonwealth Games was not good enough to take care of the pugilists.         
	Akhil created a similar controversy on the eve of the Beijing Olympics in 2008. At that time, he vehemently protested against the non-inclusion of physiotherapist Heath Mathews in the team, which forced the Indian Boxing Federation to take the him back.         
	On Thursday, minutes after he battered Pakistani Qadir Khan, Akhil said: The team (India) does not have good doctors and enough medical facilities, which hinders the recovery process after injuries.         
	I was injured a couple of months ago and the doctors couldnt help me in anyway. Boxing is a contact sport and we need good medical staff to ensure that injuries and recovery are taken care of properly, said the 2006 CWG 56kg champion.         
	National boxing federation secretary P.K. Muralidharan Raja, however, tried to play down the complaints.         
	It is his personal view. I dont believe in gagging anyone, said Raja. We have our dedicated team of a doctor, physiotherapist and masseur.

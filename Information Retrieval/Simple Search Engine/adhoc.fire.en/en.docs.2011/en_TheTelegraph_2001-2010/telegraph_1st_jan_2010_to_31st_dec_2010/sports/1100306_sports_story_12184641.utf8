The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asian teams facing dead end
                                                                                                                       7                                      Asian teams facing dead end
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  The Netherlands Taeke Taekma gets past a Canada player in New Delhi, on Friday. (PTI)      
	New Delhi: The domination of Asia in World Cup hockey is a thing of the past. And thats not a very recent development either because barring South Korea, no other Asian nation could make the semi-finals in the last two editions.         
	The situation could get worse this time, in the Hero Honda World Cup. With South Korea going down to New Zealand 1-2 in pool A on Friday, the chances of an Asian team entering the penultimate round looks bleak.         
	In pool B, four-time champions Pakistan and hosts India are placed behind England, Australia and Spain and need lots of luck to qualify for the next stage.         
	At the end of Round III, in pool A, the Netherlands with nine points are almost certain to enter the semi-finals. Germany are placed second with seven followed by New Zealand on six and the Koreans on four. Argentina and Canada are yet to log any points.         
	Germany have two tough matches in hand. While they play the mighty Dutch on Sunday, their last match is against New Zealand, who, too, are now in contention for a last-four berth. The Black Caps, however, can hope to log full points against Argentina in their next match.         
	In pool B, three teams  England, Australia and Spain  are likely to fight it out for the two spots. England are best-placed with nine points and a win against India on Saturday would surely clear their path to the semis.         
	Spain are back in the fray after the win against India but their next two matches are against Australia on Saturday and England on Monday. Given their current form, not many expect the Spanish to pip the Aussies to a semi-final place.         
	As far as India are concerned, they have to win their next two matches by a good margin and pray for the other teams to falter in the final two rounds. The same goes for Pakistan.

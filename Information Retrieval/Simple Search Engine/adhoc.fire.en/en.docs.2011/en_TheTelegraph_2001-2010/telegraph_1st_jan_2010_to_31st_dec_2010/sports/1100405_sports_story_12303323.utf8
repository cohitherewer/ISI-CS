The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This was just a one-off game: Gayle
                                                                                                                       7                                      This was just a one-off game: Gayle
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chris Gayle, at the press conference on Saturday, refused to blame the bowlers for the Kolkata Knight Riders eight wicket loss against the Kings XI Punjab.         
	We have been doing a wonderful job with the ball. This was just a one-off game... We have to be positive going into our next game. It will be an uphill task from here on. We have five more matches to go and most likely have to win all of them. But in T20, anything is possible, he said.         
	Gayle, however, termed the defeat as very disappointing. A total of 200 on any ground was good... You also have to take into consideration that the outfield was quick... But you cannot take away the fact that they batted well. You have to give them the credit. Kings XI Punjab had nothing to lose and there was no pressure on them. They played freely. It was a very crucial loss for us, he said. He, however, hoped that the players would get better and eventually adapt to the situation as quickly as possible.         
	Did Murali Kartiks dropped catch of Mahela Jayawardene prove crucial? In cricket such things can happen to anyone Mahela Jayawardene batted really well Sangakkara also did well. Yuvi came in and finished it off.         
	Gayle said he enjoyed getting back among runs. Its good to be back among runs. I started a bit slow but the captain was batting really well That really took the pressure off me. One Sourav left, I had to pick it up... Very fortunate         
	Gayle also admitted it was tough for the team management to decide on the four foreign players. He, however, added: I dont know what happened I am not part of the selection process. At the same time, I think they didnt wish to chop and change too much.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Junior brace in Chirag victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Junior brace in Chirag victory
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharya considered the AIFF XI team no good after Chirag United beat them 2-1 in their inaugural I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. The Chirag coach ridiculed the hoopla created over the junior national team and dubbed them as a bunch of rookies without talent.         
	They are kids. Forget 2018, this team cant even make it to the 4018 World Cup. This batch lacks players with individual skills. Show me one Krishanu Dey or a Sisir Ghosh in this team Of course, they ran a lot, but there was nothing new in their game plan. They depend on long balls and thats not football, Bhattacharya said.         
	The Chirag coach ensconced himself in the three points his team garnered from the first match, but a re-look at Fridays tie would suggest that Chirag were ordinary minus their two foreign recruits, Junior Elijah and Joshimar. It was Juniors brace that won Chirag the match but the victory didnt come without the hosts share of comeuppance.         
	The home team used the first opportunity that came their way on the third minute when Joshimars cross from the right was slotted in by Junior. The AIFF XI took some time to shrug off the inertia and the entire defence line was caught napping while the Nigerian slyly slipped in to score the opener.         
	But AIFF XI medio Ralte Lalrindika scored the equaliser with a piledriver in the 21st minute. Clearly, the goal had put the home side on notice and Chirag lived dangerously in the next few minutes. Lalrindikas freekick hit the side post and a Jeje Lalpekhluas in-stepper hit the side net.         
	AIFF XI defenders, Inderpreet Singh and Raju Gaikwad, denied Joshimar for a long time, but the Brazilian had the last laugh when Vishal Kumar failed to clear a long ball and Joshimar played it square to Elijah, who tapped it in for his and teams second goal.

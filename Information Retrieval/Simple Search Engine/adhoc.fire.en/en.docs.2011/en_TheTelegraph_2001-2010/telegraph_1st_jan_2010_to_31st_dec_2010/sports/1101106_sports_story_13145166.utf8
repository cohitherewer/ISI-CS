                                                                                                                       7                                      Documentary may damage World Cup bid, fears England
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Andy Anson, the chief executive of Englands 2018 World Cup bid team, has held discussions this week with Mark Thompson, the BBC director-general, amid fears that a forthcoming documentary could effectively kill their hopes before the Fifa executive committees decision next month.         
	The England bid team are increasingly concerned about the ill feeling that has arisen on the Fifa executive committee after The Sunday Timess recent allegations of corruption. One Fifa source suggested Thursday that the Englands concerns are justified and that the documentary could cause irreparable damage to the bid.         
	Anson and his colleagues have been concerned about the potential impact of the documentary since the summer, but the rising tensions on the committee since The Sunday Times allegations, have led him to convey his concerns to Thompson about the damage that further controversy could cause.         
	The conversation between Anson and Thompson is a sensitive matter for both sides, neither of which was willing to confirm officially Thursday that it took place, but the BBC Director-General is understood to have stated that the documentary will be broadcast as planned  it is believed on November 29, three days before the vote.         
	The bid team are not aware of the content of the documentary, which is being closely guarded, but both they and Fifa are worried by the involvement of Andrew Jennings, the investigative journalist who wrote Foul! The Secret World of Fifa: Bribes, Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals.

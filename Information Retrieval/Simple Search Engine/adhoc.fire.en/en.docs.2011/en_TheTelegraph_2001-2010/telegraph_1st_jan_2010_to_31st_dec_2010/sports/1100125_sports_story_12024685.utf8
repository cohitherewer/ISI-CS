The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant: Im more patient now
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ishant: Im more patient now
                      
	Dhaka: Ishant Sharma, who took four wickets in Bangladeshs first innings Sunday, said the time spent outside the team has taught him to be more patient.         
	Ishant said the selectors were right in dropping him from the home series against Sri Lanka since he, too, was convinced that going by form, he did not deserve a place.         
	It was a very hard time for me in those days. I was desperate to play for the country. It was the first time I was experiencing that because for the last three years, my career has been up and up.         
	But I learnt from that experience that I should be patient in life and in bowling also, Ishant told reporters after the opening days play of the second and final Test.         
	I dont think in the form I was in at that time I deserved a place in the ODI side (against Sri Lanka). I dont think I have any technical flaw. It (being dropped) is part and parcel of any cricketers life. You have to face that and it was a challenge. I am happy that I learnt to be patient during hard times, he added.         
	Ishant also thanked his Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag and feels the dashing opener played a role in his comeback bid.         
	All the senior players helped me a lot when I made my comeback. I want to thank Viru as I think he had a role to play in my selection in the first Test in Chittagong, Ishant said.         
	The pacer said new bowling coach Eric Simmons was also helping him to gain his rhythm back.         
	I think I have got back my rhythm. It is really good to get the rhythm back at the beginning of the season as a big series against South Africa is coming next month. It is good for me and for the team, said the 21-year-old.(PTI)

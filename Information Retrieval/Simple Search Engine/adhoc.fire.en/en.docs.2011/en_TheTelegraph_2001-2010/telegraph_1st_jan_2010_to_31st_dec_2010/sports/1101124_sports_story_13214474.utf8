The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India showed us how to bat
                                                                                                                       7                                      India showed us how to bat
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Daniel Vettori feels their batting let them down in the final Test against India. At a press conference, here, the New Zealand skipper also hailed Ishant Sharma for a sharp bowling performance.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Reasons for the loss         
	I think after winning the toss, scoring 193 put us under a lot of pressure And on the third morning, we bowled so well and took three wickets but couldnt capitalise on that. Dhoni and Dravid played exceptionally well. There were lots of niggles for us, but I think India showed us how to bat, especially in this Test.         
	Whether they surrendered too early on Tuesday         
	Any time you lose, you surrender too early... We are disappointed with our performance.         
	If New Zealand wasnt up for it mentally         
	Its hard to comment I can only look at the overall performance and say it was poor compared to the first two Tests.         
	On the positives from the series         
	As a batting unit, number of guys --- it was the first time for all of them --- did well McIntosh, McCullum, Ryder and Kane Williamson... Its an exciting group of batsmen... We have to now learn from India about batting long periods of time day in and day out.         
	If Jesse Ryder would be available for the ODIs         
	I think he is going home. I cant confirm, but I think he is         
	His views on Ishants performance         
	The real difference was Ishant Sharma. To take seven wickets on this surface... We knew we were in for a challenge against spinners. But we should have done better against the seamers.

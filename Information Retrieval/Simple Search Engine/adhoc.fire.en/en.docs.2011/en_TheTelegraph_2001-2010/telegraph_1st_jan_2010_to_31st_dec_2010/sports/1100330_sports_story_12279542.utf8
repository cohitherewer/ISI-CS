The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No Elin when Tiger tees off
                                                                                                                       7                                        No Elin when Tiger tees off
                                      
	Tiger Woods will have his faithful caddy by his side when he plays at the Augusta Masters  but not his wife.         
	Elin Nordegren will be winging it to her Swedish homeland while her louse-of-a-spouse makes his much-hyped return to professional golf on April 8.         
	Elin does not want to go to the Masters and is preparing for a trip to see her family and friends in Sweden, a source in Nordegrens camp told People.com, a US newspaper reported.         
	She is also being asked by Tiger to attend the Masters, even if for a half day, to look like she is interested in supporting his return to golf. But she would rather not be there.         
	Woods has been desperately trying to repair his marriage to Nordegren  and reclaim his good guy public image  following revelations he cheated with a legion of shady ladies.         
	While Nordegren visited Woods while he underwent sex addiction therapy, she was nowhere to be seen when the worlds greatest golfer publicly apologised for being a heel.         
	Nor has Nordegren returned to the family mansion outside Orlando, which is where the scandal broke on November 27 after Woods drove his SUV into a tree while apparently trying to escape his furious wife.         
	And when Nordegren flies home, shell be flying commercial  not on the family jet, the source said.         
	Tigers plane is too in your face for her now, the source said. She really does not want to go to Augusta, and it is easier for her to be far away than home in Orlando.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chittagong: Just days after telling The Telegraph that he wasnt one for records, Gautam Gambhir joined a very exclusive bunch, on Wednesday.         
	At the end of Day IV of the first Test, he spoke to the media at the Z.A. Chowdhury Stadium.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Its not that Im chasing (Sir Don) Bradman... Ill be very happy if, along the way, I get to six hundreds in six Tests... If I start thinking of records, then Ill be under more pressure...         
	Whats most important is that I give good starts... I need to build on them, for one never really knows what may happen in the next innings...         
	I dont set targets, because whenever I have, Ive not achieved them! I look at every innings as possibly being my last...         
	Playing for the country is the biggest motivation, not records or awards... The day that motivation dries up, Ill stop playing...         
	I know Ive been dropped a number of times, but I dont look back... I like to look ahead... Id score in the Ranji Trophy and tell myself that if I could get runs there, why not for India? Id work hard...         
	Actually, Id love to keep coming back to Bangladesh... My ODI debut was in Bangladesh (in 2003), then I made my ODI comeback in Bangladesh (2007)... It has been pretty lucky for me...         
	Its Viru (Virender Sehwag) who said I should look to convert 50s into 100s if I was to be successful... Ive tried to follow his advice...         
	I wouldnt like to put pressure on myself by saying that the only challenge left is to score (in Tests) in Australia and South Africa... But, yes, there are more challenges for openers there...         
	The wicket here has turned flat... If they (Bangladesh) play positively, then anything can happen... If we bowl well, we will win... The wicket has had something for everybody...    
	FIVE IN FIVE

	London: Shaun Udal, skipper of the English county side Middlesex has accused the Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) in India of trying to scupper their plan to sign Sachin Tendulkar for the domestic Twenty20 tournament.         
	Udal said their effort to make Tendulkar play for their side later this year might end in smoke as a tournament was scheduled in the sub-continent in June, date of which clashes with the English domestic T20 competition.         
	We know he (Sachin) is very keen and basically he would love to come but the BCCI have not been as positive as Sachin would like, Udal said. (PTI)

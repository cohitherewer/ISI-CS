	brazil  
	It almost goes without saying that Brazil, the five-time world champions, go into every World Cup heavily favoured to add yet another star to the legendary Amarelinha shirt. Having played for A Selecao at three editions of the global showpiece, coach Dunga will be fully aware that any outcome other than a sixth world crown will likely be considered a failure. But pressure never seems to tell on the Brazilians who are always looking to have fun.  
	Road to South Africa            
	 Clinched passage with three matchdays to spare, confirming their berth with a 3-1 away defeat of archrivals Argentina.   
	Star player  
	Kaka, with his silken moves and creative play, is the man the Brazilians will look to for inspiration on the field.   
	Coach  
	 Despite the Brazilian national team position being his first coaching role, Dunga answered his critics by guiding the team to triumph in the 2007 Copa America and the 2009 Confederations Cup.   
	Record  
	 Brazil will contest their 19th consecutive World Cup finals and are the only country to have taken part in every edition of the global showpiece. They are also the only country to have won the title five times. They are also the only country to have won the title five times: amassing a total of 64 victories, 14 draws and 14 defeats in 92 games played.

	north korea  
	North Korea seemingly came from nowhere to storm into the Asian Zone's final round of qualifying, where they defied sizeable odds to take one of the continent's four automatic spots at the World Cup. In a sense they lived up to their long-standing reputation as Asia's surprise packages, their qualifying success marking a return to world football's top table for the first time since going all the way to the last eight in 1966.  
	Road to South Africa             
	Needing just a point against Saudi Arabia in the closing game to qualify, they bravely held on for a goalless draw to seal their passage.   
	Star player  
	Striker Jong Tae-Se chose to discard his South Korean citizenship to play for the North Korean national team. He plies his trade in Japan and has the power and pace to breach any rearguard in a team largely made up of home-based players.  
	Coach  
	 Coach Kim Jong-Hun was only ten years old when the Chollima made history at England 1966 and now, 43 years on, he was the man who guided them back to the pinnacle of world football with a pragmatic and defensive approach based around discipline and teamwork.   
	Record  
	 Going into the global showpiece as debutants in England in 1966, the unfancied East Asians undid European heavyweights Italy with a single-goal victory to march into the quarter-finals. In what remains one of the all-time classic encounters in FifaWorld Cup history, they flew into a three-goal lead against Portugal within 25 minutes, only for Eusebio to go on to strike no fewer than four times in a 5-3 comeback win for the Selec ccedil; atilde;o das Quinas.

  First Int rsquo;l: Vs Mongolia in 2007  
	Ivory Coast  
	Ivory Coast are seen by many as the most likely African nation to make an impact at South Africa. With world class talent throughout the starting XI, it is Les Elephants who carry the continent rsquo;s hopes in 2010. They also have a point to prove after being eliminated in the first round at Germany rsquo;06, albeit in an extremely difficult group, where they lost 1-2 to Argentina and the Netherlands before eventually beating Serbia and Montenegro 3-2.   
	Road to South Africa             
	Ivory Coast strode through qualifying without losing a match, running away with their final qualifying group ahead of Burkina Faso, Malawi and Guinea.   
	Star player  
	Given that Didier Drogba is doubtful with a fractured arm, the onus will be on Barcelona rsquo;s midfield powerhouse Yaya Toure to control the game and and rally the team. The younger Toure, elder brother Kolo is at Manchester City, has had enough practice at the heart of Europe rsquo;s best midfield.   
	Coach  
	 South Africa 2010 will be Eriksson rsquo;s third World Cup after leading England to the quarter finals in 2002 and 2006. He is a vastly experienced club coach and has led teams in his native Sweden, Portugal, England and Italy.  
	Record  
	 Germany 2006 was Ivory Coast rsquo;s first appearance in the World Cup.

  First Int rsquo;l: Vs Egypt in 2004  
	Portugal  
	Finalists at Euro 2004 and semi-finalists at Germany '06, Portugal have displayed some dazzling football in recent years, but without ever landing a major prize. Having never progressed beyond the semi-finals of the World Cup, the team will be aiming to go all the way this time around. Mozambique-born coach Carlos Queiroz is no stranger to South Africa, and his previous experience as the host nation's coach could prove invaluable.   
	Road to South Africa             
	Despite the absence of Ronaldo for the two-legged play-off tie against Bosnia-Herzegovina, they won home and away to clinch a comfortable 2-0 aggregate victory.   
	Star player  
	 Although Cristiano Ronaldo, the 2008 Fifa World Player, played a subdued role in qualification, the Real Madrid star is known for his ability to rise to the occasion. The prsence of fellow Real star Kaka in the same group presents a very interesting subplot.  
	Coach  
	In his second term as the senior team coach, Carlos Queiroz, Alex Ferguson's former assistant at Manchester United would be looking to make amends for past disappointments.  
	Record  
	 Portugal set the bar incredibly high on their World Cup debut in 1966, walking away with a third-place finish along with the Golden Boot award for Eusebio. This is their fifth appearance at the World Cup

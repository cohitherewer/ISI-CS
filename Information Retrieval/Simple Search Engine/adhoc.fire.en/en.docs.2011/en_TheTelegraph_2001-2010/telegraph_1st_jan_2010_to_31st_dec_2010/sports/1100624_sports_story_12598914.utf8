The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diego rants at Fifa
                                                                                                                       7                                      Diego rants at Fifa
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Polokwane: Tuesday night at the Peter Mokaba Stadium clearly belonged to Diego Maradona, both on and off the pitch. After leading his men to the second round with nine points, the Argentina coach launched a broadside against Fifa and the media saying both should learn from their mistakes.         
	On the ground, Maradonas boys did everything right. The coach made seven changes from the team that played against South Korea, yet ran away with a fluent 2-0 win over an ultra-defensive Greece with Martin Demichelis and substitute Martin Palermo scoring in the last 13 minutes.         
	Later, Maradona, in his grey beard and matching suite, was restrained but did not miss an opportunity to take a dig at his detractors. While he advised a section of the Argentine media to apologise to the players for having undermined their abilities, he called on Fifa to enforce fair play in the World Cup.         
	For a change, the stormy petrel cannot be faulted. With Argentina struggling to qualify for the World Cup, the domestic media tore into the players and called for the coachs head. On Tuesday, Maradona said: Everything you said were wrong... You even showed a lack of respect for these players... you should apologise to these players because they give everything on the pitch, because they are 100 per cent professional.         
	Were doing our duty, were defending the Argentine colours which weve always done. These same players were in the qualifiers. Anybody can make a mistake but Id love it for those on the other side to say sorry.         
	Maradona was particularly unhappy with the manner Lionel Messi was treated on Tuesday night. The stand-in Argentina captain, arguably the biggest star at this World Cup, received little protection from the referee while being fouled repeatedly by the Greeks.         
	There is no fair play here I am convinced, Maradona said with a shrug. Even the fourth referee was not ready to listen. I tell them in every match but who cares.         
	Fifa should see what is happening here, the famous fair play doesnt exist here. Lets make it effective once and for all. Because if each time Messi gets the ball they bring him down, what are we playing at? he asked.         
	After repeated fouls, take out the yellow card to the third (player) who hits Messi, and youll see that defenders dont hit him any more. Why didnt the referee do that? Its in the regulations, man, Maradona was furious.         
	Finally, when the topic changed to Argentinas chances in the World Cup, Maradona immediately retreated into a shell. Its not easy to predict so early, he said in a matter-of-fact tone. All I can say is that we are on the right track.         
	Now the road gets more difficult, said Maradona.         
	With an all-win record in the group stage, Argentina are fast becoming the favourites and Maradona is surely formulating meticulous plans and strategies for the battles ahead.         
	The move to make Messi the youngest Argentine ever to have led the national side was a masterstroke as the Barcelona star was simply bowled over by his managers gesture. It was a unique experience  something very special, said Messi. As soon as I knew about it, I thought it was just great, unique.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Will stick to game plan, says Pantsil
                      
	Johannesburg: Ghana will stick to the tactics that have proved successful so far in the World Cup when they take on Uruguay for a place in the semi-finals, defender John Pantsil said on Monday.         
	The team, which became only the third African nation ever to advance to the quarter final stage of the World Cup, also had no fears about dealing with the attacking qualities the South Americans had shown so far in the tournament, players said.         
	I dont think there is anything to change in our game. We are going to stick with our game plan  just relax and play our normal, good football and keep our positions and heads together, Pantsil told a website.         
	Under Serbian coach Milovan Rajevac, Ghana, the only African team to make it through the group stage, have impressed many with their stubborn defence and the creativity in the midfield of Kevin-Prince Boateng and Dede Ayew.         
	However, coach Rajevac is racing against time to have his squad ready for the game in Johannesburg on Friday following injuries to key players and the suspension of Ayew and Jonathan Mensah.

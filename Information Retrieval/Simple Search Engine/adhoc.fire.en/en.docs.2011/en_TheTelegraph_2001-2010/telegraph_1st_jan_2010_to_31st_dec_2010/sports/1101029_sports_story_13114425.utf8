The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No Twitter ban for England
                                                                                                                       7                                      No Twitter ban for England
                      
	London: England players will be allowed to express their thoughts on Twitter during the Ashes tour of Australia despite previous mishaps over the use of the online communication tool.         
	James Anderson, Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad all have Twitter accounts but team management decided against an outright ban even after Kevin Pietersen used the site this year to post an expletive-laden complaint about his omission from the one-day side.         
	Captain Andrew Strauss says, We like to treat people like adults and that were going to come up with a set of guidelines as to whats best to put on there and whats best not to put on there.         
	Cricket Australia, too, had said earlier, in August, that they had no problem with players using social networking sites.         
	Micael Brown, CA general manager, had said: At this stage, its really important that we are on about growing the game and embracing the future, and young people are a critical part of it.         
	We want young people to be associated with the game.         
	Australian captain Ricky Ponting had said the networking sites were a good way for the public to get to know players behind the helmet.           (AGENCIES)

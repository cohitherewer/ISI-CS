The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India tour is not ideal before Ashes: Ricky 
                                                                                                                       7                                        India tour is not ideal before Ashes: Ricky 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Ricky Ponting                           
	When it was announced that Australia would play a mini Test and one-day series in India in October, the news was met with anger in England because it meant the counties would not be able to play in the lucrative Champions League.         
	The bigger picture could, however, be a little more fulfilling for English cricket, with the tour denying Australia an ideal warm-up for the Ashes series.         
	Australias batsmen will be denied a prolonged period in home conditions before the Ashes starts after their board agreed to replace a seven-match one-day series in India with Tests in Mohali and Bangalore, as well as three 50-over matches. This adds up to a challenging and potentially draining month in India.         
	The tour to India is due to begin on September 25 and end on October 24, leaving less than a month for the Australians to settle back into home conditions before the first Ashes Test in Brisbane on November 25.         
	If you were trying to set down and map your perfect preparation for an Ashes series or a home series, it probably wouldnt be playing two Test matches in India, said Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain. But you dont live in an ideal world. Thats the way international cricket is these days.         
	Well wait and see who weve got thats fit and ready to go for that tour and pick a squad of players we think can win a Test series over there, and then worry about the start of the Ashes after that.         
	While the Australian skipper voiced concerns about the series with India, opener Simon Katich has admitted that the side will face a tough final preparation for the Ashes series, when they tour India later this year.         
	Katich, who returned to Sydney on Monday after Australia drew their Test series against Pakistan 1-1 in England, knows how difficult a tour of India can be after he was a part of the team comfortably beaten in a four-Test series in 2008.         
	It will be very tough, Katich admitted.         
	We were there in 2008, lost 2-0 and found it hard work and we are back at two of the venues we were at in 2008. Theres no doubt they have got a very good side, they love playing at home, they will have their home crowd supporting them.         
	We do have obviously quite a few young guys stepping into Test cricket now who havent played in India before, so that will be a test for them, but its going to be a good challenge.         
	On levelling the recently-concluded series with Pakistan, Katich said, I guess the guys probably would have been a little bit disappointed, but they were all trying and you cant fault their efforts.         
	They all put in and tried their hardest, it just didnt happen, so hopefully they will learn from that and be better for it.         
	Australia managed just 88 in the first innings at Headingley  their lowest score in 26 years  as they suffered their first Test defeat in nine games.         
	We were always playing catch-up after that (scoring 88). It was a disappointing end to the series. Its something that we need to work on a rectify going forward and looking to India and later on in the year with the Ashes, he added.

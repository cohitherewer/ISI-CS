The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reid lashes out at idiots
                                                                                                                       7                                      Reid lashes out at idiots
                      
	Wellington: Former New Zealand captain John Reid feels some members of the Australian cricket team are idiots who need to be reined in.         
	Reids comments came after Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson head-butted Scott Styris in a show of aggression during the first one-dayer in Napier.         
	Generally the Australian team looks good, but there are a handful of idiots who need to be reined in, Reid, also a former International Cricket Council Match Referee, said.         
	Do your work with the bat and the ball, not your mouth.         
	While some praised Johnson for sparking life into the series, Reid said the aggression displayed by the pacer was not required.         
	Reid said players need to understand the importance of playing the game in good spirit. Like it or not, these guys are role models for youngsters. Johnson was the aggressor, but hes mad, head-butting someone with a helmet on.         
	Reid claimed that during his playing days, the Australian players were always the worst at sledging. (PTI)

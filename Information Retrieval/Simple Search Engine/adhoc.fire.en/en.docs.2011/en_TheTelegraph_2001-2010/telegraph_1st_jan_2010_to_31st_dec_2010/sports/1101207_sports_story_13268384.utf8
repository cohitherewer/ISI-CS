The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Razzaq helps Bangla take 2-1 lead
                            Razzaq helps Bangla take 2-1 lead
                      
	Dhaka: Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzaq and paceman Shafiul Islam grabbed four wickets each on Monday to give Bangladesh a 65-run win over Zimbabwe in the third one-day International and a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.         
	Zimbabwe looked distinctly second best when they were reduced to 47 for six before limping to 181 all out in 48.1 overs chasing Bangladeshs challenging 246 for seven under a cloudy sky.         
	Razzaq plunged Zimbabwes innings into disarray with a superb first spell in which he claimed three wickets and conceded only four runs in as many overs.         
	He added another wicket in his second spell to finish with four for 14, his third consecutive haul of four or more wickets in ODIs. Only five other bowlers have managed the same feat.         
	Razzaqs tally in the series now stands at 13, including a hattrick in Bangladeshs six-wicket win in the second ODI on Friday.

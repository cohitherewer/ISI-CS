	Calcutta/New Delhi: India got recognition for playing some good game in last months Asian Games in Guangzhou with as many as six of their players making it to the Asian All Stars teams.         
	Ace drag-flicker Sandeep Singh shared the honours with captain Rajpal Singh, midfielder Arjun Halappa and defender Gurbaj Singh in the mens category. In the womens section, defender Joydeep Kaur and 16-year-old striker Rani Rampal made the cut, according to a Hockey India (HI) release.         
	The All Star team was selected recently by the Asian Hockey Federation based on the performance of the Guangzhou Games, where the Indian mens team won a bronze medal but the eves missed out on the podium, finishing fourth. It feels nice to be recognised, Halappa said when asked for his reaction.         
	Meanwhile, Halappa has backed former captain Dhanraj Pillay to be the chief coach of the Indian mens hockey team, saying the mercurial forwards immense experience and knowledge can do wonders for the national side. The mens hockey team is without a coach since last months Asian Games, where they won a bronze.         
	Dhanraj has been the role model for all of us. We have grown up seeing him playing. He knows the requirement of Indian players better then anybody else, Halappa said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Motera pitch no better: Bhajji
                                                                                                                       7                                        Motera pitch no better: Bhajji
                  Harbhajan Singh                     
	Jalandhar: Having aired his view that the Kotla track was unsuitable for international matches, star Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh Friday said that the Motera pitch in Ahmedabad is not ideal for Test cricket either.         
	The Ahmedabad pitch (which hosted the first India-Sri Lanka Test in November) was purely a batting pitch and the bowlers  be it me, Amit Mishra or Muttiah Murlidharan  all were butchered by the batsmen, which was not at all justice to the bowlers, Harbhajan said.         
	The drawn match in Ahmedabad produced 1598 runs and just 21 wickets in fell in five days of play.         
	We should not play Test matches on such kind of wicket, because they will finish all the bowlers. They are not fit for any kind of cricket, he said, adding that pitches should be made keeping a balance between the bat and the ball.         
	We should prepare such wickets for Test matches, where fast bowlers can get advantage on initial days and, later on, spinners can show their talent, said Harbhajan while giving full marks to the pitch at Cricket Club of India in Mumbai.         
	The 29-year-old spinner was happy that the Board of Control for Cricket in India was trying to arrange more Test matches this year, which he said would help India retain the top spot for longer time.         
	It is great idea to play more Tests. Winning more Test matches this year, India can maintain top position in Tests. In 2009, we played only six Tests and attained the world No. 1 spot. I hope this year we will at least play 10 to 12 Test matches and by winning most of them we can strengthen our top position, he said.         
	In the past 14 months, India has risen from third in the ICC Test Championships to the top position and Harbhajan feels the current side would be remembered as one of the best in Indian history.         
	If you see the record, we are the best side. We defeated New Zealand at their homeafter 35 years, defeated Australia after 24 years and won the Twenty20 World Cup. The team has achieved a lot and I think probably this is the best team People will remember its contribution for a long time, he said.         
	On the personal front, he was also happy with his contribution to the team which has become the top team in Test cricket.         
	I am satisfied with my performance. I took 29 wickets in the six Test matches in 2009, out of which six wickets against the Black Caps, which is always tough for any spinner on the pitches of New Zealand.         
	In 2008, I took 64 wickets in 12 Tests and if we had played the same number in 2009 I would have matched the 2008 performance, he said adding that he would now concentrate on his fitness as the game has now become more demanding.         
	Asked if at any point in his career he wanted captaincy, Harbhajan said: Every player wants to become the captain of the team. I know it is a very big responsibility, but you feel honoured when you the lead the team and yes, I will be honoured if captaincy comes to me in any stage of my career. As long as I am contributing to the success of the team I dont mind in accepting any challenge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis returns, finally
                                                                                                                       7                                        Younis returns, finally
                  Younis Khan                     
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Wednesday cleared former captain Younis Khan for national duty as he will replace injured Mohammed Yousuf in the squad for the one-day Internationals and Tests against South Africa.         
	Pakistan chief selector Mohsin Khan announced that Younis has been included in the national squad, after the PCB gave the clearance for selection.         
	The clearance came after Younis met PCB chairman Ijaz Butt earlier in the day, in Lahore, to resolve a longstanding dispute between the two.         
	The PCB chairman called me up and told that Younis has been cleared on disciplinary grounds and that now it is up to the selectors to decide whether he should be picked in the team for the South Africa series. It is our decision to pick him since we feel he is a big asset to the team, Mohsin said.         
	He said Younis would replace Yousuf, who has been ruled out of the ODIs and T20s against the Proteas due to a hamstring injury that requires two to three weeks for recovery.         
	Meanwhile, Younis told the media in Lahore that the meeting with Butt was held in a cordial atmosphere and all issues had been sorted out.         
	I am feeling relieved to be back in the team and I will try to live up to the expectations of the people, he said. Sources said the long-awaited meeting between them came after pressure from the government on Butt to resolve the issue as there was lot of criticism over the continued exclusion of the former captain from the team.         
	All misunderstandings between the two have been cleared now, one source said.         
	The PCB chief had refused to give clearance to the selectors to consider Younis for the last few months although an appellate tribunal had lifted an indefinite ban on the former captain in July.         
	The PCB had banned or fined seven players including Younis in March for indiscipline and misconduct on the tour to Australia earlier this year.         
	But the Board refused to clear him as they were unhappy with some of the statements made by Younis and his lawyer.         
	This resulted in Younis being kept out of the Asia Cup and the tour to England. Initially, he was also not considered for the South Africa series.         
	The chief selector told a press conference in Karachi that Younis would report for the conditioning camp in Lahore. (PTI)

	Greensboro: Arjun Atwal put himself in contention for his maiden PGA Tour title by regaining sole lead at the Wyndham Championship with a scintillating five-under 65 in the penultimate round here.         
	The Orlando-based Indian fired six birdies against a lone bogey to take his three-day total to 17-under 193, a good three strokes ahead of the chasing pack, at the Sedgefield Country Club.         
	Compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh, on the other hand, brought home a two-under 68 for the second successive day to drop nine places to tied 19th with a total of 10-under 200.         
	Atwal, who lost his PGA Tour card and had to win a qualifying tournament just to earn a spot here, shrugged off a fourth hole bogey and picked up birdies on the seventh and eighth hole to make the turn at one-under.         
	On his way back, he sank as many as four birdies at the 11th, 12th, 14th and 15th holes to stay at the top.         
	Im not your typical Monday qualifier, Atwal said.         
	Ive never won on the PGA Tour, but Ive won on almost every other tour Ive played. I dont see why its going to be different trying to win a tournament here. If Im hitting it well, and Im playing well, I dont see why I cant win, said the 37-year-old.         
	Atwal has won on the European, Asian and Nationwide tours and is one round away from becoming the first qualifier to win the ensuing tournament since Fred Wadsworth at the 1986 Southern Open.         
	Atwal, who came up short on the money list after his minor medical exemption for his shoulder injuries ran out, said securing the card for 2011 is top-most on his priority list.         
	I couldnt hit it out of my shadow when I came back. I just wanted to play, and I thought Id be okay ... (Rushing back) was stupid, now that I look at it, Atwal said.         
	Scott McCarron (63), Scott Piercy (64) and Lucas Glover (67) were tied for the second spot at 14-under 196.         
	For me, this is a playoff, said McCarron, No. 142 on the points list. I dont play well, then Im going home.         
	For the second time in three days, the Wyndham record round of 61 was reached. This time, it was Nas turn. Going off in the mornings first pairing after barely making the cut, he took full advantage of the fresh greens with seven birdies through 17 holes and an eagle on No. 5. When he got to the 18th, he took aim at one more birdie. Honestly, you know, I wanted the course record, Na said. I wasnt going to leave it short.

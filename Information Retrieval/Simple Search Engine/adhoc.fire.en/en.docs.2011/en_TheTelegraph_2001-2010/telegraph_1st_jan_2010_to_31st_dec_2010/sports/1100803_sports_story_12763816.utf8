The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf alone cant save Pak: Butt
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yousuf alone cant save Pak: Butt
                    Salman Butt                
	Nottingham: Pakistan captain Salman Butt insisted that recalling Mohammed Yousuf was far from a miracle cure for the teams batting problems after their crushing 354-run first Test loss to England.         
	Just hours after Pakistan were bowled out for 80  their lowest Test score against England  at Trent Bridge, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed former skipper Yousuf and left-arm spinner Reza Hasan had been added to the squad.         
	The 35-year-old, a batsman with 7,431 Test runs to his name at an average of over 53, announced his retirement in March, having been handed an indefinite ban by the PCB after Pakistans disastrous tour of Australia where the team failed to win a single international match under his leadership.         
	Butt, speaking before the PCB announced Yousufs call-up, insisted the team, as it stood, could turn things round in the five days between their defeat by England at Trent Bridge Sunday and the start of the second of a four-Test series at Edgbaston on Friday.         
	However, Butt was careful to avoid giving a direct answer when asked whether he favoured a recall for either Yousuf or Younis Khan, another ex-captain and experienced batsman who has been playing for English county Surrey this season.         
	To bring somebody in or to send somebody back is not in my hands. That is what the selectors are there for and its for the board to decide.         
	Nevertheless, Butt stressed it was important for his novices to be given a fair chance. (AFP)

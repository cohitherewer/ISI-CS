	Bridgetown: Its probably not too well known that Sir Donald Bradman, who passed away in 2001, had actually gone to Adelaide airport in 1971-72 to meet Sunil Gavaskar, whod then been touring with the Rest of World squad.         
	It was such a nice gesture and I did feel really good, Gavaskar told The Telegraph at the Hilton on Sunday morning.         
	The evening before, of course, Gavaskar had narrated their meeting at the Knight To Remember function in honour of Sir Garfield Sobers.         
	Seeing us together, Sir Garfield (the captain) had said see those little fellas to which Sir Don responded these big fellas may have the power, but we have the footwork!         
	Then, when Zaheer Abbas joined us for a photograph, Sir Garfield joked oh, the Karachi Bradman, the Bombay Bradman and the real Bradman... It was a memorable stopover, Gavaskar told the gathering, which couldnt stop laughing.         
	Asked, on the morning-after, if he agreed with Sir Dons assessment of the little fellas and the big fellas, Gavaskar replied: Difficult to agree now, for even the little fellas have so much power.         
	Point, indeed.

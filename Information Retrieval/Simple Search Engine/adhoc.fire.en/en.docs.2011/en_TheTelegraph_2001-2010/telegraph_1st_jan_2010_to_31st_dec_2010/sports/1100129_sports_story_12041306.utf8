The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arindam gets the boot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arindam gets the boot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With experience falling short of expectations in the Ranji Trophy, the senior Bengal selectors opted for fresh blood when they selected a 20-member probables list for the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy in Cuttack.         
	But the question doing the rounds is should youth get more weightage than performance? Because thats exactly what has happened on Thursday when opening batsman Arindam Das was omitted from the 20-member list.         
	Arindam was the top scorer for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy accumulating 519 runs from six matches at an average of 57.66. Amidst a host of mediocre performances, he stood out with his consistent contributions.         
	But then chief selector Sambaran Banerjee thought differently. Theres a lot of difference between four-day matches and one-dayers. Arindam is good for the longer format but we need young blood for the zonal one-dayers as we felt that it would help raise our fielding standards also, Sambaran said.         
	Arindam himself failed to understand the reasons behind his axe. I dont know I dont see any logic for my exclusion, he said.         
	Fact is, the right-hander, who was also initially kept out of the Ranji probables list only to be included later, deserves a place in the squad and no logic is strong enough to define his omission. The other notable absentee from the list was off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri who, according to the selectors, didnt meet the expectations.         
	Former India captain Sourav Ganguly was named after he assured his availability.         
	Rohan Gavaskar, however, didnt get the nod. The 20-member squad, which will undergo practice at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, from Monday, will be pruned to 15 on Saturday.         
	The probables         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sreevats Goswami, Subhomoy Das, Sourav Ganguly, Manoj Tiwary, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Arnab Nandi, Iresh Saxena, Shib Sagar Singh, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Sayan Sekhar Mondal, Sudip Chatterjee, Sourav Sarkar, Soumya Pakray, Mohammed Sami Ahmed, Soham Ghosh, Anustup Majumder, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Eklakh Ahmed.

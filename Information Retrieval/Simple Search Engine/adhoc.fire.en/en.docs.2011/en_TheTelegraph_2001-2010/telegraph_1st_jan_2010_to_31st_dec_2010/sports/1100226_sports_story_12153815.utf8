The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is sincerity personified: Kapil
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin is sincerity personified: Kapil
            A STAFF REPORTER            Kapil Dev at a promotional in the city, on Thursday.                           
	Calcutta: Such is Sachin Tendulkars dedication and sincerity, the Little Master is a cut above contemporaries and other modern day greats, feels former India skipper Kapil Dev.         
	What can I say about Sachin Tendulkar? His brightness can only be compared to the sun. I have no words to describe a genius like him, was Kapils way of paying tribute to Tendulkar after the historic double hundred against South Africa in Gwalior on Wednesday.         
	Kapil was in the city for a promotional at the Rabindra Sarobar stadium on Thursday.         
	Sachin is like any normal human being. What makes him so special is his thought process that constantly pushes him to achieve the unthinkable.         
	Courage, passion, dedication are just some of the qualities which make Sachin unmatchable. No doubt he is hugely talented. But talent alone doesnt bring you success at the highest level, the 1983 World Cup-winning captain said.         
	Neither did Kapil forget to mention the sacrifices Sachin had to make during his 20 years in international cricket.         
	Success in any field doesnt come easy. One has to make a lot of sacrifices. So did Sachin. He is sincerity personified. To achieve success, you need to understand what you want from life and need to remain focussed while pursuing your goal. Sachin did exactly that, Kapil said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain have a lot to gain

	Johannesburg: The streets of Johannesburg are now lined up with Spanish flags and banners written in Spanish as their fans try to make their World Cup squad feel at home on the eve of their crucial match against Honduras at the Ellis Park here on Monday.         
	Anything less than a victory for Spain could see one of the pre-tournament favourites making an ignominious early exit from the World Cup. In their first match, the star-studded Spain succumbed to a solitary goal defeat against Switzerland. Honduras also lost their first match against Chile.         
	Despite the defeat, Spain are considered the most talented side in the 32-team mega event, a side perfectly capable of ending their nations World Cup drought.         
	Even Dutch star Johan Cruyff, considered the emperor of attacking football, said should Spain lose early, it would be a blow for the World Cup. I saw more value in the way Spain tried to play than in any of the other big nations who managed a win, he said.         
	I saw enough in the DNA of the performance against the Swiss to say that Spain can still win this World Cup. And it would be good for all of us if they do. Its not that football, played correctly, always wins. It cant be that way, said Cruyff.         
	Against Honduras, star Spanish footballer Fernando Torres is expected to make a comeback in the starting line-up. Ive been training for more than two weeks with my teammates and gradually Ive forgotten about the injury, said Torres, who is recovering from surgery on his right knee in April. Torres is expected to provide the extra punch to the team alongside David Villa.         
	Torres said it would be wrong for the Euro champions to tinker too much with a formula that had helped them win all 10 of their qualifiers. Its important for us to remain faithful to our playing style, not go mad and change things around too much and trust in what has made us one of the favourites, he said.         
	Expectedly, Spain have encountered a torrent of criticism following the defeat against Switzerland. The players are infuriated by media coverage that centred on the girlfriend of goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Midfielder Xabi Alonso said: It is only people outside of football who are talking this rubbish about curses.         
	Alonso also insisted that there will be no change to the teams possession-based, quick-touch game regardless of who starts.         
	Its hard to evaluate, especially since the system worked well in the warm-up games coming in, Alonso said.         
	Like his players, Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has also come under fire for the Swiss blunder. Former coach Luis Aragones, who led Spain to the 2008 European title, said his successor was wrong in playing two holding midfielders  Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets  and only Villa up front. That left Torres and creative midfielder Cesc Fabregas out of the line-up. Fabregas did not even come on as a substitute.         
	Defender Gerard Pique said Fabregas could provide what the Spanish were lacking.         
	A lot of touch, the ability to get into the area and goals, Pique said. If the coach opts for him, hell help us very much.         
	Thankfully, the Spanish football federation has moved to take the pressure off Del Bosque by reassuring him he wont be sacked even if the unthinkable happens.         
	On the other hand, Honduras coach Reinaldo Rueda said he was aware that Spain would be hungry for a win on Monday.         
	We cannot underestimate Spains strength. We shouldnt be distracted by the Swiss result. They are the favourites and would be even more determined to prove it against us, said Rueda.         
	In the match against Chile, the Honduras coach had to serve a touchline ban after he was sent off in the qualifiers against El Salvador.         
	While Rueda would be back at the bench, Honduras will also be hoping their main striker David Suazo, who has fully recovered from the right thigh injury, would be able to play against Spain.         
	The pressure in Mondays game, however, would be on Spain. No team have ever lost their first World Cup match and went on to lift the trophy. Time Spain proved the record wrong.

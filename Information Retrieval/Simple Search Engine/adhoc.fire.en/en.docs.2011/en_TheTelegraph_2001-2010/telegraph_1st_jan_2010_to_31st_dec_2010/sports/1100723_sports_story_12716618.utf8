	Galle: Spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan brought down the curtains on his Test career in a blaze of glory by becoming the first bowler to scalp 800 wickets as Sri Lanka thrashed India by 10 wickets in the first Test, here on Thursday.         
	The hosts had to sweat a bit to wrap up the remaining five wickets as India were all out for 338 in their second innings, a total largely built around gritty contributions from tailenders.         
	Sri Lankan openers Tillakaratne Dilshan (68 not out) and Tharanga Paranavitana (23 not out) showed great urgency to rattle up the required runs on the final day to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Dilshan brought about the victory in style by clobbering Harbhajan Singh for a mighty six as the Lankans raced to 96 no loss in just 14.1 overs to record their seventh 10-wicket win overall and the second against India.         
	Resuming at a precarious 181 for five, India lost captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (4) and Harbhajan Singh (8) in quick succession but VVS Laxman (69) and a dogged resistance by tailenders Ahimanyu Mithun (25), Ishant Sharma (31 not out) and Pragyan Ojha (13) delayed the inevitable.         
	The late order fightback not only frustrated the hosts but helped India to avoid the ignominy of an innings defeat and take a slender lead to stretch the game beyond the tea break at the Galle International stadium.         
	Muralidharan, himself played a key role in his swansong Test by scalping five wickets in the first innings and three in the second to take his overall tally to 800, thus becoming the first cricketer to achieve the remarkable feat. Indias capitulation was all the more shocking considering an entire days play was washed out because of rain. While nothing great was expected from the depleted bowling attack, the failure of the star-studded batting line-up hurt the team badly.         
	The two teams will now travel to Colombo for the second Test, starting July 26 and another defeat could dislodge India from the No. 1 position.         
	If Sri Lanka win the series 2-0, India would lose four rating points and come down to the third position behind South Africa. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will gain six points and become the No. 1 Test team.         
	All eyes were on Muralidharan as the crowd and his teammates expected him to reach the 800-wicket mark quickly but the off-spinner could add just one more scalp to take his tally to 799 till the lunch break.         
	It was paceman Lasith Malinga who took two of the three wickets that fell in the opening session by removing India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Mithun.         
	Dhoni and Laxman resumed at overnight score of 181 for five and Indias fate hinged much on their efforts with the bat. Malinga though shattered Indias hopes by bowling out Dhoni with a beautiful yorker.         
	Muralidharan, then trapped Harbhajan Singh (8) to trigger celebrations but the spirited resistance by the tailenders from then on raised hopes of an Indian escape.         
	Laxman, who was batting on nine, on the other end was unruffled and frustrated the hosts with his fighting half-century. His 49-run partnership with Mithun (25) for the eighth wicket and unfinished 68-run stand for the ninth wicket was crucial in saving India from the innings defeat.         
	After supporting Laxman for an hour, Mithun became the fifth victim of Malinga. Confronted with a screamer of a delivery, Mithun was no where in line and was adjudged plumb leg before.         
	After Mithun, Ishant showed the stomach for a fight and battled hard for Indias cause. Ishant (31 not out) became only the fourth batsman to face 100 or more balls in a Test innings while batting at number 10 position.

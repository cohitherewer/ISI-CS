            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United moved a step closer to creating history when they beat Kalighat Club 3-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Khardah Stadium on Thursday. Chirag retained their top position although they have equal number of points with Mohun Bagan (36). However Chirag enjoy a better goal difference (+28) than Bagan (+25).         
	Chirag went ahead in the 16th minute when Eduardo Chacon headed home off a Joshimar back-head. Within four minutes, the purple brigade made it 2-0. This time it was left-winger Gouranga Biswas who was on target. Right back Subhashish Roy Chowdhury overlapped and kept a measured cross for Gouranga who slotted home from close range.         
	Up 2-0 at the break, Chirag upped the ante in the second half. However, their prolific Brazilian scorer Joshimar couldnt find the mark missing a couple easy opportunities. Thus he failed to increase his tally from 13 goals in the local league.         
	In the 60th minute, Shankar Oraon rounded off the tally with a cracking right footer from outside the box. Joshimar was the provider on this occasion.         
	Chirag now need a draw to win the premier division title.

	Mohammed Shanin ensured Bengal of a medal when he entered the semi-finals of the first sub-junior National Boxing Championship, at Chetla Park, on Monday. While Shanin defeated Vanhlimpuia of Mizoram 7-0, his compatriot Rachit Routh lost to Lekraj Pun of Himachal Pradesh.       Dipendu hope  Mohammedan Sporting captain Dipendu Biswas feels Mohammedan Sporting rsquo;s Airlines Cup victory mdash; they defeated Aryan 4-3 via tie-breaker in the final on Sunday mdash; will give confidence before the I-League second division gets under way in February. ldquo;It will boost our confidence, rdquo; the former international, who scored 13 goals in 19 matches this season, said on Monday. ldquo;And with Christopher (of Kalighat MS) and Marcos Parreira (of Southern Samity) joining the team, we will be a different proposition in the second division I-League, rdquo; he added.  Biswarup deal  Biswarup Deb, who played for George Telegraph in the CFL Premier Division this season, will sign in favour of East Bengal on Tuesday. He will be available for red and gold brigade rsquo;s I-League home match against Air India, on Wednesday.  Chirag move  Chirag United have released Sergei Tokov as the club management is reportedly ldquo;unsatisfied with his performance and work ethic rdquo;. The Uzbek defender has been suffering from frequent injuries.  Sole leader  Chandrasish Majumdar emerged the sole leader with seven points after the seventh round of the Mayor rsquo;s Cup Fide Rating Chess Tournament, being held at the Town Hall. Close on his heels are Rupankar Nath and Rajib Ghorai on 6.5 points apiece.

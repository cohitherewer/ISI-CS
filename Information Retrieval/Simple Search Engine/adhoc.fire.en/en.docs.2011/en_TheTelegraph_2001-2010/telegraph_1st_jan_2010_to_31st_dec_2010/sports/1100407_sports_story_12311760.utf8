The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mishra a world-class spinner: Shipperd 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mishra a world-class spinner: Shipperd 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Delhi DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd strongly feels that leg-spinner Amit Mishra should have been in the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in West Indies.         
	The Australian, albeit in a subtle way, questioned the logic behind not selecting Mishra for the tournament. Mishra is currently the holder of purple cap (top on the wicket-takers list with 14 scalps).         
	I think the Indian selectors were very confident when they decided to ignore him (Mishra), the Australian said sarcastically, at a media conference on the eve of their match against Kolkata Knight Riders. He is a world class spinner, he said.         
	He also termed the spin combination of Mishra and New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori as a mouth watering prospect.         
	The DareDevils coach, however, doesnt want his boys to be complacent. I wouldnt say we are comfortably placed. We are well placed. We need to win couple of more matches for an assured berth in the last-four stage, said Shipperd.         
	Shipperd also lauded the DareDevils management for roping in some good Indian players. The selectors of the DareDevils team have done a wonderful job. Currently, we have five such players who are representing India in various forms of the game. Also we have got the best talent as far as our domestic batch is concerned. We have a fantastic talent like KJ (Kedar Jadhav) who got a 50 the other day.         
	He informed that senior pacers Ashish Nehra and Dirk Nannes will take a couple of matches more before they return to action. He also feels that Gautam Gambhir should be given some time to get back into the groove as he is coming back from an injury.         
	Its not easy for anyone to comeback from an injury and straightaway get into action. Gautam is a fabulous player and he played an important innings against Rajasthan Royals where he guided the team to victory. Dont forget he is also leading the side.         
	Dinesh Karthik, who also attended the media conference alongside Shipperd, said that he has been comfortable batting at No. 5 although its a thankless number to bat on in a T20 match. Someone has to bat at No. 5 and if the team management wants me to bat there, I am fine with it.         
	Karthik also agreed that he is enjoying the role of a finisher. I have batted up the order for the Indian team. However, playing in the IPL, I have learnt a lot about how to play in the middle overs. This has also given me confidence as I have finished games for my team, Karthik said.

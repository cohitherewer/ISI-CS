The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Allegations didnt bother me: Akmal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Allegations didnt bother me: Akmal
                      
	Karachi: Even as uncertainty prevails over his selection for the forthcoming series against New Zealand and the 2011 World Cup, Pakistans discarded wicket-keeper, Kamran Akmal says that he was never bothered by allegations of spot-fixing and match-fixing against him.         
	I have never taken these allegations seriously or to heart, but yes, they have affected my family and my family life, Akmal said on Thursday.         
	In my eight years of playing for Pakistan, I have never ever seen any fellow player try to lose a match or do something deliberately, he said.         
	The national selection committee called a meeting this week in which they finalised the list of 40 probables for the New Zealand series and the World Cup.         
	Sources said the list included Kamran Akmal, Danish Kaneria (who was stopped by the PCB from joining the Test team in UAE for the series against South Africa) and Rana Naved.         
	Sources said that the ICC have given clearances to Akmal and Kaneria.         
	Akmal, who was dropped for the series against South Africa, said it was a great lesson for him and he now valued the national cap much more.         
	The downside is that I have missed playing for my country But on the positive side, I have spent Eid for the first time with my family after so many years as normally we have always been on tours during Eid, he added.

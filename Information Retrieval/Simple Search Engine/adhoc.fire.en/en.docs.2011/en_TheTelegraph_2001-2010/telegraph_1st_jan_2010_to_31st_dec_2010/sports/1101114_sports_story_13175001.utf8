The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru falls for 96
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru falls for 96
    - Zaheer, Bhajji grab 4 wickets each as NZ finish on 350           SUDIPTO GUPTA            Virender Sehwag after his dismissal, in Hyderabad, on Saturday                                 
	Hyderabad: When everything comes your way, chances are that you are in the wrong lane  read a young boys T-shirt, who was among the spectators on the second day of the second India-New Zealand Test, in Hyderabad, on Saturday.         
	How true! That life is too ironic to be perfect was once again reminded by Team India openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. Just when it appeared that the duo were on the brink of signing off an excellent day of Test cricket for India, the pinch of reality soured things a little.         
	Couched in the comfort of dominance, India were set to be the runaway winners (of the day) as they moved to 160 without loss in reply to New Zealands first innings score of 350. With Sehwag (96) spraying runs with the audacity of a machinegun and Gambhir (54) finally hitting the jackpot of form, the complexion of the Black Caps fate looked even darker. However, the Indian duo deserted the 22-yard strip, in quick succession, towards the end of the day to infuse an iota of hope in the visitors mind.         
	At stumps on Day II, India were 178 for two. However, Sehwags disappointment have ushered in the prospect of a greater milestone. At the crease is Sachin Tendulkar, batting on 11, and one hopes he adds 89 more to that to reach the Everest of 50 Test centuries. Giving him company was Rahul Dravid, batting on 7. Despite the two late setbacks, the hosts have the steering in their hand. Why so? Because Sachins individual tally of Test runs is more than that of the entire New Zealand teams put together. To be practical is to think that India will surpass the New Zealand total with ease.         
	Sehwag began his innings with the patience of a monk and then metamorphosed into an all-devouring tsunami, sweeping away the visitors attack. From 2 off 23 balls, Sehwag muscled 94 off the next 97 balls, leaving Daniel Vettori clueless.         
	Smashing 15 boundaries and a monstrous six, the right-handed batsman cut, punched and drove at his will. However, though flair is his strength, Sehwags weakness originates from the temptation of implementing his strength too often. The 20,000-strong Saturday crowd was hushed to silence when he was castled while trying to slog-sweep Vettori.         
	Gambhir, who got his first half-century in 10 months, fell three balls later, edging Tim Southee to the keeper, down the leg side.         
	Earlier in the day, Zaheer Khan did what Sreesanth excelled in on the first day. The second morning saw Indias left arm pace spearhead talk with the ball and pose stiff questions to the New Zealanders. While he didnt exactly manage Sreesanths deadly Day I swerve, Zaheer, armed with an enviable cache of experience, punched accuracy, variety and small doses of swing to uncork a brilliant cocktail of fast bowling.         
	His two late wickets on Friday had nudged India back into the game and, on Saturday, he himself picked up the baton to ensure that the advantage remained with the hosts. He struck in the very second over of the day when overnight not out New Zealand batsman Gareth Hopkins (4) shouldered arms to one that came in after pitching on the off-stump and hit his pads. As the Black Caps keeper was not offering a shot, the umpire took little time to show him the dreaded finger.         
	First Test centurion Kane Williamson (4) didnt last long either, trapped in front, again by Zaheer, this time from round the wicket.         
	Vettori (11) was the Balck Caps last refuge, someone who could give Jesse Ryder company. The spectacled skipper, however, lacked the vision. While caution should have been his mantra, an attempted expansive sweep against Harbhajan left him stranded in front. Vettoris leg before virtually lamed the visitors chances of crossing the 400-run mark.         
	As the New Zealand batsmen were falling like dead leaves, Ryder planted his grit firmly. Before he perished, off a Harbhajan beauty, he had added 70 crucial runs to his teams cause.         
	Harbhajan then cut off the New Zealand tail briskly to finish with four wickets. Zaheer, too, grabbed four scalps.         
	With a batting line-up second to none, Mahendra Singh Dhoni wouldnt lose sleep over the 172-run deficit which stands at the end of the day. But yes, he would have loved to see the Sehwag-Gambhir duo walk out to bat on Sunday morning.

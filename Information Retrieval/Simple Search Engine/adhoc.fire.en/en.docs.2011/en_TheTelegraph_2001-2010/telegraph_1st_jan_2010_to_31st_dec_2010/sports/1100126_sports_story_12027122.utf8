	Melbourne: Leander Paes kept himself in contention for twin titles after making the quarter finals of both, mens doubles and mixed doubles events, at the Australian Open here Monday.         
	Paes made a good start to the day when he and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded third, beat the American pair of John Isner and Sam Querrey 6-3, 7-5 in the second round of the mens doubles competition.         
	They will next take on the winners of the match between fifth seeds Lukasz Kubot/Oliver Marach and the unseeded duo of Ivo Karlovic/Dusan Vemic.         
	The next match, as top seed with Cara Black, was hardly trouble as they easily shut out Akgul Amanmuradova and Rik De Voest in straight sets.         
	The Indo-Zimbabwean pair beat the Uzbek-South African pair 6-4, 6-2 in the second round of the mixed doubles event.         
	In the junior event, Vaidik Munshaws campaign ended as he lost in theboys doubles first round along with Chinese partner Chuhan Wang.         
	They were humbled 2-6, 6-7(3) by fourth seeds Liang-Chi Huang of Taipei and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan.         
	Vaidik is already out of singles after losing his first round match. Rishika Sunkara also had disappointment in store as she lost her girls doubles first round along with partner Yuki Ito of Japan.         
	The unseeded pair fought hard but lost 7-6(5), 2-6, 6-10 to the sixth seeded pair of Anna-Lena Friedsam of Germany and Mai Grage of Denmark.         
	Rishika also has a tough second round as she will take on third seed Russian Daria Gavrilova Tuesday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal comes first for Denson
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal comes first for Denson
            A STAFF REPORTER            Denson Devadas                           
	Calcutta: In life, the triumph of the underdogs is always a fascinating tale. And when that happens in sports, its all the more gripping. At times, though, that fact comes with a bitter pill of reality.         
	Similar was Bengals success story in the 64th edition of the Santosh Trophy. Two major architects of that cherished dream were none other than the duo of Denson Devadas and Shabbir Ali. While both garnered their respective professional accolades in Bengal, fact remains that they are, to be honest, not from Bengal.         
	The individuals themselves, however, are in love with the eastern province of the country. Note this: I had a call from a minister in Kerala and they may be keen in getting me in their side for the next edition of the Santosh Trophy. Says who? Denson, the destroyer, who killed off Punjabs challenge on Sunday with his brilliant brace.         
	And here comes the second: Im thankful to the Indian Football Association for keeping faith in me. The fact that I dont have any coaching assignments at present bothers me the least.         
	I have been a coach for quite some time now and am well aquatinted with the ups and down in ones professional life. Im thankful to my employers (a bank) for arranging my transfer to Calcutta. Ill be happily joining my work soon. This time its Shabbir, from Hyderabad.         
	Accept it or not, such love for the state only sweetens Bengals glory.         
	Denson, who started off as a striker in Kerala, realised the gravity of expectations when newspapers in his home state elevated him as the saviour of Bengal after the Santosh Trophy semi-finals.         
	It was only after I came to know about papers in Kerala portraying me as a hero that I understood how my responsibilities had multiplied. Even my parents were tensed, said Denson, who preferred to stay back in Chirag United even though he had offers from the citys Big Two.         
	The midfielder who represented Kerala in the 2007 edition of the meet, recounted how he had to spend most of the time on the bench as India star NP Pradeep was the usual first preference. But the humble 28-year-old refuses to say that his success for Bengal is an answer of sorts to Kerala. It is nothing like that.         
	Talking of Shabbir, one can only wonder, without really finding an answer, as how such a successful coach may sit idle. He is one of the few Indian coaches who has almost all the national titles under his belt. But he refuses to talk ill of anyone.         
	Im not one who will go to town complaining about the have nots. You will never find me crying over an award which I may have deserved or, say, giving the excuses for failures, a confident Shabbir said.         
	Wondering what true champions are made of? Here are two of the best.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden makes hay as Super Kings shine
                                                                                                                       7                                        Hayden makes hay as Super Kings shine
  - Virender Sehwag rsquo;s whirlwind 74 goes in vain
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Suresh Raina celebrates his teams victory, in New Delhi, on Friday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: It couldnt have been any better for the capacity crowd at the Kotla who were all there to watch a cracker of a contest between the Delhi DareDevils and the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League on Friday.         
	The highly entertaining game ultimately turned out to be a battle of two batting titans  Virender Sehwag for the home team and Matthew Hayden for the visitors  with the sell-out crowd thoroughly enjoying some electrifying batting.         
	The Super Kings, however, had the last laugh as Haydens 43-ball 93 in a stunning batting display carried his team to a five-wicket win with five deliveries to spare. The 38-year-old Australian, who retired from international cricket last year, was in awesome form as he hit nine fours and seven towering sixes to send the DareDevils crashing to their second straight defeat on home soil.         
	Chasing the DareDevils score of 185 for six  made possible by Sehwags superb 38-ball knock of 74  Hayden came out all guns blazing.         
	The spectators were left truly awestruck when Hayden launched a ferocious offensive against Tillekaratne Dilshan in the eighth over, hitting the Sri Lankan for three powerful sixes, all of them landing far beyond the ropes.         
	When Hayden finally left in the 14th over, caught by Dilshan off Amit Mishra, the Super Kings already had 142 runs on the board with seven wickets in hand. Skipper Suresh Raina (49 not out), who took three superb catches, too, did a good job with the bat and the team hardly had anything to worry about.         
	Pity Sehwags fine innings  studded with 10 fours and three sixes  was eclipsed by Haydens masterly knock. The DareDevils opener was equally ruthless against the Super Kings bowlers who found it hard to contain the India opener. Sehwag scored at will and it was finally left to Muttiah Muralidharan to rein in the rampaging opener.

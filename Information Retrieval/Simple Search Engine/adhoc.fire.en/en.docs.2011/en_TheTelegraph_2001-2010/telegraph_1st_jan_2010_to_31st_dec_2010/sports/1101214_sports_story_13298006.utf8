The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Money was clean: Butt 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Money was clean: Butt 
                      
	London: Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt claimed that the thousands of pounds of cash discovered by British police at his hotel room during spot-fixing investigation in late August was part of his legitimate tour allowances.         
	Well I think everybody knows the Pakistan Cricket Board pays us daily allowances on tours and it was a long tour, he said in an excerpt of interview at his Lahore home.         
	About 11,000 of that money was from our daily allowances and being the captain I had an extra entertainment allowance which amounts to about 4,500 from the tour, which I had with me, said Butt. (PTI)

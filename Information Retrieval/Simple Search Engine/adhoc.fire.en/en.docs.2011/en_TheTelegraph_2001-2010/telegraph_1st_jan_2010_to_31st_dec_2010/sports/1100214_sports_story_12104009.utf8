  - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Hero of the 2001 win over Australia reflects on an epic match         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                          VVS Laxman at the Eden on Saturday.   Picture by   Santosh Ghosh      
	Calcutta: Vangipurappu Venkata Sai Laxmans 281 at the Eden, nine years ago, is one innings which wont be forgotten. The 35-year-old spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on that stupendous match-winning effort.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Nine years on, nobody has forgotten your 281 against Steve Waughs Australians...         
	A Its pleasing... I believe my teammates, too, recall that 281 with special feelings... It was an innings which contributed to changing the face of Indian cricket... Helped increase our confidence and also made us play better overseas... The team, as a whole, took a lot of inspiration from that Test and series, which we won 2-1 after having lost the first Test (in Mumbai)...         
	Clearly, one of the defining moments in our cricket history...         
	Absolutely. That Test and series changed our mindset.         
	Today, how do you look back on that epic?         
	The fourth day (March 14) of that Test remains one of the exceptional days in my career... Im not saying the finest as there have been other momentous days as well... Like when we won the Adelaide Test, in December 2003... Of course, I havent matched that 281 in the number of runs, but Ive felt as satisfied whenever Ive contributed to an Indian win.         
	What were your thoughts when you took guard in the second innings?         
	That Id be starting on zero and not from 59, my score in the first innings... If you remember, Id been promoted to No.3 from No.6, all because of having top-scored... Id been in a good frame of mind, for Id dominated the attack.         
	How would you describe your approach?         
	Id kept it simple  treating each ball on merit... I was intent on playing my normal game.         
	Given that wed been made to follow on (274 behind), what did Rahul Dravid and you keep telling each other?         
	(Grins) To begin with, we set small targets... Over by over, hour by hour, session by session... We didnt look too much ahead... It really helped that Rahul and I set ourselves small goals... Fortunately, we had a good opening partnership (52 between Shiv Sundar Das and Sadagopan Ramesh) and that gave us a base to work from... As it turned out, we batted through that fourth day.         
	Surely, there must have been moments when the situation probably threatened to get the better of Dravid and you...         
	Because wed decided to play our normal game, without being burdened, that allowed us a degree of freedom... That, I guess, was needed at that point in time... Basically, we didnt put ourselves under too much pressure.         
	At the end of the fourth day, both Dravid and you were put on saline. Who was the worse off?         
	Rahul, thats for sure... In fact, he hadnt been very well going into the Test and was dehydrated... (Adds laughing) I suppose the medical staff didnt want to take a chance with me and put me, too, on saline! I couldve done without it... I guess they got carried away by what wed done on the field.         
	Its not often that one gets to see a 376-run partnership (for the fifth wicket)... When did it actually sink in that something momentous had been put together?         
	During the course of that fourth day itself... Frankly, more than my innings and our partnership, the most beautiful moment in that Test was when Glenn McGrath got out (to Harbhajan Singh) and we won an unbelievable match... The bowlers bowled very well, fielders picked up amazing catches... It was some Test...         
	The crowd had been unbelievable, too...         
	I couldnt agree with you more... Everybody was so passionate... Runs, wickets, good stops... Everything was applauded... The applause continued even after our 171-run win.         
	Some words on Dravid...         
	I consider myself fortunate that Ive featured in big partnerships with Rahul. In Calcutta, in Adelaide... Elsewhere as well.         
	Didnt the Australians sledge?         
	Initially, yes... Later, they realised the futility of doing so and began to appreciate our batting... They applauded some of our shots, realising that something special was in progress.         
	How often have you watched the recording of that 281?         
	Not often... At times, while browsing, Ive seen it on YouTube... At times, at home...         
	Do you get emotional then?         
	The innings gives confidence... Back then, Id become convinced that I could repeat my domestic achievements at the highest level. That innings, in fact, established me in the Test XI... Till then, Id be in and out.         
	Brought you back into the ODIs as well         
	(Grins) It did, for a while.         
	Any one move in that Test which comes to mind instantly?         
	Lots... What also comes to mind is that each member of the playing XI made some contribution... Even those in the dressing room contributed significantly... I remember the words of encouragement from Ashish Nehra, whod bring the drinks... It was a team effort in the truest sense... Everybodys involvement was amazing.         
	Does the confidence gained nine years ago continue to lift the team?         
	It does... Look at how we recovered in Motera just months ago (against Sri Lanka)... From four down for 32 to 426... Indeed, the 2001 Test taught us never to give up. That somebody or the other should always be there to put his hand up and complete the job. Personally, I look to try and make a difference.         
	Youre just a year away from completing a decade-and-a-half as an India cricketer. Whats it like being a senior pro?         
	I see myself as part of a family... We help each other, we feel for each other... A fantastic dressing room atmosphere has played a big role in us getting to No.1 in Tests. Getting there had been one of our goals... Having got there, we dont intend leaving the summit in a hurry.         
	What would you tell the young batsmen with big dreams?         
	Work hard and be sincere.         
	Do you agree that todays cricketers are a lot more confident?         
	They are... Its a reflection of society... Look at people in any walk of life today.         
	The final one: Any plans of another summer of County cricket?         
	Right now, Im not sure... Lets see.

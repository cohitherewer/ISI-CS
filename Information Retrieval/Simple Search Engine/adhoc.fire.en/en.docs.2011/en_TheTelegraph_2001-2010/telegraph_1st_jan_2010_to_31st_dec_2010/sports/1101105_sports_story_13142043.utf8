	Basel: Czech wild card Radek Stepanek, on Thursday, earned a quarter final match of the Swiss Indoors against Roger Federer by beating Santiago Giraldo of Colombia 3-6, 6-2, 6-0.         
	In another tie, David Nalbandian beat sixth-seeded Marin Cilic 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to advance to the quarter finals. The 29th-ranked Argentine mixed accurate serving and strong groundstrokes, clinching on his first match point with a powerful forehand from the baseline.         
	On Wednesday, Roddick came out on top in a big-serving encounter with fellow American Sam Querrey 7-5, 7-6 (6). The fourth-seeded sent down 16 aces and dropped just six first-service points against 22nd-ranked Querrey, who served 13 aces.         
	Federer, the No. 1 seed, eased past Serbias Janko Tipsarevic to move to the quarter final, requiring a single break in each set to complete a 6-3, 6-4 win in St. Jakobshalle.         
	Tomas Berdych slumped to a 6-4, 6-1 loss against Tobias Kamke, the 72nd-ranked German, who entered the main draw as a lucky loser in qualifying. (Agencies)

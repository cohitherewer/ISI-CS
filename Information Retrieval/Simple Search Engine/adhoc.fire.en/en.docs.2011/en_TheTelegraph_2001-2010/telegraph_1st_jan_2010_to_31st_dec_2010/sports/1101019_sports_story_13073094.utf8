	Shanghai: Jurgen Melzer and Leander Paes capped their debut doubles outing by winning the Shanghai Masters 7-5, 4-6, 10-5 against Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski of Poland, on Sunday.         
	The Indo-Austrian duo had earlier ended the 20-match winning streak of American twins, Bob and Mike Bryan, in the semi-finals.         
	I have tremendous respect for Jurgen, Paes said after the match.         
	I think hes one of the most hard working and talented players Ive seen over the past 20 years that Ive been on the tour. Hes beaten two No. 1s in the same week: Rafael Nadal (in the singles third round) and the Bryan brothers Saturday night. Its a big honour to play with him.         
	Melzer agreed it was a great feeling. As Leander said, beating two No. 1s in the same week is great, said Melzer.         
	But, finishing it off with a title  my first in a Masters 1000 event  makes me think we can match up great. Its nice to have so much experience next to you. You always feel comfortable. I enjoyed it, he added.         
	Leander, who won the Commonwealth Games bronze medal with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi, has already qualified for the year-ending ATP Tour Finals, to be held in London in November, with Czech Lukas Dlouhy.

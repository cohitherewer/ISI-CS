The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button puts up a brave front
                                                                                                                       7                                        Button puts up a brave front
            THE TIMES, LONDON ; AGENCIES            McLarens Jenson Button, in Sao Paulo. (AP)                           
	Sao Paulo: Jenson Button stood among the boxes and upturned tables as his McLaren team dismantled their motorhome around him. The only thing they did not remove on Sunday night in the dash to leave Brazil was the No. 1 on the nose of his car.         
	The world champion, who so memorably overcame the odds to win his title here at Interlagos last year, left Sao Paulo knowing that his reign is over. Fifth place in the Brazilian Grand Prix leaves him 47 points behind Fernando Alonso and driving for pride in Abu Dhabi at the final race of the season next weekend.         
	It was quite a few days to take in for a man, who lost a crown, and almost much more when armed robbers attacked his car on the way home from qualifying on Saturday.         
	If he escaped the gunmen, it was a forlorn hope that he could rescue something from this Brazilian Grand Prix the moment he qualified in eleventh place on Saturday.         
	On Sunday, when he battled through the field and making up the ground to finish fifth behind Lewis Hamilton, his teammate. Not much good, though, when only victory would do.         
	It is virtually over for Hamilton, too. He stands 24 points behind Alonso and calculated he needed something akin to a natural disaster that would claim all three of the title contenders ahead of him in Abu Dhabi to become champion for a second time.         
	I wont be giving up in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton said. I dont care where the other guys are. I will still be racing. If I win and the other three fall off (the track), you never know.         
	Except he does know it is all but over for this year and he knows there were too many opportunities missed  crashes in Singapore and Monza alone have been enough to wreck his challenge.         
	Button refused to be overwhelmed by disappointment. Number one is only a number, Button said. It just means that next year we will be even hungrier to get it back.         
	It has been a good season, not a great season, and good experience for next year. I think it has been a good year for me. It is not just about being world champion, it was about one of the biggest changes of my career to come here to McLaren.         
	I needed to change, have a new challenge and I definitely chose the right team because I feel so at home with McLaren. I feel part of this team and hopefully part of their future, too.         
	Meanwhile, Force Indias Adrian Sutil has described his 12th place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix as positive, after starting from the grid-tail. He began on P22 and jumped 10 places, although Force India did not get any points.         
	Vitantonio Liuzzi could not finish the race after ramming into the tyre wall but fortunately escaped unhurt.         
	From P22 on the grid, I think P12 is very positive and Im happy with that result and performance, said Sutil.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                       
	Guwahati: The RG Baruah Sports Complex woke up to a tumultuous morning Wednesday when Manipur women, participating in the 21st Senior National Sepak Takraw Championship here, went on a rampage alleging molestation attempt by a Grade IV employee in the wee hours last night.         
	Not only did they bash up the employee on duty at Deshbhakta Tarun Ram Phookan Indoor Stadium, identified as electrician Phul Kumar Das, they also attacked police officials, residents and visitors to the sports complex that houses the stadium.         
	At least five persons, including Das and one of the rampaging players, were seriously injured, eyewitnesses said. They have been admitted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. The others injured include police officer K. Mondal, a regular at the gym, several sportspersons and guardians of some minors who visit the complex in the morning for practice sessions in various sport disciplines.         
	The visiting women also smashed the stadiums window panes and caused extensive damage to properties in the complex, including a police patrol vehicle.         
	Das and an accomplice tried to molest the girls and snap their photographs with a mobile phone around 2am when they were sleeping. When the girls tried to apprehend him, he managed to escape but was finally nabbed by them early this morning. He was roughed up by a mob which did not involve our teammates, one of the girls said.

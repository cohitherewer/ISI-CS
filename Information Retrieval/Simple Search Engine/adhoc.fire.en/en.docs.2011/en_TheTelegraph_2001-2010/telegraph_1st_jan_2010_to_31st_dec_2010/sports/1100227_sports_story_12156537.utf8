The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When Sehwag got superstitious...
                                                                                                                       7                                      When Sehwag got superstitious...
                      
	New Delhi: Superstition kept Virender Sehwag from applauding most part of Sachin Tendulkars historic double century in Gwalior but once the batting maestro reached 190, he shunned his belief and cheered every shot of his idol till the milestone was reached.         
	I am of the superstitious kind. I never praise a shot because I fear the moment I do so, the batsman will get out. Till Sachin was on 190 in Gwalior, I was rooted in my seat in the dressing room. But when he got to 190, I couldnt contain myself. I came out and started cheering every stroke till he got to 200, Sehwag recalled talking to a cricket website.         
	When he got to 180, I knew he was going to get it, but when he was in the 190s I was concerned. If I was in his place, I would have tried to finish it off quickly.         
	Also, he was looking really tired: Sachin had been clutching his right side and showing signs of cramping. So when I stepped out of my seat, I was just saying, Finish it, finish it, Sehwag said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Siddle is not sorry
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Perth: Australia paceman Peter Siddle was unapologetic for his tirade at Matt Prior after dismissing the England wicketkeeper in the third Test in Perth and described sledging as good fun enjoyed by both the Ashes rivals.         
	Siddle sprayed invective at Prior after bowling him for 12, prompting the wicketkeeper to fire back a few choice words of his own before trudging off the field.         
	Prior vented his anger in his newspaper column on Tuesday: There are not many boxing matches when a guy knocks someone out and then kicks him when him while hes on the floor, he wrote.         
	But Siddle described the episode as part of the game.         
	Its always going to be there, we fight hard in the field and the emotions come out. Its always around and no doubt going to be around in the future as well, he said. I think thats part of my game anyway. When I play my best thats what Im doing anyway. Sometimes it comes off and sometimes it doesnt, in this case it has. Its just both teams going hard at it. Its good fun out there  theyre at us, were at them and it makes the game a bit more lively and no doubt the spectators like to see it.         
	The five-Test series is tied at 1-1 but Australia have all the momentum as they head into the fourth Test in Melbourne, which starts on Dec 26. Australias selectors are likely to persist with the four-pronged pace attack at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where the wicket is expected to favour their seamers.         
	Only captain Ricky Ponting remains a doubt after breaking his little finger in a catch attempt .         
	Siddle was bullish about Pontings recovery and said the Tasmanian should be fit for selection. Its looking good, hes come over here confident, and he said hes holding the bat fine and all that type of thing. It doesnt matter how sore you are or how injured you are I dont think you ever want to miss a Boxing Day Test, so I think everyone will definitely be 100 per cent fit for this one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A foreign game looks very American
                                                                                                                       7                                      A foreign game looks very American
            NY TIMES NEWS SERVICE                                  Landon Donovan        
	Pretoria: Tim Howard was playing hurry-up, booting the ball in desperation, watching the backs of his teammates, American athletes, as they raced downfield trying to save four years of effort.         
	It wasnt a soccer match, Howard said. It was an athletics match, track and field.         
	Sprinting has been, in its way, an American sport, whereas soccer has always been a foreign sport that frightens people  well, except for the millions of Americans lined up in pubs and dens and offices all over their country on a weekday morning, going crazy after the best, or the most dramatic, or the most important soccer match in American history.         
	The 1-0 win over Algeria, on Landon Donovans goal in the first minute of added time, put the Americans into the second round of the World Cup. They will play Ghana on Saturday, in what appears to be one of the more comfortable corners of the draw  though with the Yanks, nothing is easy. But they have achieved their goal, to get out of the first round, a reasonable plan for nouveau soccer nations.         
	Wednesdays match turned into a track meet, with wicked elbows and vicious kicks at full tilt, played by Americans with great legs and cardiovascular systems  plus that collective organ known as heart.         
	The old 90-second minute, said Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation and an American born in Allahabad, India. The Americans made those seconds pay off in one more frantic rush downfield, producing the goal that changed everything.         
	This was epic, touching off messages on Gulatis handheld P.D.A.  one from a friend on Wall Street, saying the brokers were going nuts (and not even over money), and another from a contact within the White House, saying staffers were celebrating en masse. Bill Clinton visited the locker room after the match, praising the players spirit.         
	This was huge, not because it put that foreign sport over the top, which is never the point, and not because it meant anything less about Algeria  a smaller nation and a skilled, competitive team  but because it felt like a sporting event that could unify America for a few screaming moments.         
	These were not foreign athletes. These were Americans doing something recognisable  Jordan thumping his chest, taking the court for the last shot; Jeter clapping his hands upon getting to second base, summoning something from within, something Americans have seen before. We bring something to the table, the American people as a whole, said DaMarcus Beasley, a reclamation project from the past two World Cups and just about the last American included on the bus to South Africa.

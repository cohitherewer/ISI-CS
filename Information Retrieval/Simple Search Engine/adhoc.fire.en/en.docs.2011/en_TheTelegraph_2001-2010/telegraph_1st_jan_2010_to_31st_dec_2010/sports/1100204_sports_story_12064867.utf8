	Mumbai: Viva Kerala registered their first away win of the season with a 1-0 win over Mumbai FC at the Cooperage on Wednesday.         
	In what could be termed as a minor upset, Anish KP headed home the lone goal for the visitors in the 43rd minute which snapped Khalid Jamils teams 10-match unbeaten streak.         
	Everyone kept talking about the unbeaten run, now we have been beaten, said a dejected Jamil after the match.         
	Mumbai FC could have easily been the winners though, but some bad luck and poor finishing did them in.         
	In the first half, an Evans Quao free-kick deflected off the bar while an Abhishek Yadav muffed a straightforward chance. Then, Yadavs header, in the second half, came back after hitting the inside of the far post.         
	The win saw Viva Kerala garner 14 points while Mumbai FC dropped remained on 18 points.         
	In Ludhiana, Air India pipped JCT 2-0 in another I-League match played at Guru Nanak Stadium here this evening.         
	The visitors got an early lead when Ravinder Singh scored off a corner kick in the fifth minute. They increased the lead in the second session when Ndubusi Opara slotted home the second goal.         
	In another match, in Pune, Mahindra United were held to a goalless draw by Pune FC.

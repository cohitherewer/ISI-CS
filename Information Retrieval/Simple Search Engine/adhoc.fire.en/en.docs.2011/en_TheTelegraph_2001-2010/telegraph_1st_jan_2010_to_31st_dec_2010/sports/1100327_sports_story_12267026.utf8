            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto and Marcos, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: When Mohun Bagan square off against Lajong FC in an 18th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, the visiting team coach Stanley Rozario will have more at stake, unlike his opposite number Satyajit Chatterjee.         
	For the green-and-maroon brigade, the championship hopes are as good as over after blowing away seven points in three games. Therefore, there is little at stake for Chatterjee and his boys save striving to improve from their current fifth position in the league.         
	For Stanley Rozario, each and every match is a do-or-die game, where a point or three will help them breathe a bit easily.         
	Currently in the second-last position with 17 points from as many games, Lajong need to turn the heat on their opposition in their bid to beat the drop.         
	Unlike Bagan, Lajong have been impressive in the last three matches. They recorded two wins (against East Bengal and Pune FC) and got a point from Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	And Rozario knows his boys will have to continue with the good work if he wants to see himself at the dugout next season.         
	For Bagan, anything less than the title (it has eluded them since 2001-02 season) is as good as a failure. Therefore, finishing second should be like finishing fifth!         
	Realistically, Bagan, who have 25 points from 17 games, still can win the title. And for that to happen they have to log 27 points from the remaining nine matches. A very difficult task, but coach Satyajit is not losing hope.         
	On Saturday, Satyajit is not expected to tinker much with the team that started against Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	Rakesh Masih has a slight niggle in his shoulder but he hasnt been ruled out. In case Masih doesnt start, Shiekh Azim may get a chance. Ishfaq Ahmed is expected play on the wide right, while Snehashis Chakraborty will be operating from the left.         
	Nigerian sharpshooter Edeh Chidi, who has been off-colour in the last couple matches, will like to fire, along with Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	The visitors will, however, depend on Nigerian Daniel Bidemi and Anil Gurung to make inroads into the fragile Bagan defence.

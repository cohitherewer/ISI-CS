            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After being in the news for wrong reasons in the past few weeks, the Indian womens hockey team left for Rosario, Argentina, on Saturday morning to play the World Cup without a head coach.         
	After M.K. Kaushik tendered his resignation last month following allegations that he demanded sexual favours from a player, the union ministry of sports is yet to announce a replacement for Kaushik.         
	Some of the support staff who worked alongside Kaushik were also given the boot including assistant coach Vasu Thapliyal.         
	Expectedly, Hockey India (HI) officials tried to put the entire blame on government saying it had recommended the name of CR Kumar as the chief coach but the proposal was not cleared by the ministry.         
	The team would have benefited by Kumars presence, a source in the HI stated. He is hugely experienced. The present set of coaches hardly have any idea about the players, he added.         
	The Squad: Goalkeepers: Dipika Murty, E Rajani; Defenders: Binita Toppo, Subhadra Pradhan, Joydeep Kaur; Midfielders: Asunta Lakra, Kirandeep Kaur, Mukta Barla, Deepika Thakur, Ritu Rani; Forwards: Surinder Kaur (captain), Jasjeet Kaur, Y Soundarya, Rani Rampal, Saba Anjum, T Chanchan Devi, Poonam Rani, Monika Badran. Support Staff: Sandeep Somesh, Khalid Modi, Sandeep Kaur, Pritam Siwach         
	Itinerary: August 30: vs the Netherlands; Sept 1: vs Australia; Sept 3: vs Germany; Sept 5: vs Japan; Sept 7: vs New Zealand.

	Port of Spain: Half-centuries from Jacques Kallis and JP Duminy helped South Africa complete a clean sweep of their ODI series versus the West Indies as the visitors won the fifth and final match by one wicket on Thursday.         
	The result meant that South Africa have now swept West Indies 5-0 in each of their last three bilateral ODI series.         
	Man of the Match Kallis hit five boundaries in his top score of 57 at better than a run-a-ball while Duminy struck just one four in his 51 off 75 deliveries as the Proteas, who needed 253 for victory, reached the target with two balls to spare.

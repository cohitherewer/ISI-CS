The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | From studs to duds, big guns face flak

    - Legends blast Latin American giants for pathetic show           JAYDEEP BASU                            
	Johannesburg: In South Africa, the elimination of Brazil and Argentina have come as a huge shock.         
	While the fans here are seriously contemplating whether to part with the tickets for the final, which they bought at a premium, hoping to watch the two Latin American giants battle it out for Cup, several former players have lashed out at the two teams after their deplorable defeats.         
	Even Tostao, one of the great Brazilian players from the days of Pele and Gerson, has taken a U-turn from his earlier stand. Tostao, who was ecstatic after Brazil defeated Chile in the round of 16, is now far less impressed by the Samba show and wants a change.         
	It was there for all to see what happened. I dont mind losing a match  its a part of the game  but this was a disgrace. From a 1-1, Brazil had enough opportunities to make a comeback. But instead they played that crucial one half very poorly, the living legend of Brazilian football told The Telegraph.         
	Dunga said he would be leaving his chair for someone else what can I say? Coaches always get the boot when the team loses in a tournament like World Cup, added Tostao.         
	Tostao was right. Defeats in the World Cup have evoked extreme reactions in many other countries.         
	In Nigeria, the government has suspended the team for two years after their poor show, and, in Italy the federation is thinking of limiting the number of outstation players in the local league.         
	The reaction is worst in France where the government wants to investigate the conduct of the players during their disastrous campaign.         
	More than the Brazilian coach Dunga, midfielder Felipo Melo is under fire for his foul on Arjen Robben when the team was down 1-2.         
	So much so that former star Ronaldo, whose eight-goal exploits won Brazil their fifth World Cup title in 2002, has warned Melo not to return to Brazil in the immediate future.         
	Its better for Felipo Melo that he doesnt return back home with the rest of the squad. He has been criticised a lot here and things can get nasty over here, was Ronaldos advice to Melo.         
	Like in Brazil, a dark and sombre mood has descended over Argentina after their 0-4 drubbing against Germany. Though no one has blamed Diego Maradona directly yet for the disaster, it may only be the lull before the storm.         
	Two of Maradonas teammates from his playing days  Gabriel Batistuta and Claudio Caniggia  have obliquely hinted that Argentina didnt deserve such a huge defeat on Saturday night.         
	While Batistuta wondered whether the defence had a casual approach, Caniggia was greatly disappointed by Lionel Messis mediocre display.         
	Messi is a spectacular player and can play in many positions. But sadly, he always plays better for Barcelona. He was supposed to hold the team together against Germany but couldnt do justice to his talent and ability, said Caniggia, whose lone strike off a stunning Maradona through pass threw Brazil out of the World Cup in 1990.         
	Former striker Edmundo, who played for Brazil in the 1998 World Cup in France, is here as a newspaper columnist but is leaving in a huff.         
	None of those so called famous tactics of Dunga worked, Edmundo said. The only time Brazil were in the arrears in this World Cup was against the Netherlands. They immediately lost their cool. Is it a sign of a big team? the nattily dressed former player asked.         
	Though Argentinas loss was far more humiliating than that of Brazil, Dunga is feeling the heat more than Maradona. Pele had already accused the Brazilian coach of destroying the natural game of the team, while Dutch legend Johan Cruyff declared he would never pay to watch Dungas Brazil play.         
	On the contrary, Germany coach Joachim Loew, has suddenly found his stock going up after the historic win. All former German players, including Oliver Kahn and Gerd Mueller have heaped praise on Loew for his tactics and famous coach Guus Hiddink said that at last he has found a solid reason to watch Germanys matches.

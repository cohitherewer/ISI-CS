The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Archers complain to Gill
                                                                                                                       7                                        Archers complain to Gill
            A STAFF REPORTER            Union sports minister M.S. Gill with women archers at the SAI complex, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The Indian archers hit the bullseye on Wednesday! And that literally caught the Sports Authority of India (Eastern Region) and the senior sports ministry officials on the wrong foot.         
	Sick and tired of the poor practice facilities and lack of equipment at the SAI Complex, here, the archers chose the inauguration of the new astroturf, to vent their ire. And with the function featuring M.S. Gill, the union sports minister as chief guest, could there have been a better opportunity to drive home their point?         
	Things happened so suddenly that even the sports officials didnt have any answers. The seriousness of the matter could be understood when national coach Limba Ram, on behalf of the archers, handed a letter to the minister.         
	It happened when Gill, after inaugurating the astroturf, posed for the customary photo session with the archery squad, preparing for the Commonwealth Games.         
	Suddenly the archers started complaining to him. Sir hum logon ke liye foreign coach nahin hai. Exposure trips bhi nahin ho rahe hain. Allowances bhi thik thak nahin milte hain. Kuch kijiye sir (Sir, we dont have a foreign coach; neither are we getting exposure trips. We dont even get the allowances. Please do something.)         
	Gill, a bit taken aback, assured the archers that their problems would be sorted out. Rahul Banerjee, however, feels it will be easier said than done.         
	The probables for the Commonwealth Games were selected in March 2009. We have been training for the past one year and still we havent got all the equipments. Despite repeated requests to the SAI authorities, what we have got is empty promises, Rahul sounded agitated.         
	He was also concerned about the lack of exposure and not having a foreign coach. At this level we dont need a coach for our day-to-day training schedule. But we do need a good South Korean coach who can fine-tune certain things before a big tournament like the World Cup (Four Stages) and World Championships. Unlike our athletes, who regularly train in European countries, we only get exposure when we are participating in the World Cup.         
	When SAI (Eastern region) director S. Harmilapi was contacted, he said that his hands were tied. I have an allocation of Rs 10 lakh for the archers. What do I provide them out of that budget? A bow costs Rs 2 lakh! An archer needs 10 dozens of arrows where as I can provide a total of only five dozens. Its up to the union ministry to see to it that they get their equipment, Harmilapi said.

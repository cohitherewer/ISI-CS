	Sir Alex Ferguson has insisted there will be no shift in Manchester Uniteds transfer policy despite suggestions that the club would invest heavily after Wayne Rooneys contract extension.         
	It had been claimed that United, other than the 30.75 million deal for Dimitar Berbatov two years ago, have not spent significantly since 2007, would bring in a host of new faces on the back of persuading Rooney, who had questioned the clubs ambition to sign a new five-year contract at Old Trafford.         
	Ferguson, who has revealed that Rooney could be out until December with an ankle injury, has always insisted that a lack of value is the reason for Uniteds relatively small transfer outlay since Cristiano Ronaldos 80 million move to Real Madrid last summer.         
	But beyond looking for long-term replacements for Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Edwin van der Sar and Gary Neville, Ferguson is adamant that there will be no shift in Uniteds strategy and does not expect to do any business in January.         
	Asked whether Rooney staying would mean more transfer activity, Ferguson said: Not necessarily. We will buy what we need to buy. We know what we need.         
	There is always this issue if Van der Sar were to retire, or Scholes was to retire, or Giggs were to retire, or Neville to retire, but weve had that for two or three years and we are well ahead of that. We know exactly what we have to do with that.         
	We wont be buying in January, definitely not. There are hundreds of players cup-tied for Europe. You have five months left of the season, I will have Antonio Valencia back hopefully towards the end of February.         
	With the squad Ive got, I dont see any reason for us to buy anyone.         
	It had been thought that Rooney, 25, would have a chance of featuring in the Manchester derby on November 10 after suffering an ankle problem in the build-up to the Champions League home game with Bursaspor.         
	But Ferguson thinks Rooney, who was on holiday in Dubai last week, may be five weeks away from fitness, making the trip to Blackpool on December 4 a possible return date.         
	He will have to pick up his fitness again, Ferguson added. I would think five weeks should be about right.         
	Ferguson will make a decision on the future of Owen Hargreaves, who has barely played for two years due to a succession of knee problems and is a free agent in the summer, in the New Year.

	Pallekelle: Sri Lanka and the West Indies are hoping a new Test ground can provide improved weather as they look for a result in the third and final Test.         
	After two rain-affected draws, the teams head to Pallekelle, a few kilometres from the central city of Kandy, which is Sri Lankas eighth and newest Test venue.         
	The ground will also host several matches of the 2011 World Cup that Sri Lanka will co-host with India and Bangladesh.         
	Its disappointing not to win a Test. In Galle we were outplayed by the West Indies but in Colombo we had most of the game under control. If we had at least three and half or four full days play a win was possible on that track, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said.         
	Sri Lanka havent lost a Test series at home since a defeat to Pakistan in 2006 and they will be under pressure to maintain their recent winning record. Sangakkara was confident the pressure would bring the best out of his team.         
	Its a winner take it all situation in the final Test. Those are the challenges you have got to accept and enjoy your cricket if you are put in a position like this.         
	Sangakkaras 24th Test century in the last Test in Colombo elevated him past Indian great Sachin Tendulkar, to the top spot in the International Cricket Councils batting rankings.         
	The West Indies preparations for the match were frustrated Tuesday because their practice session was cancelled because of rain.         
	Darren Sammy had promised to lead his team to better performance before the series and has managed to deliver on the pledge during the tour.         
	Throughout the series there have been many positives. The most important thing is that the series is still 0-0, Sammy said. (agencies)

            A STAFF REPORTER          Barreto                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Satyajit Chatterjee had an interesting fact to share with the media after his teams 5-1 humiliation of Chirag United in their Round XIV I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	This is the second time that Subrata Bhattacharya has been in the opposition ranks and my team have won 5-1. The last time was when Bagan beat FCI 5-1 in the Shibdas Bhaduri Trophy final in 1993. I was a Bagan player then and Subrata was the FCI coach, an elated Satyajit said.         
	Thursdays match was billed as the battle of the Bagan-breds. Not only did Satyajit win that battle hands down, the comprehensive victory also signals the former Bagan midfielders coming of age as coach.         
	Although it was a match Bagan started as firm favourites, even the eternal optimists among the green and maroon brigade fans couldnt have dreamt of a 5-0 scoreline and that too at the end of the first half.         
	The Bagan hit-men  Jose Ramirez Barreto and Edeh Chidi  literally toyed with the Chirag defence. It was as if the duo was engaged in a funny score-as-you-please contest.         
	Barreto got his second hattrick of the competition while Nigerian goal-machine Chidi scored two wonderful goals in his comeback after a couple of months injury lay-off.         
	Bhattacharya made a couple of tactical blunders for which he ended up paying dearly. The first was fielding Australian Mathrew Gbresa as a defensive screen in place of the experienced Jayanta Sen and having Rahul Kumar start as right back.         
	The floodgates opened early in the 17th minute when Manju, overlapping from the left, entered the box and stopper Arnab Mondal effected a rough tackle and Barreto converted from the spot.         
	The second goal came after a fantastic build-up by the Sueoka-Chidi combination. Sueoka strode up with the ball and passed for Chidi who was given 20 yards of free space to sprint into the box.         
	With Rahul in front of him, the Nigerian fooled the defender with a feint and unleashed a powerful right-footed grounder that beat Khara. Barreto made it 3-0 in the 35th minute with a powerful head off a Marcos corner.         
	The fourth goal in the 42nd minute saw Chidi enter the penalty box from the right and rounded off left-back Narugopal Hait before unleashing an acute angled right-footed scorcher that crashed into the net.         
	The fifth goal, that completed Barretos hattrick, was a sign that Bagan could do no wrong. Barreto collected the ball from a Chidi rebound and chipped it with his instep and the ball swerved into the net.

  -  Vandiar, McKenzie hit half-centuries for the lions               Sachin Tendulkar on way to his 69, in Johannesburg, on Friday                           
	Johannesburg: Sachin Tendulkars blistering 42-ball 69 went in vain as Highveld Lions stunned Mumbai Indians by nine runs in the opening Group B match of the second edition of Champions League Twenty20 tournament here Friday.         
	Tendulkar starred in a 83-run opening stand with Shikhar Dhawan (32) to raise hopes of a successful run chase but Shane Burgers two-wicket burst stole the show.         
	Put into bat, the Lions rode on opener Jonathan Vandiar (71) and middle-order batsman Neil McKenzie (56) to post a challenging 186 for five.         
	The local team then returned to restrict the IPL III runners-up to 177 for six to complete a stunning win at the New Wanderers Stadium here.         
	Chasing 187 to win, Mumbai Indians made a rollicking start and reached the fifty in the seventh over as boundaries came thick and fast.         
	Tendulkar was at his fluent best early on as the Mumbaikar picked up boundaries at will and with Dhawan by his side, the two sent the bowlers on a leather hunt.         
	Tendulkar hit Frylinck for couple of fours in his first two overs and then sent Aaron Phangiso for back-to-back fours in the eighth over.         
	Dhawan (32) also matched with Tendulkar and hit Ethan Reilly for a couple of boundaries before sending Shane Burger out of the park in the fifth over.         
	He picked up his second six in the 10th over, when he smashed Phangiso over wide long-on but an attempted reverse-sweep cost him his wicket.         
	A few balls later a brilliant piece of fielding by skipper Petersen ended Ambati Rayudus innings in the 11th over.         
	Tendulkar and JP Duminy then tried to stem the rot and forged a 42-run partnership but the former was soon clean bowled by Shane Burger to deal a huge blow to the visitors.         
	Trying to make room for himself, Tendulkar saw his stumps disturbed by a Shane Burger delivery as MI slipped to 131 for three in 14.3 overs.         
	Burger struck again 15 balls later to remove Kieron Pollard as Mumbai Indians innings faltered and they lost the plot completely in the end.         
	Earlier, Vandiar cracked a 48-ball 71 at the top to set the tone for the innings, while McKenzie blasted a whirlwind 30-ball 56 down the order to power Lions across the 150-mark.         
	Put in to bat, Alviro Petersen and Jonathan Vandiar started off on a positive note but a terrible mix up between the two helped the Mumbai Indians scalp the first Lions wicket in the fourth over. Cameron then joined Vandiar and brought his first four when he smashed Lasith Malinga over mid-on. But he couldnt stay longer as going for a big shot off Ali Murtaza was caught by Zaheer Khan at mid-on.         
	VB van Jaarsveld and Vandiar then joined hands and brought up the fifty in the eight over.

	Monte Carlo: World No. 3 Rafael Nadal won the Monte Carlo Masters for a record sixth consecutive time with a 6-0, 6-1 drubbing of fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in the final on Sunday.         
	Nadal, who had not claimed an ATP title in the past 11 months, won his 32nd straight match here with yet another stunning display of claycourt tennis.         
	Four-time French Open champion Nadal raced through the opening set as Verdasco, playing in his first Masters final, found it tough to tackle him.         
	Nadal ended the one-sided contest on his first match point with a forehand winner before rolling on the ground in celebration.         
	You played very well, sorry for today, the world No.3 said to Verdasco after putting in another display of exquisite claycourt tennis. (Reuters)

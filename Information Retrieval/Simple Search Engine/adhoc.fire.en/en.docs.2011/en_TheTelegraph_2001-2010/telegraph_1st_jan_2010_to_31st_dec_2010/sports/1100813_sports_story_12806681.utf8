                                                                                                                       7                                      Munaf   to join squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Pacer Manaf Patel will join the struggling Indian squad in Sri Lanka on Friday to bolster the attack for the ongoing tri-series in Dambulla.         
	The fast bowler was also a member of the squad for the preceding three-Test series against Sri Lanka bur did not get to play any of the matches.         
	Munaf Patel is joining the Indian team in Sri Lanka, as an additional member of the squad. He will reach Dambulla on Friday, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan said, in a media release on Thursday.         
	The 27-year-old bowler played the last of his 43 ODIs against Australia at Guwahati in November, 2009.         
	Munaf could get a look-in if Ishant Sharma fails to recover from his knee injury, which resulted in his absence from Indias opening game against New Zealand.         
	The Indian team, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, started their campaign on a poor note on Tuesday by crashing to a massive 200-run defeat against New Zealand at Dambulla.

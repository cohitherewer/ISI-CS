	Melbourne: Keen to cash in on the Twenty20 craze, Indian investors are now showing interest in buying stakes in Australian sides  New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria Bushrangers.         
	According to an Australian daily, both NSW and Victoria have different four-man consortia from India, willing to pay millions of dollars to take a minority shareholding in the Sydney and Melbourne teams.         
	The move will, however, depend on whether Cricket Australia (CA) approves private ownership for an expanded eight-team competition at a board meeting tomorrow (Thursday), which will finalise the structure of the competition.         
	Following the super success of the Indian Premier League (IPL), CA has advanced its plans by a year to begin a new city-based competition in 12 months. Six teams will be based in the state capital cities, with two new licenses yet to be granted.         
	One of them has $5 million read to go now with more to come, a senior cricket figure was quoted as saying by the daily.           (PTI)

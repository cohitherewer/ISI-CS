	Marana: Jeev Milkha Singhs dream run in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship finally came to an end with a defeat against Englishman Ian Poulter at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club here.         
	Jeev, who had upstaged three-time Major winner Padraig Harrington and American Matt Kuchar in his previous two rounds, could not pose much of a threat to Poulter who tamed the Indian 5 amp;4 to sail into the quarter finals of the $8.5 million event.         
	Poulter was quickly off the bloc as he birdied the opening hole to go one up. A 15-foot birdie putt on the fifth put Poulter two up.         
	To make it worse, Jeev bogeyed the next hole when his tee shot found the rough. Poulter bogeyed the seventh but Jeev dropped a shot on the next hole as the gap remained unbridged.         
	A subdued Jeev bogeyed the 10th as well while Poulter birdied the 11th and there was no way the Indian could make a comeback.         
	Despite his thumping win, Poulter said he was wary of Jeev and was happy to have defeated the Indian.         
	Jeev is a tough player. He has got a good short game. He putts very well and I knew it was not going to be easy against him, said Poulter.         
	But I kept hitting good shots into the green and never really gave Jeev much chance to get his birdies. He missed a few chances out there and I just kept my foot down and played good golf, said the 34-year-old tight-time European Tour winner.         
	Despite Fridays loss, this was Jeevs best show in the elite tournament, having cashed out with first round defeats in his previous two appearances here.         
	Poulter was joined in the last eight by compatriots Paul Casey and Oliver Wilson.         
	Spaniard Sergio Garcia, American Stewart Cink, South African Retief Goosen, Colombian Camilo Villegas and Thailands Thongchai Jaidee also advanced to complete an international quarter final line up.         
	Goosen barely survived for the second successive day. After edging compatriot Ernie Els in extra holes on Thursday, he beat Nick Watney 1-up when the American missed a six-foot par putt at the final hole.         
	It was a bit of scruffy game but I got through it, said a relieved Goosen, who will meet Villegas, a teammate from last years Presidents Cup, in the last eight.         
	A day after knocking out defending champion Geoff Ogilvy, Villegas was 1-down against Ben Crane at the turn, but stormed home to triumph 3 amp;2.         
	Youve got to keep it going, be patient, and I came back strong at the end, Villegas said.         
	Cink was the lone American survivor in Arizona, sinking an 18-foot putt at the final hole to remain all-square with South African Charl Schwartzel, before winning with a six-foot birdie at the next.         
	If I didnt make that putt (on 18) I was going home, the British Open champion said. It was just the kind of stuff you almost dream of. My mentality was that I didnt feel like I was ever going to lose, even with the last hole needing a par to keep going.         
	Casey, the sixth and highest remaining seed, won in a canter, 5 amp;4 over American Brian Gay.         
	Wilson went two extra holes before eliminated Luke Donald in an all-British affair.         
	It wasnt sparkling golf, said Wilson. Im just delighted to come through that.         
	Thonchai emerged form an all-Asian battle with a 5 amp;4 victory over Japans Ryo Ishikawa, while Garcia edged South African Tim Clark 2 amp;1.         
	What pleased me the most is that I finally played better today, Garcia said.         
	I probably didnt putt it as well as yesterday but I made a couple of big putts in the last four or five holes.         
	The quarter finals and semi-finals will follow almost immediately.           (AGENCIES)

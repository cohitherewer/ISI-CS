The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Parnell set for debut
                                                                                                                       7                                      Parnell set for debut
                      
	Johannesburg: South Africa pacer Friedel de Wet will miss the fourth and final Test against England because of a recurring back problem.         
	Friedel wont be training with us this week and, sadly, its the long-term problem with his back again, coach Mickey Arthur told a news conference on Monday. I really feel for him, it happened in the fifth over of the first innings in Cape Town (third Test), but he came in and gave it his all with injections and a serious back injury, for another 20-odd overs. It speaks volumes for him.         
	De Wets absence means left-armer Wayne Parnell, who has played nine one-day Internationals but is yet to make his Test debut, is likely to be brought into the side for the series finale which starts at the Wanderers on Thursday. England lead the series 1-0.         
	Wayne is a huge talent, he bowls with pace, is a decent batsman and a good fielder, Arthur said. He has a real chance of playing because of his pace.

    - Rain threat looms over first odi vs Aussies in Kochi           A STAFF REPORTER            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Calcutta: India will have to beat Australia in the three-match one-day International series, starting on Sunday, if they want to retain their second spot in the Intenational Cricket Council (ICC) rankings.         
	At the moment, Australia are No. 1 with 132 ratings points, while India, South Africa and Sri Lanka are locked on 115. However, the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side are second on the list, just by a fraction.         
	India will retain their second place if they beat Australia 3-0 or 2-1. If India win 3-0, they will have 121 rating points, but if they emerge victorious 2-1, then they will have 118 points.         
	India consolidated their top spot in the Test rankings after their 2-0 whitewash over Australia in the recently concluded series.         
	There can be bad news if India lose the series. The Dhonis can drop to fourth because South Africa are playing against Zimbabwe in a three-match series. If South Africa win all three one-dayers, they will move to 116 rating points.         
	Torrential rain in Kochi, the venue for the first one-day International, though, has cast doubts over its fate, according to an agency report. The net session of both the teams in the lead up to the ODI has been cancelled due to the rain.         
	According to the Met department, there is forecast for more rain on Friday and Saturday.         
	The Australian team was to practise Friday morning and the Indian team in the afternoon. The ground condition is very bad. There is a lot of water on the ground, the sources said. However, we will try our best.         
	The Indian and Australian team members had reached Kochi Thursday.         
	In the rankings for batsmen, South African AB de Villiers and Dhoni resume their battle for the coveted No. 1 position.         
	De Villiers, ODI Player of the Year, claimed the top spot from Dhoni in late August. However, the South African only enjoys a slender nine-point lead, which could change depending on how well Dhoni performs against Australia.         
	Australias Mike Hussey is currently in third place. He, too, is aiming to regain the top spot.         
	New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori heads the bowlers list while Bangladesh skipper Shakib-al Hasan leads the all-rounders list.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The fourth edition of the I-League saw its first change of coach, on Tuesday, when Sukhwinder Singh made a comeback to JCT as the technical director (TD).         
	According to sources, Sukhwinder will join the team in Goa from the third round of the league. The present coach, Parminder Singh, an AFC A license holder, however, will continue to occupy his current position.         
	JCT have, so far, played two matches and collected one point. In the first, they lost to HAL by a solitary goal, followed by a 1-1 draw against Churchill Brothers in Gurgaon, on Tuesday..         
	Sukhwinder, a familiar figure at the JCT technical bench since 1992, resigned as the coach of the Punjab team in the middle of the third I-League, after he was appointed the national coach for the under-23 Asian Games squad.         
	Sukhwinder had earlier guided JCT to every major title, including the first National Football League in the 1996-97 season.

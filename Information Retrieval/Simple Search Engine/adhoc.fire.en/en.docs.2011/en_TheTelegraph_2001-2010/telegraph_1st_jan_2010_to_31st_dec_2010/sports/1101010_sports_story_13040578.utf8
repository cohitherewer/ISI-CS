The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morkel injured
                                                                                                                       7                                      Morkel injured
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Johan Bothas official debut as the captain of the Proteas T20 squad could hardly have gone more smoothly than it did as he led his side to a seven-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in Bloemfontein on Friday.         
	He did lose the toss and he did have a catch dropped off his bowling but the only real setback was the injury to Morne Morkel. He is unlikely to be fit for the second match on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flower is a worried man 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Flower is a worried man

	England head off to the World Twenty20 in the West Indies with England coach Andy Flower frustrated at the lack of preparation and experience. The players are leaving an English season in full swing, where some of them were playing county championship cricket as recently as Saturday, and, yes, it was really only last summer that a World Twenty20 was held in this country, since when England, having lost to Holland there, have played the princely sum of four T20 Internationals.         
	What an absurd situation. Whats more, five players  Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Michael Lumb and Ravi Bopara  have been appearing in the Indian Premier League, which might appear a blessing given that it is a Twenty20 tournament, but could also be a curse given that it has seemingly gone on for back-breaking aeons and that, in its immediate aftermath last year, holders India suffered an early exit at the World Twenty20, prompting coach Gary Kirsten to criticise its intensity.         
	If I were in charge of the England team right now, Id be worried. Andy Flower is. That is, in charge and worried.         
	Were undercooked, he says. We were in Bangladesh recently and we finished that tour playing Test cricket, so those guys who did not go to the IPL have played only first-class cricket recently. And I do find it strange that we have one or two T20s dotted around the year and then suddenly we go into what is a huge world tournament.         
	All said, though, Flower appears remarkably relaxed. A break has done him wonders. He is his usual candid, forthright and personable self. This is no pre-Test chat at which he and skipper Andrew Strauss sometimes appear, as regards selection and tactics, enslaved to the line from The Catcher in the Rye: Dont ever tell anybody anything.         
	In truth, though, it is not Englands Twenty20 bowling that concerns Flower most; Rather the top-order batting. A lack of power upfront has been a worry, he says. To put bowlers under real pressure you do need people who are willing to hit the ball hard. So, in the Caribbean, Lumb and Craig Kieswetter will become Englands 16th T20 opening partnership in just 26 matches.         
	England stand accused of a distinct lack of planning. We might get criticised for chopping and changing, says Flower. but, as I said, Twenty20s are so few and far between and there are such big chunks of time in between. Were on a search for the most effective opening combination and that continues. Both Kieswetter and Lumb impressed me when they opened for the (victorious) Lions against us in Abu Dhabi recently. I liked their intent. Bowlers facing that kind of intent certainly know that, if they get it wrong, they will get hit. The exposure that Lumb has got in the IPL will stand him in good stead at the start of his England career. And Kieswetter looks an exciting prospect in all forms of the game.         
	And as for the wicketkeeping position: There is a better balance to our side if the keeper opens. And while I havent seen a great deal of Kieswetters keeping, he looks like a very talented ball-player. Bruce French, who is a very good judge of keepers, reckons he will be able to hold his own on the keeping front quite comfortably.

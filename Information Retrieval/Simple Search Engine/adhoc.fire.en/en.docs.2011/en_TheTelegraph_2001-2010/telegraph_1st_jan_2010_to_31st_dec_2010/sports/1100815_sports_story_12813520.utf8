The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Red tape pain for top stars
                                                                                                                       7                                      Red tape pain for top stars
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The government might claim to have spent crores of rupees with an eye to ensuring a rich medal haul at the Commonwealth Games, but the fact is that top athletes like Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes have been denied their due.         
	A combination of inane rules and the proverbial red tape means potential medal winners are yet to receive their share of the funds allotted under the CWG programme.         
	Consider this: one of the conditions for the athletes to get airfares reimbursed is that the tickets must have been booked on the state carrier, Air India, or one of its partner airlines and through the official agent, Balmer Lawrie.         
	Although the condition applies to one and all, the worst affected seem to be tennis players, particularly the frequent-travelling Paes, Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna, Somdev Dev Varman and Sania Mirza.         
	The government also limits support to players to only 75 days of international travel and playing, which is six weeks, compared to the 20 that Paes and Bhupathi play on an average in a calendar year.         
	Besides, the players have been asked to produce bills to claim their daily allowance of $100 (approximately Rs 7 lakh) since the programme started in December 2008.         
	 The All India Tennis Association has been taking up these players cases with the government. It isnt fair to ask them to submit bills, Jaideep Mukerjea, head of the tennis training programme and AITAs nominee on the steering committee, told The Telegraph. These are our medal contenders. And it is important we provide whatever help we can to someone like Somdev, who is our No.1 singles player.         
	Other players too have been forced to go wait 12 hours in transit when a direct flight to their destinations would have taken only four hours, as neither AI nor any of its partner operated that route.         
	Virendra Bhandarkar, assistant director at the SAI Sports Training Centre, said, That should not happen. In fact, the ministry of finance has issued a circular recently saying that such individual cases can be referred to the civil aviation minister to seek exemption.

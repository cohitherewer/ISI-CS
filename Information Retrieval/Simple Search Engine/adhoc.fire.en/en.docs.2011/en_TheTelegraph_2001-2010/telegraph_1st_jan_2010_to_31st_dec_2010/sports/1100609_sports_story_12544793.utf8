	Columbus (US): Jeev Milkha Singh fell by the wayside but compatriot Arjun Atwal raised his game when it really mattered to qualify for this years US Open golf tournament.         
	The Orlando-based Atwal booked one of the seven tickets up for grabs at the Woodmont Country Club after posting a total of 138 - after rounds of 68 and 70  to secure a place in the elite field.         
	However, in Columbus, Jeev was not equally lucky. Needing a top-15 finish to unlock the doors, all Jeev managed on Tuesday was a tied 55th finish as he missed the cut off for the US Open.         
	With only 15 seats up for grabs in the 120-man field, Jeev needed something extraordinary to book his passage but his rounds of 71 and 72 left him with a 36-hole total of one-under 143. Daniel Chopra, too, failed to qualify, having totalled 139 after rounds of 72 and 67.         
	Jeev sunk five birdies against four bogeys to return a sub-par card in his opening round. His second round, however, saw him finishing even-par after a wobbly front nine in which the 10th tee starter dropped three bogeys.         
	Jeev made his US Open debut in 2002, finishing tied 62nd. He has made three other appearances  in 2006, 2007 and 2009  in the second of golfs four majors.         
	A total of 60 berths were on offer through 13 sectional qualifying tournaments for this years US Open that runs between June 17-20 at Pebble Beach. Jeev plays in the St Jude Classic this week at TPC Southwind in Memphis.         
	Meanwhile, former major winners Tom Lehman, Ben Curtis and Davis Love III, too, qualified Monday for US Open, but, one day after taking his first US Tour victory, Briton Justin Rose withered in the 36-hole qualifier.         
	Rose, who finished 18-under-par to win the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio by three strokes, posted four-under 140 in nearby Columbus and joined Memorial runner-up Rickie Fowler outside of the group of 15 who qualified for Pebble Beach.         
	US Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin missed out on matching European Ryder counterpart Colin Montgomerie, who qualified on Monday for the British Open. (PTI)

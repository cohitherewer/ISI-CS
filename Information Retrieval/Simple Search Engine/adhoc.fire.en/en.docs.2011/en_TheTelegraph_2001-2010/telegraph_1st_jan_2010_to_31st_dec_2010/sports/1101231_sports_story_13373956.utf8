            Simon Hughes                      
	Melbourne: Englands success Down Under did not come just like that. It started right after the 5-0 hammering they suffered in the hands of Australia four years ago. Since then England changed their approach. From Andy Flowers meticulous planning and James Anderson or Chris Tremletts discipline in bowling to skipper Andrew Strauss diligence, all added up to their breathtaking show against Australia.         
	 The 2006-07 whitewash         
	You cannot underestimate the impact the 5-0 hammering four years ago had on the England players who were involved, especially Strauss. Amid the humiliation, he saw the importance of batsmen making big runs, employing the mantra once you get in stay in. He also experienced at first hand the pressure on batsmen imposed by naggingly accurate bowling from both ends, supported by tigerish fielding. Discipline was to become his keyword.         
	 The coaching staff         
	Englands major turnaround after the horrors 2006-07 can be pinpointed on the appointment of Flower as coach. Flower has a deep understanding both of the game and people. He is probably peerless at identifying players with both the skill and the character to perform at Test level. His choice of assistants has also been astute, especially Graham Gooch (batting) and David Saker (bowling), who buy into his philosophy of supreme fitness, ultra hard work and playing smart cricket.         
	 Strauss close shave         
	The big moment. When England started their second innings in the first Test in Brisbane, Australia had a hefty lead of 221. There were an awkward 15 overs left on the third evening. Strauss left the first delivery from Ben Hilfenhaus, which swung back sharply and hit him on the pad. Aleem Dar gave it not out, the Australians referred but Dar had got it right, just.         
	To dismiss the England captain for a pair, at that point, would have inspired the Australians and destabilised England, who could have been three down overnight. As it was Australia did not take a wicket until the 67th over when the score was 188, and the arrears had almost been wiped off. And it was the last wicket they took in the match as England piled up an extraordinary 517 for one. The psychological damage of failing to capitalise on their first-innings position was immense.         
	 Andersons wonder over         
	Australia won an important toss on a fine batting pitch for the second Test in Adelaide, but were completely unable to take advantage of it. Shane Watson, a dicey judge of quick singles, called for one off the third ball, his partner Simon Katich was slow to respond, and Jonathan Trott ran him out with a direct hit.         
	James Anderson found the perfect delivery for an unprepared Ricky Ponting next ball and he edged to second slip, where Graeme Swann took a sharp low catch.         
	 The Perth post-mortem         
	Far from being freaked by their humbling experience at the Waca, the England hierarchy dismissed it as an aberration. This was reassuring. There was no knee-jerk reaction, just a cool-headed assessment of what was needed at the MCG.         
	 Englands new ball unit         
	With everything at stake, it takes a huge dose of belief in your bowlers to put Australia in to bat at the coliseum of Australian sport, as England did at the MCG on Boxing Day. But these England bowlers are mentally robust and justified Strausss faith.

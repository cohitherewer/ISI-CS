The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United too hot for Spurs
                                                                                                                       7                                        United too hot for Spurs
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Manchester Uniteds Nani celebrates after scoring against Tottenham Hotspur during their Premier League match at Old Trafford, on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	Manchester United had a new Portuguese star to acclaim: Nani emerged late match-winner against Tottenham Hotspur with a moment of brilliance that sent United top of the Premier League.         
	Even Cristiano Ronaldo would have applauded the nerveless chip that broke Tottenham hearts 10 minutes from time after he had raced onto Federico Machedas lay-off.         
	It put United back in front in a game they had to win, and when Ryan Giggs drilled home his second penalty, he transferred all the championship pressure onto Chelsea, who face Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.         
	Wayne Rooneys absence further strengthened anxiety in the home ranks which the opening 45 minutes did little to dispel but, after yet another strong show, the defending champions now have 79 points with two games remaining while Chelsea have 77 points ahead of their game against Stoke on Sunday.         
	Arsenal were mathematically ruled out of the title chase after drawing 0-0 with fifth-placed Manchester City in the late kickoff at the Emirates Stadium.         
	At the other end of the table, Hull City were resigned to relegation after a bad-tempered 1-0 home defeat by Sunderland while West Ham United beat Wigan Athletic 3-2 to move to the brink of safety.         
	West Ham are 17th with 34 points while 18th-placed Hull remain on 28 with two matches left and a vastly inferior goal difference which leaves their survival only the slimmest of mathematical possibilities.         
	Burnley, on 27 points with a game in hand, will be relegated if they lose at home to Liverpool on Sunday.         
	In beating Arsenal and Chelsea in their previous two games Tottenham had not only blown the title race wide open again but also re-established their own top-four credentials.         
	As a point would have been a decent return for Tottenham in their quest for that elusive Champions League place, Harry Redknapp would have been far more pleased than old mate Alex Ferguson with how the opening period panned out.         
	He would have been delirious if Roman Pavlyuchenko had found the net when Jermain Defoe provided a chested lay-off after David Bentley lofted a cross into the home box. Instead, the Russian sent his effort wide.         
	It was the start of a far more entertaining second period, which took its first significant twist 13 minutes after the re-start when Berbatov burst past Benoit Assou-Ekotto.         
	Although he appeared to have run down a cul-de-sac on the edge of the Spurs box, Berbatov remained aware of Evras presence.         
	Assou-Ekotto knew the Frenchman was there too and when Berbatov supplied Evra with an impudent back-heel. The defender panicked, lunged in and sent his opponent flying.         
	There was more debate about who would take the spot-kick than whether it should be given.         
	Giggs assumed the responsibility. It was not the most clinical of finishes but to Uniteds relief, he found the bottom right-hand corner of Gomess goal.         
	But with Antonio Valencia and Evra departing due to injury and ill-health respectively and Aaron Lennon arriving for the visitors, the pendulum swung back Tottenhams way. Given the significance of the equaliser, Ferguson would have been fuming at how easily it was conceded.         
	Ledley King brushed aside Michael Carrick far too easily as he met Bales corner with a firm header.         
	At that point, Tottenham looked by far the more likely winners as Peter Crouch reinforced their attacking options.         
	But from virtually nowhere, United struck again 10 minutes from time as their own substitute Macheda collected Darren Fletchers pass, then fed Nani.         
	There was not much space but he kept his cool and as Gomes raced out, he superbly chipped him.         
	The United supporters were still celebrating when Wilson Palacios clambered all over Nani four minutes from time, offering Giggs another spot-kick, which he buried into the opposite corner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa to end year on top
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rafa to end year on top
                      
	London: Spains Rafael Nadal is guaranteed finishing the year on top of the rankings after winning the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, the ATP announced on Thursday.         
	The 24-year-old has been virtually unstoppable since the beginning of the European clay court season and on Monday completed his career Grand Slam by beating Novak Djokovic to win the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows. He is the youngest player to have won all four Grand Slams in the professional era.         
	It has been an incredible season  one of my best ever, if not the best, Nadal said in a statement on Thursday. Winning the U.S. Open together with Roland Garros and Wimbledon, as well as the three back-to-back (ATP World Tour) Masters 1000s in Europe, was not easy. I worked very hard to get back to the top and it feels really good to know I will end the year as No.1.         
	It is the second time in three years that Nadal will finish the year as No.1 and were it not for an injury-plagued 2009 when he could not defend his Wimbledon crown he could have topped the rankings three years in a row.(Reuters)

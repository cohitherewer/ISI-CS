                                                                                                                       7                                      Jessicas record in 800m
                      
	Barcelona: A record was set at the European Championships, when Jessica Ennis of Britain won the final heptathlon event  the 800 meters  to take the gold. Ennis, holding an 18-point lead over Olympic champion Nataliya Dobrynska coming into the two-lap race, led from the start. She clocked the seasons best time of two minutes, 10.18 seconds.         
	Ennis kicked coming into the final bend and sprinted away from the tired Dobrynska to take her points tally to 6,823, 45 more than the Ukrainian. Germanys Jennifer Oeser was third.         
	Britains David Greene won another gold for the country as he beat Rhys Williams in the 400 hurdles. As the fastest European this season, he was the overwhelming favourite for the 400 hurdles, finishing some 10 metres ahead of Welshman Williams.         
	Compatriot Mo Farah completed the hat-trick as he finished the first distance double at the championships for 20 years with a dominant victory in the 5,000 metres.         
	Farah gained revenge for his defeat four years ago from Spains Jesus Espana, comprehensively outsprinting the home favourite, and Azerbaijans Hayle Ibrahimov, to add the 5,000 crown to the 10,000 title he won on Tuesday.         
	There was a point when I thought my chance of gold was under threat but I pulled through, an emotional Farah said.           (AGENCIES)

	London: England team director Andy Flower has urged his players not to rest on their laurels of winning the World Twenty20 but to make improvements in all formats of the game.         
	There is still a lot of room for improvement for us in all sectors of the game and in all three forms of the game, he said.         
	Flower said the World Twenty20 would stand the players in good stead as it would instil self-belief in them.         
	I think one of the greatest things that will come from this win is the self-belief that it will create in our dressing room, he said.         
	I dont think that could be a veneer thing, self-belief. Its borne of hard work and the guys have put in the hard work, both the support staff and the players, and now its starting to bear fruit, Flower said.                 
	The guys have played a superb brand of the game, very attacking. Theyve showed a lot of intelligence and adapted very well to different conditions, he added.         
	Flower praised Paul Collingwood for his leadership in the World Twenty20.Collingwood led the side very well. He brought some of that Twenty20 experience from the IPL, and he used that to mould a very effective bowling attack into something that restricted sides Attacked at the right times, defended at the right times and were promptly a step ahead of the opposition in a lot of instances, he said.         
	England play a two-Test series against Bangladesh starting May 27 at Lords before trying to retain the Ashes in Australia at the end of the year.           (PTI)

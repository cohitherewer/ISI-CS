                                                                                                                       7                                        Md. Sp. set to dump Shabbir Ali
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shabbir Ali                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Club will not renew coach Shabbir Alis contract for the coming season after the club failed to qualify for the I-League.         
	The former India striker has been in charge of the team for three seasons during which he guided the club to the top-flight only for them to get relegated next year.         
	We will be finding a new coach for the next season. We had a lot of expectations from Shabbir but he has failed to deliver. As we wont be playing in first division I-League next season, it is better that we find someone new to take over at the helm, club president and Union minister Sultan Ahmed told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	Neither is Shabbir very keen for a renewal as he knows only too well that he has failed to deliver during his tenure.         
	My contract ends after the last two matches and I dont see myself continuing further. But I wont say I have been a total failure, Shabbir said from Bangalore.         
	The team reached the semi-finals of the EK Nayanar Trophy and we didnt lose to Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the local league, he added.

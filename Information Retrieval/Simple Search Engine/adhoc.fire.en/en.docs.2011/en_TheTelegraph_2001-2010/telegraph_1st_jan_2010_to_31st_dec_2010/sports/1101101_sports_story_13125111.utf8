            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Chirags Subhasis Roychowdhury and Pune FCs Arata Izumi in action during the Durand Cup match, in New Delhi, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: Chirag United kept their semi-finals hopes alive in the Durand Cup when they earned a bitterly contested goalless draw against Pune Football Club at the Ambedkar Stadium on Sunday.         
	Earlier in the day, Nigerian goal machine Odafe Okolie struck a hattrick to guide defending champions Churchill Brothers into the last four with a 3-1 win over Army Red in group A.         
	Chirag now need to win their last group B against Indian Air Force (IAF) by more than a two-goal margin to qualify for the penultimate round. Pune, who completed their engagements with four points from two matches, had beaten IAF 2-0 in their first match.         
	The Calcutta side could have consolidated their position had they not missed a spot kick in the 55 th minute. Brought down inside the area by Lamine Tamba, Chirags foreign recruit Joshimar da Silva Martine himself took the penalty and made a mess of it by sending it wide over the crosspiece.         
	Chirag coach Subrato Bhattacharya later said Joshimar could have avoided taking the penalty and allowed midfielder Denson Devdas to have a try.         
	Joshimar is our main penalty taker as he practices regularly in training sessions. But today (Sunday), he was slightly hurt during the match and should not have taken the kick. It proved costly for us, he said.         
	Overall, Chirag played well except for the last 20 minutes, when they grew over-defensive to allow their rivals to camp in their area. Pune created some good moves during the period and the Calcutta team should remain thankful to goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal for saving the day.         
	If Chirags defence was shaky, their midfield was a bigger flop as neither Devdas nor Subhas Chakrabarty could deliver the goods. No better were their Pune counterparts like former India captain S.Venkatesh and K.N.Ajayan.         
	On Monday, JCT will play Garhwal Heroes, while East Bengal will battle it out against Salgaocar.         
	TEAMS

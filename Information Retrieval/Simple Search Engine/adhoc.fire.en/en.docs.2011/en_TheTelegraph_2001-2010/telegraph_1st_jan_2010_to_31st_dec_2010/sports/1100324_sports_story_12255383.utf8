                                                                                                                       7                                        Kings XI, Royals look to keep up good work
                                
	Mohali: High on morale after ending their three-match losing streak, both the Rajasthan Royals and the Kings XI Punjab would be hoping to carry on the winning momentum when the two teams meet in an Indian Premier League match here Wednesday.         
	The Kings XI Punjab and the Rajasthan Royals are at the bottom of the points table with just one win in four matches and both teams need to get their act together to be in with the slightest chance of progressing to the semi-finals.         
	Notwithstanding their performance in the tournament so far, on paper Kings XI Punjab look a more formidable side as the team has plenty of international stars in its ranks.         
	As if Yuvraj Singhs return to form was not enough of a worry for Shane Warne and his men, the Kings XI Punjab, who snapped their losing streak with a thrilling Super Over win over the Chennai Super Kings last Saturday, got a major boost when Aussie speedster Brett Lee and opener Shaun Marsh joined the side Monday.         
	In the last match in Chennai, Kings XI Punjabs batting mainly revolved around Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj with the duo adding 82 in 10 overs, while the rest of the batters wore a sorry look, scoring just 54.

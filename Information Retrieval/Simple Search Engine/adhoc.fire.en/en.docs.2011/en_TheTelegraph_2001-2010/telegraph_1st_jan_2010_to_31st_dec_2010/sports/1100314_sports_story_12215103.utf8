	Calcutta: The problem between the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) was amicably sorted out on Saturday evening after the latter paid up Rs 30 lakh towards amusement tax and levy for advertisement.         
	Earlier in the day, civic officials had removed some of KKRs advertisement hoardings outside Eden Gardens after corporation officials noticed that the franchises dues had not been cleared. By evening, though, they were back in place.         
	Following a threat from the KMC headquarters, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey and a KKR official met mayor-in-council Faiyaz Ahmed Khan and paid Rs 30 lakh in dues. It was promised that an additional payment of Rs 5 lakh, as advertisement charges within the stadium, would be made after the first two matches.         
	The entertainment tax worked out to Rs 25 lakh while the advertisement charge was Rs 5 lakh, Khan said.         
	The director of fire services, Gopal Bhattacharjee, said that his department was not happy with the arrangements in the temporary structure adjacent to the clubhouse  where those with the Rs 32,000 tickets would be sitting  and was not issuing the mandatory NOC.

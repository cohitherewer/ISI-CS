The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now, Ponting has a   few more doubts 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Now, Ponting has a   few more doubts 
                  Ricky Ponting                           
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Pontings doubts about the genuineness of his teams win in the Sydney Test against Pakistan are mounting amid reports that the International Cricket Council knew of suspected match fixer Mazhar Majeeds activities during the game.         
	The game had been investigated and cleared of any match-fixing by the ICC a few months ago, but Majeed claimed that the result was indeed manipulated during a sting operation carried out by a British tabloid.         
	And the latest report about ICC knowing about Majeeds activities but choosing not to issue a warning during the match has only added to the suspicions surrounding it.         
	I probably have a few more doubts now that there have been some allegations made about some of the finer points and littler things that happened during that Sydney Test match, Ponting told a TV channel.         
	The one thing Im very protective of though is the performance that we put up that day ... touch wood the Sydney Test match is not one that has anything untoward happening out of it because I really feel that coming off the ground that day, thats one of the proudest moments of my career, he added.         
	But Cricket Australia chairman James Sutherland said he still firmly believes that the match, which the Aussies won after a stunning Pakistani collapse, was clean.         
	Thats scuttle-butt, that is to be proven. I trust that is the subject now of a proper investigation by the ICC and we can get to the bottom of that, because if there is any truth to that then thats obviously something of great concern to cricket fans and cricket administrators all over the world, Sutherland said.         
	Meanwhile, the ICC has made it clear that it will not re-investigate the Sydney Test.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said the governing body did not have sufficient evidence to warn the Australian authorities about Majeeds activities during the January series. He insisted that the ICC will not launch a re-investigation unless credible evidence comes forward.         
	Weve kept it open. We concluded in the end it was a dysfunctional team, he said.         
	Asked whether the ICC should have issued an advisory when it came to know of Majeeds presence in Sydney, Lorgat said, these are leads that we have to follow through and be quite confident before we make allegations and we werent in a position to make any allegations.

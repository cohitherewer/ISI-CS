The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith miffed at UDRS absence
                                                                                                                       7                                        Smith miffed at UDRS absence
            A CORRESPONDENT            Graeme Smith                           
	Durban: Upset after losing the second Test match by 87 runs, South Africa captain Graeme Smith expressed his displeasure about the non-usage of Umpires Decision Review System(UDRS) as two of his key batsmen  AB de Villiers and Mark Boucher  got out to debatable leg before decisions.         
	The ICC needs to take responsibility for that They need to lead the way. They cant leave it up to the Boards to negotiate If the technology is available and they want us to use it, then we must use it. Then you can have a proper idea of whether it works or not. But using it once in every seven series is not going to benefit anybody, Smith complained.         
	However, Smith did admit that their batting collapse in the first innings, when they were bundled out for 131, was the primary reason behind the defeat.         
	I think we probably lost the Test match on day two... I dont think it was a 131-run wicket. Getting bowled out for such a score just wasnt good enough, Smith said.         
	Speaking on the South Africans dubious record in Durban, Smith said that he was concerned that Kingsmead is turning out to be a jinxed ground for the Proteas where they are somehow unable to win.         
	Weve played well at the Wanderers and other places around the world. We just havent played well in Durban, its as simple as that. I dont think that its been the pace and bounce in the last few Test matches which has troubled us. When we played England, (Graeme) Swann bowled well against us here and there was reverse swing as well. We were a little bit loose at times, the left-handed batsman said.         
	Smith didnt want to blame the wicket for the defeat, but said that one needed to graft on this kind of track to be successful.         
	It was a wicket where you needed to graft. It was a tough wicket to bat on. You really needed to grind things out. It was a good contest between the bat and ball and it provided a really good Test match Thats what you want, Smith said.         
	Speaking on the match, where the balance shifted from one team to the other pretty often, Smith said: It was tight going into fourth day Every day the game swung and it was tense Thats what people want to see. Nobody wants pounded out draws. Theyre a very experienced team. We expected them to bounce back and they did just that They played well.         
	And Smith expects the third and final Test, in Cape Town, to be another exciting affair.         
	It builds up well for a good Test at Newlands Its always a great Test to play in, and being one-all in the series, its going to be even bigger now, Smith said.         
	However, Smith refused to believe that all is lost with just one defeat. Its important not to get too emotional about things Weve played well for a period of time. We havent played well here. But we havent played terribly, we just havent played to our ability. They did slightly better than us at the key moments, and they won this Test match, he added.         
	Smith also dismissed theories that his ugly spat with Sreesanth led to him playing a poor shot and getting dismissed in the process.         
	I dont think it had anything to do with me getting out.

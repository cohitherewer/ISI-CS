The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers have to be patient, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bowlers have to be patient, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Durban: South Africa might once again try to bounce India out, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes the visitors are prepared for a face off on a green Kingsmead wicket. While he ruled out the possibility of using four pacers, Dhoni said in a press conference, on Saturday, the toss would play a crucial role once again.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Views on the Kingsmead wicket         
	It looks quite green. The greenest turf Ive played on was my first season of first-class cricket. You had super league that time, and we were playing against Baroda. The wicket here is still not that green. That IPCL ground was the greenest Ive seen.         
	If therell be any help for spinners on a green top         
	Every individual is different, and accordingly everyone bowls a different line and length. What (Graeme) Swann bowls can be very different from what Harbhajan bowls or what Virender Sehwag bowls. And the wicket also looks very different, frankly speaking. Lets see what happens.         
	On the possibility of playing four pacers         
	The last game we played with three fast bowlers and one spinner, and we were 21 minutes short. If we play with four fast bowlers, surely Ill get a match ban. Definitely, the spinner can control a bit. When you have a wicket like this, more often than not, the batsmen look to cash in on the spinners. If you bowl good line and length, whatever the wicket maybe, you can always contribute to the game.         
	If the toss will be crucial once again         
	Itll be important, but I think the wicket will behave the same way for the five days. The forecast also seems cloudy throughout the Test. And stats suggest that whenever it is cloudy in Durban, the ball does a bit. Which means the toss will be crucial. I think the wicket will help seamers throughout the Test.         
	Any niggles in the team         
	As of now, Zak (Zaheer Khan) is fit. He has opted out of todays session, but hes fit. Gautam has a niggle in his left hand. But I havent got any formal report from the physio. Gautam got hit during the last Test. He batted today but has a bit of swelling.         
	On the teams performance this year         
	Weve consistently played some good cricket. As a team, weve done well. There are plenty of positives in the kind of consistent cricket we have played.         
	If Cheteshwar Pujara will get a look in         
	We always leave it (naming the final team) to the last.         
	Whether theres any pressure to perform         
	Every game is big for us. As I always say, being No. 1 or when you are on course to becoming No. 1, every game is important. We dont consider one Test match more important than the others. We believe in taking care of small things. We respect every Test, and we are not taking any extra pressure.         
	Update on Zaheer Khan         
	The bowlers have been doing well in the last two practice session that we have got. Of course, Zaheer Khan will be back in the side, which is a big bonus for us. At the same time, we know the bowlers have got the talent. Its just that they need to execute the plans well, and have to be patient. As we saw in the last game, we were not able to get even 10 wickets. It is definitely a big worry if you want to win a Test match.

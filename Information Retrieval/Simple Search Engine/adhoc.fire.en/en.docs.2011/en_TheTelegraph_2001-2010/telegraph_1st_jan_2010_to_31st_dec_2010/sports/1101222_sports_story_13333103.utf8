	Karachi: Pakistans suspended Test captain Salman Butt might be keen on deferring the hearing of the International Cricket Council (ICC) code of conduct commission tribunal but young pacer Mohammed Aamer is not in favour of any postponement.         
	Aamer Tuesday said he wants a decision on his suspension as soon as possible. My lawyers dont want the hearing to be postponed. I want a decision from the ICC on my suspension as soon as possible, Aamer said.         
	The ICC had suspended Butt, Aamer and Mohammed Asif on September 2 on allegations of spot-fixing, during their tour of England.         
	The ICC has now scheduled a full hearing of its code of conduct commission tribunal from January 6 to 11, in Doha to hear the charges against the suspended trio and decide their fates.         
	Butt, on the other hand, said that he has requested ICC to put off the hearing so that he can deal with any possible criminal proceedings in London.         
	I have requested the hearing to be put off so that I can settle the possible case in London and the ICC tribunal will hold a teleconference on Wednesday to take a decision on my request, Salman said.         
	The trio face a potential criminal case from Britains Crown Prosecution Service.           (AGENCIES)

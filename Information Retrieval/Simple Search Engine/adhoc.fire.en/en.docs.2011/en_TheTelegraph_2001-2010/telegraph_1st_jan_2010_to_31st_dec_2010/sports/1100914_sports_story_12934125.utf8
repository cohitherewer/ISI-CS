The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am high on confidence, says Rohan
                                                                                                                       7                                      I am high on confidence, says Rohan
                      
	Chennai: A buoyant Rohan Bopanna was bundle of confidence as he predicted that he believes in himself to win his first match when India plays Brazil in the World Group playoff tie in the Davis Cup, on Friday.         
	My confidence is high. I got on to the court today itself after a long travel from New York and I was able to hit the ball really good. This four days of training before the important Davis Cup tie is important and crucial. I will be working on my movements, he said.         
	Looking towards that, I am happy that I am really hitting the ball well and playing well. I have to believe in my game and try and win the first match on Friday, Bopanna, who finished runner-up in the US Open Grand Slam partnering Aisam-ul-Haq-Qureshi, said.         
	Despite arriving here late last night, Bopanna, who has a 7-13 win-loss record in making his debut in 2002, practised with his compatriot Somdev Dev Varman on the Centre Court of the SAF Games stadium. Subscribing to Bopannas view, Somdev said: Rohan and me have been really doing well. We have come out here five days ahead to get ready for the tie. It is a good chance for us to get back to world group by winning against the Brazilians.         
	We are focused to win the tie. They are world class players. We are geared up to taking the challenges. We are accustomed to the heat and we have to wrap with the home advantage situations. Rohan is playing with lot more confidence. I would like to say that we have a very good chance but these guys (Brazilians) also cannot be taken for granted Somdev said.         
	Bopanna feels that adjustment to conditions would be crucial for the tie due to heat and humidity factor. It is one more week on the road for me. I am always ready to work hard. The confidence is there and I am going to take that forward. We are going to work-out together to make sure we can take it from here and save as much energy as possible because the humidity factor is very high here, he said.         
	The Coorgi said the tie would be a tough contest but they will have home advantage. I have been seeing Brazilian players every week on the circuit. Thomas Bellucci and Ricardo Mello are really good players, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Bopanna achieved his career-best 19th rank ATP doubles list. Bopanna jumped 14 positions in the double chart and his team with Aisam is now ranked six in the world. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathis ranking suffered after a no show at the last Grand Slam of the year.         
	Paes slipped to eighth from sixth position and Bhupathi moved out of top-10 to be at 13, a loss of five spots. In the singles, Somdevs first round loss at US Open reflected in his ranking as he again moved out of top-100 and now stands at 113. Sania Mirza also improved her WTA ranking by one place to 159.

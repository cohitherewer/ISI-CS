    - Losing 4 batsmen was disappointing: Ishant           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ishant Sharma with Zaheer Khan, in Mohali, on Monday                                 
	Mohali: Patience pays. At least, that was the case with Indias Ishant Sharma who torpedoed the Australian top-order by picking up three wickets. The lanky speedster went wicketless in the first innings, but spat venom in Australias second essay.         
	Speaking at a media conference on Monday, Sharma said he has shortened his run-up, which could be a reason behind conceding 15 no balls in the first Test.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His problem with no balls         
	I was struggling in Sri Lanka with my rhythm So, I decided to shorten my run-up by a few steps to adjust my rhythm. May be, because of that, Im missing my steps which is resulting in balls. But I am working on that and it will be sorted. I have spoken to seniors like Zaheer (Khan) and I am following their advice.         
	Whether he spoke to the bowling coach         
	I spoke to Zaheer His advises have helped me a lot in improving my bowling. Shortening my run-up has also not affected my pace and Im bowling at my usual speed. However, I didnt get to discuss the matter with the bowling coach in detail because he was not with the team when I worked on my run-up.         
	If he was disappointed with some of the umpires decisions         
	You cant be worried about something, which is not in your control. They (umpires) are doing their job and Im doing mine. I try not to get emotional with such incidents and the seniors have advised me to concentrate on the basics instead.         
	Indias chances         
	We will, of course, go for a win. Losing four good batsmen cheaply was slightly disappointing The mood in the dressing room was a little tense. But we are confident and believe we have a good chance to win.         
	Laxmans injury status         
	He is okay. He will be able to bat tomorrow if required.         
	If the wicket has changed drastically         
	The bounce is, of course, better than it was in the first innings. It is helping the bowlers with their plans.

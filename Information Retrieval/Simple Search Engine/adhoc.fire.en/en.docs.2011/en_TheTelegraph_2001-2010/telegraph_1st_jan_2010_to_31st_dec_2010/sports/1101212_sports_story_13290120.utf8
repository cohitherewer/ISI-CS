	Margao: Two first half strikes helped defending champions Dempo blank JCT 2-0 in a third round match of the I-League, at Nehru Stadium, here, on Saturday. Dempo, who notched up their first win after a draw and a loss, scored through Beto (31st) and Ranty Martins (35th).         
	Playmaker Beto, who was playing his first match after skipping the earlier two matches, controlled the midfield and kept the attack moving. After a prolonged midfield battle, Dempo surged ahead in the 31st minute through a penalty.         
	Dempo increased their lead four minutes later when Ranty Martins headed in a well directed cross from the left by Nicolau Borges.         
	The win took Dempo to four points from three matches, while JCT remained on one point. Referee M B Santosh Kumar showed yellow card to JCTs Amandeep Singh and Daljit Singh. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India can sustain No. 1 rank: Lillee
                                                                                                                       7                                        India can sustain No. 1 rank: Lillee
  - Australian legend differs with ian Chappells view             Mahendra Singh Dhoni with the ICC Test Championship mace                           
	Chennai: Contradicting his former captain Ian Chappells statement, Australian pace bowling legend Dennis Lillee on Friday said there was no reason why India cannot sustain their No. 1 Test status.         
	I dont agree with Ian Chappells view that India cannot sustain their No. 1 status in Test cricket, Lillee told reporters at the MRF Pace Foundation here.         
	I dont see a reason why (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and Compnay cant sustain their position. At the moment India have a balanced attack. Sometimes it is not all about out and out fast bowling. Australia also lack a genuine tearaway pacer. Except Dale Steyn (of South Africa) there are not many bowlers who can be really fast and also deal with swing and seam, he said.         
	Chappell had recently said it was unlikely that India would be able to sustain their No.1 Test status as they lack a quality bowling attack. Batting alone cannot deliver the goods for a longer period, Chappell had said.         
	But Lillee begs to differ. As long as the bowlers know what to do with the conditions, it should be fine. There is no better example than Kapil Dev, who got the job done irrespective of where he was operating (at home or overseas). I dont agree with Ians (Chappell) take on India, he said.         
	Lillee feels bowlers will always be at the receiving end in Twenty20 cricket but those who have the quality will definitely come good.         
	When the format is truncated, the bowlers will be obviously targeted more. It is not only with the fast bowlers, it applies to all types of bowlers.         
	But Glenn McGrath bowled brilliantly in the first edition of the IPL and Daniel Vettori has been good too. So it all boils downs to the quality, he said.         
	He also said that he was not surprised at all by the growing popularity of T20. People come in to see fast paced action. All they want is live entertainment of three hours like most other sports. T20 is turning out to be a good family outing. When Waca and Victoria had arranged a private game a few seasons back, it drew in a decent crowd. I was convinced of the format then itself, Lillee said.         
	The Australian also said he was overwhelmed to see his name bestowed in the ICC Hall of Fame.         
	On being inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame is a huge honour. It was an humbling experience as my name is alongside some of the players I grew up idolising. You never dream of these things when you grow up. I did not believe I would be seen in the same league as some of the names there, Lillee said.

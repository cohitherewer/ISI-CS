	I am a righthanded batsman. I always face problems in negotiating balls pitched on or outside the leg stump. Please help.              
	(Sushil Mishra, 17, Calcutta-39)              
	Make sure you are not falling over. Also open up your stance a bit.              
	I am a righthanded batsman. How do I pick up the right ball to step out when facing a spinner?              
	(Sagnik Saha, 14, Darjeeling)              
	Make sure you watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand and step out, so that you are close to the pitch of the ball.              
	What is the difference between an off-cutter and an in-cutter?              
	(Aniruddha Bhattacharyya, 18, Naihati)              
	Both deliveries come back into the he right hander off the pitch. It happens when a righthand bowler cuts his fingers across the seam.              
	I am a right-arm pacer. Please let me know the process to maintain the shine of the ball.              
	(Swapan Dhar, 21, Calcutta)              
	Keep shining it.              
	I am an opener. I often cant resist the temptation to chase the ball outside the off stump and as a result is dismissed caught in the slips. Please help.              
	(Suranjoy Mahapatra, 19, Bhubaneswar)              
	Make sure you are playing close to the body when you are attempting those off side shots.              
	I am a lefthanded opener. I have this tendency to pull the ball from outside the off stump and as a result get caught in the mid wicket region. Why does this happen?              
	(Suhrot Sinha, 22, Durgapur)              
	Its because you are looking to pull a ball too wide.              
	I am a righthanded batsman. Whenever I try to sweep the ball, it balloons up in the air. Why does this happen?              
	(Tapas Gupta, 18, Calcutta-19)              
	You must be closing the face of the blade a little too early or looking to sweep against the spin.              
	What is the right way to play the cover drive? What should be the position of the feet?              
	(Sanmoy Pal, 16, Calcutta)              
	Your toe should be pointing to the cover area, feet close to the pitch of the ball and the weight going into the shot at the time of contact.              
	I often get bowled by yorkers. Please help.              
	(K. Guruswamy, Calcutta-47)              
	Watch the ball closely and watch your back lift as well.              
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often fail to perform in matches, though at nets, I remain impressive. Please help.              
	(Jubin Roy, 19, calcutta)              
	Set yourself small targets when you get to the middle and lay emphasis on proper shot selection.

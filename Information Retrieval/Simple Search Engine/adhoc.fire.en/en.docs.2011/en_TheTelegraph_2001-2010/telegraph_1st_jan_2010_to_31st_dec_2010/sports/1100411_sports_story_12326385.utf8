The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers choke the Super Kings
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chargers choke the Super Kings
                      
	Nagpur: Tirumalasetti Suman struck his second half-century on the trot as the Deccan Chargers scored a thumping six-wicket victory over the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League on Saturday.         
	Suman had hit an unbeaten 78 in his sides seven-wicket win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the last match and was back doing the same thing on Saturday. The right-hand bat played sheet anchor with a sensible 44-ball 55 which was laced with four boundaries and two sixes as the Chargers chased down the modest target of 139 with five balls to spare to keep their semi-final hopes alive.         
	Earlier, the Super Kings made a modest 138 for eight thanks mainly to Suresh Rainas 42-ball 52 after the Chennai team chose to bat at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Jamtha.The Chargers, who registered their fifth win in 11 matches, began the chase on a shaky note but recovered later thanks to Suman and Andrew Symonds with the Australian hitting a 22-ball 27 down the order.         
	Captain Adam Gilchrist (7) was back in the pavilion in the fifth over with the scoreboard reading 32. Three balls and as may runs later, the other opener, Monish Mishra, departed and the Chargerss chase looked in jeopardy.         
	Rohit Sharma could contribute just eight runs and it was left to Suman and Symonds to repair the innings, which the duo did with a 46-run stand for the fourth wicket.         
	Symonds and Dwayne Smith took the team home with a 32-run stand for the unfinished fifth wicket as the Chargers scored 139 for four in 19.1 overs. (PTI)

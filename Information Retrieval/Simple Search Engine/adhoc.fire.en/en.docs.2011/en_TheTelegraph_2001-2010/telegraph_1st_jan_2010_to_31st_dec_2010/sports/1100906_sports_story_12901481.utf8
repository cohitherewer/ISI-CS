            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The spot-fixing saga seems to be a never-ending one with Pakistan batsman Yasir Hameed being the latest name to be associated with the scandal.         
	And adding an insight to the sordid tale, British tabloid News of the World, on Sunday, revealed the details of the conversations between alleged bookie Mazhar Majeed and their undercover reporter during the sting operations.         
	According to a report published in the tabloid, the reporter got the tip-off about the scandal in January this year when a former member of the Pakistan team management informed him that the England vs Pakistan series would be rigged.         
	He also got Majeeds name in January and was told that he was the fixer for the Test series in England.         
	The first meeting between the reporter and Majeed took place at the Park Lane Hilton on August 16, the report said.         
	In the plush hotels Podium restaurant, our team explain they are representing a business group interested in launching a new cricket tournament  and we need Majeeds help to bring in the stars.         
	The smooth fixer instantly pounces, boasting about his links to the Pakistan team. He asks if we will put up a million dollars in prize money for the tournament and adds: All the players would be up for that. Then not only will they come to play, they actually come to win, the report said.         
	The reporter then asked him to have a word with the Pakistan players, mentioning the possibility of betting, to which Majeed replied: Theyre cool, theyre cool.         
	Asked if there were two or three players who were game for betting, Majeed said: Theres more than two or three. Believe me. Its already set up. Thats already there.         
	After the hour-long meeting, Majeed arranged for a second meeting at a restaurant at Bombay Brasserie on August 18, the report claimed.         
	During the meeting, Majeed opened up more about his deep involvement in match-fixing and called Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt on his mobile to check possible dates for the proposed tournament.         
	The report gave a detailed list of the conversation that took place between their undercover reporter and Majeed.         
	During the conversation, Majeed said: There is very big money in match-fixing and that he has been doing it with the Pakistani team for about two-and-a-half years.         
	Majeed said they have made a lot of money and that he deals with an Indian party and that they pay him for the information.         
	He, however, said they dont do results that often and the last one we did was against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup which was about two months ago.         
	Majeed specially said that he has got six Pakistan players in the first team.         
	Majeed also said they charge anything between 50 and 80,000 pounds per bracket and for results, Twenty20 is about 400,000 pounds, while for a Test Match, depending on the situation, can go up to a million pounds.         
	Majeed then talked about the Sydney Test, between Pakistan and Australia, which he had fixed.         
	Majeed said that no balls are easy to fix and could probably get up to 10,000 each. But in terms of results, one-day match results are about 450,000.         
	Majeed then said that on Friday he would give the information on two no balls to be bowled at the Oval for the sum of 10,000, the report added.         
	Majeed further said that the players were the ones who actually approached him for fixing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federers   on the decline: Murray
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer's   on the decline: Murray
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	British No. 1 Andy Murray has suggested record Grand Slam-winner Roger Federer is showing signs he is on the decline. He has said it is only normal that Federer has lost a little bit of his consistency.         
	Federer, who turned 29 earlier this month, has won a record 16 Grand Slam titles with the most recent of those a straight sets success over Murray at the Australian Open in January.         
	Murray does, however, have a winning record against the Swiss and beat Federer in straight sets last weekend to win the Toronto Masters.         
	That followed Federer slipping outside the top-two ranked players for the first time in seven years after he failed to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon for the first time since 2002.         
	And while Murray, who also lost to Federer in his only other grand slam final appearance at the 2008 US Open, is unwilling to write off the Swiss just yet he intimated he thought his form had dipped in recent years.         
	Hes always very tough to beat, Murray told a leading newspaper.         
	Its just that, because of how good he was in every tournament three or four years ago - and its very difficult to be that consistent throughout your whole career ... its normal that hes lost a little bit the last few years.         
	But hes still been playing very, very well in Grand Slams. Im sure thats what his goals are for the year, to make sure he plays his best there.

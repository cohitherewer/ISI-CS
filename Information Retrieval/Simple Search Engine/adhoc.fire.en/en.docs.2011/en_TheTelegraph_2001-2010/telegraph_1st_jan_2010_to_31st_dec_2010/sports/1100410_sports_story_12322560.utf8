The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crucial meet for me
                                                                                                                       7                                      Crucial meet for me
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With only three days before the start of the Asian Championships here, Saina Nehwal is practising hard to live up to her top billing in the prestigious meet and also enjoying the excitement of some of the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches.         
	This is a very important tournament for me; I have been training for eight and half hours a day, Saina told The Telegraph. In my spare time, I am also watching some IPL matches on the television. After all, I am the brand ambassador of the Deccan Chargers even though I dont get a chance to go to the stadium because of my tight practice schedule.         
	You know, I am also a great fan of Shah Rukh Khan. So, I watch some of the Kolkata Knight Riders matches. Its a pity both the teams are struggling to make the semi-finals, said Saina with a laugh.         
	Back to badminton, the world No. 5 is extremely serious about doing well in the Asian meet as she is the first Indian to get the top seeding in the womens section. Though none of the leading Chinese players would be there in the draw, winning the tournament, Saina felt, could be a hard bargain.         
	Keeping in mind that the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games will be played this year, I want to do well in the Asian Championships, she said.         
	I have decided to play a limited number of tournaments this year to keep my fitness intact. May be I will skip some of the Super Series tournaments.         
	In the Asian meet at the redesigned Siri Fort Sports Complex, Saina could meet her first serious opposition in the quarter finals  seventh-seeded Mew Choo Wong. The Malaysian star has beaten Saina at least thrice previously.         
	The first among Indian women to rise to the fifth spot in the world rankings, Saina is not thinking about being the No.1 right now.         
	I am not thinking of becoming the World No.1 at the moment, said Saina. I know I have it in me but let me reach the No.3 spot first.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahela: Sachin   is still hungry
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Colombo: Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, and his deputy (also predecessor!), Mahela Jayawardene, saluted Sachin Tendulkar on the eve of his becoming the most capped Test cricketer. Both spoke to The Telegraph on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Sangakkara: Its an amazing achievement and speaks volumes for his remarkable fitness... Theres no point talking of his on-field deeds, for theyre well known... He could go on for as long as he wants. Quitting, after all, is a very personal thing.         
	Jayawardene: What should I be saying? Weve known for a number of years that hell be breaking many records... Hes still hungry and, like Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan), will finish with some records which just wont be broken. Hes been quite extraordinary.         
	While Sangakkara has played 90 Tests, Jayawardene has made 112 appearances.

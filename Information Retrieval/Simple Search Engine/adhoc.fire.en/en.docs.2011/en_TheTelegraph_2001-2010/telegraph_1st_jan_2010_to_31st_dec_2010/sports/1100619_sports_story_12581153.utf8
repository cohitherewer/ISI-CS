The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dutch look to cut Japanese to size

	Durban: The Netherlands take on Japan in Group E on Saturday with high hopes of securing a berth in the World Cups knockout stages.         
	Winger Arjen Robben is still doubtful, but the Dutch are talking up their chances in this tournament despite an unconvincing opening 2-0 win against Denmark that was helped by a Danish own goal. We just have to deliver this World Cup, midfielder Nigel de Jong said. We have got enough quality to do it.         
	Robben flew out late to join the Dutch team and is racing to recover from a left hamstring injury suffered on a June 5 friendly against Hungary.         
	Robben, too, said the Netherlands have a chance to break their the World Cup curse in South Africa.         
	Two-time runners up, the Netherlands placed fourth in 1998 and have been viewed as underachievers on the world stage for the past 35 years.         
	There are a lot of big teams at the World Cup with a lot of quality, Robben told Fifa.com. But we have a very good group of players and we can accomplish something at this World Cup.         
	Bert van Marwijks Dutch side blitzed though qualification, winning all eight matches, with a goals for and against tally of 17-2.         
	They kept their winning run through friendly games against the US and Mexico, before a 4-1 win over Ghana on June 1 and the 6-1 rout of Hungary days later. In Durban, the Dutch face a Japanese team buoyed by their 1-0 win over Cameroon, following a string of losses in warm-up matches.         
	Coach Takeshi Okada benched former Celtic star Shunsuke Nakamura in the game against Cameroon, but that gamble paid off when Keisuke Honda scored the games only goal in the 39th minute. Honda, a CSKA Moscow midfielder, played as the lone forward for a team that has had difficulty finding a reliable goal scorer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haroon: Undercover agents just a thought
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haroon: Undercover agents just a thought
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat on Friday sought to play down the furore over a controversial idea to have undercover agents approach players in the guise of bookies, saying it was not a serious proposal being considered for implementation.         
	Its not a plan as such being considered at the moment. There were a lot of suggestions or thinking, and this was one such suggestion, Lorgat, in the city for a promotional, told reporters.         
	The suggestion was the off-shoot of ICCs efforts to unearth players who might conceal approaches from bookmakers, which is a violation of its Code of Conduct.         
	However, Lorgat had no qualms about the idea despite the players unions terming it as unlawful should it be implemented.         
	Its only a thought, but I dont think its a bad thought, he said at the function where former India captain Ravi Shastri was also present.         
	The South African was also cool to Australian batsman Mike Husseys recent comments questioning the credibility of ICC rankings.         
	Its interesting. We never heard of that as long as Australia were at the top of the table.         
	We never said that it (the rankings) was the perfect system. But it is as accurate and as best judgement of any team, he said.

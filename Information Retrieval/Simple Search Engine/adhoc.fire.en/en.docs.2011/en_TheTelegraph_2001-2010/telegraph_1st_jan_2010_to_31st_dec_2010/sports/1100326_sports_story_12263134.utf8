	Bangalore: Kedar Jadhavs unbeaten half-century and some immaculate bowling fashioned Delhi DareDevils 17-run victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore, thus snapping their losing streak in the Indian Premier League here Thursday.         
	Put in to bat, Delhi piled up a challenging 183 for four, thanks to Jadhavs unbeaten 29-ball 50 and AB de Villiers 45 off 35 ball. Walking out to defend the total, the DareDevils restricted the Bangalore team to 166 for nine in 20 overs at the floodlit M Chinnaswamy Stadium.         
	It was a welcome victory for the Delhi side which had lost its last three matches on the trot.         
	Manish Pandey made a 29-ball 39 and Virat Kohli cracked an unbeaten 28-ball 33 but their efforts were not enough as the Delhi bowling, led by Amit Mishra (2/23), brought the visitors back in the match.         
	Chasing a challenging 184, Royals Challengers went off to a solid start with openers Pandey and South African Jacques Kallis (27) producing a 71-run partnership.         
	The first wicket fell in the 10th over when Kallis, who struck three fours during his 29-ball innings, misjudged Mishras flighted delivery and the ball crashed on to his stumps.

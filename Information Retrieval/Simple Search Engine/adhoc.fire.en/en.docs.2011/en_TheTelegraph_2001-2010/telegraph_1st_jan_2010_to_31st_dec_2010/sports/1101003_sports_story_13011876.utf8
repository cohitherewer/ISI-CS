            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: For the people of Najafgarh and Sohna, normal life may come to a standstill for the next 11 days.         
	Both are medium sized villages on the outskirts of Delhi and will have two of their famous sons fighting to win gold medals in the Commonwealth Games beginning on Sunday.         
	While world champion wrestler Sushil Kumar hails from Najafgarh, Sohna, famous for its hot springs, is pinning hopes on village lad Om Prakash Singh to give India their first athletics gold medal in 52 years.         
	So much so, that hundreds of people from both villages are expected to camp in Delhi during the Games to cheer their boys. As far as I know, at least 500 people from my village have bought tickets to watch all my bouts. Those who wont be able to come will be glued to television sets, said Sushil, proudly.         
	The 66 kg world champion and Beijing Olympic bronze medallist, who checked into the Games Village on Thursday, only to shift back to Sonepat the next day to avail better practice facilities, said he wanted to win the CGW gold medal at any cost.         
	I won the World championships gold far away in Moscow. Now, that all my elders, close relatives and friends from village will be watching the bouts, I need to give something back to them. I cannot afford to lose this event, said Sushil.         
	Despite the world title, Sushil has been training relentlessly for the CWG. Its an extremely important meet for me. I have been concentrating on counter attacks now. It is going to help me a lot in this competition, said the gifted wrestler.         
	On the other hand, the villagers of Sohna, in Gurgaon know that Om Prakash will have to fight hard for a podium finish in the shot put event. To pray for his success, the villagers are now regularly offering prayers to God.         
	Nearly 250 to 300 people from my village will come to watch my performance, said Om Prakash. My villagers love me so much that they are now holding daily havan (fire ritual) so that I can win a medal in the Commonwealth Games. I wish I can live up to their expectation, he added.

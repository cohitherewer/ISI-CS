The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo aim for a win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo aim for a win
                      
	Margao: Dempo are determined to collect full points when they meet Mumbai FC, Wednesday, in the fifth round of the I-League, played at Nehru Stadium here.         
	Despite half of the side doing duty for the national team and Joaquim Abranches and Valeriano Rebello on injury list, Dempo have done a commendable job of keeping the team afloat.         
	They have won against JCT, drew against Churchill Brothers, Mohun Bagan and lost 0-1 to East Bengal to collect five points from four matches.         
	Dempo will be looking to their playmaker Roberto Silva to lead the attack along with Nigerian Kalu Ogba Nannu, Nicolau Borges and Peter Carvalho.         
	Joe Rodrigues return from injury will strengthen the attack. The defence has put up a reasonable performance but they will have to remain more focussed and sharp upfront.         
	My boys have played well so far creating lot of chances, but we were not able to win matches due to lack of finishing. But the way they practised today, they are determined to win tomorrow, said Dempo coach Armando Colaco.         
	On the other hand, Mumbai FC, who are relatively inexperienced, had a dream start winning their first three matches until they got thrashed by East Bengal.         
	Mumbai FC, who are third with 9 points, will be looking to their experience of Noel Wilson, Bungo Singh and Lalwampuia to counter the rival midfield.         
	Dempo are the defending champion with a good bench strength. They have the advantage of playing at home and it will be difficult to beat them. But my boys have come prepared, Mumbai FC coach Subrata Bhattacharya said.         
	Our aim is to defend first and not to lose points.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai looking for the right start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mumbai looking for the right start
                      
	Mumbai: A cracker of a contest is on the cards as reigning champions Mumbai, who are aiming for a hattrick of Ranji Trophy title, begin their campaign against Saurashtra in the elite group A match, at the Bandra-Kurla Complex ground, in Mumbai, on Monday.         
	Mumbai, who won the previous two editions despite shaky beginnings, would look to change history and begin on a good note.         
	On paper, the hosts boast of a strong batting-order with the likes of skipper Wasim Jaffer, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma and Abhishek Nayar in their ranks.         
	The bowling is expected to revolve around the experienced duo of Ajit Agarkar and off-spinner Romesh Powar, with Avishkar Salvi and Iqbal Abdullah likely to share the burden.         
	In another match, keen to break their two-decade old title drought, former champions Tamil Nadu will start as favourites when they take on Assam, in Chennai.

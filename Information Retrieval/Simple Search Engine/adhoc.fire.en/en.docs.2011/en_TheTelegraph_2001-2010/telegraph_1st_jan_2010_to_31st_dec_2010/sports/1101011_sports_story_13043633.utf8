                                                                                                                       7                                      Manoj to lead in Twenty20 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After a new coach, now a new captain! The CAB seems to be going all out to revive Bengal cricket.         
	As the 14-member squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament was named on Sunday, there were two surprises  Manoj Tiwarys selection as the captain and the omission of Ranadeb Bose.         
	While the second decision was logical as the selectors chose to rest Bengals strike bowler ahead of the more important Ranji season, Tiwary becoming the captain in the presence of Laxmi Ratan Shukla might bear hints for the future.         
	According to sources, should Tiwary do well in the T20 meet, there is every reason to believe that he may lead the team in the Ranji Trophy too.         
	We have to look at the future As of now, Manoj is the captain for the T20 meet. But if he is successful, he will be a strong candidate for the entire season. Lets see how things shape up, the source said.         
	It is learnt Tiwary has the vote of coach Workeri Raman, who was present at the selection meeting.         
	Where does that leave Shukla, last years captain, then?         
	Well, as of now, the message for him is to perform. Many also believe that with the burden of captaincy gone, Shukla might perform better.         
	The squad: Manoj Tiwary (captain), Wriddhiman Saha, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ashok Dinda, Arindam Das, Sreevats Goswami, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Anustup Majumdar, Sami Ahmed, Saurav Sarkar, Iresh Saxena, Sourashish Lahiri, Arindam Ghosh, Arnab Nandy.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal players would like to forget the shameful memories of Saturdays CFL Premier division match against Mohammedan Sporting as soon as they can. The players dont have an option either as they take on Pune FC in a 14th round return-leg I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Statistically, there is not much to choose between the two sides with East Bengal placed sixth with 20 points from the first-leg and Pune FC a notch below with a point less than their opposition.         
	However, East Bengal will be considered favourites as their national team players like Bhaichung Bhutia, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Syed Rahim Nabi, Rennedy Singh will be available for Tuesdays match. While East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder admitted that all the national team players are fit and available, he didnt divulge the names of ones who are likely to get a start.         
	Its always difficult to carry the baggage of a previous match. For Uga Okpara and Alvito DCunha, it will be an uphill task to erase the memories of Saturdays infamous brawl and get going.         
	The duo has been the mainstays for East Bengal this season, when the national players were not around. It is then a must for Okpara and Alvito to remove the cobwebs in mind about the possible consequences they may have to face and concentrate on the match.         
	May be that was the reason that De Ridder took his boys out for lunch at a city restaurant so that his players feel relaxed before the match.         
	Its nothing special The whole team will be having lunch together. It will be Okparas treat, he chuckled. The red-and-gold brigade will, however, miss the services of left-back Saumik Dey as he is yet to recover from a fractured nose and Subhash Singh who is out with a hamstring injury. Ace striker Yusif Yakubu is yet to arrive.         
	We are expecting Yakubu to be back soon. Even if he is back tonight, I will have to take a call as to whether he is match fit. I will decide my playing XI tomorrow (Tuesday), said the Belgian at the post-practice media interaction.         
	Their opponents, Pune FC, will be largely dependant on their Japanese linkman Izumi Arata, Brazilian striker Edmar and Ivory Coast midfielder Douhou Pierre along with star goalkeeper Subrata Paul. Subrata is, however, recovering from a shoulder injury which kept him out of action during Indias recent trip to Dubai. The keeper, who reached the city couple of days ahead of his mates, had practised along with the Chirag United squad under his personal coach Debashish Mukherjee.

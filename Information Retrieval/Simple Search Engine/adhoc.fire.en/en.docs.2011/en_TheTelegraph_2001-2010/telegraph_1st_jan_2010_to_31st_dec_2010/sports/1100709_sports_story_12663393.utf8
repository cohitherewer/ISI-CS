The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We just never had the ball: Joachim Loew
                                                                                                                       7                                      We just never had the ball: Joachim Loew
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  With D-Day approaching, Soccer City in Johannesburg dresses up for the grand finale. The stadium, which will host the Spain versus the Netherlands match on Sunday, looks dazzling on Thursday

	Durban: Sixty thousand people thronged the majestic Moses Mabhida Stadium on Wednesday night to watch the second semi-final of the World Cup. What they actually saw was sheer poetry in motion as Spain mesmerised Germany to make the final.         
	It was a historic moment on the pitch as the Spanish win ensured that the world will have a new champion at the Soccer City in Johannesburg on Sunday night when the Spaniards play the Netherlands in the final.         
	While Spain will be playing their maiden final, the Oranje will be hoping to be third time lucky after failing to clear the hurdle in 1974 and 1978.         
	So far, only seven nations have won the World Cup  with Brazil leading the pack, having won it five times, followed by Italy, who bagged it on four occasions. Germany have bagged the prize thrice while Argentina and Uruguay have won a couple of times each. England and France were champions once each.  
	Statistics apart, the Spanish display was definitely the best exhibition of skilful football in the tournament. They charmed with their passing game, were aesthetically pleasing and overwhelmed the Germans leaving the critics, who said that Vicente del Bosques side were only a shadow of what they were in 2008 European championship, speechless.         
	Such was the volume of Spanish superiority that even the Germans had to concede that they stood absolutely outplayed in their 11th appearance in the penultimate round. Germany coach Joachim Loew went one step ahead and announced that Spain would lift the Cup.         
	Spain are the best team in the world. I am convinced they will be the champions, said the German boss despite the heartbreaking defeat. In 2008, Spain won the Euro in an overwhelming way. They have won all their important games over the past three years and they are pretty much unchanged.         
	I am convinced they are going to win the final because when they want to be, they are in complete control. They dominate opponents and games and have shown they can beat anyone and everyone, Loew said.         
	All credit to the Spanish, we just never had the ball, Loew signed off, sounding helpless.         
	Given the utterances in the German camp on the eve of the match, it was a huge shift of stance on the part of the German coach. Not long ago, German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger called the Spanish squad a team of the past and Germany the future of football.         
	In reality, it proved to be the other way round. The youthful German brigade, weakened by the absence of wonder boy Thomas Mueller, totally lost their way against a Spanish midfield that was dominated by Andreas Iniesta, Xavi and Xabi Alonso.         
	Their ball possession was amazingly high and they played it with whatever way they wanted to, time and again weaving patterns around the German defence, especially in the second session.         
	No wonder that even the Spanish coach was overawed by his boys display. Not famous for showing his emotions, Del Bosque said he was simply proud of his boys.         
	From defence to attack, the boys were extraordinary and played a great game. The players were like young wild boar. I dont want to single anyone out but they have been magnificent. We have another game to play  against Holland Their team represent the values of Dutch football very well and theyll be very tough rivals, said Del Bosque.         
	The job is not yet finished and we are on the doorstep of history. I know my boys will do it exactly the way it should be done, Del Bosque said in a confident tone.         
	But the remarkable success story of the Spanish armada could never be complete without the mention of Carlos Puyol, who punctured the hopes the young German team with a mind- blowing goal.         
	In the 72nd minute, Puyol, whose Catalan nickname is Tiburon, the shark, hammered a header from a Xavi corner kick past German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to catapult Spain into their first World Cup final. It was definitely the most inspiring moment of his career.         
	We are so happy to make the final at last, said Man of the Match Xavi after the match. I thought the whole team was great and Puyol just threw himself at the ball when he scored the goal. It was a superb effort.         
	German assistant coach Hansi Flick said: We have learned a lesson or two from this match. We are on the right road but it was evident we havent reached the end of this learning curve. We wanted to deny them the space they needed and force them into mistakes. But you have to admit that they are one of the best teams in the world, they are technically gifted and are great at keeping possession.

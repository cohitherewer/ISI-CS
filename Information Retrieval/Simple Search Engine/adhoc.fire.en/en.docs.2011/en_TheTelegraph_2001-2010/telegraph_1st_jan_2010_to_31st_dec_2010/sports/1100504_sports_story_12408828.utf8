The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Higgins career under threat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Higgins career under threat
            Paul Kelso                      
	John Higgins career could effectively be over after the reigning world champion was recorded allegedly offering to throw frames in future events in exchange for 259,000. He has subsequently been suspended.         
	Higginss entanglement in a sting during the World Championship is the highest-profile case of alleged match-fixing to hit the sport but it is by no means the first, and precedent suggests that at 34 the Scotsman faces a long and possibly terminal expulsion from the game.         
	In 2005, Quinten Hann was also caught in a newspaper sting, apparently offering to throw a match against Ken Doherty at the China Open. Hann was banned for eight years for breaching rules that prevent players from soliciting any payment in exchange for influencing the outcome of any game.         
	If Higgins is guilty of that offence, he can expect a similarly harsh penalty, and he and his manager, Pat Mooney  until Sunday a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association board member  could also be penalised for failing to report the approach to the governing body.         
	Betting and anti-corruption experts contacted by this newspaper would not be drawn on the severity of Higginss transgression, but there was agreement that the incident underlined snookers vulnerability to corruption.         
	As an individual sport in which the participants have complete control of the variables when they are at the table, snooker is almost uniquely exposed to manipulation.         
	Three players in the world top 50 are the subject of police investigation into suspected corruption. World No. 2 Stephen Maguire and Jamie Burnett are under investigation by Strathclyde Police following a match in 2008, won 9-3 by Maguire, in which unusually large amounts were wagered on that result. Last month Maguire called on bookmakers not to take bets on his matches to end speculation.

	Calcutta/Johannesburg: Anil Kumbles Royal Challengers Bangalore would have to quickly get over the disappointment of a two-run defeat to Mumbai Indians as they take on Highveld Lions in a must-win Champions League Twenty20 Group B match here Tuesday.         
	The Bangalore side had put up a spirited performance against Mumbai but Sachin Tendulkars men snatched a narrow victory and now Tuesdays encounter has become a virtual quarter final for Kumbles team.         
	Experienced South African Jacques Kallis has returned to the RCB squad after recovering from a back injury, while captain Rahul Dravid is also in fine touch and the duo have to give the Indian Premier League side a solid opening against the Lions.         
	Virat Kohli, who regained some lost form with a fluent 47 against Mumbai, and their New Zealand import Ross Taylors role are also going to be crucial in the middle overs on the New Wanderers pitch.         
	While Kallis return is also good news for the teams bowling department, pacer Dale Steyn would be more than eager to capitalise on home conditions to help the side book a semi-final berth in the show-piece tournament.         
	RCBs spin attack would be handled by none other than legendary tweaker Kumble.         
	On the other hand, captain Alviro Petersen, who cracked an unbeaten 38-ball 57 in their last match against Guyana, and Richard Cameron are the mainstay of Lions batting order.         
	In another development, RCB have been fined for maintaining a slow over rate during their match against Mumbai Indians. RCB were assessed to be one over behind the required rate after allowances were taken into consideration. Kumble has been fined $1500 and each player $750.         
	Meanwhile, a low profile Guyana will lock horns with South Australia Redbacks in another Group B encounter of the day at the same venue. South Australia have already qualified for semi-final.

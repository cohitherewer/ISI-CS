The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pullouts dont matter: Sania
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pullouts dont matter: Sania
                  Sania Mirza                     
	New Delhi: The game of tennis has enough depth to negate the absence of star players when the sport makes its debut at the Commonwealth Games, feels Indias tennis ace Sania Mirza.         
	It would have been a treat for home fans had world No.4 Andy Murray, former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt, French Open finalist Smantha Stosur and Cyprus Marcos Bhagdatis, who recently stunned Rafael Nadal, not pulled out of the Games. The event is clashing with prestigious season-ending ranking events on the two professional Tours, forcing players to decide against playing in the Games.         
	Sania, who has been Indias face on the WTA circuit last half-a-decade, feels star-factor or rankings dont count much when one is on court. As a tennis player, one can only compete with the players who are on the other side of the net! However, I can assure you that at least in a global sport like tennis, the depth is tremendous and stardom or rankings have no bearing once a player enters the court, Sania said.         
	Indias mens squad is packed with legends such as Leander Paes and rising stars in Somev Dev Varman but the womens squad wears a completely different look.         
	AITA (All India Tennis Association) had to recall 33-year-old Nirupama Sanjeev for the Games and apart from Sania and Nirupama, another veteran Rushmi Chakravarthy (513) and youngster Poojashree Venkatesh (444) comprise the four-member womens team.         
	Sania acknowledged the bleak picture. It is a great achievement for Niru to be still good enough to get into the team. However, it is disappointing that the cupboard of upcoming talent in Indian womens tennis looks bare, Sania said.         
	Sania will not compete in the womens doubles event as Poojashree and Rushmi will take part in the event. She will play in the singles and pair up with Leander Paes in the mixed doubles. Nirupama will pair up with Rohan Bopanna in the mixed doubles.         
	Talking about her own expectations at the Games, worlds third largest sporting event in terms of participation of countries, Sania said she just believes in giving her best shot and not think much beyond that.

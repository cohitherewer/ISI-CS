The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ancelotti:EPL title within our reach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ancelotti:EPL title within our reach
            Ben Smith                      
	Carlo Ancelottis claim that the Premier League is now in our hands may have felt strangely appropriate after Chelseas controversial 1-0 victory over Bolton Wanderers.         
	However, the Chelsea manager has called on his players to remain calm and focused as they close in on their first Premier League title since 2006.         
	Ancelottis side laboured to a 1-0 victory at Stamford Bridge Monday night, a result that leaves them four points clear of Manchester United at the top of the table with four matches remaining.         
	Nicolas Anelkas first-half goal, his first in 14 games, wrapped up the points, but Chelsea were fortunate to see two penalty appeals waved away by referee Lee Probert.         
	The officials failure to award spot-kicks for handballs by Didier Drogba and John Terry, one in each half, provoked Owen Coyle to confront Probert as he left the pitch on the final whistle to seek an explanation for the oversights.         
	Nevertheless, Ancelotti believes his players are not suffering from title jitters.         
	Now the Premier League is in our hands and we have to stay focused and calm, he said. We have to play game by game, and we are not interested in the results of the other teams.         
	There was pressure on us to get this result because we needed to improve our position, but I think the players now have very good motivation to arrive well to the end of the season.         
	We had 21 shots, so we deserved to win. Theres no debate about this. It was difficult because, when youre 1-0 up, you have to be careful right to the end. For me, it was a very good performance. Now we have more possibility to win the title than, with respect, Manchester United and Arsenal, but we are not sure yet.         
	We have to play four tough games and we know that we have to fight again. But were ready to fight.         
	John Terry, the Chelsea captain, has urged his team-mates to create history with a Premier League and FA Cup Double.         
	Theres a real togetherness. We have a chance to make history and are determined to achieve it, Terry said.         
	We have not won the league for the last three years. Weve won the FA Cup twice in that time. We have never won the league and cup double.         
	In my lifetime only Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal have, so when the opportunity arises you have to seize it. When you seize it, you can make history.           THE TIMES, LONDON

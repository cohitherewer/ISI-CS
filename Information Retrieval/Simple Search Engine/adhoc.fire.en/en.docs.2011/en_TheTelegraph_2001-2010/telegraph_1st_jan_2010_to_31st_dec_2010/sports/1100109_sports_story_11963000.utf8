                                                                                                                       7                                        India hoping for Ram boost
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Rajeev Ram                           
	Chennai: Rajeev Ram, the Indiana-based Non-Resident Indian placed 79 in the ATP rankings, could soon be eligible to represent India in the Davis Cup and other international tournaments, according to Karti Chidambaram, the vice-president of the All India Tennis Association (AITA).         
	Chidambaram, also the chairman of the Chennai Open organising committee, said AITA would also make efforts to get Prakash Amritraj playing for India again.         
	Now, only a player holding an Indian passport can represent India, said the AITA official. But today, the Prime Minister said that NRIs could be granted voting rights. It gives us hope that foreign-based Indian players could also be included in the national teams very soon.         
	Chidambaram said that the addition of Rajeev and Prakash to a pool that includes the likes of Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Som Dev Varman could make India a formidable team.         
	Born to Indian parents in Colorado, 25-year-old Rajeev first made a mark on the professional circuit when he stretched Stanlislas Wawrinka to five sets at the US Open in 2005.         
	He is also a fine doubles player and is ranked No.39 in the world. Last year he won the doubles title at Chennai Open.         
	Both Rajeev and Prakash have expressed their willingness to play for India but are not too keen to surrender their US passports.         
	On Saturday, the Chennai Open organising committee will honour the members of the 1966 Indian Davis Cup team that reached the final before losing to Australia in Melbourne.         
	While Ramanathan Krishnan, Jaidip Mukerjea and S.P. Mishra will be present, the organising committee has requested the Ajit, the brother of the late Premjit Lall, to attend the function.         
	Them will receive Rs 2.5 lakh each and a commemorative wrist watch, said an official of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association.         
	We also plan to honour the other two Indian teams that reached the Davis Cup finals, in 1974 and 1987, in the coming two years, he said.

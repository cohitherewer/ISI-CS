The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for captain Ponting to make the difference
                                                                                                                       7                                        Time for captain Ponting to make the difference
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting during a training session, in Bangalore, on Thursday                           
	Calcutta: Often, statistics dont reveal everything. A study of the figures related to Ricky Ponting as Australias Test captain, though, says quite a bit.         
	From a success percentage of 75.61 in the first four years, when he had the services of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist for much of that period, the last two-and-a-half years have seen a fall to 51.61.         
	Clearly, when the XI was packed with match-winners, Ponting didnt have much to do. In the changed circumstances, however, hes been found wanting somewhat. Purely as a captain, that is.         
	There hasnt, after all, really been an inspirational spark which will be talked about for many seasons.         
	A 50-plus success percentage (in the post-Gilchrist era) is creditable, yes, but Australia have lost when they ought to have won. In Mohali, for example, where a specialist with a bad back, V.V.S. Laxman, and a tailender with a bad knee, Ishant Sharma, scripted the near-impossible.         
	Pontings backers may argue that the captain can hardly be faulted for four overthrows (by substitute Steven Smith) at the worst possible moment or that the impressive Doug Bollinger suffered an abdominal strain at absolutely the wrong time, but the bottomline is that Australia choked.         
	Moreover, few have forgotten Australias failure (under Ponting) to force the issue in Cardiff last summer, during the Ashes. In the end, even a first innings lead of 239 proved to be inconsequential.         
	As it turned out, England grew in confidence after the draw at Sophia Gardens and wrested the Ashes. Australia lost the No.1 ranking as well.         
	For England and Andrew Strauss, that first Test, in Cardiff, remains a turning point.         
	Not too long ago, landing killer blows had become a matter of routine for Australia. It was taken for granted, helping enhance The Invincibles brand. Well, times have changed and, like it or not, the captain has to take much of the flak.         
	The media in Australia have been reasonably kind towards Ponting, after Mohali, but is the reaction going to be as muted if the two-Test series is lost 0-2?         
	Then, what if a resurgent England actually pull it off, again in the Ashes, this time Down Under?         
	Last year, Ian Chappell, among the iconic captains of all time, told The Telegraph that hed like Ponting to gamble and not stay rooted as a conventional skipper.         
	Specifically, Chappell said: ...What Ive been disappointed about is that Punter is his nickname, but he hasnt taken his gambling instincts on to the cricket field...         
	Opening the bowling with offie Nathan Hauritz on the final morning, in Mohali, wouldnt have been Chappells idea of a gamble, though. Australia should have taken the conventional route and attacked with quicks.         
	In fact, they ought to have really gone for Indias jugular with the short-pitched stuff, which had become so effective.         
	Hauritz is a decent spinner, but few would bet on him becoming a match-winner against Indias batsmen.         
	Come Saturday and Ponting will get the chance to set things right, stand up to the challenge. For him, at least, it wont be the start of just another Test.         
	At the Chinnaswamy, in Bangalore, theres going to be plenty to gain. And lose.         
	Footnote: After the SMSes lampooning Suresh Kalmadi, a really positive one is now doing the rounds. Not in praise of Kalmadi, oh no, but our Mohali hero: While many in India are pondering where Ram was born, the Australians are wondering why Laxman was born!

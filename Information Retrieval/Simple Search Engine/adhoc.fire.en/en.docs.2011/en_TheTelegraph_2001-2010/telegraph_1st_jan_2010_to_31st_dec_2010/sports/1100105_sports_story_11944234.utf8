                                                                                                                       7                                      Will get better: Bhutia
  - Return of the champions Federation Cup-winning East Bengal players get a rousing welcome 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: A day after guiding East Bengal to a historic triumph in the Federation Cup in Guwahati, Bhaichung Bhutia wowed the tennis fans at the Chennai Open.         
	The striker entertained the Centre Court audience with his aces, returns and lobs as he starred in a friendly match alongwith Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Tamil superstar Surya.         
	Described by master of ceremonies Vijay Amritraj as Gods gift to Indian football, Bhutia was a huge hit with the local crowd and was mobbed by the fans as he walked off the court.         
	Later, speaking to The Telegraph on a more serious note, Bhutia termed the victory in the Federation Cup as a special occasion in his career.         
	Personally, it was a hugely satisfying triumph, admitted the national captain. I have won many tournaments but the one on Sunday was really special.         
	Let me make it clear. I switched over to East Bengal only recently from Mohun Bagan and so much was written about it. So, it was very important for me to win the trophy this time.         
	What gives Bhutia more satisfaction was that he could win the Federation Cup for East Bengal for the first time in his 16-year association with the game at the highest level. Previously, I won the Fed Cup twice but on both occasion I was wearing the Mohun Bagan jersey. I had played for East Bengal before but this title somehow eluded me every time.         
	Bhutia vehemently denied any suggestion that it was a grudge tournament for him after being suspended by Mohun Bagan for no fault of his own. It wasnt so, said Bhutia with a smile. Like everyone else, I love to win any tournament that I play, he stressed.         
	Bhutia said he greatly cherished the win over Mohun Bagan in the semi-final. But then, it wasnt because I suddenly had to leave Mohun Bagan and join East Bengal. Believe me, I was not looking for any revenge. Who doesnt want to play and win in an East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match? I am happy that I could give something back to the millions of East Bengal fans.         
	Bhutia felt strengthening of the defence proved crucial for East Bengals win.         
	Secondly, most of our junior footballers have finally strted playing well. Now that they have found their , it is really helping the team. I am sure East Bengal will get better and better in the I-League, he said.

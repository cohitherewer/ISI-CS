The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jason Day takes the sole lead

	Norton: The way the roars reverberated through the trees and across the golf course at T.P.C. Boston, on Sunday, it almost sounded as if Tom Brady and the Patriots were pouring on the points up the road in Foxborough. But all this exuberance was generated by a day of chip-ins, hole-outs, back-nine 30s, eagles and double eagles at the Deutsche Bank Championship  where Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker, Luke Donald, Steve Stricker, Phil Mickelson and a host of others  put on an extraordinary show, in the PGA Tours FedEx Cup playoffs.         
	When Snedeker holed the last pitch for an improbable par and a 67 from off the green at the 18th and Day holed the last putt for birdie and a 66 to tie the tournament 54-hole, scoring record of 17-under-par 196, that one stroke separated the pair who had come into the day, tied for the lead. Donald (66) was a stroke further back at 198.         
	Day, a 22-year-old Australian, had only one bogey and a chance to eagle the 18th from 25 feet above the hole. Snedeker, who hit his second shot into a hazard at the par-5 18th and chunked his fourth from short of the green, staved off bogey with a 40-foot chip for par that ignited a roar from the grandstand and a smile from Day.         
	I was thinking he was going to just get up and down and make bogey, and I was going to make an eagle or birdie, Day said. That would have gave me a nice little cushion going into tomorrow. But Brandt is a competitor, and he stuck it out until the end and made a really good par save. Im going to look forward to tomorrow. Its going to be really, really enjoyable.         
	It should be that, and for more than just the final pairing. Stricker, who shot a 67 in his fourth straight round without a bogey dating to the Barclays, can supplant Tiger Woods as the No. 1 golfer in the world rankings if he wins and Mickelson finishes out of the top three. Mickelson shot a 67 and is five strokes back.         
	Im going to have to shoot something really low, I imagine, to catch the leaders, Stricker said. But itll be fun to try, and we should have a good day.         
	Mickelson can also knock Woods from the top spot he has occupied for 273 weeks by winning, finishing second (with Woods out of the top three) or fourth, if Stricker does not win and Woods  who shot a 69 and was tied for 23rd  finishes out of the top 24.         
	A right-hander, who plays golf left-handed, and is sometimes known as Phil the Thrill, Mickelson gave the crowd plenty of what it came to see. In one highlight, he hit the flagstick on his approach from 134 yards at the 15th hole, and after the ball bounced back 46 feet from the cup, he drained a birdie chip from off the green.         
	His day was set up by his driver, which he hit straight  12 of 14 fairways  and long, with half his tee shots exceeding 300 yards. When Mickelson drives the ball in the fairway with regularity, he is a threat to win. As for the race for No. 1, this is his best chance to grab it since the W.G.C.-Bridgestone last month, where he closed with a 78.         
	Im looking forward to getting in the hunt tomorrow (on Monday) and seeing if I can get off to a good start and make some birdies and move up that leader board, he said.         
	Mickelson saw how fast that could happen here. Vijay Singh, playing in the twosome ahead of Mickelson, on Sunday, took aim at the back pin position at No. 2, a 567-yard, par-5 playing dead downwind. After a drive of 337 yards, Singh had 230 remaining and hit a 5-iron on the front of the green. His ball rolled up the shelf, hit the middle of the flagstick and went in for golfs rara avis, the double eagle.         
	It was that kind of day, a set-up for a finish in which anything could happen.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

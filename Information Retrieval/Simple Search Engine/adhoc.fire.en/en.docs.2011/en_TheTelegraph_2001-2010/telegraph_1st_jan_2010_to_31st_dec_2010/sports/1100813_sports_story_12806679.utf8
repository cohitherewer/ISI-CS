The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB aims to prune list
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB aims to prune list
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is looking to limit the number of probables for its senior squad to within 30 this time as compared to other years when the list has been known to go up to 45 or so.         
	Sambaran Banerjee, the chairman of the senior selection committee, Thursday met joint secretary Biswarup Dey to discuss the inordinate delay in releasing the initial list of probables.         
	We will name the probables in the last week of this month. However, Ive had a discussion with the joint secretary that we shouldnt name more than 30 players. It becomes very difficult for a coach to conduct the sessions when you have too many players.         
	The coach should be able to devote quality time to the players available, Banerjee said. That none among the younger crop of players has been able to make an impression at local and club tournaments makes it easier for the selectors to choose the squad.         
	All I can say is that pacer Mohammed Sami Ahmed has a bright chance of making it to the squad as the third pacer after Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda.         
	I am confident that Sami will fully utilise the chances he will get during the upcoming Moin-ud-Dowlah Trophy and the JP Atray meet. He can swing the ball both ways and can be an asset to Bengal, he said.         
	Banerjee also wants a vice-captain named right at the outset in order to avoid unnecessary confusion in event of the regular captains absence.

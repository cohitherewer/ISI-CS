The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting stresses on the right spirit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting stresses on the right spirit
                      
	Chandigarh: Australia captain Ricky Ponting Tuesday asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to get to the root of the spot-fixing allegations against Pakistan but said banning the country was not a solution to the problem.         
	Ponting said the governing body needs to clean up the mess quickly to ensure that the credibility of the game doesnt take a bigger hit.         
	The ICC should get to the bottom of the allegations. But it wont be a wise decision to keep Pakistan out of international cricket because it will have a bigger impact on other things, Ponting said during a media conference, ahead of the first Test against India, starting October 1, in Mohali.         
	Ponting refused to comment on Ijaz Butts allegations, saying that the investigations were on and the image of the game has taken a battering. He, however, said that we are here to play the best brand of cricket and hoped the games image would improve.         
	Asked if any Aussie player had been approached by any bookie in the past, Ponting said: The Australian team is very well educated on that side. We havent been approached by anyone. We are briefed very well by our team management from time to time.         
	Ponting, who does not have a very good individual record in India, said he would be aiming to improve that and take some positives from the two-match series ahead of the Ashes and next years World Cup.         
	Australia-India series have traditionally been stormy affairs in the past with off-field controversies grabbing headlines as much as the on-field action.         
	Ponting said the rivalry has built over the years and as long as players dont cross the line, some banter only adds zing to the contests.         
	(Its okay) as long as players play in the right spirit. I think there have been intense moments, but thats the way international cricket has been. As long as both sides understand whats right and whats wrong and play in the right spirit of the game, things should be fine. And whats happened in the past will be forgotten, Ponting said.         
	Its a great challenge for us to come here. Certainly, we want to play against good teams and with this current group of players we are touring with, we hope we can be very competitive over the next couple of weeks and months, he added.         
	The Australian captain said the current tour, during which they are also to play a three-match ODI series, should put his team in good shape ahead of the Ashes and the 2011 World Cup.         
	Ponting didnt wish to read much into Yuvraj Singhs exclusion. Even without Yuvraj, India have some top batsmen in their batting list. Although Yuvraj is a very good player, but the selectors thought to give one of their younger guys (Cheteshwar Pujara) an opportunity, he said.         
	They (India) bowled well against us in the last series. Zaheer (Khan) and Ishant (Sharma) also had the reverse swing going, he said.           (AGENCIES)

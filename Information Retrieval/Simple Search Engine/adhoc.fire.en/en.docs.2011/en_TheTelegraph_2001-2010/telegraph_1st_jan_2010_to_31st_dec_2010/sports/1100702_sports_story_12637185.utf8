	Nakamura bids adieu to Japan         
	Tokyo: Japan midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura has quit international soccer two caps short of making 100 appearances after the Blue Samurai were knocked out of the World Cup. Local media reported on Thursday that the 32-year-old had decided to retire from the national side after spending most of the South Africa finals on the bench.         
	My next Japan game? There wont be one, Nakamura said. I wanted to leave some mark on this World Cup. Its weird. Its as if the soccer gods are testing me.         
	Cold tension         
	Pretoria: Lionel Messi missed Argentinas practice due to a head cold on Thursday, 48 hours before the World Cup quarter final against Germany in Cape Town. Messi turned out for training but coach Diego Maradona decided to send the World Player of the Year back indoors as a precaution, team spokesman Andres Ventura told reporters covering the final part of the session. The 23-year-old is expected to be fit for Saturdays match.         
	Biggest Cup?         
	Johannesburg: The World Cup could set a 16-year high for paid attendance at games, the chief executive of the local organising committee said Thursday. Danny Jordaan said at a breakfast meeting that there is a big possibility that the tournament will surpass three million paying fans for the first time since 1994 in the United States. The signs are there, said Jordaan, adding that 2.69 million people had already paid to watch games.         
	New coach         
	Johannesburg: Pitso Mosimane will be offered the post of South Africa coach although the FA has yet to enter into negotiations with him, it said on Thursday. The long-term assistant to Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, whose spell in charge ended when they went out of the World Cup, will be invited to discussions in the coming weeks.         
	Big bonus         
	Accra: Ghana is rushing to erect giant screens around the capital Accra while special prayer sessions are being laid on to invoke divine support for the countrys Black Stars for Fridays quarter final tie with Uruguay. If the sense of expectation is not enough to motivate the team, which will line up largely unchanged from the side that beat the United States, the government is offering a $50,000 bonus per head for victory against Uruguay.           AGENCIES

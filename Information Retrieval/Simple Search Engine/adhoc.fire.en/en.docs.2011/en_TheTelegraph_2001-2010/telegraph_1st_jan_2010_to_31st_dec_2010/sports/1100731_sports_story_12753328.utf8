            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia will back New Zealand Cricket chairman Alan Isaac for the two countries joint nomination for the ICC vice-presidents position. Cricket Australia have declined to put forward a new candidate after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected former Australian Prime Minister John Howards bid but they will support New Zealands nominee, albeit reluctantly.         
	The following is the release issued by CA on Friday:         
	Cricket Australias Board has re-affirmed that former Australian Prime Minister John Howard is the best candidate available for nomination for the position of vice-president of the ICC and has decided it will not consider suggesting any other names for the role.         
	New Zealand Cricket has proposed its chairman, eminent businessman and corporate governance practitioner, Alan Isaac, for the role and CA will now support that nomination.         
	The CAs board unanimously reaffirms the credentials of John Howard to be the Australian and New Zealand nominee for the position of ICC vice-president. The board is disappointed and most concerned by the ICC Executive Boards lack of support of his nomination and regards it as completely unacceptable that no reason has been provided as to why he has not been accepted.         
	In the circumstances, the CA board is not prepared to nominate any other candidate for the role, the release said.         
	CA Chairman Jack Clarke said the CA board remained disappointed that the nomination of Howard had not been supported by the ICC board.         
	We still have been given no official reason why a strongly-credentialed candidate of Mr Howards qualifications, skill and stature was not supported, Clarke said.         
	Our directors were today very strongly of the view that Howard continues to be the best candidate CA could nominate.         
	We are not prepared to suggest another candidate but given it is clear Howard will not be supported, we clearly have to consider a new approach. Accordingly, we are pleased to support New Zealand Crickets suggestion that Alan Isaac be nominated for the role, Clarke explained.

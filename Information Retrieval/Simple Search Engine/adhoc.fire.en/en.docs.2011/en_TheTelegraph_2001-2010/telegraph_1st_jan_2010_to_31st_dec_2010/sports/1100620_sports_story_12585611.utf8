The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Albiol backs under-fire Iker Casillas
                                                                                                                       7                                      Albiol backs under-fire Iker Casillas
                      
	Potchefstroom: Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas is not distracted by the pitchside presence of his television presenter girlfriend and is fully focused on his job, according to defender Raul Albiol.         
	Casillas, who is in a relationship with Sara Carbonero, a Telecinco reporter covering the World Cup, was criticised for a lunging tackle that resulted in Switzerland scoring the only goal of Spains Group H opener on Wednesday.         
	He had to explain himself in a live interview with Carbonero immediately after the match and the defeat prompted a British newspaper to suggest her presence at games was a distraction for the Spain captain.         
	If Iker has anything, its a lot of personality, experience and level-headedness, Albiol said at Spains training base in Potchefstroom on Saturday.         
	He knows what his job is and he is fully focused on winning the World Cup. He knows hes the captain, a key player, and everything else is nonsense. Well give him all the support he needs.

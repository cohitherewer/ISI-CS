	Within an hour of the International Cricket Council (ICC) making known the Executive Boards decision on John Howard, Cricket Australia chairman Jack Clarke and New Zealand Cricket chairman Alan Issac issued a joint statement.         
	The following is what they said:         
	Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket said they were deeply disappointed that their joint nomination of former Australian Prime Minister, the Honourable John Howard AC, for the position of ICC vice-president had not been supported by the ICC Executive Board when it met in Singapore Wednesday.         
	The chairmen of the two boards, Jack Clarke and Alan Isaac, said in a joint statement that Australia and New Zealand had nominated the best possible candidate from the region under the ICCs stipulated process.         
	Howard is an eminent and well-credentialed international statesman who Australia and New Zealand nominated after a comprehensive selection process.         
	We jointly nominated Howard as a candidate as he possesses significant leadership and administrative skills.         
	We believe cricket needs to continue to seek excellence and dispassionate independence in the games global governance.         
	We were delighted that the most senior world figure ever considered for this role agreed to accept the nomination.         
	We remain convinced it is reasonable for his nomination to be supported by the ICC Executive Board and we are deeply disappointed by the position taken at Wednesdays meeting.         
	The ICC Executive Board has now invited us to resubmit a nomination by August 31. Firstly, we shall need to go back to our respective Boards and then for Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket to agree upon a combined approach.         
	It is premature for the two Boards to make any further comment.

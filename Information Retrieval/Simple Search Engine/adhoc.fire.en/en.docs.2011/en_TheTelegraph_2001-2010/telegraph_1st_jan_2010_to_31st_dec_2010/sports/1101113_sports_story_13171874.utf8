	Paris: Fourth-seeded Robin Soderling reached the semi-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, using 18 aces to defeat Andy Roddick 7-5, 6-4. Soderling has yet to lose a set this week.         
	On Thursday, Roddick clinched the last spot for the ATP Tour finals in London. Tomas Berdych and David Ferrer were the other two have secured their spots too. They join Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Soderling in the eight-man line-up.         
	The Swede got off to a strong start on the fast Bercy center court, losing just one point on his first serve in the first 10 games.         
	Roddick said he might have lost his focus after qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Thursday. Soderling will also feature in the year-ending tournament from Nov. 21-28.         
	The last two weeks youre kind on pins and needles trying to qualify for this thing, and it might have been a little bit of mental letdown today, which is completely on me, Roddick said.         
	In the doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi qualified for London after advancing to the Paris Masters quarter finals, but Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshis bid failed following a second round defeat.         
	Sixth seeds Bhupathi and Mirnyi, beat Jonathan Erlich and Michael Kohlmann 3-6, 6-1, 10-5 but their progress to London Finals depended on Mike and Bob Bryans victory.

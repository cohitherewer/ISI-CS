The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A battle of the heavyweights

	Bangalore: Riding high on Sachin Tendulkars rollicking form, the Mumbai Indians would for another victory when they take on the Anil Kumble-led Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here Saturday.         
	While the Mumbai Indians have already qualified for the semi-finals with 18 points from 12 matches, the Royal Challengers, with 14 points from 13 games, would have to ensure that they dont slip up at the doorstep of what would be their second straight semi-final appearance. They had finished runner-up in the second edition.         
	Though they have virtually made the semi-finals alongside table-toppers Mumbai Indians and Delhi DareDevils, Kumble amp; Co. would have to ensure that their net run-rate does not nosedive even if they lose.         
	If they do, they will be providing a lifeline to the Chennai Super Kings, the Rajasthan Royals and the Deccan Chargers. So the focus would be on the net run-rate.         
	Unlike the Mumbai Indians, the Bangalore outfit have been inconsistent. After beginning their campaign with four successive wins in five matches, their slate has been peppered with high-profile wins and demoralising defeats.         
	They have won matches they should not have, and lost games, which they should have won hands down. Had bowling been their concern at the start, their batting has been wobbly of late. These are aspects that Kumble would want to mend before the semi-finals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | WAGs wont fire up Ashes 
                                                                                                                       7                                      WAGs wont fire up Ashes

	It may be impossible to measure the impact of the WAG factor, but England are restricting its presence by banning players wives and girlfriends from the early stages of the Ashes tour.         
	This is a departure from their last visit down under. Then, on the eve of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane, which ended in the first defeat of a 5-0 whitewash, Steve Harmison was pre-occupied with whether the seats allocated for his wife and kids were in the shade. One assumes he got the matter sorted, though given he fired the opening ball of the series straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip, something may have been preying on his mind.         
	Such distractions wont happen this time, at least not in the first two Tests, as Andy Flower, Englands team director, has limited the time WAGs can be on tour to a five-week window. Instead, wives, children and girlfriends will be welcome from Dec. 10 (the start of Englands three-day match against Victoria) until mid-January, when the one-day series begins.         
	 I did feel the need to restrict the presence of families on tour, Flower said at Lords on Monday. I think its important for us to get together as a group and focus fully on the game.         
	Flower has children of his own and discussed the ramifications of taking his current job with his wife when the vacancy first appeared. Cricket is crueler than any other sport in taking fathers away from their families, something Kevin Pietersen has been vocal about before.         
	Others are also thought to be unhappy over this latest policy, though Flower said dissent was minimal once the reasons for it had been aired.         
	Its a tricky thing for players and management  most of us have kids, Flower said.         
	If youve got a group of almost 30 people going away on tour, you are going to have differing opinions and you cant please everyone all of the time. I think once the intent of the decision was explained, they accepted and respected it.         
	At present, the ECB pays for two weeks of family visits while anything longer is funded by the player.         
	We try to time the families visit when it would be a healthy thing for the group, Flower said.         
	Having them there will be a good thing, as well have been on tour five weeks by then. It also coincides with Christmas and New Year and its important to be with family over that time.         
	If timing their arrival is important to Flowers plans, so is helping Pietersen rediscover his fecundity with the bat.         
	As Flower acknowledged yesterday (Monday), Australian conditions normally reward teams that score heavily and it is unthinkable that England will make enough big totals without Pietersen  who has eschewed rest for a stint playing in South Africa  having a bumper series.         
	I expect great things from him, said Flower. He wants to make a big contribution and this is a great stage for him to do that. Hes a special player and I expect him to be a stand-out on this tour.         
	Flower also defended him from criticism by John Buchanan, Australias former coach, who claimed England would be undermined by Pietersen the individualist, a man at odds with team goals.         
	John Buchanan is not part of our inner circle, Flower said.         
	Kevin is an integral part of our side and a healthy part of our side. Hes an exceptional cricketer but hes also a role model in the way he trains and goes about his business. Were quite comfortable with Kevins role in the side both as a player and a team member.         
	While many of the squad have been working on their batting with Graham Gooch at Lords over the past few days, Pietersen has been filming a commercial in Mumbai.         
	He will be back to catch Fridays flight to Perth and the journey that could define the second half of his career.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

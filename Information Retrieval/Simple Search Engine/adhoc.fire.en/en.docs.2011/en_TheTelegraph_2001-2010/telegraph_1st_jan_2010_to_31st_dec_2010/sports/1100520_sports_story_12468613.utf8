The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barca to sign Villa 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barca to sign Villa 
                      
	Madrid: Barcelona agreed to sign striker David Villa from Valencia on Wednesday in a transfer worth $49 million.         
	Villa will undergo a medical scan Friday before signing a four-year contract with an option for a fifth, the Spanish champions said on their website.         
	Barcelona sporting director Txiki Begiristain said Villa would complement Barcelonas quick-passing possession game perfectly. Like Lionel (Messi) hes a combination of a centre forward or also a right winger who can float to the middle, Begiristain said.         
	Meanwhile, Barcelona said they would respect Arsenals wishes in their battle to lure Cesc Fabregas back to Spain.         
	In face-to-face talks at the clubs training ground on Tuesday, Fabregas told Arsene Wenger of his desire to return to his boyhood side, who are preparing an initial bid of 30 million.

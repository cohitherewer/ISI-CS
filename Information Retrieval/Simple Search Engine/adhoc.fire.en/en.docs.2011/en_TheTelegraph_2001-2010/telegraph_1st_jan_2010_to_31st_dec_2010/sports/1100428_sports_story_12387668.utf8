The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL IV will be bigger, better
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL IV will be bigger, better
                      
	Vadodara: The Indian Premier Leagues interim chief Chirayu Amin on Tuesday said that efforts are on to clean up the scandal-hit Twenty20 event and promised a bigger, better and transparent IPL next year.         
	The job has just started and I am getting involved in it. Over a period of time, we will get into the details, Amin said in his first press conference after being appointed the IPL boss on Monday in the Governing Council meeting. Amin replaced the high-flying Lalit Modi who was suspended from the job barely a few minutes after the prize distribution ceremony of the IPL final on Sunday.         
	The show will go on. IPL IV would be on schedule and it would be bigger and better. The cleaning up is already happening. My job is to run IPL in the most transparent manner, he added.         
	And he also has some changes in mind for the event, one of them being to stop the after-match IPL parties introduced by Modi.         
	I dont know about the cheerleaders but the IPL nights will be stopped, he said.         
	[That after-match parties will be stopped was first reported by The Telegraph on April 23.]         
	Asked about his style of functioning, Amin said it would be there for everyone to see in the coming days.         
	I have my own style which will evolve. Flamboyance has got nothing to do with cricket. Cricket is itself a religion, it sells itself, he said.         
	Amin will also be interacting with franchise owners to ease their anxieties after Modis ouster.         
	My job is to interact with franchises and assure them that their investment is safe and will flourish. IPL management is under the radar but I dont think cricket is under scanner. IPLs brand image is strong, no one can touch that. Its a storm but it will pass, he assured.         
	Asked about missing documents on franchise bids and TV and internet rights, Amin said the matter is being investigated. Nothing is out of control. There has to be a total of audit of things. Some documents are missing and the Board is looking into it, he said.         
	Amin conceded that the events Governing Council erred in trusting Modi too much and should have kept an eye on the suspended Commissioners functioning.         
	The success of the IPL was so dazzling that everyone was basking in its glory. Certain details were not disclosed to us in all this. We trusted Modi in good faith. I have to admit that the Governing Council could have been more vigilant, Amin, himself a council member besides being a BCCI vice-President, said.         
	Amin said he never thought he would be given the job. The job is tough. It has been thrown up to me unexpectedly. I didnt expect to be put in the hot seat, he quipped. Amin, who is the owner of pharma company Alembic, takes over as the IPL chief at a time when the league is battling allegations of money laundering, benami holdings in the franchisees and tax evasions.         
	We will maintain full transparency. There is no hanky-panky. BCCI is a democratic set-up. We are doing utmost to make it work, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have never seen such team spirit before: Ranadeb
                                                                                                                       7                                      Have never seen such team spirit before: Ranadeb
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ranadeb Bose has spent close to a dozen years playing 63 matches for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, but cannot recall a dressing room with the spirit displayed by the present squad that fought long and hard to take a decisive 14-run lead over Delhi at the Kotla, here, this week.         
	In my 12 years at the top level, I havent seen such team spirit and cohesiveness, he said after pairing up with Ashok Dinda to help his side claim three points from their opening Group A Super League game this season.         
	We were patient and never panicked. We knew we had the match in our hand. I really like the attitude of the team. We came back really well after Virat Kohlis knock of 173, he added.         
	Bose spoke highly of his new ball partner Dinda. It has been five long years since I last had such a nice partner in Shib Shankar Paul. Dinda bowled really well and we complemented each other, he said of the man who also claimed four wickets and shared the enormous workload with him.         
	Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary hoped that the team would keep the momentum going after a good start to the season. The boys did a fabulous job. I had complete faith in my bowlers and although the spinners failed to pick up wickets, Bose and Dindas experience came in handy. They really complemented each other superbly, Tiwary said.         
	It was a thought echoed by Bengal coach WV Raman. The wicket wasnt helping the bowlers but Dinda and Bose bowled a good line and length, Raman said, pointing out that they had to lead the teams bid to stop Delhi from taking the first innings lead. It was a cat and mouse game and I am happy that my boys managed to clinch three points.         
	Delhi captain Mithun Manhas was effusive in his praise of the Bengal pace bowlers. Bose and Dinda bowled a proper line and length and the results were there for everyone to see, he said. We also have good fast-medium bowlers but the wicket wasnt helping them at all. That was a disadvantage. This was just our first game, so there is no need to be over critical, he added.

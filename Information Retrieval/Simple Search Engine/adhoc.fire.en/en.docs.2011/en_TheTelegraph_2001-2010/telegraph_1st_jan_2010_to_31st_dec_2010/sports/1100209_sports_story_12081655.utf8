	New Delhi: Having made a flying start to the new season, Gaganjeet Bhullar has now set his sights on the prestigious Asian Tour Order of Merit crown.         
	The 21-year-old triumphed at the season-opening Asian Tour International in Bangkok Sunday, coming from six shots back to win with a closing 64, and said his confidence was now sky high.         
	Ill try to win the Order of Merit this year. This win (in Bangkok) has put me in a good frame of mind, but Ill need to win the big events. That will be my goal for the rest of the year, said Bhullar, who sits on top of the Order of Merit list for 2010, after bagging $47,550 for his win in Bangkok.

	Calcutta: Representatives of some of CABs first division clubs met president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Thursday to demand a probe into the allegations of match-fixing, against West Bengal Police and Aryan, along with the poor standard of umpiring that is affecting local cricket.         
	YMCA, George, Barisha, Manohorpukur Milan Samity and Suburban are among some of the notable clubs that will be playing the relegation play-offs.         
	It has been learnt that the club officials expressed concern over the menace of match-fixing in the Maidan and also spoke of the standard of umpiring.         
	The president has assured us that he is aware of the current scenario and was trying his best to find a solution. We also told him that if the league remains suspended indefinitely it would create financial problems for some of the clubs, a representative of one of the clubs stated. It was also learnt that a senior member and former office-bearer raised questions about umpires posting.         
	Meanwhile, the CABs panel of experts, who were probing the lights fiasco during the India vs Sri Lanka ODI on December 24, submitted their report to the president.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar, whose team clinched a thrilling 4-run victory against the Rajasthan Royals, said that he always knew that no match was over until the last ball was bowled.         
	His counterpart Shane Warne lauded Yusuf Pathans stupendous 37-ball 100 and said that it was the best innings he had ever seen in his career.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Tendulkar: By nature, Twenty20 games turn out to be thrilling and this one was definitely one of the closest games. Even in the first year we lost a close one against the Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur.         
	It was a special innings from Yusuf But the effort from R. Sathish to get him run out was also special. It was the turning point.         
	Before he came in and played that knock, I thought we would win this match with ease, but thats the beauty of this game. You can never take anything for granted.         
	Warne: In my 21 years of first-class career, I have seen Sachin murder some attacks and I have seen (Brian) Lara play I think today (Saturday)s innings (by Yusuf) is the best innings I have seen. In the situation which we were in (66 for four), when you have no chance, to turn it around was amazing.

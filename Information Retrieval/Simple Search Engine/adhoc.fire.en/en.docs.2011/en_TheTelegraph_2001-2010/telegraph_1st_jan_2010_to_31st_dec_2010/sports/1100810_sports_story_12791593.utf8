The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hunter on target
                                                                                                                       7                                        Hunter on target
            NYT NEWS SERVICE            Mickelson squandered a chance to become the world No. 1                           
	Akron: For the second time this year and the third in his career, Hunter Mahan won a PGA Tour event by doing what he does best  overcoming the field with a furious Sunday rush from off the pace.         
	Mahan, 28, broke up the tightly packed leader board with a final-round six-under 64, coming from three strokes back to win the W.G.C.-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club. His 12-under-par 268 for four rounds was two strokes clear of Ryan Palmer, an overnight co-leader, who closed with a 69 on the tough, 7,400-yard, par-70 South Course at Firestone.         
	I felt like my game was ready, said Mahan. I felt like I was really sharp in a lot of areas. It feels great to be here on Sunday and hit some of the shots that I needed to hit. I knew I had a chance. Not making bogeys on a Sunday is a good feeling.         
	Mahans flawless sprint to the wire was the best anyone could do on a day in which 13 players began play within four strokes of the nine-under pace set by Palmer and Hair. That group included Phil Mickelson, who was four strokes back and needed to the finish fourth or better to break Tiger Woodss five-year hammerlock on the No.1 spot in the world ranking.         
	The already-open door was flung even wider by Woods, who shot a final-round 77 for an 18-over total and tied for 78th, his worst finish in a 72-hole event and well below the 37th he would have had to finish to prevent Mickelson from taking over his perch.         
	But instead of the 66 Mickelson needed to finish tied for third, he shot 78 and tied for 46th. He will go into the P.G.A. Championship this week at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wis., ranked No.2 for the 258th week of his career.         
	It was a rough day, Mickelson said. The way I drove it, I was fighting for pars on a lot of the holes.         
	Ive got some work to do to get my own game sharp, Mickelson said. Its important with this last major coming up that I try to get this thing turned around here in the next three days.         
	Speaking of sharp, the British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen shot a 65 on Sunday and finished tied for ninth after starting the day nine strokes back. Palmer seemed neither surprised by Mahans surge nor disappointed with his own performance.         
	Youve got to hand it to Hunter Mahan, said Palmer, who won the Sony Open in January. He went out and did what I expected somebody to do and shot a low round. I didnt lose the golf tournament. Im proud of the way I hung in all day.         
	And Mahan seemed proud of doing what he needed to do to play his way onto the United States Ryder Cup team, whose points competition will be completed next week. The victory will place him in the top eight, and also puts him in a select fraternity with four other PGA Tour golfers in their 20s who have three wins  Dustin Johnson, Anthony Kim, Camilo Villegas and Hair. He is also the fifth player with two tour wins this season.         
	I knew I had it in me, he said. But to win a tournament like this, with the best players in the world here, it just feels great. And the Ryder Cup, I feel great that I jumped into the top eight.

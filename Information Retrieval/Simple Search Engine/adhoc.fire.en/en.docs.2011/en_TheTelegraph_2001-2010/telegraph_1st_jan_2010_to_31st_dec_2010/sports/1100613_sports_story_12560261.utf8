The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Van Persie raring to go
                                                                                                                       7                                      Van Persie raring to go
                      
	Johannesburg: The Netherlands striker Robin van Persie is fit, fresh and ready to show the world he has matured from a talented kid with potential into a player who can handle more responsibility on and off the pitch.         
	The 26-year-old started his career as a winger, but after Thierry Henry left Arsenal, Van Persie became a central striker, a role he also wanted in the national team and secured in the Cup warm-ups.         
	I love to approach the ball and combine through the defence but the coach hammers (home) that one or two of us need to bring depth to the game every time we attack, he told reporters.         
	I have to be aware of that but if I switch enough between both choices it makes me less predictable for defenders.         
	But I want to fill in this role my way, I am stubborn in that. I am convinced that it will work out my way. (Reuters)

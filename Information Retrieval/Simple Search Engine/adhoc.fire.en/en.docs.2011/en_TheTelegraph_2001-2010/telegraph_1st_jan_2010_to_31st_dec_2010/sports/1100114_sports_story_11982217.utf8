                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni blames it on poor batting
  - Captain says Ashish Nehras injury cost team india dear       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday                                 
	Dhaka: Mahendra Singh Dhoni blamed poor batting for the loss against Sri Lanka. At the post-match news conference, the India captain also rued missing Ashish Nehra as the pacer practically played no part in Wednesdays match after injuring himself while bowling.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Reasons behind the loss         
	We lost five early wickets and that proved crucial. Still, we ended up getting 245 The start we got was good with the spinners bowling well in the middle overs. But missing Nehra, who was forced out with a groin injury, proved crucial. There was some reverse swing and we could have made it tough for them.         
	The batting         
	We lost too many wickets early in the innings. Suresh Raina batted well and we were fortunate to reach 245. The shot selection wasnt too great. It happens sometimes. There was no dew today and the spinners came into action.         
	Rainas dismissal in the 46th over         
	He batted from 0 to 106 He was trying to get more runs. While batting he thought there would be dew and 245 could prove to be enough in the circumstances.         
	The positives         
	Our bowling wasnt good but today they bowled well. One good thing from this match was the return to form of our bowlers. As the tournament progressed we have bowled better and better. Its good to see them return to form.         
	Whether playing Tyagi would have helped         
	Tyagi has been good with the new ball. But he still has a long way to go. He is new and has to learn how to bowl in the second and third spells. He is improving but with more experience and exposure to international cricket he will become a good bowler.         
	If Amit Mishra should have been played         
	Ravindra Jadeja did a good job with the ball, along with Yuvraj. We werent missing a specialist bowler. Jadeja has been filling the all-rounders slot well. Weve to see the composition of the side and see what suits us better.

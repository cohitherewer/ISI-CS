            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Deccan Chargers bolstered their chances for a semi-final berth when they registered a convincing five-wicket victory over the Kings XI Punjab in Dharamshala on Friday. The Chargers Rohit Sharma anchored the 175-run chase with an unbeaten 38-ball 68 to give Adam Gilchrists side full points.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, Gilchrist credited Rohit for the win saying that the right-handed batsman has turned out to be Mr. Reliable for his team .               
	The following are excerpts         
	Gilchrist: We always believed that we had a chance in this match. The ground was small and the wicket, apart from a grassless area which was producing some turn, was wonderful as well. The ball was coming on to the bat beautifully. Rohit batted superbly today He has been our Mr Reliable in this tournament. He has always delivered whenever the chips are down.         
	Sangakkara: We bowled too many loose balls at the wrong time The discipline was lacking. Our batsmen did a good job but the bowlers were not just disciplined enough to defend a handsome total.         
	Rohit: We knew we had a chance and my basic plan was to stay at the wicket till the end and finish the match Thats my job. I kept my nerve till the end. T Suman did an excellent job with the bat as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus is on game, not Bharat Ratna: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        Focus is on game, not Bharat Ratna: Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar during a press conference in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: For Sachin Tendulkar, even the Bharat Ratna comes after cricket.         
	The worlds leading batsman, who breached the 200-run mark, in an innings, in one-day Internationals the other day, said on Tuesday that for him accolades could wait because he was not finished with the game yet.         
	Awards like the Bharat Ratna are rare to come by. Those who have got it are heroes of not just mine but the entire nations. To join them would be everybodys wish. But its not for me to think about awards My focus is only on playing. If it has to happen, it will happen, the batting maestro said at a charity event here.         
	For the record, former captain Kapil Dev has called for Indias highest civilian honour to be conferred on Tendulkar and the Maharashtra government had announced that it would recommend the latters name for the award. All that in the wake of Tendulkars 200 not out against South Africa at Gwalior last week.         
	And for the odd reporter, whose fault might have only been the wrong choice of words, Tendulkar made it clear that he was still some time away from hanging up his boots.         
	Asked what he thought about Virender Sehwags recent comment that he would like to bat at No. 4 after Tendulkar had called it a day, pat came the reply: I will answer that question after calling it a day.         
	Tendulkar also dismissed a notion that he has become a better batsman after Gary Kirsten took over as coach, a notion stemming from the fact that he had asked the South African to give him some throw-downs at the nets instead of facing up to a regular bowler during the recent South Africa series.         
	Getting better is a process that never stops. Thats the reason I wake up every morning and go to the nets, because every day you can get better, he said.         
	We have worked together and he (Kirsten) has worked hard to help the team become better. But with regard to batting at the nets, I go by my feeling. If I dont like to do something, I dont do it. I plan my practice sessions with precise details based on our opponents and I execute that plan.         
	Even during the 2003 World Cup, I had just one full net session in the whole tournament and for the rest of the days it was just throw-downs.         
	Tendulkar also gave his thumbs-up for the Indian hockey team competing in the World Cup in Delhi.         
	I am also a hockey fan, but not an expert. I would like to tell them, whether you perform very well or the performance is not up to your expectation, we will always support you.

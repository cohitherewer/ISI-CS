The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injuries worry Indians
                                                                                                                       7                                      Injuries worry Indians
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India will start favourites against Hong Kong in the international football friendly at the Balewadi Sports Complex, in Pune, on Monday. India will be looking to prove a point after losing to the same opponents 18 months back.         
	India coach Bob Houghton felt that both teams were evenly matched. But our team has been together for the last three months, and having played as a single unit will surely help in playing better, he said in a media release.         
	The game will also provide opportunity for non regulars to play and make their mark as it will test our bench strength, he added.         
	India, who are also scheduled to play against Yemen (October 8) and Vietnam (October 13), have been hampered because of injuries to key players like Mahesh Gawli, Anwar Ali, NP Pradeep, Mohammed Rafi and Bhaichung Bhutia. The India captain has rejoined the team but is unlikely to play Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | KKR look to be ace at base
                                                                                                                       7                                      KKR look to be ace at base
    - Sourav amp; Co. hope to do a season double vs the Deccan Chargers             A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: As owners we encourage and love the team. Finally, the team has to do what it does best Play to its potential. Insha allah KKR will do so now  says Shah Rukh Khan, on his Twitter account on Wednesday.         
	The message, on the eve of the Kolkata Knight Riders match against the Deccan Chargers, comes straight as an arrow  get out of the doldrums and perform with that stormlike gusto which this format demands.         
	That, in fact, has been the problem with the Knights. The meek surrenders for their four losses in this edition of the Indian Premier League have underlined the lack of character without which playing Twenty20 is like crossing the Atlantic on a canoe.         
	However, that need not be the case. In Chris Gayle and Shane Bond, the Knights possess two of the deadliest practitioners of the game.         
	Add to that the captain, Sourav Ganguly. Sourav is known for his feisty leadership, and you will agree that the team have enough firepower for an explosive show.         
	Team combination is a puzzle yet to be solved by Shah Rukhs men. Be it the openers slot, the middle-order or the bowling  there has just been too much experimentation.         
	Sourav needs to lend support to Gayle upfront, while the Manoj Tiwarys and David Husseys should steady the shaky middle-order.         
	It would be interesting to see who the Knights bring in to replace Mandeep Singh, who is certain to be dropped after his awful show in the last two games. Ideally, all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla should be a better option because of his familiarity with the venue.         
	However, one cant rule out Cheteshwar Pujara or Harpreet Singh making a comeback.         
	Angelo Mathews has largely been under utilised when it comes to batting in spite of his brilliant show in the first match, against the same opponents. Instead of him being sent in at No.6 with often just a couple of overs left, a promotion to No.4 should provide him with a better chance to help the team and, of course, the middle-order.         
	In the bowling department, Ishant Sharma, Ashok Dinda and Ajit Agarkar have been consistently ordinary. It wouldnt surprise if Jharkhand youngster Varun Aaron, who insiders say is bowling at a lively pace during nets, gets a look in.         
	In fact, on Wednesday, a Varun bouncer at nets hurt Wriddhiman Saha on his left arm. However, team sources said the injury isnt too serious.         
	Also, a possibility is Sri Lankan Ajantha Mendiss getting a chance as the second spinner to exploit the dry Eden track.         
	However, it will be difficult for the team management to omit any one from the quartet of Gayle, David Hussey, Mathews and Bond to accommodate Mendis.         
	The Chargers, on the other hand, have experienced a similar slump, losing their last two encounters, against the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians. Captain Adam Gilchrist is the fulcrum of the side and the teams failure in the last two games had a lot to do with Gilchrists early dismissals.         
	The Knights must have made a note of that. Among the others, while Rohit Sharma has been in good nick, Andrew Symonds and Herschelle Gibbs have been patchy at best. VVS Laxman is set to make a comeback at his favourite ground.         
	Souravs men had clinched an 11-run victory against the Chargers in the first match of this editions IPL. Then it had been billed as a clash between the champions and last years laggards. On Thursday, however, the contest will be fought on an even playing field.         
	Both teams have six points with the Chargers having played a match less than KKR.         
	Sourav has been vocal about his team lacking the X-factor. On Thursday, the Knights will have to get their ABC right before they think about X, and that surely would be an important factor.

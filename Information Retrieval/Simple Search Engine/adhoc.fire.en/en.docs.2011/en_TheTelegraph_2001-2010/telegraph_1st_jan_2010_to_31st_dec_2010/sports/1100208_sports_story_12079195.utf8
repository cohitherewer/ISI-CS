            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pacer Charl Langeveldt was Sunday added to South Africas one-day squad for the upcoming three-match series against India.         
	We have decided to add Langeveldt as an additional player to the squad announced earlier, national selection panel convener Gerald Majola said. We do not believe that we have all our bases covered at the moment in the bowling department.         
	Langeveldt, incidentally, is one of the ten foreign recruits of the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	The ODI matches are to be held in Jaipur (February 21), Gwalior (February 24) and Ahmedabad (February 27) , after the ongoing two-Test series.         
	THE ODI SQUAD

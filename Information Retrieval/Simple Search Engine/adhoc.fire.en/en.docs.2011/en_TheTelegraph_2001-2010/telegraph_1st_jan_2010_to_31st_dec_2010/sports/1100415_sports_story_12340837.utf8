The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jankovic survives a scare
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jankovic survives a scare
                      
	Charleston: Former champion Jelena Jankovic shook off a passive start to win her opening match of the Family Circle Cup over unseeded Edina Gallovits 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 Tuesday.         
	It was Jankovics first match on clay this season and she struggled. The Serbian, ranked seventh in the world, put five shots into the net in her first three games.         
	But the No. 2-seeded Jankovic pulled herself together after the first set, breaking the Romanian in the second set. She wouldnt trail on serve for the rest of the hard-fought match, despite screaming at herself a couple of times after missing shots. She didnt smile until Gallovits netted her shot during a long rally on match point.         
	I think its a good thing I played a tough match like that because it gives you confidence and you get fitter and fitter for the next rounds, said Jankovic, the 2007 champion who gets a day off before her round of 16 match on Thursday.         
	The two only played on clay once before  at the 2003 French Open. Jankovic didnt remember that match, but said she wont forget this one.         
	She didnt have anything to lose. She can just play freely and go after her shots, said Jankovic, who along with 2006 winner Nadia Petrova are the only former champions in the field.There were two upsets Tuesday: No. 11 Virginie Razzano of France became the first seeded player to lose, falling to Monique Adamczak 4-6, 6-0, 6-2; No. 15 Melinda Czink of Hungary lost to Michaella Krajicek of the Netherlands 7-6 (9), 6-3.         
	No. 4 Samantha Stosur, No. 7 Vera Zvonareva, No. 10 Elena Vesnina and No. 14 Vera Dushevina all advanced in straight sets, while No.12 seed Aleksandra Wozniak needed three sets to move on to the round of 16.         
	In the featured match Tuesday night, American teen sensation No. 13 seed Melanie Oudin beat the tournaments oldest player, 35-year-old Jill Craybas, 6-3, 6-1. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was stumped: Nari
                                                                                                                       7                                      I was stumped: Nari
                      
	Mumbai: Former India captain Nari Contractor, who had to return home after being stopped at the gate of the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday last for not carrying a valid ticket for the Indian Premier League (IPL) final, said that he was flummoxed and wondered how this was allowed to happen by the ticket issuing authorities.         
	I was completely stumped when I was asked for a badge to accompany the ticket. I did not have the badge, as it was not given to me along with the ticket. I just turned around and went back, Contractor said Friday.         
	I would not blame the gatekeeper. He was doing his duty. The main issue is how the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) issued these fake tickets, Contractor said.         
	He had not seen any IPL match this season after the MCA boycotted all home matches of Mumbai Indians that were played at the Cricket Club of Indias Brabourne Stadium.         
	Around 200 tickets for the final were handed over by IPL authorities directly to the MCA officials who, in turn, distributed them to their members and former cricketers and all were stopped at the gate.         
	It needed the intervention of MCAs joint secretary Lalchand Rajput, who spoke to IPLs CEO Sundar Raman, before the associations guests were allowed into the stadium. But by then Contractor had chosen to go back.           (PTI)

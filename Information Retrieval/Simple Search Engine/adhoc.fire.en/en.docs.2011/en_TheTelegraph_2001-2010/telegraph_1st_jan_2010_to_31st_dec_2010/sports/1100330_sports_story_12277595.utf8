The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray: I need to get my head right
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murray: I need to get my head right
            Mark Hodgkinson                      
	Miami: Something is up with Andy Murray. Having the right mental approach can often be everything in this sport, with matches played out in the grey cells before they are played out on purple cement, red clay or green grass, and Murray has disclosed that he has not been enjoying his tennis in the two months since losing the Australian Open final to Roger Federer. Too many negative thoughts keep popping up into his head.         
	Off the court, Murray has been happy since that defeat at Melbourne Park, yet on the court, he has been anxious, uneasy and unsettled, and it sounds as though even he is not sure exactly what has brought all this on.         
	Over the years, Murray has developed a reputation for having a smart tennis brain, and for his mental fortitude, for his bloody-minded determination to win matches and titles, yet when the defending champion lost on his opening appearance at this Miami Open, in the second round to world No. 101 Mardy Fish, it was another sign all is not right between the Britons ears.         
	It could be something off the court, or something in my game, I dont know, said Murray, after his first defeat to someone outside the top 100 for three years. It could be a lot of things. Everyone goes through bad patches. I have been very happy off the court, but not on it, and thats where I need to be happy, because thats my career. I need to start enjoying my tennis again, like I was at the start of the year.         
	Ive done everything to get ready for matches, but its been flat. Ive not been thinking about the right things. Since Murray became a Hollywood name in mens tennis, there have not been many matches more frustrating than this one on Saturday afternoon. So Murray, who will drop one place in the rankings to fourth, exchanging places with Nadal, needs to get my head right, to work out what he can do about his poor, unacceptable mental approach.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gunners face a Stoke test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gunners face a Stoke test
            PREMIER LEAGUE                
	London: Arsenal will look to get back on track in the Premier League title race, on Saturday, against a club whose physical and direct style of play has frustrated and troubled Arsene Wengers side, in recent seasons.         
	Stoke have beaten the Gunners in each of the last two years, using route-one tactics and the long throw-in of midfielder Rory Delap to great effect against Arsenals flimsy defence.         
	Wenger has often been critical of Stokes approach and is hoping the match at Emirates Stadium will be one for the purists, as Arsenal seek to rebound from their 1-0 loss to title rival Manchester United, on Monday.         
	What is important is we want to see a football game where both teams play good football, said Wenger. It is Arsenal against Stoke. Every game is different and it is a new start for us.         
	The last time they met Stoke  at Britannia Stadium in February  Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey broke his leg as a result of a late challenge by Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross. Wenger was furious at that tackle and, this season, accused Shawcross and fellow Stoke centre back Robert Huth of behaving like rugby players during a game against Tottenham.         
	Wenger wants to consign these incidents to history and is focusing on improving his sides poor home record in the league this campaign, which has seen the Gunners lose to West Bromwich Albion, Newcastle and Tottenham.         
	What happened in the past, happened in the past, Wenger said.         
	There is no need to add any fuel on it and we just focus on playing football as we always do and respecting our opponents.         
	After beating Arsenal 3-1 in the FA Cup last season and 2-1 in the league in the 2008-09 campaign, Stoke are looking for another upset win.         
	I cant control what Wenger says (about Stoke) or does, said Stoke manager Tony Pulis.

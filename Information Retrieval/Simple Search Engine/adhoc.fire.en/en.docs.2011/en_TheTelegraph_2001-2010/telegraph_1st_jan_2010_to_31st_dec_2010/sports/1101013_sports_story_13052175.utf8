The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina, Jwala close in on CWG glory

	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal, Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa gave India enough reasons to smile on Tuesday. After all, their victories created history and gave India an opportunity to win, at least, two gold medals in the individual badminton events, after the men lost in the semi-finals.         
	While Parupalli Kashyap beat Rajiv Ouseph, Chetan Anand fell meekly (11-21, 12-21) to world No. 1 Lee Chong Wei in just under half-an-hour. Unforced errors, losing a large lead in the final game and maybe, to some extent a line-call which was deemed controversial at 18-18, cost Kashyap the match to the Englishman, 19-21, 21-14, 21-18.         
	Jwala and Ashwini defeated Australians Kate Wilson-Smith and He Tang Tien 12-21, 21-13, 21-11 in the womens doubles semis. In the last tie of the day, Saina beat Scotlands Susan Egelstaff 21-10, 21-17.         
	After the first game, Jwala just asked me to hit. Somehow I wasnt hitting. And, it worked! said Ashwini. We had to change our game plan accordingly in the next two games, exclaimed Jwala. They will now be taking on top seeds SM Sari and L Yao for a chance to win their maiden CWG gold.         
	Saina was in such a hurry to end her match, that she made an easy game tough. After I won the first game, I wondered how I could win it so easily! That put me under pressure and I tensed up. But, I let my mind stop wondering on winning and losing and that was that, claimed the 20-year-old top seed. Saina will now take on second seed, Malaysias Mew Choo Wong, for the final gold battle.         
	Though Chetan and Kashyap will play in a bronze-medal playoff on Wednesday, the Indian women have assured, at least, two silvers when they take the stage on Thursday.         
	In table tennis, Soum-yadeep Roy overcame Singapores Xiaoli Cai 4-1 to go into the mens singles semis. Poulomi Ghatak and Mouma Das defeated Australians M. Miao and J.F. Lay 3-2 to enter the womens doubles semis.         
	In squash, Indias hopes ended with fourth-seeded Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa going down to Malaysians Nicol David and Beng Hee Ong 5-11, 11-7, 7-11 in the quarter-finals of the mixed doubles event.

	Sydney: Pakistan dismissed Australian out for a paltry 127 to take a firm grip on the second Test following an extraordinary opening day at the SCG Sunday.         
	The home side were dismissed shortly before stumps after winning the toss and electing to bat on a seaming greentop of a wicket.         
	Paceman Mohammad Asif was the chief destroyer with career-best figures of six for 41  the second-best return by a Pakistani bowler at the SCG.         
	It was Asifs sixth five-wicket haul in just his 16th Test. Bad light stopped play for the day 10 minutes before stumps, the visitors to resume day two at 14 for no loss with Imran Farhat on nine and Salman Butt three.         
	Australia were on 62 for seven prior to tea before a 44-run eighth wicket partnership between Nathan Hauritz (21) and Mitchell Johnson (38) eased the score past 100.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India brace for tough tie vs Japan
                                                                                                                       7                                      India brace for tough tie vs Japan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The India under-23 team have a tough task on hand when they play mighty Japan in the pre-quarter finals of the Asian Games football at the Huangpu Sports Centre, in Guangzhou, on Tuesday.         
	Placed 30 th in the Fifa rankings, Japan are one of the toughest sides in the Games and favourites to win their maiden title.         
	They qualified for the round of 16 with an all-win record against China, Malaysia and Kyrgyzstan in group A. Japan are also yet to concede a goal in the tournament.         
	India are surprise entrants in the knock out rounds. After narrowly losing their first two matches against Kuwait and Qatar, they thrashed Singapore to qualify as one of the four best third finishers in six groups.         
	Indian coach Sukhwinder Singh admitted that his team would go into the match as underdogs but said his boys would not go down without putting up a fight.         
	We are here with a bunch of youngsters, who lack experience. But the match against Singapore in the group league (India won 4-1) has given us a tremendous boost. All the players are fit and will fight till the end, claimed the coach.         
	India, however, have a problem with the last line of defence, as they are left with only one goalkeeper  Gurpreet Singh Sandhu  to play the match.         
	With the other custodian L. Kuttimani ruled out of the tournament because of a back injury, Indias request for a replacement has been turned down by the organisers.

	Calcutta: Well-placed sources in South Africa have indicated that Graeme Smith may step down as the countrys captain in limited overs cricket  both the 50-over and the T20 versions.         
	Its not confirmed, but one learns that Smith could make the announcement on Wednesday, one of the sources told The Telegraph, late on Tuesday.         
	Smith has been leading South Africa in all three versions from early 2003, specifically after the World Cup held that year.         
	The period has definitely seen some highs, but Smith has neither won a World Cup, nor a Champions Trophy nor even a World T20 event.         
	Everything points to Smith continuing as the Test captain.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Fred to play practice round with Tiger
                      
	Texas: Fred Couples will play a practice round for the Masters with Tiger Woods at Augusta National on Monday.         
	Woods is making his return to competitive golf next week at the Masters after months of seclusion following revelations that he cheated on his wife.         
	Couples said on Wednesday he will avoid asking Woods about his personal life.         
	This is not going to be questions and answers, said Couples, playing in the Houston Open this week.         
	Its going to be strictly golf. I play a lot with him at Augusta, so this is not unusual.         
	Couples said he would be playing in a foursome with Woods, though he did not know who the other two golfers would be. Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, said hes curious to see how fans will react to seeing Woods on the course again.         
	Im looking forward to it, for sure, just because he hasnt played, Couples said.         
	I want to see the reaction and how good hes hitting it.         
	Couples wasnt sure what time the practice round would begin. Woods has a news conference scheduled for that afternoon.         
	The 50-year-old Couples has won his last three starts on the Champions Tour and says hes taken some ribbing from Woods in recent text messages.         
	He teases me about winning a couple of times on the Champions Tour, Couples said.         
	He needs shots is what hes telling me. Im smarter than that.         
	Couples, who will be returning as captain of the US Presidents Cup team next year, said he expects Woods to commit to play in the event in Australia.           (AGENCIES)

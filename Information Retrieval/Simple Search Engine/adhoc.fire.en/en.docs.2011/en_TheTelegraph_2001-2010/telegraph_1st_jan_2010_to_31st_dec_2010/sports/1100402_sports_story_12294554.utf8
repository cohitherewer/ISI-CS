            A STAFF REPORTER            Shah Rukh Khan at the Eden, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Principal owner Shah Rukh Khan took a lap-of-honour after KKRs 24-run victory against Deccan Chargers on Thursday. Shah Rukh said at the Eden that it was important to forget the disappointments of defeats and deliver in T20 format.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If he was nervous before the match         
	It has been three years now (in the IPL) Im getting used to it. But yes, I was a bit nervous today. During some crunch situations, I often feel like jumping on to the field and help the boys. Dada is not the only one who bites his nails! Im gradually understanding the Twenty20 format and realise that youll not win every time. Its important to forget the disappointments and deliver.         
	On what did he tell the team         
	I just come down and try to encourage them. I never participate in the cricketing talks. Because if I try to teach them how to play the game, they may try to teach me how to act! So I stay away from speaking anything about the game. I just try to lift their spirits and tell them to enjoy the game.         
	His opinion about the Knights performance so far         
	We have had some ups and downs in the tournament so far. But it cant be worst than the position we were in. The only way from here goes up. I believe its time for the players to start proving themselves to the Eden Gardens and our supporters. Eden is a wonderful place and Im grateful for the support we have received here.         
	The atmosphere in the dressing room         
	We have got an amazing set of people. All the guys including Dav (Whatmore), (Vijay) Dahiya and Wasimbhai (Akram) have been excellent. But the most important thing for us is that Dada is looking good, really good.         
	His association with sports         
	I have always been close to sports. I have had experiences of playing cricket, football and hockey in the early stages of my life. So Ive always been a sportsman! And given a choice, Ill always want to be a sportsman.         
	On creating the ideal atmosphere for the team         
	We have affected the required changes in the set-up. But the most important thing is the team should be happy. A happy team always does well. If your team is not happy you cant expect the best from them. I just hope that this year we have a happier team.         
	On the tweeted message that the time for excuses are over         
	Absolutely You just cant give excuses, we are professionals. Weve got to get out there and have more fun. We always try to treat them (players) as kids, make them happy, so that they can go out there and make us all happy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yakubu stars in EB win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yakubu stars in EB win
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal supporters could not have asked for a better gift on the first day of the Bengali New Year. Their favourite club returned to wining ways in the I-League with a 1-0 victory over Mumbai FC.         
	Yusif Yakubu converted a spot-kick in the 61st minute after Abel Hammond was brought down inside the box by Kamaljeet Kumar. Mumbai FC coach Khalid Jamil expressed his unhappiness about referee Benjamin DSilvas decision, at the post match press conference.         
	His opposite number Phillippe de Ridder obviously had no such complaints as he merrily wished the scribes Suva Brata instead of Suva Nababarsha at the end of the match as everyone burst into laughter.         
	He had every reason to be happy though. There has been days this season when De Ridders boys have played better than their opponents, but ended up on the losing side. On Thursday, the red-and-gold brigade were disappointing but got the all-important goal.         
	They now have 24 points from 20 games and have made a big step towards moving out of the relegation zone. Incidentally, this is East Bengals first win in the return leg. I am satisfied with three points. Especially, with the win coming on Bengali New Year, the coach said at the post match media conference.         
	There was nothing to write home about East Bengals performance. Apart from a powerful goal-bound shot from Alvito DCunha, which had Yakubu in the way, the winners could not make much headway in the first half.         
	The only time East Bengal looked like making some impact was after Bhaichung Bhutia and Sanju Pradhan were introduced in the final 20 minutes. Bhaichung, who is coming off a hamstring injury, looked hungry to be back in the thick of things.         
	He came close to scoring in the 87th minute, but his placement, with goalkeeper Nidhinlal at his mercy, was off target. Yakubu was completely off-colour on the day, save once, when he rounded off a couple of defenders but his placement was wide.

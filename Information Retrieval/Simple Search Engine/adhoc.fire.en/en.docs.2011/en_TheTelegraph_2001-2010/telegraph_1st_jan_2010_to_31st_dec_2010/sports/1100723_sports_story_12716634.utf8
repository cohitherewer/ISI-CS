The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali: 800 is only a number
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murali: 800 is only a number
            A CORRESPONDENT                                Muttiah Muralidharan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Galle, on Thursday       
	Muttiah Muralidharan said at a press conference, on Thursday, that retiring after taking his 800th wicket and helping Sri Lanka win his farewell Test, against India in Galle, was one of the greatest moments in his life.         
	Murali during his career was called twice for chucking  in a Test by Darrell Hair and in an ODI by Ross Emerson.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Getting to 800 wickets         
	800 wickets is only a number... We wanted to get the wickets quickly. You never know in Galle winning the match was most important. At that time I didnt think about it, but it came in the end. It wouldnt have mattered if it didnt come. The most important thing was winning the match.         
	If he was worried about reaching the landmark         
	The wicket was so slow... It got slower. My only scare was when Lasith Malinga had to go off the field. 800 wasnt running in my mind. I just wanted to win. I told them some how get this wicket. We knew the situation in Galle and had the match ended in a draw, it would have been very sad. It was hard work for the spinners. Magnificent yorkers by Malinga made the difference.         
	Playing just one Test and not all three         
	Galle is my favourite ground. There is always a result here. (Jayananda) Warnaweera prepares good wickets and we won in four days. This was an opportunity I waited for. Perform well, win the match and finish it nicely. My knee is not good to bowl 50-60 overs every Test. There are good young spinners. You wont miss me much. Ajantha is bowling better and better and both Suraj and Rangana are good. I have achieved everything in Test cricket and thought this should be the end. I am very happy to go this way.         
	If he wants to reconsider his decision         
	I have played for 19 years and I thought that there are three other good spinners in the side. They are 24-25 and I am 38. I thought its better to give them a chance. I have nothing more to achieve and I thought this is the right time.         
	If claiming eight wickets was the perfect icing on the cake         
	Eight wickets wasnt important... I had decided on my last Test some time back as there are some young players. I thought its the right time. Everything went off well.         
	If he felt emotional         
	Not emotional, in a way Frankly, I am happy that I have done it. That was the only thing I thought. I trained really hard. Even last week, I trained hard to play this match and took it very seriously. Im very happy. God has given me everything. Eight wickets, victory, basically everything... This is one of the greatest moments of my life. Warnaweera gave a good farewell. Our motivation was to win. I am not an emotional person, but I get upset sometimes. I think Kumar will take this team to greater heights.         
	His successor         
	Very difficult to say who will succeed... Each one is different. Cant really say. I think our dressing room has three good spinners and they will take the team to a better position. I havent thought of doing anything for cricket. I dont think they will require me, because there are a lot of young spinners to do the job I just need to continue with my life.         
	If he wants to forgive the umpires who no-balled him         
	Life is all about forgiving and forgetting. You cant say they did a wrong thing. Theres a fair trial... The ICC will check and use technology. Now umpires cant call, if they suspect they send people to be checked and thats how it goes.         
	Any message from Hair         
	I havent got any message. Lot of other people have praised me. At the end of the day, its a game and people come and go. I am one of them.         
	Future plans         
	I have spoken to the selectors and Sanga. There are youngsters and they need experience if they are doing well they can play. I am practising for the Champions League and the selectors have a chance to decide what they will do in the lead up to the World Cup.

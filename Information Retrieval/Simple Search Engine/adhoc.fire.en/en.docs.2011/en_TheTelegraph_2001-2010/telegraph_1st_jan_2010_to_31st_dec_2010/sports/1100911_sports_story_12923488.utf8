            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanths career enhancing portal, careerstrokes.com, is aimed at solving the complexities of life with experiences drawn from the cricket field.         
	The idea is to help a young professional with motivational speeches through the medium of a language the Indians understand most  cricket, the chairman of national selection committee told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Were trying to solve leadership and stress-related problems as also develop communication skills. Its about setting goals for individuals and helping them develop self-belief.         
	For example, when I talk about self-belief, the focus will be on the spirit of the 1983 World Cup wining team and how Kapil Dev kept egging on the players into believing that we could win the World Cup. Similarly, Sehwag will be a role model for positive attitude, Srikkanth said.         
	The e-learning portal will also see Srikkanth holding classes, interviewing business leaders, celebrities and also cricketers on their careers. Five live interactive Q and A sessions a month will also be part of the package, which comes at Rs 990 for three months, and includes 16-18 hours of readymade content.         
	The idea is to motivate and improve awareness and provide career enhancement to youngsters, Srikkanth added.         
	Srikkanth himself has anchored the lectures and has also interviewed industrialist Venu Srinivasan and filmstar Arvind Swami.         
	The idea to launch such a website came from his experience in being invited to motivational talks by corporates, colleges and schools. The success of these talks made me wonder why not make this reachable to a wider segment. And e-learning is the fastest and easiest way to do it, he added.

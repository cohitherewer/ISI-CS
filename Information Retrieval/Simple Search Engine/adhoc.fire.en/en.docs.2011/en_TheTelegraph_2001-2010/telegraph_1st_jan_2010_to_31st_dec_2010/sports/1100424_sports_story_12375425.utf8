            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), on Friday, through lawyer Tapash Chakraborty, sent its Memorandum of Understanding with Kolkata Knight Riders regarding the staging of seven Indian Premier League matches to the Income Tax authorities.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB brass did not attend Fridays IPL Awards function in Mumbai. Had we attended the function it would sent wrong signals to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). And thats something we dont want at this moment, a CAB official said.

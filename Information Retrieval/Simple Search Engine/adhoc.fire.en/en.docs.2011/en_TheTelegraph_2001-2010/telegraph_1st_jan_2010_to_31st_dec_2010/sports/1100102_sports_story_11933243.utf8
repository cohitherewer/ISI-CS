    - Lajong to miss as many as four key players, including captain           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Lajong coach Stanley Rozario (in blue jersey) with players during a training session at the Nehru Stadium, in Guwahati, on Friday.

	Guwahati: Giant-killing Shillong club, Lajong FC, will be missing the services of both their foreign recruits  James Gbilee and Daniel Bidemi  when they meet the star-studded East Bengal in the final of the Hero Honda Federation Cup on Sunday.         
	Both Gbilee and Bidemi have two yellow cards against their names and will have to sit out the title match but coach Stanley Rozario Friday said despite that, his side were confident and determined to give their heavyweight opponents a run for their money.         
	We will miss the services of the foreign recruits as well as key players Aibor Khongjee and Romeo Shukhlain. But our boys are confident and very determined as a team.         
	They are in high spirits after winning the semi-final against Churchill Brothers, Rozario told The Telegraph while having lunch with the team at a city restaurant as part of the New Year celebrations. Skipper Khongjee is down with a fungal infection.         
	Rozario would have liked Bidemi and Khongjee holding the citadel in Sundays final. The forward line, comprising Nepal recruit Anil Gurung and Sheikhohau Tuboi, is undoubtedly formidable.         
	Unity and determination are our main strengths and this lunch together is going to be a major fillip for team spirit.         
	Very few teams have such unity, the former East Bengal coach said. He, however, conceded that East Bengal are definitely a strong opponent.         
	They are experienced and have five India internationals, including (skipper) Bhaichung Bhutia. But my boys will give a tough fight and I hope they do wonders, he said.         
	Lajong went down 0-3 to East Bengal in the I-League in their away match at Barasat.         
	It is already an achievement to make the final clash after beating strong opponents.         
	But we need to win tournaments which will help us grow in confidence, the coach of the only I-League outfit from the Northeast said.         
	Semi-final hero Gumpe Rime, who saved a penalty by Odafe Okolie, felt Lajong have nothing to lose on Sunday.         
	Reaching the final in itself was a great experience.         
	Well play our hearts out for the title I hope God will be with us once again, the former Maharana AC and Rising AC custodian, for whom the Nehru Stadium turf is a familiar one, said.         
	Exposure and good coaching do matter. Rozario is a really respectable and competent man who has brought about a sea change among us.         
	As to denying Odafe, I had kept out a penalty kick from him in the IFA Shield, too, and expected him to shoot in the same direction on Wednesday. My anticipation turned out to be correct, he said.         
	The Shillong outfit Friday had a brief practice session in the morning and went out on an outing to celebrate the New Year.

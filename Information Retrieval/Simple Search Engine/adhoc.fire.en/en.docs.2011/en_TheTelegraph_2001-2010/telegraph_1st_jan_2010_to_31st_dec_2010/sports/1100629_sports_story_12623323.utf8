The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will be in semis: Maradona
                                                                                                                       7                                      We will be in semis: Maradona
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: On Sunday, when the Argentina coach walked in for the post-match press conference 15 minutes late smoking a cigar, he was promptly told by the Fifa media officer to put it off as it was against the rule.         
	But the rebuff couldnt wipe off the broad and triumphant smile from Maradonas face. He hugged and joked with Argentine journalists before settling down to address the press conference. And when the media officer finally called it a day, Maradona overruled him and continued to talk for another 10 minutes.         
	I want to answer more questions and they are trying to send me off, Maradona said laughing. It is going to be a great match against Germany in the quarter finals but it will be Argentina who will go to the semi-finals, he announced confidently.         
	However, during the first 25 minutes of the match, Maradona looked tensed as the Argentine goal had two close shaves. He was seen talking to his two assistants  Hector Enrique and Alejandro Mancuso  and was surely contemplating early substitutions.         
	Two quick goals  one from an offside position and the next one because of a defensive error  changed the complexion of the match. So much so that Maradona said he would love to put on his boots again and play against Germany.         
	I feel like pulling on the jersey and play myself in the next match. It is beautiful to be involved with this group of players. I feel proud to share these moments with them, he said. Germany is a different team to Mexico. They are stronger but we will find the right players to beat them.         
	Sundays win was not the only victory that Maradona had under his belt. Off the pitch, he won a bet against his striker Lionel Messi. He promised to score a goal but did not get one for the fourth consecutive match.         
	I could have scored a goal, Messi said later. I had many shots, but no luck. Hopefully, I will get one against Germany. I am feeling fine, and there are still a few games to go. I feel comfortable and happy on the pitch, Messi said.

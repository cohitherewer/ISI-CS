The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir blasts top order
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir blasts top order
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gautam Gambhir, the Delhi DareDevils captain,has urged his top order batsmen to show more responsibility, at the presentation ceremony of a match they actually won.         
	Gambhirs comments came in the wake of the Delhi sides early jitters while chasing a meagre target of 113 runs set by the Chennai Super Kings.         
	The DareDevils were reduced to six for three by the second over of the match. However, Gambhir, along with Mithun Manhas, took the team to victory.         
	The skipper, adjudged Man of the Match for his unbeaten 57, ensured his team secured the crucial result but was unhappy with the batting. Gambhir and Co. are now third on the table with 14 points form 13 matches.         
	Gambhirs counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on the other hand, rued the lack of part-time bowlers in his team.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Gambhir: The top order should have been more responsible. It is all about finishing the job. I hope they bat with more responsibility in the next game. Chasing 113 was not an easy job and you cant just bat irresponsibly. The top order needs to show some responsibility. You cant bat like that and leave the job for the lower order. It was a matter of one big partnership. For us, it was more important to finish off the game and get two points. We were not concerned about the net run-rate. I never gave any instructions to the top order batsmen that they have to finish off the game within the 13th or 14th over. Personally, it is a huge satisfaction to have seen the team through in this particular game.         
	Dhoni: Of course, this is a disappointing result. We should have batted well. Also, the DareDevils have part-time spinners like Virender Sehwag and Tillekaratne Dilshan, which we lack. Batting has been our strength but we couldnt do well today. We still have a chance to make it to the semi-finals. The Deccan Chargers need to lose one and we need to win one. Its been a great experience playing in Chennai. The crowd has been very supportive and I hope to come back here again next year.         
	Mithun Manhas: We lost a couple of wickets early on and then had to rebuild the innings. We had to pick up singles. It was fantastic batting from Gautam. All I had to do was just hang in there. I was doing much of the talking during our partnership, just to take the pressure off him.         
	Ashish Nehra: It is an important victory for us. The bowlers did a good job to restrict the Super Kings to 112. There was a lot of help (in the pitch) for the bowlers. Our job was to hit the right areas consistently and we did that. Even our spinners  Amit Mishra, Dilshan, Sehwag  bowled well. We were definitely under pressure when we lost four quick wickets. But Gautam and Mithun batted well and saw us through. On the personal front, I am feeling quite good having bowled well today. I am coming back from a rib injury and its been so far so good for me. I had been bowling at the nets for the past two to three weeks. I hope we win our next match against the Chargers at Kotla. Thats our home ground where we have earlier won three back-to-back matches.

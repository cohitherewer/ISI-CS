The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Changes are on Ferguson mind 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Changes are on Ferguson mind 
                      
	London: Manchester United will take their hope of winning a third straight League Cup title to West Ham, on Tuesday, with recent form suggesting that only a changed line-up could prevent them reaching the semi-finals.         
	United cruised to the top of the Premier League for the first time this season with a 7-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday but manager Alex Ferguson is set to make widespread changes to keep players fresh.         
	Javier Hernandez, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Wes Brown are all likely to play, with Uniteds squad also containing reserves Magnus Eikrem, Ben Amos, Bebe and Ravel Morrison. But midfielder Michael Carrick is not contemplating a correspondingly weaker performance due to any changes.         
	We set high standards and we want to keep hitting those levels, Carrick said. We did that, but we want to keep doing that every week.         
	Uniteds priorities as usual are the Premier League and Champions League, but with Arsenal hosting Wigan in Tuesdays other quarter final  and Aston Villa vs Birmingham and West Bromwich Albion vs Ipswich scheduled for Wednesday  there are still some tricky opponents left in the second-tier cup competition.

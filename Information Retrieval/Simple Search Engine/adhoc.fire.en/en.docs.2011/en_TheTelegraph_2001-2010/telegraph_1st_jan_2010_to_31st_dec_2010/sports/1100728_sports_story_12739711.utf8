The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Negi wants to be coach
                                                                                                                       7                                        Negi wants to be coach
            OUR BUREAU            Mir Ranjan Negi                                 
	Former India goalkeeper Mir Ranjan Negi has expressed his desire to become the coach of Indias womens hockey team. The post has been lying vacant after M.K. Kaushik resigned in the wake of a sex scandal.         
	However, the sports ministry refused to confirm any development about the issue saying that they were not dealing with the process at the moment.         
	Neither have we started the process of appointing a new coach for the womens team nor is there any chance of beginning that in near future.         
	The team, at present, are on a overseas tour and it wont be logical to search for or appoint a new coach under such circumstances, said a ministry source said.         
	Negi was the goalkeeping coach for the 1998 Asian Games where India won the gold.         
	He had also been associated with womens team in the past and has a good record to boast.

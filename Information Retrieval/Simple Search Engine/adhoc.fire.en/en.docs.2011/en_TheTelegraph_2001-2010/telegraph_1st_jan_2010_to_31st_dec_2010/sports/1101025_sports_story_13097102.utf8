The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Recalling Bagan bang...
                                                                                                                       7                                        Recalling Bagan bang...
            A STAFF REPORTER            Edeh Chidi                           
	Calcutta: Exactly a year ago, on this very day, Mohun Bagan exorcised the ghost of 1975.         
	The pain of conceding five goals to their arch-rivals East Bengal in the IFA Shield final on September 29, 1975, ebbed once and for all.         
	On October 25, 2009, Mohun Bagan scored five past East Bengal to spark unbridled euphoria amongst the Bagan fans.         
	That they conceded three goals is another story. Edeh Chidi found himself in the history books as the first player to score four goals in a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal derby clash. Manish Mathani scored the other for Bagan. For East Bengal, Nirmal Chetri and Yusif Yakubu were the scorers.         
	Karim Bencharifa, who was the Mohun Bagan coach when the score was settled had no idea till The Telegraph told him Monday would be first year anniversary of that historic match.         
	Is it so? My god! Time flies was the Salgaocar coachs first reaction.         
	As a professional coach I would say that the most satisfying part was that we won the derby. But, from the historic point of view, I think the older supporters must have felt relieved. That 0-5 drubbing haunted them for 34 years! So for them, that 2009 Sunday was something unforgettable. A very emotional thing for them, Bencharifa said.         
	The Moroccan in fact did not understand the significance of the victory till the next morning when the newspapers splashed the win on their front pages. When I woke up the next morning, I realised how big it meant for the supporters, he said.         
	Bencharifa recalled bringing in Sangram Mukherjee in place of a shaky Shilton Paul was a masterstroke.         
	Shilton was very shaky. So, I brought in Sangram who guided the defence very well. At half time, the score was 3-3 and it could have been anybodys game. And Chidi also had a great game.         
	So, what does the four-goal hero Chidi have to say? How can I forget that day. Best match of my life. I will be celebrating in my own way.         
	Can he score four goals against East Bengal again?         
	In football, nothing is impossible. You never know. I may end up scoring five goals in a derby, Chidi said. The Nigerian, along with teammates will be felicitated at the club tent by a fan association on Monday morning.         
	And when that felicitation function happens, his teammate Mathani wont be there. Mathani flew to China with the Asian Games-bound football team. But he had the time to share his experience.         
	I was a newcomer. Yet to understand the importance of an East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match. But, the next morning I understood what it really meant. Everyone was talking about revenge taken after 34 years. The match is still fresh in my mind. I was lucky to be part of it, he said.         
	True. As Bencharifa said: That match made us part of Bagan folklore.

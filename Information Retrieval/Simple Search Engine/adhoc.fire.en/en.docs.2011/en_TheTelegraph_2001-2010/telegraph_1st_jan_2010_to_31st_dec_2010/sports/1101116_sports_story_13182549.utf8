The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle storm   hits Galle

	Galle: Chris Gayle hit an explosive double century to propel West Indies to 362 for two on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Monday.         
	The former Windies skipper smashed the ball all around the ground, batting throughout the day to finish unbeaten on 219 off 247 balls.         
	Gayles chanceless effort comprised eight sixes and 26 fours on a placid pitch. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was also 20 not out when stumps were drawn.         
	The opener, who has a top Test score of 317, reached his 13th century by hitting Ajantha Mendis for two consecutive sixes in an expensive over which cost the spinner 18 runs. Gayle celebrated with arms raised, flashed a broad grin, took off his helmet and lay flat on the ground to milk the applause.         
	He was less exuberant upon reaching his double century with a single. Gayle had a scare on 65 when Sri Lanka used the referral system for an lbw decision off Mendis and television replays showed he got an inside edge on to his pads.         
	The southpaw was particularly severe on Mendis and fellow spinner Suraj Randiv, who went for a combined total of 234 runs. Gayle and Adrian Barath put on 110 for the first wicket after Darren Sammy won the toss on his debut as Test captain.

	Sao Paulo: Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull took the lead at the first corner and cruised to victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday, keeping the Formula One title race alive until the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi.         
	Mark Webber of Red Bull was second, championship leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari third and Lewis Hamilton of McLaren fourth. The top two places at the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) Interlagos track gave Red Bull its first constructors championship.         
	Alonso was the only driver who could have won the championship in Brazil, but his third-place finish was not enough. He has an eight-point lead over Webber and a 15-point advantage over Vettel ahead of Abu Dhabi next weekend. Hamilton is 24 points back.         
	Alonso now has 246 points, while Webber has 238 and Vettel 231. Hamilton has 222 points and remains in contention but with remote chances.         
	In terms of points we are happy, Alonso said. The championship is very open now. With the win, Sebastian is another strong contender. We will see what we can do in Abu Dhabi.         
	Defending champion Jenson Button of McLaren finished fifth and cannot win the title.         
	Vettel got a good start from second place to pass pole pole-sitter Nico Hulkenberg of Williams and never looked in trouble. Hulkenberg also was overtaken by Webber on the first lap, and then was passed by Alonso on the seventh lap. The 23-year-old German rookie was trying to give Williams its first win since 2004, when Juan Pablo Montoya won at Interlagos. His surprising pole on Saturday was the teams first in 100 races, since the 2005 European GP.         
	Vettel and Webber pulled away from the field after getting past Hulkenberg, but they temporarily lost their advantage when the safety car was deployed on Lap 51 because of a crash by Force Indias Vitantonio Liuzzi.         
	Its an incredible day, said Vettel, who would have been leading the championship had his cars Renault engine not blown in South Korea last month. The car felt fantastic all through the race. Im very proud, proud of my team and myself.         
	Hamilton made an extra pit stop under the safety car, but was not able to move closer to the leaders despite the fresh tires. Vettel won the race by 4.2 seconds ahead of Webber and 6.8 in front of Alonso. Hamilton was 14.6 back.         
	It was Vettels fourth win this season, and the eighth overall for Red Bull, which has been the dominant car this season. But the team arrived at the final two races without a comfortable advantage in the standings because of missed opportunities during the season, including driver mistakes and mechanical failures.         
	Felipe Massa, a two-time winner in front of his home crowd in Brazil, had problems on the pit lane and fell out of contention early in the race, finishing 15th. Veteran Rubens Barrichello of Williams made contact with Sebastien Buemi of Toro Rosso midway through the race and fell to the back with a punctured tire, finishing 14th.         
	The 29-year-old Alonso is trying to claim his third F1 title, after winning with Renault in 2005 and 2006. He could have won it with a victory on Sunday if Webber finished fifth or worse. A second or third place also could have been enough had his rivals faltered.         
	I lost too much ground at the start of the race, said Alonso, who started fifth. But overall it was a good race for us, being on the podium and overtaking Hamilton and Hulkenberg, which we knew wasnt going to be easy.         
	The drivers championship had been decided at the Brazilian GP in the last five years.         
	I am absolutely stoked, stoked for the guys, said Webber. We are still absolutely in the hunt. (agencies)

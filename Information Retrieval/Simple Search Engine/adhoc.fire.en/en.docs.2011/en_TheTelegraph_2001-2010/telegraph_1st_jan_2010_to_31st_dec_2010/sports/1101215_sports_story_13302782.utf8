The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus is on track versus Railways
                                                                                                                       7                                      Focus is on track versus Railways
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Sourav Ganguly is besieged by autograph seekers on arrival at the Delhi airport,   on Tuesday. He will play in the Ranji tie against Railways, beginning Wednesday.   Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha      
	New Delhi: The sparse crowd, who braved the winter morning chill to watch the Bengal team practice at the Karnail Singh Stadium on Tuesday, were disappointed not to find Sourav Ganguly among the visiting players.         
	The former India captain joined the team late in the evening and would be part of the playing eleven in their must-win Ranji match against the Railways.         
	Bengal (12 points) have a one-point lead over Railways (11 points), and the visitors desperately need a victory in their concluding Group A match to make the last eight. Though Bengal coach W.V. Raman and skipper Manoj Tiwary were confident of making the next grade, both felt the pitch could play a crucial role in deciding the fate of the match.         
	Tiwary felt the wicket would assist spinners and the match may not last four days. I wont be surprised if the match gets over well before the fourth day, Tiwary said. This kind of track should help the spinners even before lunch on the first day, he added.         
	Railways have Murali Kartik, so they want to take the advantage. But we, too, have good spinners. Toss is going to be a crucial factor in the match, the Bengal skipper said.         
	Raman, too, agreed with Tiwary. This type of track is definitely going to make a lot of difference in the match, he said. Asked if it would be difficult for Sourav to handle the Railways bowlers without a hit at the nets, Raman said: I am confident he would do well.         
	Players like Sourav only need fine-tuning of their minds. No one can guarantee how many runs even an in-form batsman would score. So, there is no point speculating what Sourav would do with the bat. All I can say is that his sheer presence will be a big boost.         
	Tiwary pinned full faith on Sourav and believed the southpaw was prepared for the match. He (Sourav) is a class player and since he has decided to play the match, I am sure he has made his own mental preparations, Tiwary said.         
	Even Railways skipper Sanjay Bangar believes Souravs presence would lift Bengals confidence. The kind of experience he (Sourav) has will surely help Bengal, Bangar said.         
	Bengals only concern is with Sreevats Goswami, whos nursing an injury on his right foot. He was in acute pain during the training session and received treatment from the team physio.         
	The team management would take a call on his fitness Wednesday morning. Anustup Majumdar has been kept as stand-by. The visitors have also flown in specialist keeper Geetimoy Basu (under-22) as Sreevats replacement.         
	For Railways, Karan Sharma will replace Amit Mishra. There are talks of playing a third spinner in Nilesh Chauhan keeping the wicket in mind.         
	Teams         
	Bengal (likely): Arindam Das, Sreevats Goswami/Geetimoy Basu, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Manoj Tiwary, Sourav Ganguly, Anustup Majumdar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Sarkar/Iresh Saxena.         
	Railways (from): Sanjay Bangar (captain), Murali Kartik, Jai Prakash Yadav, Faiz Fazal, Shreyas Khanolkar, Karan Sharma, Dhiren Salvi, Anureet Singh, Nilesh Chauhan, Rakesh Mishra, Mahesh Rawat (wicketkeeper), Prashant Awasthi and Vikas Tokas.         
	Umpires: Samir Bandekar and Prakash Patkak.         
	Match Referee: Gursharan Singh.

  Chargers captain says he is not losing sleep over form            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Deccan Chargers Andrew Symonds and RP Singh during a practice session, in Mumbai, on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist Wednesday said that the teams season double over the Chennai Super Kings would matter little when at stake is a place in the final of the Indian Premier League.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Being in the semi-finals...         
	We know anything can happen in the semis. The Super Kings are one of the stronger squads in the tournament. You look at their bench strength. We were fortunate to get positive results against them the last couple of times. We have a nice positive feeling. But we both are none-for-none at the start of the game; we dont start 50 runs ahead because we won the two games prior to this.         
	Five wins on the trot         
	Thats a positive feeling obviously. After five losses in a row we knew we could not afford to lose another game. That freed us a lot and we knew what our job was.         
	Similarity with Australias run at the 1999 World Cup         
	I had not really thought of it. Theres a lot of synergy there, seven games we had to go undefeated. We won five, had a tie and then won the last one. Seven is the number for us this time.         
	His form         
	Im not losing sleep about my form. Im looking at leading the team well and giving the franchise the chance to win the tournament.         
	On T. Suman and Pragyan Ojha         
	They have been very impressive and have contributed in various ways last year and this year. Everyone has contributed in some way, whether its 30 or 20 runs that were crucial or a bowling spell.         
	On Harmeet Singhs slower ball         
	He can take all the credit himself for developing that. He worked on it and has been very accurate with it. Its his variation (in change of pace) I guess that has troubled the batsmen.         
	On Ojha not being picked for World T20         
	Hes as good a bowler as anyone else in that group ... Its not my job to pick the Indian team or to tell the Indian selectors whom to pick.         
	The money in IPL         
	T20 has changed the whole landscape of cricket, theres no doubt about that and the IPL has played a major part in that. Obviously, a lot of revenue is raised and turned over and tasked. Its changed the face (of cricket) and the direction players take. I dont know whether it is good or bad, to the detriment of the game... I have a sort of crystal ball gaze on that. There are a lot of positives about IPL and T20 as long as its well administered and well managed.

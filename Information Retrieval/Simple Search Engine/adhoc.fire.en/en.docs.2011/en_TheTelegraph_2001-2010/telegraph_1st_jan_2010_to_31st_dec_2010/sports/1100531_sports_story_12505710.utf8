	Iker Casillas ball barb  
	Innsbruck: Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas complained the official World Cup ball was better suited to the beach than to the finals in South Africa after his sides 3-2 warm up win against Saudi Arabia.  
	Its a bit like a beachball, the Spanish captain was quoted as telling the Spanish media on Sunday before going on to describe the unpredictable movement of the ball. Now it isnt only the goalkeepers (complaining) it is the outfield players as well. Its sad that a competition as important as a World Cup has an element as vital as the ball with such abysmal characteristics.         
	Pepe cleared         
	Lisbon: Portugal received a significant World Cup boost on Sunday when doctors gave midfielder Pepe clearance to continue training with the national team. Doctors from Portugal and his club Real Madrid agreed to give Pepe a clinical discharge, meaning he can continue his recovery from a serious knee injury with the World Cup squad.         
	Cup of woe         
	Johannesburg: South Africa may fall victim to a terrorist attack during the World Cup it is hosting in less than two weeks, according to a report in a British newspaper, quoting an investigative group and other sources. The recent arrest in Iraq of Abdullah Azzam al-Qahtani, an alleged al Qaeda supporter who claimed he was planning attacks on the Dutch and Danish teams, has revived debate on whether the tournament faces a threat of this kind.         
	Frank wish         
	London: England midfielder Frank Lampard was keen to keep hold of penalty-taking duties after missing from the spot in warm-up friendly win over Japan in Graz. Ill always want to take it. It wasnt a great penalty. Its disappointing because Ive practised loads this week. Im always confident in taking them and that will make me go away and work harder. If the manager wants me to take it Ill always step up, he said.           AGENCIES

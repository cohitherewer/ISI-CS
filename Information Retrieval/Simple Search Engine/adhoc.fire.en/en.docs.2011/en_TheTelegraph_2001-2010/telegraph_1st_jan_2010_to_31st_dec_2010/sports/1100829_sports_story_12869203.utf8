	New Delhi: After rejecting Lalit Modis demand for recusal of two of its members, the BCCIs disciplinary committee will meet here on Sunday to decide the procedures and schedules for its probe against suspended IPL commissioner Lalit Modi.         
	According to sources, the disciplinary committee will decide the procedures and the number of sitting in its probe against Modi, who has been accused of irregularities in running the cash-rich league. The three-member committee comprises of Arun Jaitley, Chirayu Amin and Jyotiraditya Scindia.         
	Sundays meeting was originally scheduled for August 18 but could not be held because union minister Scindia was out of the country.         
	Modi has been absent on all the three occasions, leaving it to his legal team to present his case, and he will not be present on Sunday also.         
	Asked whether Modi would appear before the committee on Sunday, his lawyer Mehmood Abdi said: No, he is still out of the country. (PTI)

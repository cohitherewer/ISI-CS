The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A tough test awaits Mumbai
                                                                                                                       7                                      A tough test awaits Mumbai
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai face their first tough test of the season when they take on Railways in their third round Ranji Trophy Elite division match here, starting Wednesday.         
	Having comfortably gained three points each in their previous games, one might expect the hosts to go for an outright win as they play the second of their three home games this season.         
	But such hopes have been dealt a blow as Mumbai would be without their two key seamers, Avishkar Salvi and Ajit Agarkar due to injuries.         
	Middle-order batsman Abhishek Nayar, who suffered an ankle injury in the last game in Calcutta, is out as well as youngster Praful Waghela, who is down with malaria.         
	The Murali Kartik-led Railways team that drew Assam in Delhi last week has three changes.         
	Leg spinner Nilesh Chauhan has come in place of Kulamani Parida, who announced his retirement after being called for suspect action against Assam.         
	Medium pacer Anureet Singh and batsman Harshad Rawle have been included in place of Krishnakanth Upadhyay and Karan Sharma.

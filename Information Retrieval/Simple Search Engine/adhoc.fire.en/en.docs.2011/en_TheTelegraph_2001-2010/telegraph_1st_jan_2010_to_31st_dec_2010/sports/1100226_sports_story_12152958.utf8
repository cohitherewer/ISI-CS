The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreevats, Sourav sizzle
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sreevats, Sourav sizzle
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sreevats                           
	Calcutta: For Bengal, the two SGs are doing the trick. For the second time in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, 37-year-old Sourav Ganguly and 20-year-old Sreevats Goswami came together and butchered the opposition bowling as Bengal eased through their quarter final match against Saurashtra winning by nine wickets at the Motibagh Palace Ground in Vadodara, on Thursday.         
	Chasing a decent Saurashtra score of 255 for seven, Sourav (87 ..) and Sreevats (149 ..) put on an undefeated 196 runs for the second wicket as Bengal romped home with 55 balls to spare. They will now take on Karnataka in the semi-final on Saturday.         
	Earlier, during the zonal-leg, Sourav and Sreevats had put on 131 runs for the second wicket against Assam, paving the way for a Bengal victory.         
	This was Sreevatss third century in the competition after having notched back-to-back hundreds against Jharkhand and Assam, during the zonal-leg in Cuttack. Sreevats now tops the batting list with 442 runs to his name.         
	Winning the toss, Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla opted to field. Sagar Jogiyani (71) and Cheteswar Pujara (110) added 100 runs for the third wicket. In the 37th over Sourasish Lahiri trapped Jogiyani leg before but Pujara completed his century. Shukla, who removed Pujara, was the most successful bowler taking three for 35 from his 10 overs.         
	In reply, Bengal lost opener Arindam Das (18) early, but Sourav and Sreevats pulverised the bowling. While Sreevats hit 11 boundaries and seven sixes in his 138-ball knock, the former Indian captain also scored at a brisk pace hitting five boundaries and five sixes.         
	We always knew that 256 was an achievable target. We didnt take any undue risks and yet played the big shots. I wouldnt like to compare this innings with earlier centuries, but I am happy that I am regularly contributing to the teams cause, Sreevats told The Telegraph over phone from Vadodara.         
	Has he changed his batting style? I have not changed anything. The only thing I have told myself is that when I am in good form, I have to make full use of the opportunities I am getting. Even Dada (Sourav) told me that its good to get a hundred, but I must try and finish off the game. Since I am in good form, I shouldnt leave it upon others, even if there are few runs left. Hope that I can carry my form into the next match as well, Sreevats said.         
	His skipper, Shukla, too, lavished praise on the youngster. Sreevats has been outstanding in the tournament. I only wish he continues this form.         
	And what can I say about Sourav? He has always put his hand up and done it for the team whenever we required him. Not only is his contribution with the bat immense, but also the amount of input he has been providing is phenomenal, Shukla said.

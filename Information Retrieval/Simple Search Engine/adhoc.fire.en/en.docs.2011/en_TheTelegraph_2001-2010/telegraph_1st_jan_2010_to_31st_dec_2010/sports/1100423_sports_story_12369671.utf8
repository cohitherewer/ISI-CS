The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib back on the selectors radar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Shoaib back on the selectors radar
                  Shoaib Akhtar during his six-wicket haul in Karachi, on Wednesday                     
	Karachi: Pakistans chief selector Mohsin Khan Thursday said that controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar could be considered for the upcoming tour of England, if he continues to perform well in the domestic tournaments.         
	Mohsin, who watched Shoaib bowling Wednesday in the Pentangular Cup one-day tournament here against Peshawar, where he returned with figures of 6 for 52, said the pacer stands a realistic chance to return to the international arena.         
	If he continues to play well regularly at the domestic and club level and proves his fitness and form, he could be considered for the English tour, Mohsin said.         
	We have not written him off completely. He should be grateful to the PCB that it has given him a chance to win back his place in the national team, he said.         
	With Wednesdays performance, Shoaib is now the leading wicket-taker in the Pentangular tournament. Pakistan are due to tour England from late June onwards to play six Tests, two against Australia and four against England in what promises to be a tough tour.         
	Shoaib, 34, has not played for Pakistan since May 2009 when he appeared in a one-day series against Australia. Since then has had a knee operation and also faced disciplinary issues with the board.         
	Shoaib was delighted with his performance, insisting he was confident of making it back to the national team.         
	I am targetting the England tour and that is why I am laying stress on domestic cricket. My knee is holding up well and it was the best decision I took to have the operation last year since I was struggling with it for last few years, Shoaib told reporters at the stadium.         
	Mohsin also made it clear that the selectors would be happy to pick former captains and senior batsmen, Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf, the day PCB lifts its ban on them from playing for the national team.         
	If the board lifts their bans we will be happy to consider them since they are experienced players with a proven record at the Test level, he remarked.

  - Deccan Chargers aim to beat Dhonis boys for the third time this season       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Herschelle Gibbs in Mumbai, on Wednesday                                 
	Mumbai: For Adam Gilchrist, the Deccan Chargers five-match winning streak makes for a sense of dj vu.         
	As an Australian opener, nearly 12 years ago, Gilchrist was part of Steve Waughs team that bounced back from the brink of elimination by winning seven matches in a row before eventually going on to lift the World Cup.         
	Well, actually one of the results was a tie but coming as it did in the semi-finals and with Australia advancing, it was the opposite of a loss.         
	On the eve of the second semi-final against the Chennai Super Kings, Gilchrist would have harked back to those halcyon days. His sides performance at the half-way mark of the season has been anything but that befitting defending champions.         
	At one stage, with six reverses in nine games, it seemed that the Chargers would be fighting the rest of the tournament to avoid the wooden spoon. But then followed a remarkable escape act that would have done the ice-cool Waugh proud, and the team finished the league phase second only to table toppers Mumbai Indians.         
	And ominously, Gilchrist is yet to properly fire. There have been the starts, but they have been nipped in the bud. But the swashbuckling opener has a penchant for playing irresistible knocks on the biggest occasions.         
	If his record in World Cup finals from 1999 to 2007 seems too far back in time to seriously worry the Super Kings, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. would only have to jog their memory a year back to recall his destructive 35-ball 85 against Delhi DareDevils in the semis in South Africa.         
	Super Kings would anyway be wary of the Chargers and their demolition man, thanks to their all-loss record against the Hyderabad franchise this season.         
	Bowling has been their weak link, especially the medium-pace department where domestic talent has been found wanting. Laxmipathy Balaji, M.S. Gony, Joginder Sharma and Sudeep Tyagi have been far from threatening.         
	Fortunately, the slow bowlers have done a decent job. Sri Lankan world record holder Muthiah Muralidharan has not really set the stage afire, but 13 scalps from 10 games is quite commendable in this format.         
	Another offie, the 23-year-old R. Ashvin, has also played the role of specialist spinner quite ably with his 12 wickets.         
	Chargers have their own slow-bowling hero in left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha who, with 20 wickets, is the leading bowler in the tournament.         
	But there is no doubt that both the sides have relied on their batting artillery to qualify for the knockout stage.         
	Skipper Dhoni has bailed the team out on more than one occasion and the Super Kings would be hoping Matthew Hayden, who much like Gilchrist, has been dormant in the tournament, would come to the party with his Mongoose bat at the right time.         
	But Murali Vijay has been the revelation of IPL III and is one of only eight batsmen to aggregate more than 400 runs so far. And, having been named Virender Sehwags replacement in the Indian squad for the World T20, the 26-year-old will be relishing one more opportunity to prove his attacking prowess.

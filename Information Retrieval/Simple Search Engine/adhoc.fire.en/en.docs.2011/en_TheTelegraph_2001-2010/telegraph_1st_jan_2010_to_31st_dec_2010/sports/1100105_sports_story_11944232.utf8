                                                                                                                       7                                      An historic moment: De Ridder 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Twenty-seven months is a long time. And, for the millions of East Bengal fans, 27 months without a trophy must have been even longer. So when the Federation Cup finally landed at the club premises on Monday, celebrations were the obvious outcome.         
	Showered by adulation from red and gold fans, Phillippe de Ridder, claimed the occasion to be an historic moment.         
	Given the problems we faced, it was certainly a great performance. Their fighting spirit and never-say-die attitude has led to this triumph. Im happy to be a part of this historic moment, De Ridder said.         
	He also lauded his defence which didnt concede a single goal in the tournament. That we played well is evident from the fact that we didnt concede any goal Even in the tie-breaker we were brilliant. Credit must go the defenders for such a performance, he said.         
	Asked what was the secret behind the unexpected success, De Ridder winked: I guess its the mutual respect between me and the players. We just try to put up a team effort.         
	If the Belgian was going gaga over his team, his captain, Syed Rahim Nabi, paid back the tribute as he said a lot of things have changed with De Ridder at the helm.         
	It has been a positive change for us. De Ridder has instilled the much-needed confidence in us and, these days, we play more freely. I think that has made a difference, Nabi said.         
	Nabi heaped praise on goalkeeper Abhra Mondal. All credit to him for the final, he said. The East Bengal officials, on their part, have announced an incentive of Rs 3 lakh for the team.         
	Meanwhile, East Bengal have been clubbed with Lebanons Al Nejneh, Kuwaits Kardis and Al Itihad of Syria in Group D of the AFC Cup.

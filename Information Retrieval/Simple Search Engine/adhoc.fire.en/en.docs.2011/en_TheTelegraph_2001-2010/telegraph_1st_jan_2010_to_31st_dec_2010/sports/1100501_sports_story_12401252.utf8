The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are elite now: Liuzzi
                                                                                                                       7                                      We are elite now: Liuzzi
                      
	London: Force India have shrugged off their place among the minnows and joined the elite group battling for points, according to in-form driver Vitantonio Liuzzi.         
	The 29-year-old Italian and his Force India teammate Adrian Sutil have scored points in three of the four Grands Prix held so far, and have looked fast in qualifying.         
	Now, with the progressive backing of team owner Dr Vijay Mallya, who is also the chairman of both United Breweries and Kingfisher Airlines, as well as owner of the Bangalore Royal Challengers in Indian Premier League, Liuzzi reckons Force India are set to grow even stronger.         
	Mallya has declared that it is his ambition to see his team fighting for a victory next year when Indias inaugural Grand Prix will take place, and Liuzzi believes the team is on course to realise that dream.         
	When you start having results and you start scoring points, then you feel much stronger, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are on top now: Herath
                                                                                                                       7                                      We are on top now: Herath
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sri Lanka spinner Rangana Herath was extremely happy with his batting display on the third day of the first Test, against India, in Galle, on Tuesday. And why not? For someone who possesses a Test batting average of 9.00, coming in at No. 8 and scoring 80 precious runs for the team is no doubt a wonderful experience.         
	Speaking to the mediapersons after the days play, the 32-year-old said he was happy because his hard work paid off. He was also of the opinion that there will be a result in the match inspite a days play being lost due to rain.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his batting         
	I am so happy with my batting because this my highest score in first-class and Tests So, I am happy with the way I batted.         
	If he thought about scoring a century         
	No I just wanted to be on the wicket and score some runs.         
	His preparations         
	I am working with the coaching staff on my batting, and I am getting some good results now.         
	Partnership with Lasith Malinga         
	We did not have any plans about who will go after the bowling. We just discussed to bat on for as long as we could. We were thinking in terms of adding 10 to 15 runs, nothing else.         
	If batting was easy         
	No It was hard for the first 10-15 overs, but after that I realised it was a bit easier to score. Though it wasnt so easy since there was a little turn and bounce in the wicket.         
	On what Muralidharan said         
	Murali was telling me that if I can get the hundred, he will stay with me (at the crease).         
	Muralidharans retirement         
	It is really hard to fill the void. But myself, Suraj (Randiv), Ajantha (Mendis)  we have to step up and do well for the team.         
	On Muralidharans bowling         
	He bowled really well today. He got Sachin (Tendulkar)s wicket. That has given us the advantage.         
	The VVS Laxman-Sehwag partnership         
	They batted very well. But at the same time, the bowlers were bowling really well So if either of them had had done one mistake, it would have cost them their wicket. We expect to do the same thing on Wednesday.         
	His teams plans         
	If we can get early wickets, we can restrict them under 250 or 300. Thats what we want to do. Even if they avoid the follow-on, we can still force a win.         
	Sri Lankas chances in the match         
	For me, we are on top now. If we can get two or three early wickets tomorrow (Wednesday), it will set up the game for us. I still see a result in this game. (Virender) Sehwag is the danger man. If we can get him out early, it would be good for us.

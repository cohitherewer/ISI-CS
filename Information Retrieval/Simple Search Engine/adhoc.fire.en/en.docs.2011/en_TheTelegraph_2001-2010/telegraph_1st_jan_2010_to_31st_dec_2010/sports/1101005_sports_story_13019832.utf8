The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Europeans wrest Ryder Cup   Colin Montgomerie with the Ryder Cup, on Monday
                                                                                                                       7                                      Europeans wrest Ryder Cup
  - Woods returns to form with one of the best performances of the day       SANDY MACASKILL                                  
	Newport: Graeme McDowell regained the Ryder Cup lost by Europe at Valhalla in 2008, when his opponent Hunter Mahan conceded the Northern Irishmans putt at Celtic Manors 17th hole after squeezing his own effort just wide.         
	Europe were victorious by the most narrow of possible margins  14  - 13   giving this troubled Ryder Cup a unforgettable finish.         
	Colin Montgomerie could not watch. But the noise told him all he needed to know. Monty, the European captain, had said, before the competition started, that this would come down to a final putt on the final hole. Not far off.         
	Captain Fantastic, Darren Clarke had called him. Well, whatever people will make of the rest of his singles order, Montys decision to take out an insurance policy by playing McDowell in the final singles match proved decisive.         
	That it came down to McDowell and Mahan, the 12th match, was because of impressive final-day performances from the US team, who won six of the days singles matches.         
	Mostly it came down to a tenacious fight-back by rookie Rickie Fowler, who recovered from three holes down, with four to go against Edoardo Molinari, with four straight birdies to halve the match.         
	Europe had started strongly, Montgomeries team needing just five points to regain the trophy lost in Louisville, Kentucky two years ago.         
	With all 12 singles matches on the course, Europe led in eight. Luke Donald defeated Jim Furyk by one hole and Ian Poulter  good as his word to return with a point  thumped Matt Kuchar 5 and 4.         
	But it was the Americans, who had started the day trailing by 9  points to 6 , who performed better in the singles. Its tight, Donald had said after finishing. It was more than that.         
	Magnificent Monday, morphed into Manic Monday when Steve Stricker landed an early blow by beating Lee Westwood 2 and 1, Dustin Johnson beat Martin Kaymer 6 and 4, Jeff Overton beat Ross Fisher 3 and 2, Phil Mickelson defeated Peter Hanson 4 and 2, and Zach Johnson beat Padraig Harrington. Stuart Cink was held to a half by Rory McIlroy in the second match.         
	Tiger Woods, meanwhile, pulled out one of the performances of the day, announcing his return to form in style by coming from two behind and smashing opponent Francesco Molinari 4 and 2 despite the Italian posting four birdies.         
	It was a day of nerves for those watching and those taking part.         
	European fingernails were bitten down to the quick when Fowler recovered against Molinari, winning the 18th. So it was that it came down to McDowell, who at the 16th green was just one-up and feeling the pressure.         
	He sunk a 12ft putt, extending his lead to two with three to play, both fists pumping the air.         
	At the 17th, two up with one more to play, Mahan muffed his chip to the green. McDowell left his putt short, but when Mahan missed the American conceded.

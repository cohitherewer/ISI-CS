The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni set to lose No.1 spot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni set to lose No.1 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, unavailable for the teams tour of Zimbabwe, is all set to lose his number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen as a result of the break.         
	A player loses half-a-per cent of his ratings points for every ODI missed. As such, Dhoni, who currently leads Michael Hussey by just eight ratings points, will slip behind the Australian when the player rankings are released at the end of the series in Zimbabwe.         
	Dhoni had regained the top spot from Hussey in February after the Australian scored 23 against New Zealand in the fourth ODI and didnt play in the fifth.         
	But Dhoni might not be the only Team India senior experiencing a slide. Sachin Tendulkar (fourth), Virender Sehwag (11th), Yuvraj Singh (14th) and Gautam Gambhir (23rd) are all likely to slip in the rankings after opting out of the tri-series to be played between 28 May and 9 June.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (10th) and Mahela Jayawardena (29th), too, can find themselves dropping down the chart after opting to sit out of the series.         
	The absence of these big shots gives stand-in captains, Indias Suresh Raina (16th) and Lankan Tillekaratne Dilshan (13th), an outstanding opportunity to move up the table.         
	It is the same scenario in the rankings for ODI bowlers with iconic spinner Muttiah Muralidharan certain to drop out of the top 20 for the first time since March 1996.         
	In the ODI championship table, India are second with 122 ratings points while Sri Lanka are sixth and 14 points behind. Zimbabwe are at 10th, just two ahead of Ireland.

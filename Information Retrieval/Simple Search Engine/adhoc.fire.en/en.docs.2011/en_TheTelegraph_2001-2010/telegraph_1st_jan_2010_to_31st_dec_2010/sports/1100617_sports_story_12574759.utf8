                                                                                                                       7                                      TV pundit penalised
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	London: ITVs World Cup coverage suffered another blow on Tuesday when it dismissed a pundit whose allocated tickets ended up in the hands of a group of women who went to a match in bright orange mini dresses as part of an ambush marketing stunt.         
	Robbie Earle, a commentator with the UK broadcaster since 2002, lost his job after a Fifa investigation into the ejection of 36 women from Hollands opening match against Denmark.         
	They were all wearing dresses designed to promote Bavaria Beer, a Dutch company.         
	ITV sources said that Earle, thought to be on a pay package of about 150,000 a year, had assured the broadcaster that he was buying the tickets for his friends and family though the real story was something else.

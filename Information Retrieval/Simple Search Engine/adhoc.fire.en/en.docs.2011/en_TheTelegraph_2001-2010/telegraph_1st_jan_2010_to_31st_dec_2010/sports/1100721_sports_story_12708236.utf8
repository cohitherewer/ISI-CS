            A STAFF REPORTER            Manipurs Subhas Singh gets past J amp;K defender Wasim Feroz during their Santosh Trophy match, at the Khardah Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: When a team dish out a masterly display even if their stars are warming the bench, theres only one inference  quality. They are deservingly known as the nursery of the present Indian soccer and, on Tuesday, at the Khardah Stadium, Manipur, playing mostly with their reserve players, showed why they are title favourites in the 64th edition of the Santosh Trophy.         
	Outclassing Jammu amp; Kashmir 2-0 on their way to the pre-quarter finals, where they will face the might of Punjab, Manipur displayed, in what can be called, simple but solid football. Dominating the game from the onset, Manipur never allowed Jammu amp; Kashmir, who possessed the physical advantage, to get a grip.         
	With N. Bengkok busy making those searing runs down the left flank, the Jammu amp; Kashmir defence were having a torrid time clearing his missiles. The strike duo of Subhas Singh and Malemnganba Singh combining well, it was just a matter of time till the scoreline showed 1-0 in Manipurs favour.         
	And that eventually came in the 16th minute when an under-pressure Jammu amp; Kashmir defence got caught in their own off-side trap as Jotin Singh got truckloads of time to slot the ball past a hapless goalkeeper Vikramjeet Singh.         
	It could have easily been 2-0 if Jotin Singhs powerful header in the 31st minute, off a corner, didnt find the horizontal on its way.         
	Jammu amp; Kashmirs only real attempt was a long ranger from Asif Majid at the hour mark. That had enough power to beat the keeper Basant Singh but didnt get past the crosspiece.         
	Manipur added their second in the 82th minute when Malemnganba Singh met Nilakumar Singhs centre to perfection to send the ball into the net.         
	In the other matches of the day, Nagaland thrashed Puducherry 6-0, while Punjab hammered Gujarat 10-1. Punjabs Amanjeet Batra scored a hattrick.

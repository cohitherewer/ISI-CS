The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Iqbal spins a web, claims five vs Delhi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Iqbal spins a web, claims five vs Delhi
                            
	New Delhi: Left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla ran through the Delhi middle-order with a five-wicket haul as Mumbai bowled out the hosts for 201 thereby taking a first innings lead of 66 runs in the final group league encounter at the Roshanara ground.         
	After Abdulla (five for 25) decimated Delhi, Mumbai scored another 74 runs losing two wickets in the process. The defending champions now enjoy a lead of 140 runs with eight wickets remaining.         
	Besides captain Mithun Manhas (66,110 balls, 12x4), none of the Delhi batsmen showed any signs of taking any responsibility in a crunch match as they threw away their wickets.         
	It was Moondeep Mangela who started the slide Thursday dismissing Shikhar Dhawan caught by Rohit Sharma. However, Manhas and Mayank Tehlan (29, 63 balls, 2x4) added 77 runs for the fourth wicket as Delhi reached 150 for three. However, the next seven wickets fell for just 51 runs with Abdulla taking five of them and Aavishkar Salvi taking the other two.         
	Salvi bowled one in the line of the stumps as Manhas went for a cut without having much room to execute it and the ball clipped the off-bail.         
	Abdulla then got Tehlan caught by Prashant Waghela as the others like Rajat Bhatia, Puneet Bisht, Pradeep Sangwan, Sumit Narwal followed suit playing poor shots.         
	When Mumbai batted in the second innings, wicketkeeper-batsman Omkar Gurav (30, 71 balls, 5x4) and opener Sahil Kukreja (25 batting, 3x4) scored 58 runs for the first wicket before Gurav was caught by Bisht off Pradeep Sangwans bowling.         
	Prashant Waghela who played at No. 3 in place of Ajinkya Rahane failed for the second time in this match nicking one to Bisht off Narwals bowling.         
	In Kanpur, riding C.M. Gautams century, Karnataka piled up 416 in their first innings and then reduced Uttar Pradesh to 163 for five at the end of second days play.         
	Gautam (115) started from where he had left last evening and, together with Udit Patel (72), added 126 runs for the ninth wicket to guide Karnataka past the 400-run mark.         
	For UP, leg-spinner Piyush Chawla added one more wicket to his four overnight to finish with figures of five for 95.

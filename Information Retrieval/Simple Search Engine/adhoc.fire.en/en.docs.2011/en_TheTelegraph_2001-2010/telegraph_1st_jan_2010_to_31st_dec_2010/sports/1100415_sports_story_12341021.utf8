	New Delhi: India striker Sunil Chetri made a disappointing debut for Kansas City Wizards as he failed to score and was shown a yellow card for a reckless tackle.         
	Kansas City lost 1-2 to Colorado Rapids in the US Open Cup qualifier at the Kansas City in the United States.         
	Two goals from Wells Thompson were enough for the Colorado Rapids to advance to the next play-in stage of the Cup and eliminate the Wizards from the competition at the H Durwood Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Chetri played for 45 minutes and was cautioned in the 20th minute for bringing down Thompson from behind. He was replaced by Kei Kamara in the 46th minute.         
	The Wizards drew first blood through rookie Teal Bunbury, who scored just four minutes into the match after outrunning three Rapids defenders on the left flank.         
	However, Thompson responded in the 24th minute off a corner kick from Jamie Smith. Thompson took one touch and sent a close-range rocket past Eric Kronberg at the near post to level the score.         
	Thompson scored the winner in the 80th minute off a feed from newly-signed Argentine import Claudio Lopez.         
	The Wizards had multiple opportunities to restore parity in the stoppage time but Kamaras left-footed half volley was not on target and Rapids goalkeeper Steward Ceus tipped a late Jimmy Conrad header over the crossbar.         
	Chetri is the first Indian to play for a Major League Soccer side and also the first Asian to play for the Wizards.         
	The diminutive Indian did not play in Wizards second MLS match against the Rapids on April 10 as he did not have his clearance papers from the United States Soccer Federation and the MLS.         
	Sunil is a guy that has good attacking tendencies. Hes had a bit of time to settle in, so it should be a seamless transition, Wizards manager Peter Vermes had said after official announcement of Chhetris inclusion in the roster.         
	Chhetri has scored four goals in two games for Wizards reserve team, including a hattrick against the University of Evansville two weeks ago. (PTI)

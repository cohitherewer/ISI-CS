            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The construction work of state-of-the-art dressing rooms at the Eden Gardens will begin from Monday. And it will be a race against time for the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).         
	The work has to be completed within 80 days since, according to ICC guidelines, the World Cup venues should host a minimum of two first class matches before the Cup.         
	As per the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s domestic fixtures, Bengal will get to play only two first-class matches at home.         
	The first one will be a Ranji Trophy Super League encounter against Mumbai from November 10-13 and the second one, against Assam, from November 17-20.         
	We have to complete the work by November 1, said Chitrak Mitra, the chairman of the stadium committee.         
	And what if the work is incomplete? We are hopeful, but in case such a situation arises, we will have to do a makeshift arrangement in the first floor, Mitra added.

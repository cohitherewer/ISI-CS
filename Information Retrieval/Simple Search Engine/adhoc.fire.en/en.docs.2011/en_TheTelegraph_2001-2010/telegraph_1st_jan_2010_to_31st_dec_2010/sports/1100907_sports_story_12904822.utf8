            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Playing against higher ranked Asian teams would be more beneficial for India in the run up to the Asian Cup preparations, feels Bob Houghton.         
	India will take on Thailand at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday followed by another friendly encounter against African side Namibia at the same venue on September 15. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) also has plans to arrange matches against Gambia, Yemen and Vietnam in the next one month.         
	Houghton, who was initially not too enthusiastic about playing against African teams, said: After all, we are going to play the Asian Cup. It is always better to play against good Asian nations.         
	The national coach also said that it would have done the team a world of good had the AIFF organised a preparatory camp in one of the west Asian countries.         
	Houghton is also reluctant to release players for the Asian Games camp. Our main aim should be to do well in the Asian Cup, the British coach commented.         
	The current set of boys, captain Bhaichung Bhutia said, would go a long way in serving the national team.         
	The present team has got a great future. Almost all the players who played in the last match against Thailand were young, except Mahesh (Gawli) I think, he said.         
	Sixty to 70 per cent of the players in the team are young, with an average age of 24 or 25, and thats a good sign, the captain said. Players like Anwar, Gourmangi Singh, Anthony Pereira and Mohammed Rafi have great future, said Bhutia.         
	The Indian captain further added that clubs in India would have to change their attitude. They are not contributing much to the cause of Indian football. They should be able to supply more quality players to the national team.

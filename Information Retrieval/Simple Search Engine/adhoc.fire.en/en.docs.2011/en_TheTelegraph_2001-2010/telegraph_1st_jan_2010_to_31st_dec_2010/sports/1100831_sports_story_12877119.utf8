	Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting on Monday said if the match-fixing slur on his teams Sydney Test win over Pakistan is proved right, all individual milestones by his players in that game would be tainted.         
	Reacting to the claims by a bookie Mazhar Majeed Ponting said he has been left stunned. But the Aussie skipper insisted that he never suspected anything fishy during the 36-run win over Pakistan in January in a match, which saw nine wickets of the visiting side fall for 89 runs.         
	Not at the time, no, I had no idea about anything like that at all, Ponting told a radio station. The way we won was one of the more satisfying moments that Ive had on the cricket field. And now when some of these things come to light is when you start to slightly doubt some of the things that have happened. Its not up to us to worry about that anyway, he added.         
	But after the sting, Ponting said he fears the individual efforts by his players to notch that unlikely win would stand tainted.         
	The thing that Im most worried about if any of this is proven to be true is some of the individual performances that took place in that game, he said.         
	You look at Mike Husseys second innings hundred and Peter Siddles batting and the way he was with Mike Hussey that day and Nathan Hauritz taking five wickets on the final day to win us the game.         
	All of those individual milestones will be tainted as well, he added.         
	Cricket Australia also said the allegations are most disturbing and called for a thorough investigation into the scandal.         
	The reports from the UK are most disturbing and we look forward to the outcome of rigorous investigation by the UK authorities as well as by the ICC, CA chief James Sutherland said.         
	It is critical for cricket that the public has confidence in the integrity of the outcome of games, which is why CA and other ICC members have supported the significant world cricket investment in anti corruption over the last decade or more, he added.         
	Sutherland said so far CA had not doubts about the Sydney Test. CA had been in no doubt that Australia had won that game on the merit of their on-field performance and will now wait on evidence from UK and ICC investigations before making any further comment, he said in a CA statement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka look to exploit conditions 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lanka look to exploit conditions 
                      
	Dambulla: India get a chance to make amends for their recent debacles, climb up the ODI rankings and break a 15-year jinx in the Asia Cup which takes off Tuesday with favourites Sri Lanka facing Pakistan in the opener.         
	With a hattrick of titles in sight, Sri Lanka would look to exploit the home conditions against Pakistan at the Rangiri Dambulla ground Tuesday.         
	Considering the fact that Sri Lanka won the title in the previous two editions, the hosts are slightly ahead of the others going into the meet.         
	The tournament opener between Sri Lanka and Pakistan holds promise as on paper both the teams are equally matched in terms of potential, though the buoyant hosts have the more experienced players, who have a reputation of being devastating in their own backyard.         
	The inclusion of wily off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who recovered from an injury sustained during the World Twenty20, has strengthened the Kumar Sangakkara-led Sri Lankan side. What would be a morale-booster for Sri Lanka is Tillekaratne Dilshans return to form.         
	It remains to be seen how Pakistan play under new captain Shahid Afridi.           (PTI)

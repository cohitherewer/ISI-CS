                                                                                                                       7                                      Nada to conduct random tests
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) will conduct the random doping tests on behalf of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on the domestic cricketers during the ongoing season.         
	Although the parent body has been sending a list of prohibited drugs to the various state associations for some years now, this is the first time that cricketers from all age-groups (senior, U-22, U-19, U-16) playing Board matches will have to undergo a dope test.         
	The BCCI has already sent letters to each and every state association informing them about the decision.         
	The Nada will perform the test. The BCCI will select the matches where Nada officials will be present.         
	The tests will be performed on match days only, a senior BCCI official said Saturday.         
	The letter, written by the BCCIs chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, has clearly stated that players will be selected randomly for the tests.         
	There is also an instruction for the support staff of each and every state team (all age-groups) to get updated about latest list of prohibited drugs as per the Wada regulations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India hope to salvage honour
                                                                                                                       7                                      India hope to salvage honour
  - Hosts need to finish third in group to qualify for fifth-sixth spot playoff       JAYDEEP BASU                            
	New Delhi: After hat-trick of defeats in the group stages, India will take on South Africa on Monday hoping to improve their rankings in the World Cup hockey at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium.         
	The last time India played South Africa in the World Cup was in 2006, in Germany, to decide the last two spots in the 12-nation meet. Luckily, India avoided the ignominy of finishing 12th as they managed victory by a solitary goal.         
	Indian coach Jose Brasa has been saying for long that a fifth place finish in the World Cup would be a satisfactory result for the hosts.         
	But then, as things stands now, Brasas dream of taking India to the top six bracket seems a near impossible task.         
	To qualify for the classification match for the fifth and the sixth spots, India will have to ensure a third place finish in their own group, an extremely improbable job.         
	Apart from the basic need of beating South Africa by a comfortable margin, India will also have to depend heavily on the results of the other matches in the group.         
	As of now, India are placed fourth in the group with only three points that they earned by beating Pakistan on the inaugural day. Spain, who are placed third with six points behind England (12) and Australia (9) are still in with an outside chance for a last four spot and will certainly go flat out against England on Monday.         
	Though India are slightly better placed on goal difference, the two other teams in the group  Pakistan and South Africa  can pip the home side in the fight for the higher placing as both the sides also have three points each.         
	Beating South Africa, especially after their morale-boosting win over Pakistan, is going to be tough, said Brasa. South Africa are a very good side. They played well against Pakistan, Spain and England. It will not be an easy job.         
	Indias problems are basically self-inflicted. Against both Spain and England, the hosts missed a series of chances and failed to mark the rival strikers.         
	Once again, India were proved to be poor converters of penalty corners despite having three specialist drag-flickers in the team.         
	The lack of variations was evident as the rival goalkeepers foiled Sandeep Singh and Dhananjay Mahadik time and again.         
	On Saturday, Brasa said that lack of experience was one of the main reasons behind Indias poor showings against top teams in the group. The argument doesnt hold good as India have several players in the team who have played more than 100 international matches.         
	Seasoned striker Prabhjot Singh also felt the team missed too many chances in the tournament.         
	We wasted opportunities and failed to covert penalty corners. Our man-to-man markings were also not up to the mark, he admitted.         
	Given the kind of support the home team received throughout the tournament, India must do well against South Africa.         
	A defeat against the 12th place team in the last World Cup would be the last thing the fans would expect from Brasa and his men in the concluding group league match.

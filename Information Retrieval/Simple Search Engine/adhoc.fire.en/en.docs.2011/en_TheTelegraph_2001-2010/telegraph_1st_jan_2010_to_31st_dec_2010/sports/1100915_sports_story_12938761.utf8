	Calcutta: Horses were brought out for the morning exercises on Tuesday, signalling the end to the syces agitation. Syces had gone on a warpath following the death of their fellow-worker who was victim of a fatal kick from Ajayajeet, a Richard Alford-trained horse. Syces, who demanded hefty compensation from RCTC, also threatened to disrupt Wednesdays racing if their demand was not fulfiled. Everything was sorted was out amicably after long deliberations late on Monday night. Normalcy has been restored now; said an RCTC source.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Murithala Ali and Jose Ramirez Barreto, at the Barabati Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                            
	Cuttack: A hattrick each by star strikers Jose Ramirez Barreto and Murithala Ali powered Mohun Bagan to a thumping 6-1 victory over Salgaocar Sports Club, in their last Group D quarter final league match of the 32nd Federation Cup, at Barabati Stadium, on Sunday.         
	With this win (their second in the group stage), 14-time champions Bagan topped the table with seven points and completed the semi-final line-up in the process. They will lock horns with Group C toppers Dempo Sports Club in the second semi-final on Thursday.         
	East Bengal will meet Churchill Brothers in the first semi-final on Wednesday. After an off-colour performance in the first two league matches, Brazilian striker Barreto bounced back into form, scoring the first, second and fourth goals against three-time champions Salgaocar.         
	In the 12th minute, he nodded home an Ishfaq Ahmed flag-kick from the left. Barreto struck again nine minutes later, booting home a Murithala pass. It was a stunning goal as Barreto made a solo run, beat three opposition players and then bulged the net with a booming right-footer from outside the box. He completed his hattrick when he scored off an Ishfaq cross from the left flank in the 35th minute.         
	Forming a deadly combination with Barreto, Nigerias Murithala helped Bagan to a 5-0 lead at half-time. He opened his account with a left-footer in the 24th minute and struck again in the 40th minute, heading the ball home from a Kingshuk Debnath pass. He clinched his hattrick in style when he volleyed the ball home from a Snehasish Chakraborty centre in the 89th minute.         
	Bagan keeper, Shilton Paul made an extremely good save in the 82nd minute. Yusif Yakubu got the ball with acres of open space in front of him. He tried to pass the ball to Ryuji Sueoka, who was standing unmarked. However, Shilton anticipated the move and intercepted the ball.         
	After half-time, Salgaocar got three chances but Tomba Singh, Yakubu and substitute Sueoka squandered them. However, Sueoka amended his earlier mistake by scoring the consolation goal in the 85th minute.         
	Expecting it to be a keen contest, the match drew a crowd of around 7,000 spectators.         
	In a later match, Mumbai FC held Lajong FC goalless.

	Calcutta: An enraged England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Thursday sought an unreserved apology from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt for making match-fixing allegations against English players during the ODI series of the just-concluded stormy tour.         
	The ECB and the Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) confirmed that a pre-action letter has been sent on behalf of the England cricket team to Ijaz Butt, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, following his allegations that the England team were involved in fixing the outcome of the third one-day International, between England and Pakistan, played at the Brit Oval, on Friday, the ECB said in statement.         
	The ECB said failing an apology, it would take legal action against Butt who caused a sensation by saying that the English cricketers were paid enormous amounts of money by bookies to throw the third ODI of the five-match series which the hosts won 3-2.         
	Butt repeated his claims on Tuesday when he urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to investigate Englands performance at the Oval.         
	The letter seeks a full and unreserved apology. Butt has been advised that if a satisfactory response is not received, legal proceedings will be commenced against him without further notice, the statement read.         
	The acrimonious tour, during which three Pakistani cricketers were suspended for alleged spot-fixing, came to an end on Wednesday but the drama could continue for some time as the PCB too has threatened to make public the names of those who were involved in framing its players.         
	Andrew Strauss, the England captain, had issued a statement on Monday saying the team were exploring the option of taking legal action and Butts increasingly inflammatory statements have stiffened resolve within the ECB and PCA.         
	Meanwhile, according to a report published in The Daily Telegraph, Butt has told ECB officials in private that he will apologise.         
	There is rising anger in Pakistan over the ICCs handling of the latest match-fixing allegation after it launched an inquiry into Pakistans performance in the third one-day international after receiving a tip-off from a tabloid about predicted scoring patterns.         
	However, the British paper quoted a PCB source as saying: There is no question of an apology. Our players were also blamed for spot-fixing without any evidence, did somebody apologise for that? When we were accused everybody was suspecting us and now everybody is protesting against the chairmans remarks There are double standards in the cricketing world.         
	Butts position at the PCB is increasingly under threat and it appears unlikely his term of office, which ends later this year, will be extended by Asif Ali Zardari, the President of Pakistan and the Boards patron.         
	Butt was wrong in levelling allegations, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan had said. Even if any other team is involved that does not absolve you. (The PCB) has to put its house in order. There should no longer be a PCB chairman nominated by the President of Pakistan who is not accountable to anyone, Imran added.         
	However, the PCB Thursday instructed its solicitors in London to respond in detail to ECBs letter.         
	The PCB, in a media release, said that it had received a letter from English solicitors in connection with statements said to have been made by Butt.         
	In this letter multiple demands have been raised. The Board has instructed London lawyers, Addleshaw Goddard, to respond on its behalf to these demands, PCB said in a statement.

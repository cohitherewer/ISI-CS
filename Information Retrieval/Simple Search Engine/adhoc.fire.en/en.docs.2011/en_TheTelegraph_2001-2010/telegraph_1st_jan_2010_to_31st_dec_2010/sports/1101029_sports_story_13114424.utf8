The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Greatbatch blasts NZ players 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Greatbatch blasts NZ players 
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand cricketers have come in for some startling criticism from their coach Mark Greatbatch who feels some players arent as good as they think they are and even a couple of draws in Novembers three-Test series against India would be a good result.         
	New Zealand were handed a humiliating 0-4 thrashing by minnows Bangladesh in a recent ODI series, a result which stunned the country known to perform beyond expectations at big events such as the World Cup.         
	The whitewash in Bangladesh has made for a demoralising build-up to the India series which starts November 4. Daniel Vettoris men will play three Tests and five one-dayers against India. The first Test begins in Ahmedabad, on Thursday, followed by matches in Hyderabad and Nagpur.         
	India have only lost one of their last 13 Tests in India, so if youre gonna ask me what a good result is, I would take two draws, Greatbatch said.         
	Talking about the disappointing tour of Bangladesh, Greatbatch said: When you play badly like that youve got to front up, its devastating.         
	You can talk about structures as much as you want, but the reality is its about the bat and ball. Watching it, making good decisions and getting the hell stuck into the opposition and we just havent done that consistentl.         
	Greatbatch said some players in the team are not fit for international cricket. Ill be honest again I think some (players) arent good enough, I think some think theyre better than they are and the third thing, I think, is the mind, said Greatbatch.         
	Weve got to get our mind right and sometimes that requires patience. At times, it requires being aggressive. What it requires is actually sorting out the cricket smarts and weighing up the situation that youre playing in and weve got some work to do in the areas.

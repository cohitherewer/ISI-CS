	Cuttack: Rocked by two consecutive defeats, the Delhi DareDevils face a stiff challenge of putting their campaign back on track when they take on defending champions Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Sunday.         
	The Chargers are coming into the match with two wins in a row while the DareDevils, suddenly, are seen struggling after a tremendous start to season III. Not cashing on good starts is a concern for the Delhi side, who are without injured skipper Gautam Gambhir.         
	The DareDevils could not cross the 200-run mark, which was within their reach after Virender Sehwags early blitzkrieg against the Chennai Super Kings Friday. AB de Villiers has been a let down and he needs to fire in the middle order if they are to put up a big score.           (PTI)

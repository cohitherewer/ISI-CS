            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Celtic Charm, Legendary Emperor and Whispering Wind are the three runners who are capable of boosting trainer Daniel Davids tally on Friday, the last day of the season. Daniel enjoys a slender lead of one-point over Vijay Singh at the championship table. Vijay, too, has four horses lined up in the afternoons six-event card but they need to put in inspired performance to foil Daniels plans. Moreover, Vijays stable-jockey C. Alford has taken the day off after his fall from Royal Dance on Wednesday.

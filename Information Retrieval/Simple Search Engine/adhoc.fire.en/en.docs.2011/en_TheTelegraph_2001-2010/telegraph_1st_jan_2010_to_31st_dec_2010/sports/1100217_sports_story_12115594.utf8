            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	John Terry has arrived back in London hand in hand with his wife Toni.         
	The Chelsea captain was stripped of the England captaincy 10 days ago after being found to have had an affair with ex-partner of England team-mate Wayne Bridge.         
	Terry flew to Dubai last week in an attempt to save his marriage. Terrys wife, Toni, fled to Dubai with their three-year-old twins, Georgie and Summer, after news of the defenders infidelity broke.         
	However the couple presented a united front as they arrived at Heathrow airport late on Tuesday.         
	We know how we feel about each other and that is the main thing. Our relationship has never been knocked down. Were just so in love, Terry said.         
	His wife added. Were very strong as a couple always have been. John came over and enjoy a few days in the hot weather.

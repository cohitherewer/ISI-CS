The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Setback causes Nadal dismay
                                                                                                                       7                                      Setback causes Nadal dismay
                      
	Melbourne: Troublesome knees cost Rafa Nadal a chance to regain the confidence that has been missing from his game since he lifted the Australian Open title last year, the Spaniard said on Tuesday.         
	Briton Andy Murray instead advanced to the Melbourne Park semi-finals after the 23-year-old world No.2 retired while trailing 3-0 in the third set.         
	Murray had already won the first two sets 6-3, 7-6 before Nadal called for a medical time out to have his right knee treated. He lasted just a few minutes more before he shook his head and told Murray he could not continue.         
	Nadal said it was a recurrence of the problems that forced him out of the defence of his Wimbledon title and away from the ATP Tour last year for more than two months.         
	Since he returned to the courts, Nadal has beaten only one top-10 player, although he said Tuesday he felt he was close to returning to his best and regaining his confidence  something he had not felt since he beat Roger Federer in five sets at Melbourne Park last year.         
	For me its a little bit disappointing (to) have the pain on the knee because I think I am very close to start winning these important matches, he said.         
	I had big chances to win both sets and against probably the player who is playing better right now, I was very close.         
	So I go out from this tournament very happy about my level because the perspective is much better right now than two or three months ago.         
	Nadal refused to say whether he would change his style to try to overcome his knee problems, though it is apparent the pain has changed his game.         
	The top-spin forehand is not as over-powering and he no longer manages to run down every ball to blast winners from improbable angles. It is doubtful whether his knees would now allow him to stop and turn again so quickly.         
	Nadal, however, said he had changed his approach before the knee problems struck. If you see my matches 2005 or 2004, 2006, I run a lot compared to now, Nadal said.         
	Today I played against one of the best players of the world and I wasnt running more than him. I have control of the point, a lot of the time, with the forehand and the backhand, returning aggressive. If you see my matches three years ago, that didnt happen.

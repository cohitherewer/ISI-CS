The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Future is not looking rosy for the Reds
                                                                                                                       7                                      Future is not looking rosy for the Reds

	It is amazing how quickly ambitions recede and goals diminish. Liverpool, title contenders at the start of the season, are now faced with the challenge of trying to qualify for the Europa League next season. Not exactly dignified.         
	The Europa League, like methadone, may only be a pallid substitute, but its better than nothing. Starting with Burnley on Sunday afternoon, Rafael Benitez knows his side must secure qualification via the league or be faced with the task of winning the thing just to be able to take part in European competition next season.         
	Liverpool are four points clear of Everton in seventh  all that is needed for Europa qualification after Portsmouths exclusion was upheld  but have to play Chelsea next week. A win on Sunday would give them that bit of breathing space.         
	Its always important to be in the Champions League or the Europa League, both for the image of the club and for the money, Benitez said. Yes, the image would suffer if we missed out on the Europa League, but sometimes you never know what is best. We will try to win the competition, try to be there and if not, we will get ready for the next challenge.         
	The image of the club. Thats a pretty tough thing to define at the moment. In their current state, Liverpool are a provisional club. Even the short-term future is obscure. We dont know who will own the club, who will manage it or who will be playing for it.         
	As those three factors are interdependent, the picture will only become clearer if there is a radical change.         
	The worst-case scenario for Liverpool is that an overly optimistic valuation of the club, by Tom Hicks in particular, will deter investors and force the club to limp into another campaign without the means to compete. Benitez has made it clear he needs four or more high-quality players. If he doesnt get that investment the next challenge he spoke of will be another club.         
	Juventus clearly want Benitez to be their next manager. In many ways they are Liverpools Italian echo: the nations most successful club fallen out of their domestic elite, and facing the commercial desert of exile from the Champions League. Unlike Liverpool, though, Juventus have money to invest and Benitez might see it as the best venue to rehabilitate a damaged reputation.

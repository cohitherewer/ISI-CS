The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win tie for Lajong 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Must-win tie for Lajong 
                      
	Margao: Lajong FC will be going all out for a win when they meet Salgaocar on Friday in the last round of the I-League to avoid relegation.         
	The match which was scheduled to be played at the Tilak Ground has been shifted to the Duler Ground because of the renovation work going on at the earlier venue.         
	For Lajong FC it is do or die game.         
	With four teams fighting for survival in the last round which ends on the morrow, Lajong, who are placed 12th with 26 points needs an outright win and see Air India and Mumbai FC lose their respective matches on Friday.         
	Lajong, who has a poor away record, will have to pull up their socks and win against Salgacar who does not have any pressure of relegation.           (PTI)

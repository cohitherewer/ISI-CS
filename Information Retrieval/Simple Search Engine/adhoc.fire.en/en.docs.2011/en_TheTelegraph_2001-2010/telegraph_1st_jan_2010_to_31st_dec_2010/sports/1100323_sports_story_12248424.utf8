The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ian Bell leads fightback
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ian Bell leads fightback
                      
	Dhaka: Ian Bell cracked a superb 138 and Tim Bresnan an unbeaten 74 to lead Englands recovery on the third day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh Monday.         
	England were in danger of conceding a first-innings lead before posting 440 for eight in their first innings at stumps in reply to Bangladeshs 419, thanks to Bells 10th Test hundred and Bresnans maiden half-century.         
	The visitors were struggling at 174 for four early in the day before being revived by Bell, who added 98 for the fifth wicket with Matt Prior (62) and 143 for the next with Bresnan.         
	England were just four runs short of Bangladeshs total when Bell was caught by debutant Jahurul Islam while slog-sweeping left-arm spinner Shakib-al Hasan. He smashed one six and 15 fours in his 263-ball knock.         
	Bresnan, batting in only his second Test innings, hit five fours.           (AFP)

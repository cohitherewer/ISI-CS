The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilly: It was an all-round show by KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gilly: It was an all-round show by KKR
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Adam Gilchrist praised Murali Kartik and felt the Kolkata Knight Riders bowling made the difference in Thursdays match at the Eden.         
	Kartik has always been a challenging bowler over the years. Not just in the IPL. Hes very skilful, very experienced and has been enjoying the conditions. Hes been doing a wonderful job. Theres no doubt Murali contributed very well during the crucial overs. All credit to Sourav. It was an all-round package that won KKR the match today, the Deccan Chargers captain explained at the post match media conference.         
	Praising Souravs innings, Gilchrist said: It wasnt just about one man. Sourav played well but the bowling was very impressive when the match was equally balanced in favour of both teams. The change of pace, the variations, the yorkersIt was a collective effort after Sourav had set the tone.         
	He said the Knights total was too good. It was a big total. Anything above nine an over is difficult. We knew we had to bat well. We had a good start but it was disappointing to lose wickets after that. It was a tough ask.

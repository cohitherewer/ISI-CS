	Calcutta: They may not match Mohun Bagan or East Bengal in the volume of supporters. But on Tuesday, at the Sealdah station, 400-odd Chirag United fans made up for the lack in numbers with their vociferous and warm welcome to the team who created history by winning the Durand Cup.         
	It has been a fascinating journey for Chirag United  from being a small-time club of some dedicated football lovers, the boys in purple are now a name to reckon with at the national level.         
	Mohammed Rafique, Chirags hero of the semi-final and final, was floored by the euphoria. I am elated with the support the people who came here to receive us It is an overwhelming experience and a great moment for all of us. I dedicate this success to my mother. We played well as a team and our coachs (Subrata Bhattacharya) contribution to the triumph is immense.         
	The striker was however grounded with his future goals. I need to cement my place in Chirags first eleven Only then will I be able to realise my dream I want to represent a big club in the future. Also donning the India jersey will be right up on my agenda.         
	Rafiques strike partner, Joshimar said that the team spirit led to the success. We played as a unit and thats the most important thing for our success. Rafique was fantastic and dont forget, our coachs (Bhattacharya) significance. Now, we will be eyeing a good performance in the I-League.

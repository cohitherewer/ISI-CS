The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rudi turns to home turf
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rudi turns to home turf
                  Rudi Koertzen shows off an autographed shirt, in Leeds                     
	Leeds: Rudi Koertzen, before his last spell as an international umpire, is told by colleague and match referee Chris Broad that a flight has been found to get him home two days early but it will be economy class.         
	The answer from the South African is negative. Home will have to wait just a bit longer.         
	His 108th and final Test, between Pakistan and Australia at Headingley, finished almost two days early and Koertzen was keen to start a new domesticated life rather than spend more time in a hotel room.         
	The guys asked me what Im going to do now and I said Im going to start working on my marriage after 40 years, the 61-year-old said with a chuckle, minutes before he was given a guard of honour by Australias team.         
	My wife (Hyla) has been everything. While I have been travelling, she has been the housewife. Im very thankful to her.         
	Koertzen, famous for his slow death raising of his arm when giving batsmen out, will return to the small town of Despatch (about 20 miles from Port Elizabeth) for a more sedate lifestyle not involving airports and hotels as a weekly routine.         
	Koertzen also stood in 209 ODIs, making him the most experienced umpire in that format, while he is second to Steve Bucknor on the Test appearances list.         
	He made his international debut in a one-day game between South Africa and India in 1992 at Port Elizabeth . Koertzen said he tried to avoid watching match highlights after a days work.         
	It is hard with technology and you are not going to get away with anything now, he said.         
	Koertzens highlight was appearing in the opening game of the 1999 World Cup at Lords.         
	His worst low was during the 2007 Ashes encounter between England and Australia.         
	The hardest cricket in the world to do is the Ashes because of the way the guys play and with all the hype around it, Koertzen said.         
	The one player he singled out as the finest and most challenging to umpire was former Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne. As an umpire you needed hair on your chest to survive him, said Koertzen. Every ball he bowled in his opinion was a potential wicket and he wasnt far wrong, said the veteran official.

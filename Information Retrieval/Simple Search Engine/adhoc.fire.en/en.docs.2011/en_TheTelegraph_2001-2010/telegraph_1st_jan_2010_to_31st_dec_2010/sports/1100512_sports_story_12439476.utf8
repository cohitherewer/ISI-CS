                                                                                                                       7                                      Tragedy for Satinder
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Bengal cricketer and current assistant coach of Mohun Bagan Satinder Singhs parents were shot dead by unknown assailants on Sunday night at their residence in Manjhi village in Chhapra district of Bihar.         
	Satinders father Janardan (74) was shot in his sleep, while mother Pravabati Devi (68) was dragged to the balcony before being killed.         
	We are shocked at what has happened. My father was associated with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and was the president of the local unit. I believe the murder is politically motivated, Satinder said from his Manjhi residence on Tuesday.         
	The police are investigating and have arrested the servant who used to work in our house. We are confident that truth will prevail, he said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      India deserved to win: Ponting
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Ricky Ponting at a media conference said his team has learnt a good lesson before the Ashes in November.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Any positives from this match         
	Johnson and Hilfenhaus have been very good. Watson at the top of the order has been very good for us. Tim Paine looked every bit of a world-class keeper-batsma. India deserved to win.         
	If the defeat is a worry before the Ashes         
	Well play in a different condition. Its going to be interesting to see how the group bounces back now.         
	His recation to Shane Warnes criticism         
	Hauritz got the field he wanted to bowl to. Unfortunately, Warnie has got his opinion out in the public. Its a personal opinion I guess.         
	Its something that we all face as international cricketers. Different people say different things at different times. We dont always agree with all of them. But thats life I guess.

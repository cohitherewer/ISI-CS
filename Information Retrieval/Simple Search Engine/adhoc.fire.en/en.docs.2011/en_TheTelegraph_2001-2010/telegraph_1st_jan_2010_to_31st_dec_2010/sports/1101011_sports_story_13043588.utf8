	New Delhi: Jose Brasa was smiling on the sidelines, as an ecstatic Indian team did a lap of honour. And they had every reason to feel over the moon. Rajpal Singh amp; Company had just beaten  battered to be more precise Pakistan 7-4 in a Pool A match of the Commonwealth Games, on Sunday and earned a semi-final clash against England.         
	The jam-packed Major Dhyan Chand Stadium  which had Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Mohammed Azharuddin and Gagan Narang among the spectators  was enjoying every bit of the post-match celebrations. After all, netting seven goals against Pakistan is no mean achievement.         
	A memorable day for me. I am still in a daze. I have this knack of scoring against Pakistan, you see, said two-goal hero Shivendra Singh.         
	For those who came in late, Indians exorcised the seven-goal ghost, which had haunted them since the 1982 Asian Games final. On that wintry December afternoon at the same venue, Pakistan ran roughshod over a hapless India banging in seven, after Zafar Iqbal had put the hosts ahead.         
	Now we can all sleep well, said Sandeep Singh, smiling. Nobody will dispute that.         
	India began the match in a whirlwind fashion and before Pakistan could realise what hit them, the scoreboard already read 4-0. Sandeep put the hosts ahead in the second minute, from a penalty corner and followed it with the second one, seven minutes later through another penalty.         
	The third came in the 19th minute when Shivendra redirected a Sandeep hit from the left. A minute later, it was 4-0, when Saravanjit Singh sounded the board after Pakistan goalkeeper Imran Shah partially saved a Sandeep drag flick.         
	Those four goals killed the contest. We tried to comeback and pulled two back, but we knew we had a mountain to climb, Pakistan captain Zeeshan Ashraf was very candid.         
	Pakistans first goal was scored by Imran Mohammed off a penalty stroke and Rizwan Mohammed got the second.         
	After the change of ends whatever hopes Pakistan had of making a contest of it, suffered a jolt, as India scored two more by the 45th minute.         
	Danish Mujtaba netted the fifth after Sandeeps penalty corner was partially saved by Imran. Shivendra, after doing all the good work gave the ball on a platter to Dharamvir Singh who made no mistake.         
	In the 58th minute, Pakistan got their third through Irfan, but India found their seventh thanks to Sivendra.         
	Pakistan continued their struggle and got their fourth through Shakeel Abbassi.         
	Amidst all the emotions Jose Brasa was very relaxed and had his feet firmly on the ground. That half-time break was crucial. Boys were playing with their heart and not mind. Thats why Pakistan got those two goals. I had a difficult time controlling their emotions.         
	This is the best match India has played under me. Thats for sure. I would like to salute the crowd. And hopefully they will come in huge numbers on Tuesday too, Brasa said.         
	India captain Rajpal Singh said his team can enter the final if they repeat the Sunday show. We were brilliant today. Hopefully, on Tuesday we will play with the same intensity.         
	True, on Sunday the Indians served a different ballgame altogether. Even the general weak link Prabodh Tirkey was not ready to yield an inch. We needed to win, and generally we play well whenever our backs are against the wall.         
	Few would doubt that.         
	Meanwhile, Australia beat Malaysia 7-0.

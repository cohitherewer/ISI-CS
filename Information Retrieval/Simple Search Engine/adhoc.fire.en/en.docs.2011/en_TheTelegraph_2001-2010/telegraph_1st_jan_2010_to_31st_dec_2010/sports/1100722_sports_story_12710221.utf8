The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hope polls reveal a clear picture
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hope polls reveal a clear picture
            STICKWORK - GURBUX SINGH                
	What is election to Hockey India without any controversy? This time, with a new date  July 28  followed a fresh controversy. And this one puts the Indian Olympic Association in a funny situation. With the elections just round the corner, there has appeared a potential roadblock. What happened is this.         
	When the elections were announced, it came with the advisory that the process would be conducted in strict adherence to Union ministry of sports guidelines regarding tenure regulations in national sports federations.         
	Now there are only two contestants for the post of president, Pargat Singh and Vidya Stokes. While Pargat has openly questioned Suresh Kalmadis bona fides, Stokes is seen as someone who the IOA president would rather work with.         
	But Stokes had the fine print read to her by the MoS which has reminded Hockey India that the no objection certificate, that is, its go ahead for the elections, was conditional to the federation implementing the tenure guidelines in letter and spirit.         
	Stokess age disqualifies her from the race for president in the Sports ministry guidelines, the veteran administrator being over the 70-year age limit. She is, in fact, 83.         
	There was no chance that Stokes, the interim president by the way, was going to take all this lying down and, to be sure, she has gone against the ministry and had her nomination accepted by Justice R.C. Chopra, the Hockey India observer for the elections.         
	Their argument: being a self-governing society sanctioned by the law of the land, Hockey India should be allowed to conduct its affairs at its own discretion.         
	Not only that, in its bid to make sure there is no interference from the sports ministry, Hockey India, while okaying Stokess candidature, also declared that it did not need government grants or aid to function. For starters, that means it would no longer have access to Sports Authority of India facilities for training and practice. To reject governmental assistance is a serious step; now one has to see how it all ends.         
	If it is the sports ministrys will that prevails, Pargat would have become president uncontested.         
	That, however, is something unlikely to happen. At the moment we can only pray that there are no further postponements of the date and hope that it is a clear picture that emerges when the final vote is counted.         
	But fresh disruptions are likely and, maybe, we will have to start all over again as Indian hockey tries to break out of the rut it is stuck in.

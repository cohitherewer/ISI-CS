The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England win by one wicket
                                                                                                                       7                                      England win by one wicket
                      
	Manchester: England beat Australia by one wicket Sunday to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the one-day International series.         
	Tim Bresnan hit the winning runs at Old Trafford with five balls to spare in the third of five one-day matches. It was Englands first ODI series win over Australia since 1997.         
	Andrew Strauss scored 87 to lead England to 214-9, in reply to Australias 212 all out. Doug Bollinger finished with 3-20 and Shaun Tait got 3-28 for Australia.         
	England appeared to be heading for a comfortable win at 184-3 before collapsing to 203-9.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss hit 87 from 121 balls, including eight fours, and Paul Collingwood made 40 from 61 balls, including one six and one four.         
	Earlier Australia faltered from 75-0 to 212 all out.         
	Graeme Swann took 4/37 and James Anderson 3-22, while opener Shane Watson was Australias top scorer with 61 from 76 balls, including two sixes and five fours.         
	England won the toss, for the first time in the series, and Strauss chose to field. The decision was vindicated as Australia faded from an excellent position for the third consecutive ODI, with batsmen again squandering promising starts. After some initially cautious batting, Australia went after Bresnan and scored 18 from the eighth over.

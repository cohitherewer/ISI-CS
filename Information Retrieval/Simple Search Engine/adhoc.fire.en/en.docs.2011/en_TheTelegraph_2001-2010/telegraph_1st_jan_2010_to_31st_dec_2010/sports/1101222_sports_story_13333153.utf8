The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Everton deny City a spot at the top
                                                                                                                       7                                      Everton deny City a spot at the top
                      
	Manchester: Evertons surprise 2-1 victory denied Manchester City the chance to celebrate Carlos Tevezs decision to stay at Eastlands by moving to the top of the Premier League.         
	David Moyes side took a two-goal lead through Tim Cahill and Leighton Baines inside 20 minutes.         
	City pulled one back through Phil Jagielkas own goal after Everton striker Victor Anichebe was sent off with an hour gone, and though the hosts pushed hard for an equaliser, they found Evertons defence and their goalkeeper Tim Howard in commanding form.         
	Hes been the man not just this season but all the other seasons as well, Cahill said of Howard. Theres times in games when we look to him to get us out of it and tonight he did that.         
	City defender Kolo Toure was sent off in added time for a second booking in quick succession. City therefore missed the chance to be top of the table at Christmas for the first time since 1929, meaning that honour goes to rival Manchester United, the team that lead Arsenal by two points.         
	Roberto Mancinis City stand third, behind the Gunners on goal difference.         
	Everton moves up to 14th after only their fourth league win of the season, and second away from home.         
	City started the game in high spirits after the announcement that Tevez had settled his differences with the club and withdrawn his threat to leave.         
	Everton had not won since the end of October, but, boosted by a three-game winning streak at Eastlands, they began the game full of confidence and took the lead in the fourth minute.         
	Everton ended a run of seven winless matches and Moyes believes his team must replicate this performance to move up the table. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Double for Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Double for Blues
                      
	London: Chelsea overcame a resilient Portsmouth to win a dramatic FA Cup final 1-0 at Wembley Stadium on Saturday and achieve their first League and Cup Double.         
	Didier Drogba got the winner with a 59th minute free-kick after they hit the woodwork five times in the first half and Frank Lampard missed a late penalty.         
	In an astonishing match of twists and turns, Kevin-Prince Boateng, who scored from the spot in the semi-final at Wembley, saw his 56th minute penalty saved. The triumph gave the west London side a second straight FA Cup final victory, after they beat Everton last season, and their third success in four seasons.         
	Although the newly-crowned Premier League champions dominated relegated Portsmouth in the opening half, they were thwarted on five occasions when Drogba (twice), Frank Lampard, Salomon Kalou and John Terry all hit the bar or post.         
	Despite that, Portsmouths incredibly vociferous fans made the greater noise inside the sun-drenched stadium and stayed to applaud their side even after defeat.         
	The match turned Chelseas way when Boatengs penalty, awarded after substitute Juliano Belletti brought down Aruna Dindane, was saved by Petr Cechs legs.         
	Drogba fired home a 25-metre free-kick three minutes that went in off the inside of a post to maintain his record of scoring in all six competitive matches he has played for Chelsea at Wembley  three semi-finals and three FA Cup finals.         
	Lampard fired wide from the spot in the 88th minute after Michael Brown had clattered into him. (REUTERS)

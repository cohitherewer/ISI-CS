The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must get basics right: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Must get basics right: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Fresh from the success of leading the Chennai Super Kings to glory in the Champions League T20, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni shifted his focus to the India-Australia series, which starts here on Friday.         
	Speaking at a media conference on the eve of the match, Dhoni refused to believe that the series is basically a Dhoni vs Ricky Ponting affair.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The key to success         
	Test cricket is about doing well in sessions. The team that wins more sessions in the last couple of days, when the ball turns and bounces as well, will have success. Also there is reverse swing factor It might become the deciding factor.         
	On how the Indians would tackle short deliveries         
	The solution is simple. If you cant hook or pull, its better you leave those deliveries.         
	If it is a Dhoni versus Ponting affair         
	I dont believe that its a captain versus captain battle. The reason that India have done well against Australia in the recent times is the fact that we played well as a team. As a captain, you take a few important decisions But at the end of the day, its the batsmen and the bowlers who win you matches.         
	On Australia         
	They are a very competitive unit. But over the years, we have played a lot against the Aussies. The boys know exactly what to expect and can react accordingly. Normally, the strategy is decided after analysing the conditions. However, the basic strategy remains the same.         
	On his Chennai Super Kings teammates Mike Hussey and Doug Bollinger         
	The friendship remains off the pitch. You do not have to be rude or rough on the field. They are nice guys and we really gelled well while playing in the IPL. They are tough opponents and I am quite fond of them.         
	The wicket         
	The ball might just skid on to the batsman when the fast bowlers bowl.         
	Whether rankings are important         
	Rankings are not everything The process of preparation and execution of plans is far more important. Also, you need to do the basics right. I believe that if you do most things correctly, rankings will be taken care of.

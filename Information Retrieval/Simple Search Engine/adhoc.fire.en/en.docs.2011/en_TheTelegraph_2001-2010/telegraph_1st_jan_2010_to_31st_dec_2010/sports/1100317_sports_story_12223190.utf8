The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barca to rely on Messis genius
                                                                                                                       7                                        Barca to rely on Messis genius
                  Messi                     
	Barcelona: FC Barcelona will be relying on Lionel Messis impressive scoring form against Stuttgart on Wednesday in the second leg of the Champions League knock-out round.         
	Barcelona earned a 1-1 draw in the first leg three weeks ago. But the European champions have sputtered lately and have had to rely on Messi, who has scored their last six league goals to keep the team at the top of the standings with Real Madrid.         
	Zlatan Ibrahimovic hasnt scored since the match against Stuttgart, while Thierry Henry has only three goals this season as the France striker has fallen out of favour with coach Pep Guardiola.         
	Messi has scored 29 goals in all competitions. Hes the best in the world. What he brings with his talent puts him above, said goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who has also stood out while Barcelonas strikers havent been able to find the net. Messi can become the best player in history.         
	Henrys impressive display in Sundays 3-0 win over Valencia does provide some relief inside Barcelonas locker room. When Henry is motivated, he brings a lot to the team, assistant coach Tito Vilanova said.         
	Barcelona have beaten German opponents eight straight times at the Camp Nou, and have won 15 times after an away-leg draw. Stuttgart have never gone past this phase of the competition, and lost 3-1 on their previous visit to Barcelona in 2007.         
	Barcelona do not often take competitors lightly, especially after a home loss to Russian club Rubin Kazan earlier this season.         
	Messi will likely have full support, too, as only captain Carles Puyol remains questionable after missing Sundays 3-0 win over Valencia with back pain. Midfielder Seydou Keita remains sidelined by a leg injury. Bayern Munich were the last German club to win at the Camp Nou  in 1998.         
	Meanwhile, Bordeaux need to improve on their disappointing domestic form when they host Olympiakos in a bid to reach the quarter finals for the first time since 1988.         
	Laurent Blancs side are protecting a 1-0 lead in the second leg but they havent won a match since the February 23 victory against the Greek side.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A mixed day for Leander 
                                                                                                                       7                                      A mixed day for Leander 
                      
	Melbourne: Leander Paes had a bitter-sweet experience at the Australian Open with the Indian tennis ace sailing into the semi-finals of mixed doubles but crashing out of mens doubles event here on Wednesday.         
	The Australian Open title continued to elude the mens doubles specialist as he and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded third, went down 3-6, 4-6 to unseeded Croat-Serb combination of Ivo Karlovic and Dusan Vemic at the Melbourne Park.         
	The Indian derived some solace later in the day when he partnered Zimbabwean Cara Black to clear their semifinal passage in the mixed doubles event.         
	The top-seeded pair defeated eight seeds Elena Vesnina of Russia and Israels Andy Ram 6-4, 6-3 in the quarter finals.         
	They will next take on seventh seed pair of American Lisa Raymond and Wesley Moodie of South Africa.         
	Paes has won all other three Grand Slam titles but has never won an Australian Open mens doubles trophy.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Bindra happy with comeback scores
  - Best of 596 shot in Luxembourg meet       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhinav Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: Abhinav Bindra, who shot a 596 and a 595 on his return to competitive action, a fortnight ago, is very happy with the scores totalled in Luxembourg.         
	Indeed, yes, Im very happy... Id shot a 596 en route to gold in Beijing and, frankly, I didnt expect to score that much coming off a 16-month break, Indias solitary individual gold medallist in the Olympics, told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Back home (Bindra Farm on the Zirakpur-Patiala Road, near Chandigarh) after the two events in Belgium, held between December 16-19, Abhinav added: I finished fourth in both competitions, but as I told you earlier this month, Im aiming to first get back into groove... To get used to the competitive arena... That being so, I have no complaints over where I finished...         
	Abhinav went off competitions immediately after the Beijing Olympics and returned only after an inner voice persuaded him to.         
	The field was strong in both events... The best Russian shooters, whore preparing for the European Championships, were there... Also, quite a few others whod competed in Beijing... Theres a big difference between training and actually taking part in a competition... Im pleased with the way I coped with things, Abhinav pointed out.         
	Despite being the world and Olympic champion in the 10m rifle, had he been nervous on his comeback?         
	Abhinav laughed before replying: Look, one is nervous before any competition... I wouldnt say I was more nervous than usual... I was quite relaxed... Ill be happy if 595 is my worst in a competition... A 597 would be great...         
	Had the world of shooting seen a change in the past 16 months?         
	Abhinav was quick to answer: If anything, it has become much more competitive... Everyones training and aiming to reach the next level.         
	The ace marksman intends returning to Europe, specifically Germany, around the middle of January.         
	In preparing for the bigger events ahead (the World Championships and the Commonwealth Games, in 2010) I need to constantly shoot in a highly competitive environment... Ive discussed it with our new national coach (Stanislav Lapidus) and hes absolutely in agreement, Abhinav said.         
	Hopefully, the iconic shooter wont have to prove his worth at some trial or the other, conducted by the National Rifle Association of India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney now as good as Ronaldinho: Beckham
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney now as good as Ronaldinho: Beckham
                      
	Milan: In-form Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is now as good as Brazilian Ronaldinho, AC Milans David Beckham said as he prepared to meet his former club in the Champions League.         
	Tuesdays last-16 first-leg match at the San Siro will be an emotional occasion for Beckham, who joined United as a youngster and won the 1999 Champions League there before leaving in 2003.         
	Its one of the biggest games for me personally. But the most important thing is the team going through and beating United which I hope we do, Beckham said.         
	United are on fire, theyre playing well. Wayne is scoring goals like he can. Its going to be a tough game.         
	Asked if Rooney was now comparable to twice world player of the year and Milan team mate Ronaldinho, Beckham said: Without a doubt, Ive always said Wayne is one of the best goalscorers in football. Hes proving that and he is at a great club like Manchester United so hes doing what he does best  scoring goals.         
	Beckham, not assured of a start on Tuesday, came on as a substitute in Milans patchy 3-2 Serie A victory over Udinese on Friday which ended a run of four games without a win.         
	Despite the retirement of Paolo Maldini and the sale of Kaka to Real Madrid, Beckham still believes underdogs Milan can eliminate United in his first clash against Alex Fergusons men.         
	Obviously there are a couple of players not here ... but the team is just the same, theyve got this great team spirit within the squad and thats definitely not changed, he said, who is on his second loan spell at Milan from Los Angeles Galaxy..

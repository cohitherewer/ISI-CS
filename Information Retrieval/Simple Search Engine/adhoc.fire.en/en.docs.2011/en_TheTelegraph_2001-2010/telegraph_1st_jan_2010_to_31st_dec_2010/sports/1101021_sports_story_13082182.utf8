The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kohli steals the show
                                                                                                                       7                                        Kohli steals the show
 - Yuvraj hits form as India win second ODI by 5 wickets            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR              Virat Kohli after his century during the second one-day International, against Australia,   in Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday. (PTI)                            
	Visakhapatnam: Young batsmen, young legs in the field, young side.         
	Young was the most heard word as Indian crickets Gen X gave us a whiff of the future.         
	Undaunted by the 290-run target, the youngsters displayed talent and assurance in carving out a convincing five-wicket victory in the second match of the Airtel Cup.         
	If Australia displayed resilience as well as Cameron Whites raw power to recover from a disastrous start, India banked on a team effort culminating in Virat Kohlis superb 118 off 121 balls.         
	Suresh Raina (71 not out off 47 balls) stayed till the end to guide the side through while Saurabh Tiwarys (12 not out off 17 balls) debut will remain etched in his memory.         
	Two consecutive fours off Mitchell Starc by the Jharkhand batsman sealed the win with seven balls remaining.         
	Everyone chipped in when it mattered. Yuvraj Singh showed during his 58 off 87 balls that he is determined to put the disappointments behind in the lead-up to the World Cup.         
	Focused and disciplined, he showed all the traits needed to build an innings until a slower ball from Clint McKay cut short his promising innings.         
	But his 137-run stand in 152 balls with Kohli, after the departure of the two openers, had given a direction to the chase. While Kohli stepped on the gas pedal, Yuvraj played the senior pros role to perfection by rotating the strike.         
	Kohli has often failed to match his reputation of being matured and level-headed.         
	On Wednesday, though, he proved he could be trusted upon in trying circumstances.         
	Coming in at 35 for two, he batted with perfection and never allowed the bowlers to dictate terms.         
	Battling cramps, he was forced to use a runner in the later part of his innings, but that didnt stop his run flow.         
	There were 11 fours and a six in his innings.         
	The 21-year-old looked classy and calm in getting to his third one-day hundred before falling to a tired-looking shot.         
	When Cameron Whites 89 not out off 49 balls overshadowed a determined unbeaten 111 from Michael Clarke, it looked like the visitors had wrested the psychological edge.         
	The stand-in captains return to form after a disastrous Test series will add further fuel to speculation on Ricky Pontings future.         
	White was brutal against the inexperienced Vinay Kumar, whose last two overs during the close yielded 40 runs.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men had everything going in their favour until the 45th over when White blazed away.         
	The Australian Twenty20 vice-captain scored his last 64 runs off only 21 balls as the final five overs of their innings produced 84, including six fours and seven sixes.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder was solely responsible for spoiling Ashish Nehra and Praveen Kumars figures.         
	Whites savage attack on the bowlers was set up after Clarke and Michael Husseys (69) 144-run partnership for the third wicket consolidated the innings.         
	The unbroken 149 runs for the fourth wicket dashed Indias hopes of restricting them to below 250.         
	Dhoni finally won a toss and the decision to field was influenced by the dew factor.         
	While Shikhar Dhawan and Tiwary made their debut for India, Starc and John Hastings were handed the Australian limited-overs caps.         
	Australia surprised by leaving out David Warner as Shaun Marsh and Tim Paine struggled against the discipline and accuracy of Praveen and Nehra.         
	Nehra, who had figures of 4-1-3-2 in his first spell, made life difficult for them pitching the ball just short of that driving length, while Praveen impressed with his variation of pace and movement.         
	Marsh lasted just 11 balls before dragging one on to his stumps and Paine was forced into a suicidal dismissal trying to break the shackles.         
	He stepped out, failed to reach the pitch of the ball and holed out to mid on.         
	At 16 for two in the eighth over, it looked like the visitors were destined to their fate.         
	Clarke and Hussey then started the repair job with controlled aggression. While Clarke mainly concentrated on singles, Hussey used the long handle well.         
	The foundation was laid for White to deal in boundaries and sixes. But that proved too little in the end.

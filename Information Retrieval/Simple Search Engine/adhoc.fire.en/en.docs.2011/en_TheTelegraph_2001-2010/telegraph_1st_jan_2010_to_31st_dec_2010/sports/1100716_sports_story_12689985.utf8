The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sanath loses SLC contract
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sanath loses SLC contract
                      
	Colombo: Veteran all-rounder Sanath Jayasuriya has been denied a central contract by Sri Lanka Cricket while retiring spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan finds his name in the 20-member players list issued for the current year.         
	Jayasuriya, a veteran of 110 Tests and 444 ODIs, has been witnessing a slump in his performance for quite sometime and possesses an average of less than three runs in the last six Twenty20 matches he played for his country.         
	If that was not enough, in his last six ODIs, Jayasuriyas highest score was 31.         
	We had discussions over the last few weeks with senior players, Sri Lanka Cricket, selectors and team management to try and put a value on the national contracts. In that regard we decided we will try and reduce the number of national contracted players to 20 from 30. We felt that having that number of players will give us the cream to be signed up on a contract for the national squad, chairman of selectors Aravinda de Silva said.         
	The contracts were worked out on the previous years performances and in Sanaths (Jayasuriya) case, since he had not performed up to expectations, we decided to leave him out. We also allowed him to go to England and play some County cricket to see how he performs. As Ive said before we havent let either Chaminda Vaas or Muralidharan out of our minds for the World Cup, de Silva added.         
	However, the 41-year-old prolific left-hander had recently stated that he would like to play next years World Cup in the sub-continent before finally calling it quits.         
	The selectors, meanwhile, retained Muralidharan in the contract even though the champion spinner had already announced that he retire from Tests after the opening Test against India, starting Sunday, in Galle.         
	To be fair to Murali, he mentioned to us that we could leave him out of the contract and consider him only for the one-dayers if we require him. I have told him that we definitely require him for the World Cup, de Silva said.         
	The SLC, however, included two newcomers  off-spinner Suraj Randiv and batsman Dinesh Chandimal  in the contracts list and have placed the duo in Category Six.         
	Altogether, there are six categories under which players have been offered contracts. Captain Kumar Sangakkara, Muralidharan, Mahela Jayawardene, Tillekaratne Dilshan and Thilan Samaraweera occupy the top category.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chowrasia is tied 2nd
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chowrasia is tied 2nd
                      
	Rabat: S.S.P Chowrasias late birdie binge catapulted him to the tied second place after his sparkling opening round of six-under 67 in the Trophee Hassan II golf meet here.         
	Playing in the tougher Red course at Royal Golf Dar Es Salam, the Calcutta-pro birdied the five of his last seven holes to join Irelands Peter Lawrie, Scot Stephen Gallacher, Italian Francesco Molinari, Argentinas Ricardo Gonzalez and Paraguays Fabrizio Zanotti who were just one shot behind Nick Dougherty.         
	Fellow Indian Shiv Kapur, who played in the relatively easier Blue course, carded five-under 67 to lie tied eighth.         
	Chowrasia bogeyed the opening hole but shrugged off the setback sinking birdies on the fourth, seventh and eighth holes to lie three-under at the turn.         
	The par-four 11th hole cost him a shot but there was no more looking back as the diminutive Indian set alight the course, reeling off birdies on the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 18th holes.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: Lalit Modi, the suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman, would have to appear before the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s disciplinary committee for a hearing on July 16 after being served summons to that effect on Thursday.         
	Yes, we have received summons, Modis legal counsel Mehmood Abdi said.         
	Modi has been charged with various irregularities in the IPL and was suspended from all posts in the BCCI on April 26.         
	The three-member disciplinary committee comprises Chirayu Amin, a BCCI vice-president and also the interim IPL chairman, BJP leader and Delhi District Cricket Association head Arun Jaitley, and Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union minister and president of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association.         
	The BCCI, during its Special General Meeting on July 3, also decided to file criminal and civil charges against Modi for causing huge financial losses and damaging its reputation.         
	Meanwhile, Modi took the first legal step in his fight against the BCCI, filing a case in the Bombay High Court on Thursday seeking the squashing of his suspension and the disciplinary proceedings against him.         
	We filed a writ petition today (Thursday). The Court has to fix a date for the hearing, Abdi said.         
	In his petition, Modi also appealed to the Court to appoint a mutually acceptable and independent person or panel to consider his replies to the BCCIs three showcause notices.

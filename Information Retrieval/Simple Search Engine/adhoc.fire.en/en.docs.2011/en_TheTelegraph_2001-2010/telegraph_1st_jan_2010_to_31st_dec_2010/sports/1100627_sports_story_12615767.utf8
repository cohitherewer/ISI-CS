The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suarez bends it Uruguays way
                                                                                                                       7                                      Suarez bends it Uruguays way

	Ultimately this was a match for Uruguay to win, or lose. Wherever South Korea might have reached in 2002 and however far they might have come this time in South Africa, the Park Ji-sungs were always going to be the underdogs.         
	Uruguays pedigree is backed up by two world titles and propped up by a defence which had yet to concede.         
	But Lee Chung-yongs header showed that the goalkeeper is not exactly where their resistance is the strongest.         
	Rather, what bewildered me was the way the Uruguayans went about their business on Saturday before finally winning 2-1.         
	This was a team that had completed the group matches with some authority, holding the French and beating hosts South Africa 3-0 before rounding off their league engagements with a narrow but convincing defeat of Mexico.         
	So, I expected them to come out all guns blazing in their knockout match but all I got to see was a team whose game fluctuated between good to the downright pedestrian.         
	They are the ones advancing to the quarter finals but, to be fair to the South Koreans, they were not the runaway winners I thought they would be before the match began.                   Luiz Suarez (circled) bends in the winner for Uruguay, during their World Cup second-round tie against South Korea, in Port Elizabeth, on Saturday. (AP)       
	It began well for them for sure. Diego Forlan was going to be the Uruguayans man of the moment and, when he played that most measured of passes into the box for Luis Suarez to hit home, I thought that the time had come for the Atletico Madrid striker to assert himself on the world stage.         
	But a cameo was all that their star could manage in a game whose plot the Uruguayans appeared to have lost for the better part of the hour between scoring in the eighth minute and conceding in the 68th.         
	Forlan was nowhere to be seen and the same is true for the entire team except, of course, for the lively Suarez who executed the most brilliant of finishes with his second goal of the match to send his team into the last eight.         
	One would have expected the Uruguayans to consolidate, build, create and press for more after going into the lead so early in the match.         
	But they just seemed content to sit back and devote their energies to foiling their opponents.         
	This brings us to the South Koreans.         
	Like I said, they were always going to be the second favourites against the Uruguayans. It is to their credit that they walked into the tunnel after the final whistle not so much beaten as unfortunate.         
	After conceding the early goal, I imagined they would be outplayed and out thought by the Forlans but all they lacked in retrospect was a little luck. Had Park Chu-youngs beauty of a freekick in the fourth minute gone in instead of hitting the upright, the result could have been a lot different.         
	Or, if goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryung had not acted like a complete novice and bungled on what was no more than a routine intervention, it could be an even first half and all to play for in the second session.         
	Playing, as the Koreans did, an open game in a high-pressure match is good football but bad strategy when you dont have the luxury of smart playmakers and surefire winners in your ranks.         
	The quality in the final ball was lacking even in the second half when the Koreans took the field looking more determined and played with greater purpose.         
	But with the scores tied, it looked like anybodys game.         
	Cup football, however, is always about quality and the Uruguayans got the touch of class they so desperately lacked for the greater part of the match when the ball from Forlans corner fell for Suarez and the Ajax captain turned to unleash the perfect curling ball into the right corner of the Korean goal. That was the 79th minute.         
	In pouring rain, the Koreans tried with all they could for the remaining 10 minutes or so for the equaliser which would take the match into extra time, but it just was not to be.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi: Enter Group Captain Sachin Tendulkar.         
	The cricketing icon will don the Indian Air Force blues shortly after being conferred the rank of honorary group captain  equivalent to a captain in the Navy and a colonel in the army.         
	Kapil Dev was the last cricketer to have donned the military uniform. The military top-brass deemed, however, that the yesteryear all-rounder was fit only for the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel, a notch below the rank to be conferred on Sachin.         
	The military believes it knows how to rank its stars. Ranking is not to be confused with rating.         
	Sachin will be the first sportsperson to be conferred the honorary rank by the IAF. The IAF has honoured 21 others with J.R.D. Tata and the Raja of Patiala being some of the names on the list.         
	The last time it conferred an honorary rank was on industrialist Vijaypat Singhania. It is indeed a great honour that I have been considered for the honorary rank of group captain in the Indian Air Force.         
	As an Indian, I am very proud to be associated with this dynamic force and I shall do my very best to be a brand ambassador for the IAF, an air force statement quoted Sachin as saying. Sachin will be conferred the honour by President Pratibha Patil.

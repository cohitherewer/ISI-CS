                                                                                                                       7                                      Punjab and Goa begin with wins 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: An injury-time strike by the substitute Cavin Lobo helped Goa to edge past Karnataka by a solitary goal in their opening quarter final league encounter played at the Salt lake Stadium, here on Thursday.         
	Both the teams failed to break the deadlock as stalemate prevailed over the first 45 minutes.         
	A much better performance was expected from the reigning champions in the second half, but their casual approach and lack of combination in the midfield certainly spoiled the day before substitute Cavin Lobo scored the winner in the injury time.         
	Cavin replaced Milagres Gonsalves in the 55th minute and Lobo finally broke the jinx with a clean strike from the top of the box to give his side a winning start to their Santosh Trophy campaign.         
	In the second match, Punjab continued their unbeaten streak and defeated Services 1-0.

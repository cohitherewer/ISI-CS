                                                                                                                       7                                      No captain named
                      
	Karachi: Two days after taking disciplinary action against seven top players, the Pakistan Cricket Board Friday announced a 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup but did not name the captain of the side.         
	Speculation is high that all-rounder Abdul Razzaq or opener Salman Butt could be handed over the reins of the team.         
	Despite insistence, chief selector Mohsin Khan did not reveal why the squad was announced without a captain.         
	The Squad: Mohammed Hafeez, Salman Butt, Khalid Latif, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Umar Akmal, Abdul Razzaq, Yasir Arafat, Kamran Akmal, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Aamer, Umar Gul, Hammad Azam.         
	Reserves: Mohammed Sami, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Naved Yasin, Raza Hasan, Shahzaib Hasan           (PTI)

	A day after an adoring welcome from fans at the Masters and a triumphant return to golf, Tiger Woods returned to Augusta National for the second round Friday and quickly found himself in the middle of something much less warm and fuzzy: a golf tournament. Woodss appearance on the first tee on Friday was greeted by a more muted crowd, showing this was not the first day of his comeback anymore. An overnight rainstorm cleared the troublesome rain, replaced by a bright blue sky and cooler temperatures, but Augusta National also wore a tougher setup and still-gusty winds.         
	Woods found out quickly about the rounds challenges. He sprayed his first tee shot into the trees and found himself scrambling for par on the first hole.         
	After 10 holes, Woods remained where he started the day, at 4 under and four shots back of leader Lee Westwood, who surged to minus-8 with an eagle on the par-5 No. 2 and a birdie on No. 3. Fred Couples, Ricky Barnes and Ian Poulter were at minus-6.         
	Woods had one birdie and one bogey and saved pars out of the trees and a bunker. He was holding his round together despite some leaks, playing without the swagger that marked the second half of his first round, in which he charged close to the leaders with two eagles.         
	Couples seems to be marching steadily through his round after an early birdie, collecting mostly pars through eight holes until a bogey on No. 9 dropped him into a tie with Barnes, who has two early birdies on his front nine. Poulter joined them after a birdie on No. 8 and was minus-5 through 10. Westwoods eagle vaulted him past all of them on the second hole by sticking his approach shot within two feet of the hole.         
	For his birdie on No. 2, Woods flew his second shot past the green, but chipped up inside two feet and made the putt. On the third hole, a par 4, he hit a perfect tee shot and had about 15 feet for birdie but that putt rolled just off the hole, breaking left in the last foot.         
	On his way to the third tee, he smiled broadly and shook hands with a young girl, who was maybe 5 years old, as she sat atop her fathers shoulders alongside the restraining ropes in the crosswalk leading to the tee.         
	On the 4th, a par 3, he was in trouble right away. His tee shot was left of a bunker on the left of the green and had him stuck in a grassy area between the left bunker and a large grandstand. Woods had little green space to land the ball. He pitched to within eight feet but missed to the right of the hole for bogey. He saved par on No. 5 from a greenside bunker and had a monstrously long birdie putt on No. 6, which he lagged within a few inches. He missed some makeable putts, including one for birdie on No. 10 that left him hanging his head.         
	On Thursday, Woods had an impressive return to competitive golf after a five-month layoff, shooting a 4-under 68, his best first round ever at the Masters. It was his first appearance in a tournament since November, when a car accident led to revelations about a string of extramarital affairs and turned public perception of him upside-down.         
	The presence of Woods back in top form didnt faze Couples, one of Woodss practice round partners early in the week. Couples blazed to a spectacular first-round 66 full of birdies and the trademark Couples cool that marked his heyday in the 1990s. At 50, though, Couples had already embarked on his Championship Tour days and few expected to see him walking triumphantly down the Masters fairways.         
	The low scores of the first round, abetted by surprisingly easy pin placements, were expected to be less common in the second, as officials constructed a tougher setup. Although the weather was markedly improved, winds were expected to gust. But the rain and pin-bending gusts of the first round are not in the forecast for the rest of the tournament.         
	Tom Watson, who shot a thrilling first-round 68 at age 60, had an adventurous start to his round. He started with a bogey on No. 1 but bounced back quickly with a birdie on No. 2, only to bogey again on No. 3. Then he birdied No. 4 to stay at minus-5.

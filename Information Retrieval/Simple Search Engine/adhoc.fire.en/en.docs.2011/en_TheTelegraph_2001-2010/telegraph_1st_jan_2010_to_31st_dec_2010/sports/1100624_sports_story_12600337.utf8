The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians hope to end jinx
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians hope to end jinx
                      
	Dambulla: India will aim to set right their woeful record in ODI finals and end a 15-year-old jinx when they take on familiar foes Sri Lanka in the final of the Asia Cup here on Thursday.         
	Having been humbled by a dominant Sri Lanka in the last match, India will also seek to avenge Tuesdays defeat at the Rangiri International Stadium where they suffered a seven-wicket defeat.         
	India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni struggled to explain the humiliating loss but the fact remains that India were completely outclassed by the Lankans.         
	If India dont get their act together, they could once again be crushed by Kumar Sangakkaras men who come into the final with their nose clearly ahead after an emphatic win. That they have trounced India in three ODI finals since 2008, besides the victory in the World Twenty20, indicates that the inspired Lankans would be a hard bunch to be beat even if Harbhajan Singh and Ashish Nehra return.         
	Dhoni would also hope to end a 15-year title drought that followed Indias last Asia Cup triumph in Sharjah in 1995.

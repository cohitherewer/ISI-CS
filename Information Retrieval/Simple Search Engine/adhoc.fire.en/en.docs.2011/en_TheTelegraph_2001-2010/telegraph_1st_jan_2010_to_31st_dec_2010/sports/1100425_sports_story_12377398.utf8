            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: They are among the nations best but they were far from their best on the inaugural day of the 30th Senior National Archery Championships (recurve and compound), marked as it was by delayed start, tight schedule and an energy-sapping day.         
	However, it was a business-like start with 299 archers from 32 affiliated units of the Archery Association of India (AAI), lining up in batches of 41 to hit the bulls eye during the ranking rounds under a blazing sun.         
	Defending champions ( recurve) Rahul Banerjee and Deepika Kumari, Jayanta Talukdar, Dola Banerjee had an off day by their own lofty standards but were confident of peaking when the Olympic Round that starts Monday.         
	It was just not my day. Had some shooting problem but nothing much to worry, said Rahul. Talukdar shared his views, adding that despite a below par 90m, he was okay with his 70 m show.         
	L. Murthy, director of shooting, AAI, said the official results will be declared only after the conclusion of the ranking round Sunday since many events could not be completed Saturday owing to late arrival of many teams.

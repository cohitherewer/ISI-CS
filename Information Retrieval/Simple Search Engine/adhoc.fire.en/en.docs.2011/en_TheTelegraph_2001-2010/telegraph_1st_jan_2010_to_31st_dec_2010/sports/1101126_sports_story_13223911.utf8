            A STAFF REPORTER                                Mohun Bagan captain Ishfaq Ahmed (right) shares a laugh with Edeh Chidi after a practice session, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: Trevor Morgan has faced it all. The British coach knows the pressure of an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan tie and came out with flying colours in the Federation Cup final earlier this year. But he understands bygones are bygones and thus kept his foot firmly rooted before Fridays virtual CFL decider.         
	Morgan felt theres not much to differentiate between the two sides and the team, which plays fluent football, will have a chance to win. Theres absolutely no difference between the two teams. So theres no advantage to us. It will be an open game tomorrow and it will be exciting, Morgan said.         
	The East Bengal coach refused to completely negate the pressure of a derby match and hoped it didnt get to his players. The only pressure tomorrow is that its a derby game. I think that puts more on it than usual. We have to take our game to them and well see what happens, he said.         
	Having put East Bengal on an upswing from the beginning of the season, the Brit has created a niche about his style of coaching and managing players. While he took responsibility for his teams performance after every game, he, at the same time, tried to feel the emotions involved around the sport in this part of the country. I feel personally responsible for the millions of peoples happiness tomorrow. I have to live with that, he said.         
	Either a draw or a win on Friday will almost assure East Bengal of this years CFL title, but Morgan is not taking things easy. A point will be good for us tomorrow. But I am not saying we are aiming for a draw. One point is not good for Mohun Bagan because it leaves us in the same position and we have one game to go. They really have to win the game. But we have got no negative thoughts in our mind at all. Every thought that I have, every thought that the players have are positive about winning tomorrows game, he said.         
	Morgan refused to pick any particular Bagan player as threat but sounded a general concern over the three Bagan foreigners. The three foreign players (Barreto, Chidi and Murithala) are a threat to anybody. They are all creative players. They have played in the last game in the Federation Cup (final). So, Its up to us how we deal with them, he said.         
	Bagan coach Stanley Rozario, on the other hand, wanted to move on from the Federation Cup loss and believed Fridays match will be played at a different level.         
	We couldnt get Edeh Chidis services for full 90 minutes in Federation Cup final and, in Platinum Jubilee match, most of the key players didnt play. So, Fridays match will be the first with full team in front of home crowd and I can tell you the boys are confident and ready for the challenge, Rozario said.

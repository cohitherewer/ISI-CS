The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin feat seems like Beamons, says Sunny
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin feat seems like Beamons, says Sunny
                      
	New Delhi: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels that Sachin Tendulkars world record of 50 Test centuries can only be compared to legendary American long jumper Bob Beamons record-setting leap at the 1968 Mexico Olympics which stayed put for 23 years.         
	Well, its such a record that you can only compare it with Bob Beamons long jump world record set in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico.         
	At that time it seemed like it would never be broken. Tendulkars 50 Test centuries is one such record which seems like it never will be surpassed, Gavaskar said.         
	However, Gavaskar who was the first Test cricketer to surpass 10,000 runs, feels that Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only one among current cricketers who has a realistic chance of getting close to 50 Test centuries.         
	Ponting is a couple of years younger and if he can hit a purple patch, one never knows.         
	Still 11 Test centuries is not easy. You have to score in every third Test match you play, Gavaskar said.         
	When asked if he has found Sachin doing anything differently, Gavaskar said, He has always adjusted his game according to situations. May be he changed his backlift a bit.         
	Its like a golfer adjusting his swing for optimum result.         
	A technician-par excellence himself, Gavaskar also gave a technical reason as to why Tendulkar has been in brilliant form of late.         
	From what I have watched, he was opening his left shoulder at the time of the bowlers delivery. He was moving across and was being adjudged leg-before a few times. He is not opening his left shoulder any more, he said.         
	When everyone in India was fretting over when Sachin would reach his 50th hundred, Gavaskar had advised him to remain cool.         
	Sachin needs no advice... I mean, hes already got 49 Test hundreds... This isnt the first time that hes in a situation where everybody is waiting for that one hundred, Gavaskar had said last month after Sachins dismissal for 61, versus New Zealand in Nagpur.         
	The 50th hundred will come when it is destined to... Surely, somebody with Sachins experience wont be nervous...         
	Gavaskars words have proved to be prophetic.           (AGENCIES)

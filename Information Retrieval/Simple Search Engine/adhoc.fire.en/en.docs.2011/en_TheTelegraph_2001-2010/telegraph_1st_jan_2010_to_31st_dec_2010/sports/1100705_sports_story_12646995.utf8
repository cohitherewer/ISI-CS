The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa owes it to upbringing
                                                                                                                       7                                        Villa owes it to upbringing
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            David Villa (left) and Cesc Fabregas celebrate after the former scored against Paraguay, in Johannesburg. (Reuters)                           
	Johannesburg: His great grandfather was called Trotsky. His grandmother was known as Freedom. David Villas never-say-die attitude and his commitment to hard work comes from his upbringing in the Austirian village of Tuilla, where his family worked in the mines.         
	On Saturday night at the Ellis Park, after scoring the match-winner against Paraguay in the quarter finals, Villa said it was his mining background that has taught him to be tenacious and make sacrifice to get goals, as reported in Sundays Late City edition.         
	I have come from a place which is full of miners and struggling people, said Villa. Without sacrifice and love for your work and fighting qualities, it is impossible to reach the highest level.         
	If football was just talent, then we would have seen many more players coming up. But I have noticed that those who are less talented but ready to make sacrifices sometimes do better in life.         
	Asked the secret behind scoring in almost every match of the World Cup so far, Villa said he considered getting goals was his main job.         
	All my life I have played as a striker thinking about goals. Every time I pick up the ball, even when I am back in my own half, I look for the quickest way to go towards the rival goal. All my friends, who have played against me, say that I make things uncomfortable for them whenever I have the ball, said the Barcelona striker.         
	Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque is under fire at the moment for his decision to continue with off-form Fernando Torres but Villa stood firmly behind his coach and the striking partner.         
	I think it is highly unfair to criticise Torres, Villa felt.         
	We have all seen him often doing a sensational job on the pitch. I am not against the argument that the most deserving people should play. At the same time, we have to allow people to get into their rhythm. In the next match against Germany, wait for Torres to make a thumping comeback, said Villa.         
	Despite being the leading scorer, Villa thinks Xavi is the brain behind Spains success in the current World Cup. The baton is in the hands of Xavi. He is leading the Spanish campaign here.         
	This is basically a team game. I am leading the attacks, some other people are taking care of the defence. As a striker what I do is to try and help the team as much as possible. But in the end, within the area, it is me and the goal. If someone is better placed, I will definitely give the ball to him. But as a striker, I am mostly thinking about the goal, Villa said.         
	Meanwhile, Spain coach Del Bosque promised to play a different game against Germany on Wednesday.         
	 quot;Its an absolutely marvellous time for Spanish football. We now hope to raise the quality of the game. I am sure that our match with Germany will be a good advertisement for football. quot;         
	Faced with a barrage of uncomfortable questions on Spains moderate show against Paraguay, Del Bosque admitted that he himself was not happy with the performance. quot;It has been a very tough match but this is what we expected, they did not let us play our game.         
	In my time, a Spanish side never felt so uncomfortable or passed the ball so inaccurately. Our game plan was completely disrupted by the South Americans, Del Bosque admitted.         
	Paraguay were not too happy with the supervision and felt the match could have easily gone their way had not Nelson Valdezs legitimate goal been disallowed for an offside in the first half.         
	Coach Gerardo Martino demanded that as it happened in case of England and Mexico, the Fifa president should apologise to his team also. No doubt, Fifa should apologise to us, Martino said.         
	Then, we can say thank you Fifa for apologising to us. That was a clean strike by Valdez. I wonder why it was disallowed. I dont feel happy or satisfied as were trying to create history. Spain are in the semi-finals but we could have been there too. I am happy that we played on a equal footing but we were not lucky, rued the Paraguay coach.

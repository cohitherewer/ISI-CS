                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC lays tampering row to rest
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Wednesday said it would consider the ball-tampering episode of the Cape Town Test a closed chapter. This was after South Africa didnt lodge a formal complaint against the English bowlers.         
	The International Cricket Council confirms that it has received no official lodgement from South Africa team management laying a charge against any England player following reports of alleged breaches of Law 42.3 (changing the condition of the ball).         
	With play on Day 4 of the match having resumed, the deadline for submission of such notification has now passed, the ICC said.

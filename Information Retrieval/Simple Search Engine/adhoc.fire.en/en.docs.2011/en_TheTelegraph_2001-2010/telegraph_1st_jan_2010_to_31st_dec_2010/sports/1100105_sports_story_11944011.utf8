The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Donald: It would be foolish not to consider an offer
                                                                                                                       7                                        Donald: It would be foolish not to consider an offer
    - Nobody (in the BCCI) has approached me as yet, says SA icon           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Allan Donald                                 
	Calcutta: Allan Donald, who took fast bowling to quite another level in the 1990s, is now open to the idea of working with a national team as its bowling coach. A shade over two years ago, hed turned down a long-term contract from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).         
	Today, then, Donald would definitely consider if an offer was made to him by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Nobody has approached me as yet... I dont even know if Im being talked about... However, I would definitely consider the offer, if one actually came from the BCCI... It would be foolish for me not to, Donald told The Telegraph, from Cape Town, on Monday afternoon.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. have been without a bowling and a fielding coach for the past three months and the captain, in particular, has been pretty vocal about the need to have such specialists on the support staff.         
	Among other things, the pressure on (head) coach Gary Kirsten would then be that much less.         
	Venkatesh Prasad (bowling) and Robin Singh (fielding) were with Team India for two-plus years, till they got sacked after the last Champions Trophy.         
	Donald, who took 330 wickets in Tests and 272 in ODIs for South Africa, in an international career spanning over a dozen years, briefly served as Englands bowling coach, in 2007.         
	Satisfied, the ECB offered Donald a two-year contract, but hed declined, citing personal (family) reasons. Now, circumstances have changed.         
	In fact, the 43-year-old Donalds contract as Warwickshires bowling coach has ended and, so, hes free from all cricket-specific contractual obligations.         
	Significantly, it was under Donalds guidance, at Warwickshire, that Sreesanth regained his rhythm late last summer and, after a sensational return to international cricket, didnt forget to thank the South African icon.         
	I am indebted to him (Donald), Sreesanth said, after his five-wicket haul in the recent Kanpur Test against Sri Lanka. That was Sreesanths first India appearance in 19 months and he went on to win the MoM award.         
	Donald, for his part, is convinced that Sreesanths best years are ahead of him.         
	Nobody from the BCCI was available for a comment, but it wouldnt do any harm if either president Shashank Manohar or secretary Narayanaswamy Srinivasan had a word with Donald.         
	For the record, Kirsten and Donald were teammates for a number of years.

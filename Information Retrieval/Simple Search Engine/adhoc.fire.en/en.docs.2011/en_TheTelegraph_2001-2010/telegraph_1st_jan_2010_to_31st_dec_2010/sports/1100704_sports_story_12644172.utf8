            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: David Villas 83rd minute strike took European champions Spain to the semi-finals of the World Cup. Villas goal was enough to hand Spain a 1-0 victory over Paraguay.         
	Spain will take on the might of Germany in the second semi-final on Wednesday in Durban.         
	The match was filled with drama as both Paraguay and Spain wasting a penalty each within a three-minute span. Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas stopped Oscar Cardozos 59th-minute spot kick after Gerard Pique was yellow-carded for fouling him inside the area.         
	Xabi Alonso looked to have put Spain ahead with a 61st minute penalty but was ordered to retake it, and Justo Villar saved the low shot. Paulo da Silva cleared Andres Iniestas shot off the rebound while Villar was lucky not to booked for a foul on Cesc Fabregas.         
	Earlier in the first half, both Spain and Paraguay decided to take a cautious approach as the match remained goalless at the end of the first 45 minutes. While Paraguay, playing a 4-4-2 formation, were determined not to give away any space and time to their fancied rivals, the European champions didnt manage any real breakthroughs.         
	Spain manager Vicente del Bosque kept his faith on off-form striker Fernando Torres and decided to field an unchanged side for the third successive match in the World Cup. Once again, Torres could hardly make any impact, especially in the first half, and wasnt of much help for his striking partner, David Villa.         
	Paraguay coach Gerardo Martinos game plan was clear. He made six changes from the team that played against Japan and was aiming to take the game beyond the stipulated period. With limited resources, Paraguay restored to their familiar style to go for the double covering whenever they lose possession of the ball and then try and slow down the game when they get it back.         
	In the Paraguay line-up, strikers Roque Santa Cruz, Edgar Benitez and Lucas Barrios were all dispatched to the bench. While Nelson Valdez and Oscar Cardozo came in, Carlos Bonet, Enrique Vera and Nestor Ortigozo were also kept out, with Dario Veron, Victor Caceres, Edgar Barreto and Jonathan Santana coming in.         
	Yet, the brilliance of Villa and Iniesta had the Paraguay defence in trouble on a few occasions. Midway through the first half, Villa sent a fine pass on the right of Sergio Ramos, who looped a cross for Torres. Paraguay goalkeeper and skipper Justo Villar had to rush out and punch the ball away to save the situation.         
	Though Spain slowly got into their strides and took control of the midfield, their inability to open up the goalmouth was their biggest problem. Along with Villa, both Xavi and Iniesta tried their best but couldnt draw the Paraguay defenders out.         
	On the contrary, the counter movements of the Paraguayans almost paid off a couple of times. The near-capacity crowd, the majority of whom were backing the Spanish efforts of making their first World Cup semi-finals in 60 years, were stunned to see Oscar Cardozo and Nelson Valdez coming close to scoring at least twice.

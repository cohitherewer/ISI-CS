	Pattaya: Indian tennis ace Sania Mirza squandered a one-set lead before crashing out of the $220,000 Pattaya Open with a first-round loss to German Tatjana Malek here on Wednesday.         
	In a match lasting close to two hours, Sania went down 6-3, 4-6, 3-6 as she continued her poor run on the circuit.         
	The Hyderabadi ace lost her way after making a fine start.         
	Her serve proved to be a complete let down as she conceded break points to her rival. (agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Satyajit walks out
                                                                                                                       7                                        Satyajit walks out
  - East Bengal may give coach Phillippe de Ridder the boot 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto tries to score from a goalmouth melee, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Not even two months in the hot seat, 55 days to be precise, Mohun Bagan coach Satyajit Chatterjee resigned after a 2-2 draw against Railway FC at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. Bagans performance since Satyajit took over from Karim Bencharifa has nose-dived and Tuesdays draw was the last straw.         
	I take moral responsibility for the poor form of the team and have quit as coach. I am not being able to gel with the players well. The team has not clicked under me. After the Lajong loss (1-4 on Saturday) I was thinking something on these lines. This draw just hastened my decision. I would not have quit had we won todays match, he said at the post-match conference.         
	Bagan, under Satyajit, have hit the rock bottom in the I-League with losses against Sporting Clube de Goa, and Lajong FC and a couple of draws against JCT and Pune FC. Incidentally, Bagan play their next I-League match against the Bencharifa-coached Salgaocar at home on April 10 and the last thing they would be wanting was a rudderless team taking the field.         
	So, now who will be taking over the reins? Till late Tuesday night, Bagan officials were locked in a huddle with Bernards name doing the rounds. If at all the Nigerian, who was the Bagan coach for three months in 2007, takes charge, he will be helped by none other than Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	The Brazilian, in fact, has been taking a more active role ever since Satyajit took over, and at team meetings, sources said, was heard more than the coach. Barreto also was contemplating taking an AFC C licence to become a full-time coach to make the transition from player to a coach smoother.         
	From the day Satyajit took over the reins, disaster was waiting to happen. He might be a perfect gentleman but managing a team of Bagans stature was no mean task. There were too many pulls and strings, and with Barreto too chipping in with his words of wisdom, Satyajit found the going really tough.         
	And Tuesdays draw against Railway FC wasnt too easy to digest.         
	If Bagan are already without a coach, their arch-rivals East Bengal are on the verge of giving Phillippe de Ridder the boot. With elections due in September, and their performance in tatters, the present regime cannot afford to further mess up things.         
	We will have a meeting tomorrow (Wednesday), and if he doesnt quit, he will be asked to put in his papers. We have an election later this year and cant afford any more slip-ups, an executive committee member said.         
	For the record, East Bengal returned from Goa on Tuesday, where they lost 1-4 to Salgaocar the day before.

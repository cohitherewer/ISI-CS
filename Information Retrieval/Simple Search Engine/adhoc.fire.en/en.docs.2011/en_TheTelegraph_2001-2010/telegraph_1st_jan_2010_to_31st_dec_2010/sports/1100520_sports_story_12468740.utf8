            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Team India coach Gary Kirsten will join the ICC cricket committee to discuss the use of coloured ball in day-night Tests, one-day cricket format and the controversial switch hit in its two-day meeting starting, in London, Thursday.         
	The panel, which also includes former India captain Ravi Shastri and is headed by former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, will see Kirsten replacing fellow South African Mickey Arthur as the full member team coach representative.         
	The two-day meeting will discuss the Decision Review System (DRS), research into the use of coloured cricket balls for floodlit Test cricket, the format of ODI cricket and the switch hit/reverse sweep, the ICC said in a statement.         
	There will also be a review of the Laws 2010 edition and the impact on standard playing conditions as well as reports from the womens cricket committee and the medical committee, it added.         
	Outgoing ICC President David Morgan has already gone on record, saying he expects day-night matches to be a reality soon either in India or Australia.         
	Morgan said he already has discussed the issue of day-night Tests with the Australian administrators, who gave a positive feedback.         
	I talked to administrators in Australia whom I expected to be so conservative as to be against day-night Test cricket but they are very much for it, he told AFP. I believe it wont be too long before we see day-night Test cricket in Australia or India.         
	The ICC chief said the chief executive committee of the governing body was working to create the right context for Test and one-day cricket.         
	The panel has Morgan and ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat as ex-officio members and also includes Ian Bishop, Mark Taylor, Kumar Sangakkara, Tim May, Justin Vaughan, Simon Taufel, Ranjan Madugalle, Keith Bradshaw, Clare Connor, David Kendix and Steve Tikolo.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir warns of complacency
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir warns of complacency
                      
	Vadodara: India might be comfortably placed to wrap up the five-match series going into the third ODI against New Zealand with a 2-0 lead on Saturday, but skipper Gautam Gambhir, on Friday, warned about the dangers of complacency creeping into the mindset of his team.         
	I have always felt players need to be wary from becoming complacent. We are going to see it now as three-match series. New Zealand are a dangerous one day side and we are looking forward to the contest tomorrow (on Saturday), said the India captain at his pre-match media conference at the Reliance Stadium.         
	He hinted that Saurabh Tiwary might play in the ODI.         
	Gambhir, who would not be a part of the senior members team going to South Africa early for acclimatisation, said his entire focus is now on the current series and, in particular, Saturdays match.         
	I am not thinking about South Africa. My focus is on the series at hand and tomorrows match. I have been given a responsibility to captain the team and only after completing it I would think about South Africa tour, Gambhir said. I will fully utilise the time I will get after reaching there to acclimatise to the conditions, he added.         
	The BCCI has decided to send senior players  regular skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh  well in advance of the opening Test against South Africa commencing December 16.         
	The rest of the tour members will leave after the conclusion of the ODI series against New Zealand.         
	Gambhir expressed similar views about the World Cup and said there was some time between now and the commencement of the mega-event on February 19, 2011.         
	In the same breath the left-handed opener, who played a match-winning knock of 138 not out in the second ODI at Jaipur that India won by eight wickets, praised the decision of the selectors to include Zaheer Khan to play in the last three matches of the current ODI series.

	Dubai: Ross Fisher and Ian Poulter led the way with turbo-charged displays as the elite of European golf jockeyed for position on a day of superb low-scoring in the Dubai World Championship second round, on Friday.         
	In the two-way tussle to finish the season as European No. 1 on Sunday, Race to Dubai leader Martin Kaymer opened an eight-shot advantage over Graeme McDowell who is second in the money list.         
	German Kaymer shot a 70 for a seven-under total of 137 while Briton McDowell slumped to a 73 for 145.         
	Up for grabs for Kaymer and McDowell, the only two players who can top the money-list, is a $1.26 million cheque for winning the tournament plus a $1.5 million bonus for finishing the season as Europes No. 1.         
	Its not over, said McDowell who is playing his fifth tournament in five weeks and acknowledged he felt mentally drained. Going 65-65 at the weekend is not out of the question.         
	I just have to rest, the Northern Irishman told reporters. I have got to somehow go out and relax and have a good time, maybe have a few beers tonight and hang out by the hotel pool.         
	Irish Open champion Fisher was as relaxed as anyone in the Dubai heat, equalling fellow Briton Lee Westwoods eight-under-par course record 64 set last year to finish on 135.         
	Poulter, bidding for back-to-back titles after his victory in the Hong Kong Open last Sunday, carded a 66 to join compatriot Fisher on nine-under.         
	World No. 1 Westwood was one stroke adrift in third place after a 67 while fellow Briton Paul Casey (67) also joined the birdie bonanza to take joint fourth spot on 137 with Kaymer and Thailands Thongchai Jaidee (69).         
	Fisher made his intentions clear from the outset, birdying four of the first seven holes. To hit eight birdies and walk off this course without making a bogey is very pleasing, he said. I drove the ball fantastically well. .(agencies)

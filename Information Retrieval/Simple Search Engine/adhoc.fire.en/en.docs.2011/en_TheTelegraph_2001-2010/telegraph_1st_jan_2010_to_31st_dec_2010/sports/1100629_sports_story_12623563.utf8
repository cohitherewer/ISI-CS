    When taking a catch, receive the ball, dont grab at it            CRICKET ONLINE    Ravi Shastri      
	I face problems when taking high catches. I judge it wrongly and hence drop it. Please help.              
	(Souvik Dhar, 14, Calcutta-61)              
	Keep you eyes on the ball and receive it when you catch it rather than grabbing at it.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often indulge in careless strokeplay and get out quickly. Despite repeated attempts I havent learnt to be careful. Please help.              
	(Ramesh Srivastava, 21, Calcutta)              
	Play according to the state of the game and conditions. Focus on shot selection.               
	I am a left-arm spinner. What should be the ideal length when bowling to a righthand batsman who is on the rampage?              
	(Rohit Sutradhar, 17, Calcutta)              
	It all depends on his areas of strength. Keep the ball up to the bat and attack the stumps.               
	I am a left-arm spinner. I often bowl too many wide balls. Please help.              
	(Subir Ganguly, 17, Howrah)              
	Keep a steady head. Watch the spot you want the ball to land and dont fall away in your action.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. I cannot judge whether a delivery is yorker or overpitched. Please help.              
	(S. Vivek, 18, Guwahati)              
	Watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand and dont commit yourself with your feet.               
	I am a righthanded opener. Is it advisable to go on the rampage from the outset to unnerve the bowler?              
	(Rajiv Gupta, 22, Calcutta)              
	Treat the bowling on merit. It also depends on the conditions.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. I have a high backlift and that leads to problems when tackling shortpitched deliveries. Please help.              
	(Bapi Pattnaik, 19, Cuttack)              
	Control your backlift and work on your backfoot play.

	(Swapan Sammadar, 19, Calcutta)              
	Work on your cardio and strengthening and yoga will help.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg spinners?              
	(Tamal Saha, Calcutta)              
	Not really... Unless the ball is turning a lot out of the rough.               
	I am a righthanded batsman and often get caught at fine leg when attempting the hook to shortpitched deliveries. Should I stop executing the shot?              
	(Sampat Guha, 19, Calcutta)              
	Yes. Work on your backfoot game and when you are confident of getting into good positions then start hooking.

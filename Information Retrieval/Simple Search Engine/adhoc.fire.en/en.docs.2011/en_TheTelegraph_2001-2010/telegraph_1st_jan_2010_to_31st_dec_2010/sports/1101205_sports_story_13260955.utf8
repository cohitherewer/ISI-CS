The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Black Caps bow to Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                        Black Caps bow to Gambhir
                  Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli, on Saturday                     
	Vadodara: New Zealand came to India having suffered the ignominy of a 0-4 ODI series humiliation at the hands of Bangladesh. But they resurrected some of their reputation when they put up a gallant show in the Test series versus the No. 1 side in the world.         
	However, after three ties of the five-match ODI series, against India, it seems that the Black Caps are once again heading towards the pits. Stand-in India captain Gautam Gambhir literally led from the front as the hosts sealed the series with a crushing nine-wicket win in the third ODI, in Vadodara, on Saturday.         
	India are leading the series 3-0 and from the way New Zealand have been outclassed so far, it wouldnt be surprising if Gambhir records a whitewash in his debut series as a captain. Opening the innings, Gambhir cracked an unbeaten 126, his second century on the trot, to lead India home with more than 10 overs to spare.         
	The left-handed batsman, who hit a match-winning unbeaten 138 in the second ODI in Jaipur, was once again in blistering form as he hit 16 boundaries during his 117-ball knock. He was instrumental in a 115-run opening wicket partnership with Murali Vijay, who had a quiet day with a 50-ball 30.         
	Virat Kohli, who came in at No. 3 after Vijays run out, too, continued his good work with the willow.         
	Kohli, who had scored a match-winning century in the first ODI in Guwahati and followed that up with a half-century in Jaipur, remained unbeaten on 63 off 70 balls. The youngsters innings was studded with six fours and two sixes  the second six, over long on, bringing the winning runs for India.         
	The second wicket duo of Gambhir and Kohli put on 114 runs off 125 balls to ensure a comfortable victory. Saturdays victory was also Indias ninth successive ODI win over New Zealand and has rendered the remaining two matches, in Bangalore (December 7) and in Chennai (December 10), as contests of just academic interest.         
	The hosts won the opening match in Guwahati by 40 runs and then took a 2-0 lead with a thumping eight-wicket victory in the second ODI in Jaipur.         
	Chasing New Zealands modest total of 224 for nine, built around James Franklins unbeaten 72, India were on the offensive from the very first ball as Gambhir raced to his 50 off only 30 balls. The southpaw was ruthless to anything loose and played shots all around the ground. It was Gambhirs aggression which took away the match from the visitors.         
	Earlier in the day, Franklin came to New Zealands rescue after they fumbled in the beginning in conditions which were favouring the bowlers. The visitors made a disastrous start by losing their openers within the first five overs and were struggling at 106 for seven before Franklin and Nathan McCullum staged the recovery act with a stand of 94.

    - super kings praying for captains return vs the Mumbai Indians           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni during practice, in Mumbai, on Wednesday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: The Chennai Super Kings are hoping that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be fit to play in their crucial Indian Premier League match against the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne stadium on Thursday.         
	After two morale-shattering defeats, against the Kings XI Punjab and the Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Super Kings received a major boost with Dhoni joining the team for the match-eve practice session for the first time since suffering an injury in the March 16 match against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	The Chennai Super Kings captain was hit on the right arm by a Shane Bond delivery, but battled the injury to take his team to victory at Eden Gardens.         
	It might be just about 10 days since the Indian captain went back to his Ranchi home to recuperate although, for the Super Kings, it would have seemed like aeons after they lost to the Kings XI in the super over before being outplayed by the Bangalore side on Tuesday.         
	The teams practice was rescheduled following a two-hour delay in arrival, but things appeared to look up for the Chennai side as Dhoni padded up and batted with his right elbow still in a bandage.         
	A final call on Dhonis fitness is to be taken before the start of the match and, according to the support staff, it has been left to the captain to judge for himself whether he wants to play on Thursday.         
	The Super Kings, however, will continue to miss South African fast-bowling all-rounder Justin Kemp who also has an injury.         
	But in Muttiah Muralidharan and Lakshmipathy Balaji the visitors have quality bowlers who can exploit a Brabourne track which is expected to be on the slower side.         
	Coach Stephen Fleming said that the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Mumbai Indians are the two teams who were looking good to make the semis, adding that it was for the other teams to bring them down on level terms.         
	At the moment Bangalore and Mumbai are certainly the teams in form. It can change with injuries and form slump. Its for other teams to stop that and bring them to the pack. Its our responsibility with Mumbai tomorrow (Thursday), he said.         
	The Mumbai Indians have fewer worries although they would be wary of another inspirational performance by Dhoni, like the one he produced at the Eden Gardens to decimate the Knights.         
	With Sachin Tendulkar in a purple patch, it will be a good opportunity for Shikhar Dhawan, who has replaced out of form Sanath Jayasuriya, to make an impression as an opener.         
	Ambati Rayudu is still recovering from the injury he picked up in the game against the Royal Challengers and as such would not be available for Thursdays match.         
	He wont be playing tomorrow. He will need a couple of days more (to recover from his injury), coach Robin Singh said.         
	Like Rayudu and Saurabh Tiwary, the other youngster in the Mumbai line-up who has grabbed attention is the 20-year-old Aditya Tare. Tares wicketkeeping has not been top class, but his attacking batting has easily helped him keep the No.3 batting slot ahead of Tiwary and Rayudu.         
	I think he has done his job except maybe during the last game (against the Knights) when he didnt keep too well. As far as we are concerned he has played his role in most of the games, Robin said.         
	We wanted to use his batting more than his keeping. In this format you obviously get very few balls to keep, unless its a really bad wicket. We wanted to concentrate on his batting because he is quite an explosive player.         
	Robin said his bowlers have delivered at the death overs as they had studied the rival batsmen and bowled accordingly.         
	We have been studying most of the batsmen. Its up to the bowler to figure out where he wants to bowl, where he is comfortable. This is a big ground and its not easy to hit a six as compared to some other grounds, he said.         
	Robin felt that some of the teams were suffering because of absence of top foreign players but the situation might improve as the tournament progresses and the players are available once their national commitments are over.         
	Tendulkars side have been quite fortunate to play six of their first eight games at home apart from the away tie against the Adam Gilchrist led Deccan Chargers, which is to be played at Navi Mumbai on Sunday.         
	Having lost to the Royal Challengers last week, they would be keen to collect full points from the remaining home games to give themselves a cushion when they start touring in the latter half of the tournament.         
	Match starts: 8 pm.

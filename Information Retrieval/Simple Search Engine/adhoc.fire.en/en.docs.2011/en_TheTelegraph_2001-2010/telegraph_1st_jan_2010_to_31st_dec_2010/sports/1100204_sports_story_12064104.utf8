            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: The top-weighted Ballantyne fully justified the support received at pampered odds, of 5-2, while recording a facile victory over a rank-outsider, Alamgir, in the upper division of the Memorable Day Cup, on Wednesday. Ballantynes odds shot up after trainer Arti Doctors Ariela attracted quite a wagering at 7-4. The filly, however, ran a disappointing race. Arti, however, saddled a brace of winners  Mysterious Star and Bayberry  in their respective events. In the lower division of the trophy event, trainer D. Davids Star Luxurious cantered home after taking a good jump out at the start.RESULTS

                                                                                                                       7                                      Serena doubtful for US Open
                      
	New York: Serena Williams is in doubt for the US Open because of her recent foot injury, according to the WTA Tour. Williams cut her right foot on broken glass at a restaurant shortly after winning Wimbledon. The Tour said last week she needed surgery and would miss three tournaments leading up to the Open.         
	On Monday, tour spokesman Andrew Walker said Williams is questionable for the final Grand Slam of the year. Williams return to the Open has been widely anticipated because of her tumultuous semi-final loss there last year, when she threw a tirade at a line judge at the end of a match against Kim Clijsters and was fined a record $82,500.         
	Because of the injury, Williams is missing the entire World Team Tennis season with the Washington Kastles. Her team said she cut the bottom of her foot and needed stitches.         
	Hey guys Im doing better, Williams tweeted Monday. Thanks for all the love. On Sunday night she tweeted: cant wait to get out of bed amp; back on the courts amp; do what i do best!         
	Ranked No. 1, Williams won her fourth Wimbledon crown and 13th Major title July 3. The injury occurred shortly after in Europe and at first was not believed to be serious. After hurting her foot, Williams played in an exhibition in Brussels on July 8 against Clijsters before a world-record tennis crowd of 35,681.         
	Williams attended a WTT match the next night in Glen Falls, New York and did not play but briefly discussed her injury with reporters. When asked how she was able to play against Clijsters, Williams said, Those Belgian doctors and waffles.

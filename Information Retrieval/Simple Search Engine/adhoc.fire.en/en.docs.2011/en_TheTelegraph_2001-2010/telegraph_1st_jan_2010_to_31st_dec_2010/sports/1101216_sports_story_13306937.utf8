The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pacy Perth holds key
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pacy Perth holds key
                      
	Perth: Having sent Australia crashing to the canvas in Adelaide, England will hope to land a knockout blow to their punch-drunk former tormentors when the third Ashes Test gets underway, in Perth, on Thursday.         
	Victory at the Waca ground would see Andrew Strausss team bring the Ashes home for the first time since the Mike Gatting-led triumph in 1986-87, while condemning Ricky Ponting to becoming the first Australian captain in 120 years to lose three Ashes series.         
	Ponting said England outbatted, outbowled and outfielded the hosts in the second Test in Adelaide, but the tourists, 1-0 up, will need to defy recent history to stop the hosts squaring the series.         
	England have lost their last five Tests to Australia at the Waca and, like most teams, have struggled to adapt to the grounds traditionally quick pitches.         
	Their last win at the Waca came in 1978, when the Mike Brearley-led side defeated an Australian team gutted by World Series Cricket.         
	If Australia were wounded in Adelaide and have a point to prove theyre going to be that much harder to beat and weve got to counter that, Strauss said on Wednesday.         
	Australias record here is very good, so that suggests that theyre better at adapting to these conditions than other teams.         
	Englands innings and 71-run victory in the second Test helped erase some demons from their disastrous tour in 2006-07 when they were whitewashed 5-0, but more bitter memories linger at Perth where the Australians handed out a 206-run thrashing to wrest back the Ashes before Christmas.         
	Underlining the home sides desperation, selectors are likely to slot Mitchell Johnson straight back into the side after he was dropped following his wayward performance in the first Test in Brisbane where he conceded 170 runs without taking a wicket.         
	The selectors also raised eyebrows by naming Michael Beer in their 12-man squad, a left-arm orthodox spinner with only five first class matches under his belt, as a potential replacement for the dropped Xavier Doherty.

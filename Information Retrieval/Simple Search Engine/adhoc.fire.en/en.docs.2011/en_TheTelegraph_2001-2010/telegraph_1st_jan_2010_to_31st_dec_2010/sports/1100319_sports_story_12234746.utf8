            A STAFF REPORTER            Theodore Sunday tries to get past an Eastern Railway player. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: He was selfish in not passing the ball to his teammates on Thursday. But Theodore Sundays brilliance eclipsed his self-indulgent nature, near the goalmouth, as he led Mohammedan Sporting to a 3-1 victory against Eastern Railway SC at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The Liberian, who had vanished off the scene only to surface a couple of weeks back, scored a brace, while Lucky Imran hit the other for Shabbir Alis side.         
	In the absence of Brazilian Eduardo, who was banned for the rest of the CFL this season, Theo, as he is popularly known, was the key to Mohammedan Sportings success. And he did his duty in style.         
	His first came in the 25th minute, when he took advantage of a defensive lapse to unleash a pile-driver past an advancing Eastern Railway keeper into the net.         
	Lucky Imran netted the winners second in the 78th minute. He was lucky enough (he was also surprise choice for the Man of the Match) to evade an offside call and push home the ball after being nicely set up by Dipendu Biswas.         
	Theos second, and Mohammedan Sportings third, in the 81st minute, was pure magic.         
	Latching on to a pass near the central circle, Theos wizardry bamboozled half-a-dozen rival players in a single run which culminated in foxing the keeper and tapping the ball gently in.         
	Eastern Railway did manage to breach Shabbirs defence once when Bikash Narjinary hammered in their only goal, in the 58th minute, from close range with the Mohammedan defence serving as the audience.

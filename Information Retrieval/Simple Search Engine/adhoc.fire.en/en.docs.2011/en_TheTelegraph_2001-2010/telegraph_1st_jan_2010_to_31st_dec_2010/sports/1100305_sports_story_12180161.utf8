                                                                                                                       7                                        Jack foresees Masters return
    - Would have blown the whistle Had I known about Woods affairs: caddie           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Tiger Woods                                 
	Jack Nicklaus expects Tiger Woods to return to action in time for the Masters. Woods is four titles short of matching Nicklaus record of 18 Majors, but has not played this year.         
	The Masters begins on April 8 and last month Woods offered no assurances he would play at all in 2010 as he apologised for the sex scandal which has turned his life upside down.         
	However, Nicklaus suspects 34 year-old Woods will be itching to play at Augusta and is likely to take his place in the field.         
	It would surprise me if he didnt, Nicklaus said. Ive been very non-committal because its none of my business. But playing golf, my guess as a golfer, hes going to probably try to want to.         
	Nicklaus added: I suspect he will play something before Augusta, and Id be very surprised if he doesnt play before Augusta.         
	Discussing Woods further, Nicklaus said: His personal life is his personal life. Hes a professional golfer and hes a sensational golfer. Hes a great athlete, and hell figure out his own problems.         
	And as a golfer, hell come back and get his game in shape and play. Thats what he does.         
	Meanwhile, Woodss caddie Steve Williams has said that he knew nothing about the golfers extramarital affairs and was angry with him over the scandal.         
	The New Zealander, who has been Woodss caddie for 11 years and is now his close friend, said he would have blown the whistle if he had known of the golfers behaviour.         
	Its been the most difficult time of my life, no two ways about it, because every single person believed that I should know or did know or had something to do with it, Williams said. I knew nothing, thats my answer. I dont have to clarify or extend that answer, I knew nothing.         
	If the shoe was on someone else, I would say the same thing. It would be very difficult as a caddie not to know but Im 100 per cent telling you, I did not know, and thats that, he said.         
	Im a straight-up sort of person. If I had known something was going on, the whistle would have been blown.         
	Williams said he was angry when revelations about Woodss private life emerged, but had not berated the player because he felt he needed a friend.         
	Of course Im mad at him, why would you not be? Williams said. Im close with his wife and hes got two lovely children and hes let them down.         
	When a guys having a tough time, its not up to me to beat him with a stick right now. Hes getting enough grilling from everybody else.         
	When youre a true friend of somebody, thats when somebody needs your support and need you the most. Thats when you dont walk away. Tigers one of my closest friends and he needs my support right now and Id never think of walking away.

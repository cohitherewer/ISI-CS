  - Would be good to have five wins in a row ahead of SA tour: Gambhir       OUR BUREAU AGENCIES            Saurabh Tiwary and Yusuf Pathan during a practice session, in Chennai, on Thursday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta/Chennai: High on confidence after steamrolling the opposition in the first three matches before snatching an improbable win in the next, a rampaging India would aim for a whitewash in the fifth and final one-dayer here Friday.         
	The young Indian side have done remarkably well in the series in the absence of senior players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh. With weather gods relenting, a full match appears to be on the cards at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium.         
	Most of the top-order Indian batsmen have been among runs in the series and that bodes well for the side. The only time India had hiccups in the series was in Bangalore on Tuesday with the home side in trouble at 188 for five at one stage while chasing a daunting target of 316. But Yusuf Pathan butchered New Zealand bowlers to single-handedly take India to a five-wicket victory with seven balls remaining.         
	Yusufs unbeaten 123 of 96 balls and useful contributions from Saurabh Tiwary (37 not out), Rohit Sharma (44) and Parthiv Patel (53) must have boosted the confidence of the side that are hell bent on going for a whitewash. Stand-in skipper Gautam Gambhir has led from the front, hitting back-to-back centuries to top the batting averages for four matches. Gambhir has scored 329 runs with an average of 164.50, followed by Virat Kohli (232 runs; 77.33 average).         
	Gambhir himself was upbeat with the chance to complete a memorable clean sweep. We need to win this game. It is important. It would be good to have five wins in a row and wind up the series before heading for South Africa and it would be useful, he said.         
	In the bowling front though, India will have to improve upon their performance in the last ODI in Bangalore where they gave away too many runs at the death overs, an oft-repeated problem for the side. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has done a decent job in the series so far with eight wickets from four matches though he was expensive in the last ODI. Yusuf and Yuvraj Singh have also chipped in with useful contributions with six and three wickets with the former taking 3/49 in Bangalore.         
	Left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra has been a bit of a let down having taken just three wickets in the four matches by conceding 197 runs. Zaheer Khan, having missed the first two ODIs due to injury, has taken two from the two matches. The pace spearhead may be rested for the tie. The Daniel Vettori-led New Zealand side would, however, take some solace from the way they cornered India in Bangalore before a Yusuf special bailed the home side out.         
	New Zealand top-order batsmen fired in unison for the first time in the series in Bangalore to post 315 and Vettori would be looking for a repeat of that here if the visitors want to end their otherwise forgettable tour on a winning note.         
	After a much-improved show by his players in Bangalore, Vettori said he would focus on winning the last match though the series has already been decided.         
	We still think we can still win matches. We will approach the game on the morrow like the way we do every game to keep motivated in not losing focus since the one-day series has already been decided, he said.         
	He would be looking to James Franklin, who scored a superb 98 not out in Bangalore if they want to post a big score and chase down a big target. With big guns like Brenden McCullum, Ross Taylor and Scott Styris coming a cropper, Franklin is the top run-getter for New Zealand in the series with 170 runs from two matches.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Gautam Gambhir, Parthiv Patel, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Saurabh Tiwary, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Munaf Patel, Ashish Nehra.         
	New Zealand (likely): Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Jamie How/Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, James Franklin, Daniel Vettori, Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Andy McKay.         
	Match starts: 2:30 pm.

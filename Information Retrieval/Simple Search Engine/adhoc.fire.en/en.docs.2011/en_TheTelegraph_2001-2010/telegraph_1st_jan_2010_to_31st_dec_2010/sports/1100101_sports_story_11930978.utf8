            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Syces agitation, which threatened to stop the New Years Day races, is a thing of the past. With agreement reached between the concerned parties, and signs on the dotted line, it is going to be business as usual on Friday. The scene now shifts to the renovated race stands, the fully furnished new Baqlava lawn and the nine-event competitive race card framed for the afternoon.           
	The winner-spotting is, however, going to be very tough on the day. Still, it may pay to follow trainer Vijay Singh who has waited very patiently to deliver the goods early in the New Year with thorough planning. The likes of Brave Moves, Glamorous Spirits, Hall Of Glorys and Record Breakers, from Vijays yard, may need little luck and good wishes from his followers to keep the the adrenaline flowing and also to keep the expected large crowd in good humour. Brother, Bharath, too, is known to flex his muscles on such a big day.           
	Vijay is eying for the two star events in the card  the 2,200m RCTC Gold Vase and the baby race, the 1.200m Kunigal Stud Indian Produce Stakes. In the Gold Vase, Vijays both runners, Azureus and Silver Fox, may be expected to fight out the issue. On revised weights, Azureus seems to enjoy advantage over Silver Fox, who however, is a gutsy customer. The third horse in contention is Rising Hero, from trainer Patrick Quinns yard. The Storm Trooper son has missed the winning bracket narrowly in his last two starts. The horse is stayer, he may trouble all.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

	Chennai: Third seed Stanislas Wawrinka played some flawless tennis to clinch a quarter final spot in the $450,000 Chennai Open at the Nungambakkam tennis stadium on Thursday.         
	Cheered on by an appreciative crowd, the Swiss attacked consistently from the baseline to get the better of No.83-ranked Michael Russell of the US 6-3, 6-4 in an hour and 31 minutes.         
	In the doubles event, the Indian pair of Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna scored a 6-3, 7-6(7-5) victory over American duo James Cerretani and Travis Rettenmaier to set up a last-eight clash with Colin Fleming and Ker Skupski.         
	Later in the day, the Indo-Spanish pair of Yuki Bhambri and Carlos Moya went down to the Spanish pair of Marcel Granollers and Santiago Ventura 5-7, 1-6 in a one-sided encounter.         
	Back to the singles, down 1-3 in the second set, Wawrinka pocketed four games in a row to make it 5-3 before sealing the issue on his next service game.         
	It is good to start well in the first tournament of the year, said the Swiss player, who lost to Italian Flavio Cipolla in the first round here last year. I was lucky to have won in straight sets because Michael played well today. My backhand really worked well when closing out long rallies, he added.         
	Wawrinka now plays German Michael Berrer for a place in the semi-finals. Berrer defeated Stephane Robert of France 7-6(9-7), 6-3 in another pre-quarter final match.         
	In the days first match, Slovakias Lukas Lacko hit 11 aces to end Robby Ginepris dream run with a 7-6(7-3), 6-4 victory in the pre-quarter finals.         
	This is the first time that the Slovak youngster has made the quarter finals at an ATP event.         
	The Slovakian was definitely the better player on court and held a firm grip over the match from the very beginning. While games went with serve in the first set leading to the tiebreak, Lacko shrugged off a 1-3 deficit to break Ginepri twice and pocket the match.         
	Fifth seed Dudi Sela, the 22-year-old from Israel, also survived a first set tiebreak to beat Kevin Kim of the US 7-6(7-3), 6-2 to set up a clash with Lacko.         
	Meanwhile, in the days last match, Somdev Dev Varman and Sanam Singh also made the last eight with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Jeff Coetzee (South Africa) and Rogier Wassen (the Netherlands).

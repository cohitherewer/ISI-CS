The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City on Red alert
                                                                                                                       7                                      City on Red alert
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Roberto Mancini faced a defining week in Manchester Citys season insisting that a training-ground disagreement with Craig Bellamy was insignificant compared to the uncertainty about the duration of Carlos Tevezs compassionate leave in Argentina.         
	Bellamy, who was reportedly involved in a heated row with Mancini this week, will be considered for a place on the substitutes bench against Liverpool at Eastlands Sunday if he emerges unscathed from match-eve training.         
	The battle for fourth spot remains tight with only three points separating Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa, all of whom play on Sunday.         
	While City play the match of the day, Spurs are at Wigan Athletic while Villa are at home to Burnley.         
	But 19-goal top-scorer Tevez will be in Buenos Aires when City kick-off a game crucial to their Champions League aspirations. He went home after his daughter Katie was born six weeks prematurely last Monday.         
	Although Mancini is keen for the 25million forward to return for the trip to Chelsea next week, if not Wednesdays FA Cup replay at Stoke, he is reluctant to impose a deadline.

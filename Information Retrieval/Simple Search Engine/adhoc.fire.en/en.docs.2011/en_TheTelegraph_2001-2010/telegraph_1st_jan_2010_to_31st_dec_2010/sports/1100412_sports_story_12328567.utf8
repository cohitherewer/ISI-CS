The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaneria mulls legal action 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kaneria mulls legal action 
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria is contemplating legal action against the British tabloid which has named him as one of the two Essex players currently under investigation by the police for match irregularities in the English county championship.         
	Police are investigating allegations that two Essex players were involved in match irregularities, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Saturday.         
	The Sun named Kaneria as one of the two players who are under investigation, prompting an angry response from the spinner. I dont know from where they have got their information but I have spoken to my lawyer and we are contemplating to sue them for damages, Kaneria said.         
	Kaneria, who has been playing for Essex for the last seven seasons, said he was devastated by the allegations as he had always stayed clear of such controversies and scandals.         
	The Essex police said on Saturday that following allegations received about two Essex County Cricket players involved in match irregularities, they have initiated an investigation.         
	Kaneria was due to join Essex last week but was held back by the Pakistan selectors who wanted him to play in the Pentangular Cup one-day tournament as they are considering him for the Asia Cup and with the 2011 World Cup in mind.         
	My association with Essex is long and I have a lot of respect out there. This controversy has hurt me badly and it is rubbish as far as I am concerned, Kaneria said.         
	I am just waiting for the police to complete their investigations after which I will then claim damages, he said.         
	We are always soft targets because of what happened 10 years ago. I am devastated because it does affect my personal and professional life badly, he added.         
	Kaneria is due to join Essex next month and said that at present there were neither any changes in his plan nor had the county told him anything otherwise.         
	Meanwhile, Englands county cricketers have been advised to stay away from social networking sites like Facebook as there are fears that they might end up adding bookies and match fixers as their friends, a day after the police investigations started.           (PTI)

    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -   Chargers captain on batting, keeping and leading an IPL team             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Adam Gilchrist         
	Calcutta: Adam Gilchrist, who needs no introduction, spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour. The Deccan Chargers captain is in the city for Thursdays IPL clash against the Kolkata Knight Riders.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q You gave batting a whole new dimension, particularly in ODIs. Has Virender Sehwag taken it to the next level?         
	A Yeah, I think so... Virender has been phenomenal... Matthew Hayden, too, changed the mindset... That the first session of a Test didnt have to be all about survival... That those two hours could be about total domination and setting the flow of the game your way... Id pick both guys... Both spent some time out of the team and came back, clear in their minds, that they wanted to play in a certain way... They may have missed out on the odd occasion, but stayed focused.         
	While the ODI record for the maximum dismissals (472) is still yours, Mark Bouchers the No.1 in Tests (494 dismissals). Your thoughts...         
	Mark has played more games than me, hasnt he? (Laughs) In all seriousness, Im thrilled to see him hold that record because he has been around for 13 years... We all talk about Sachin Tendulkar and his 20 years in the game, but heres a wicket-keeper who has put in over a dozen years and done his job over and over again, almost in an unrecognised manner. All credit to Mark.         
	[The 33-year Boucher has played 131 Tests, while Gilchrist, 38, quit after 96 appearances at the highest level.]         
	Whats special about Bouchers keeping?         
	Consistency... Marks reliable and can take great catches. He has brought those qualities to the team... Then, in the middle-order, he chips in with useful runs.         
	Any young keepers whove caught your eye...         
	Not young, because all countries have pretty stable (experienced) teams... Im not, for example, surprised that Brad Haddin has been doing so well... Hed been a seasoned first-class cricketer before he got into Test cricket... Kumar Sangakkara is a wonderful keeper... Brendon McCullum, I think, is a fine keeper. The world is actually well served in the keeper-batsman department.         
	The trend is for keeper-batsmen. Whats your take?         
	When people say that, does it mean they do not rate other wicket-keepers whore out there, for their keeping? Is that a statement saying that the standard of wicket-keeping has deteriorated over the years? I cant comment on that, I dont know... I remember Rod Marsh and Ian Healy... Theyre the guys that I grew up watching... My idols, my heroes... All we try to do, as wicket-keepers, is to do the best job we can. And, again, when we get the bat in our hands, thats what we try to do... Theres definitely an expectation that you have to be a greater contributor with the bat in this day and age than 20 or 30 years ago.         
	If you had a role in picking a team, would you go for a specialist keeper or a batsman-keeper?         
	All wicket-keepers today are fine batsmen anyway. I cant see anyone turning up who cant bat...         
	What are your impressions of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the India captain and wicket-keeper?         
	 Look, I dont watch enough cricket to know the finer details... On face value and looking at the results, Dhoni seems to be doing a tremendous job... Indias No.1 in Tests and the captain and coach (Gary Kirsten) can take credit... The players, too. Dhonis a very, very calm person... His calmness is what I admire the most.         
	Dhoni sees you as his role model. Have the two of you ever had a lengthy chat?         
	Weve chatted, yes, but Dhoni doesnt seem to be the sort of guy who needs to ask... Hes very confident himself, backs his abilities and has a lot of trust in his team... Thats great... He is forging his own identity.         
	What were your emotions when, last August, Australia lost the No.1 position in Tests (to South Africa, at that point in time)? After all, youd played a huge role in taking them to the pinnacle...         
	Im not overtly emotional at all... As for losing that position, it was bound to happen at some stage. The team, though, have got their own identity now... Its amazing that when you are not directly involved, it doesnt quite seem as important as when you are actually involved... What Im trying to say is that you realise theres a lot more going on in life.         
	Your message to the Australian team...         
	They should keep doing whatever they are doing. They dont need advice from me.         
	You made a point about Sachin and longevity... What were your impressions of him when you played against him the first time (1996 or so) and what are your impressions now?         
	Back then, Sachin would play in a very dominating manner, could really be deemed to have been at the height of his powers... In the years after that, he has been evolving in a different kind of role. I guess maybe not even consciously doing it... Maybe, its because of being who he is and the expectations on him... Rahul Dravid and the others in the core group have also contributed so well... Sachin has always had the determination and the hunger, but there appears to have been some sort of a rejuvenation over the last 12 months or so.         
	Five years from now, what role do you see for yourself?         
	Hopefully, it would involve still being with the Deccan Chargers! (Laughs) Who knows? After my retirement from international cricket (March 2008), if someone had said Id be playing till the third edition of the IPL, I would have thought it to be unlikely... The IPL has created opportunities... So, five years hence, I really dont know.         
	You played a big role in the Chargers turnaround in IPL II. Well, as the captain, what exactly did you do?         
	There are a lot of finer details... However, generally speaking, wed spent a lot of time in the first IPL (2008) talking about the appreciation of the different cultures in our dressing room... There were seven nationalities and to appreciate each others cultures... We spent too much time on that without realising that we had to create our own culture, a Deccan Chargers culture.         
	Whats that?         
	Its hard to necessarily put it down in words or to describe it, but its there within the group. You know it, you can feel it... It is creating an atmosphere everyone wants to be a part of, everyone wants to buy into... So thats an example of one part of the Deccan Chargers culture... You (also) need total commitment. That is how you go about preparing to play decent cricket.         
	If you had to select a team, would you look only for skills or would you look for attitude, too? What, for you, is most important?         
	The person... Attitude would get more weightage... The key to good teams and successful organisations is their people. Im convinced of that.         
	What would you tell somebody aspiring to be a Gilchrist?         
	You have to make a lot of sacrifices... Put in a lot of hard work, but make sure you are having fun all along the way... Have fun, but be committed to whatever you are doing at that moment in time. If its training, make sure that is the most important thing in your life...         
	The fear is that T20 will be promoted even more vigorously at the expense of ODIs and Test cricket...         
	I think theres room for all three formats and I also believe that T20 is definitely an extremely powerful tool... The key, really, is the volume of cricket... We are close to saturation point and thats what is going to remove the interest in the game... If we can make it better, people will get the calendar and go wow! The reason why T20 came about was because of an over-saturation of one-day cricket.         
	Now, theres an overkill of T20... Two World T20 meets within a year...         
	Perhaps, we are getting very close to that critical point (of too much cricket).... Ive got no doubt that the administrators are aware of that and are doing their best to alter the situation... We dont want inconsequential games... We need to try and create identities. It would be great if every country had an iconic series, like the Ashes. Test cricket can survive, with T20 being used to attract new people to the game.         
	The last one... What has cricket taught you?         
	(Emotionally) Humility, honesty and commitment. Believe me, if youre not committed, the game will expose you.

	Miami: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi had to work hard before the Indian duo, along with their respective partners, cleared the opening round hurdle in the mens doubles event of the Miami Master here.         
	Third-seeded Paes and Czech Lukas Dlouhy toiled in the middle for nearly one-and-half hours before eking out a 6-4, 7-6(4) victory over Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.         
	They now face the unseeded Thomaz Belucci-Marc Lopez pair who struggled to down Christopher Kas and Dick Norman 3-6, 6-3, 10-8.         
	Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi also overcame a tricky test against 2005 Wimbledon champions Stephen Huss and Wesley Moodie before carving out a 6-4, 7-5 victory in 76 minutes.         
	The fourth seeded Indo-Belarussian pair now face the John Isnor-Sam Querry duo, who toiled to get past Johan Branstrom and Jean-Jullen Rojer 4-6, 6-3, 10-7 in yet another intense opening round match.         
	Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal remained on course for a showdown against No 1-ranked Roger Federer with a 6-7 (8), 6-2, 6-2 third-round win over dangerous wild card entry David Nalbandian here. It has been 10 months since Nadal won a tournament, but he Sunday showed some of his old championship swagger by rallying past Nalbandian.         
	Nadal and Federer havent played against each other since May in Madrid, but their paths to the final became easier when No. 2 Novak Djokovic and No. 3 Andy Murray lost their opening matches.         
	It doesnt affect me a lot that Murray or Djokovic are out if I lose today, fourth-seeded Nadal said. As for who he might play next Sunday: If I am in the final, I dont care.         
	A potential semi-final opponent is No. 6 Andy Roddick, who reached the final 16 by beating Sergiy Stakhovsky in 55 minutes, 6-2, 6-1.         
	Nadal will next face fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, who beat Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (5), 6-3. Olivier Rochus, who upset Djokovic in the second round, lost to No 27 Thomaz Bellucci 6-3, 6-4.         
	Advancing to the womens fourth round were Belgian pair and Grand Slam champions Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. They could meet in the semi-finals. Second-seeded Caroline Wozniacki and defending champion Victoria Azarenka also won.         
	In the early going against Nalbandian, it looked as though Nadal might have the coming week off. The Argentine, a former top-five player mounting a comeback from hip surgery, more than held his own in long baseline rallies and often found th open court with his backhand.         
	It was no fluke  Nalbandian has beaten 16-time Grand Slam champion Federer eight times. As the opening set passed the one-hour mark, Nadal endured several wobbly moments, most notably when he double-faulted with a serve that missed by two meters. That made the score 5-all in the tiebreaker. Nadal regrouped to reach set point, then let it slip away and lost the final three points of the set.         
	But after dropping serve early in the match when he double-faulted on break point, Nadal held his final 11 service games. Nalbandian began pressing to finish rallies, losing two in a row when he tried drop shots, and his errors mounted.         
	Nadal, hampered by knee trouble in recent months, has gone without a title in his past 12 tournaments. But with the clay-court season approaching, the four-time French Open champion is encouraged about the direction of his game.         
	He reached the semi-finals at Indian Wells this month before losing to Ivan Ljubicic, and now hes trying to win his first title at Key Biscayne, where he was runner-up in 2005 and 2008.         
	The unseeded Henin, mounting a comeback after a 20-month retirement, beat No 26 Dominika Cibulkova 6-4, 6-4. Clijsters, seeded 14th, swept the first nine games and needed only 51 minutes to beat No 17 Shahar Peer 6-0, 6-1.         
	Wozniacki, hampered by a viral illness and dizziness, rallied to beat No 32 Maria Kirilenko 1-6, 6-1, 6-4. Five games into the match, Wozniacki required treatment from a trainer, who checked her blood pressure before the match resumed.

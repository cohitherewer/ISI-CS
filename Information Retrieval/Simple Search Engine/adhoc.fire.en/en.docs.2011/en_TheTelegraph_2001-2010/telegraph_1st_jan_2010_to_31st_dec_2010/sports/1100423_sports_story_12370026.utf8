            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians were expected to take a call on their captain Sachin Tendulkars availability for their maiden Indian Premier League final a day before the match, the team management informed on Thursday.         
	The final, against the Chennai Super Kings, is scheduled to be held on Sunday.         
	The Super Kings overcame the challenge of defending champions the Deccan Chargers by 38 runs in the second semi-final on Thursday. Doug Bollinger was declared the Man of the Match for taking four wickets giving away a meagre 13 runs.         
	The team will take a call on Tendulkar on April 24. As of now, the situation remains the same as it was last night (Wednesday), a Mumbai Indians spokesperson said.         
	Tendulkar split the webbing on his right hand while attempting a low catch on Wednesday. He needed five stitches to treat the wound.         
	However, the Mumbai side heaved a sigh of relief after key all-rounder Kieron Pollard was declared fit ahead of Sundays final. There is no problem with Pollard. Hes fit, team sources said here.         
	In the semi-final, against the Royal Challengers, Pollard was seen limping while batting as well as bowling even though it did not stop the West Indian from dishing out a superb all-round display.         
	He had some cramps, but hes okay now, the sources added.         
	The all-rounder struck a belligerent 33 not out in 13 balls with three sixes and then picked up three crucial wickets while bowling. He effected a run out as well to bag the Man of the Match award as the Mumbai Indians won the match by 35 runs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win tie for Germans
                                                                                                                       7                                        Must-win tie for Germans
  - Brazil-born Cacau to start upfront in place of suspended Klose

	Johannesburg: Former champions France have already made the most dishonourable exit from the first round while defending champions Italy and England are yet to confirm their last-16 berth. On Wednesday, if Ghana beat three-time champions Germany, it could be the most telling blow to European football.         
	As of now, Ghana are leading the Group D points table with four points. They are followed by Germany and Serbia with three points each and Australia have managed a point. While all four teams stand a chance of making the second round, all are at a risk of crashing out also.         
	Joachim Loew is under tremendous pressure as a defeat will certainly mean an end to his stint as German coach. Speculation is rife that former defender Matthias Sammer who works as the sports director of DFB or German Football Association, is waiting in the wings to replace Loew, one of the tactical architects of Germanys third place finish in the last World Cup. So tensed is Loew at the moment that he cancelled the training session at the Soccer City stating that he wanted to spare his players from a long bus ride from Erasmia.         
	He has even banned the team management from providing the players with updates the other match to be played simultaneously between Serbia and Australia in Nelspruit on Wednesday.         
	We should concentrate on our game, Loew said. Maybe in the end, if its all clear, we will know what has happened there, Loew said.         
	The coach, however, put up a brave front when he turned up for the official media briefing.         
	Germany had been in similar situation two years ago, he said and pointed out how his team advanced to the next round after being faced with a must-win situation against Austria in the 2008 European Championships.         
	I know, Ghana will be charged up as they are the only African nation who have a realistic chance of qualifying to the next round, Loew said. Its not going to be a piece of cake, but we are confident that we have what it takes to beat Ghana.         
	Germany started the campaign on a roaring note, beating Australia 4-0 but were surprisingly beaten 1-0 by Serbia. Ghana, without their best player, Michael Essien, beat Serbia but drew with Australia in the next match.         
	The Serbia match was a disaster, Loew said. The impression I have is that they are not showing nervousness or doubt. But Ghana is a physical and robust team. It will be mentally and physically very demanding on our players, Loew said.         
	Germany are likely to start with Brazil-born striker Cacau as a replacement for Miroslav Klose, who has to sit out because of one-match suspension.         
	The presence of Kevin-Prince Boateng, whose tackle in the FA Cup final put Germany captain and striker Michael Ballack out of the World Cup, would be another interesting aspect of the match. Boatengs half brother, Jerome is a Germany defender.         
	Boateng was accused by a section of the German media of deliberately injuring Ballack and the Ghana player complained that the hostile reaction had racist elements.

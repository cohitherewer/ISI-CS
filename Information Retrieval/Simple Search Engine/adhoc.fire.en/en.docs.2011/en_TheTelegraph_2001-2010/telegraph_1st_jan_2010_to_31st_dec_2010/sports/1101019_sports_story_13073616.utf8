	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Monday introduced a new Code of Conduct for its international and domestic players in line with the recommendations made by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for creating awareness among cricketers about anti-corruption laws.         
	Pakistans new team manager Intikhab Alam said the code of conduct would be effective immediately and all players selected for the series against South Africa must sign it unconditionally before leaving for the UAE.         
	Anyone who does not sign it will be dropped from the team, Intikhab said.         
	The former Test captain said the new code of conduct had been revised keeping in mind the suggestions made by the ICC with lot of stress on creating awareness among players about anti-corruption laws.         
	We dont want a repeat of what happened in England. The idea of the new code is to make the players aware of their responsibilities with reference particularly to the anti-corruption laws of the ICC, Intikhab said.         
	He said the board had given him increased powers to deal with indiscipline and misconduct.         
	The Pakistan selectors Monday named young opener Shahzaib Hasan and pace bowler Wahab Riaz in the squad for the Twenty20 and ODI series against the Proteas. The inclusions come after the pairs outstanding performance in last weeks domestic Twenty20 competition.         
	The selectors had earlier ignored both the players while announcing a 15-member side for the forthcoming series against the Proteas in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	Senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf has suffered a hamstring strain just five days before the national team leaves for Abu Dhabi to play against South Africa.         
	He has been advised three days rest from the training camp currently underway in Lahore.         
	He should be okay in three days time, but for the moment he has been told to rest, coach Waqar Younis said.         
	Meanwhile, the PCB has decided to send video footage to ICC of the recently held National Twenty20 Cup in Lahore as part of its efforts to convince the games apex body about the security situation at home.         
	According to a top PCB official: The video footage will show the ICC how security arrangements were made for the popular tournament that featured almost all the top players of the country and attracted huge crowds.         
	The step is aimed at convincing the ICC and its member nations to help resume international cricket in Pakistan, he added.

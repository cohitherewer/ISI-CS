The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith props up Proteas
                                                                                                                       7                                      Smith props up Proteas
                      
	Dubai: South Africa dealt a blow to a listless Pakistan bowling attack by racking up 311 for three including captain Graeme Smiths 22nd Test century on the first day of the first Test, here.         
	Smith, who reached his half-century off 93 balls from the first ball after lunch, needed just another 58 deliveries to bring up his century as he looked to take the attack to the bowlers during the days middle session.         
	However, the left-hander who struck eight fours during his knock, departed to the next ball that he faced after reaching his ton when his attempted pull shot off left-arm swing bowler Wahab Riaz was caught by Taufeeq Umar on the deep midwicket fence.         
	Everyone in the top order, including opener Alviro Petersen (67), Hashim Amla (80) and Jacques Kallis (53 not out) helped themselves to a half-century on a benign pitch at Dubai International Cricket Stadium, on Friday.         
	Smith and Alviro Petersen had combined for a first-wicket stand of 153, with Petersen weighing in with 67.         
	Pakistan also suffered a setback when Mohammed Yousuf had to pull out at the last moment because of a groin injury. Yousuf injured himself in practice before the start of the game and has been advised to rest for 10 days, meaning he will miss the second Test too.

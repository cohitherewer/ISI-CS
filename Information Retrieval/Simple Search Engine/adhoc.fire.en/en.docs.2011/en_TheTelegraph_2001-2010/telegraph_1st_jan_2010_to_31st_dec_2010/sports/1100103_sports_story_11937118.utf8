	Calcutta: Treta Bhatatcharyya drubbed Aandrita Deb 6-0, 6-0 to win the womens singles title at the Calcutta Gymkhana Grasscourt Championship on Saturday.         
	Treta, who won the national doubles grasscourt partnering Shivika Burman recently, played a flawless game to beat Aandrita. Such was her dominance that Treta didnt drop a single game during the whole tournament.         
	In the mens singles final, Vinod Sewa beat younger brother Manoj in three sets 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-3. Manoj was leading 5-2 in the first set when Vinod came back strongly to level proceedings. Vinod then kept his cool to win the tie-breaker. Manoj made no mistake in the second set as he led 5-3. He then went on to hold his serve as he closed the set at 6-4.         
	With one set all, Vinod made a strong start as he broke Manoj twice to go 3-0 up in the final set. That eventually helped him to clinch the final as Manoj never recovered from the service break. Vinod finally won the decider 6-3.         
	Aandrita who was literally humiliated by Treta in the womens singles however had something to cheer about when she won the girls under-18 final of the AITA Talent Series meet happening simultaneously at the same club. The second seed Aandrita beat top seed Arundhati Basu 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.         
	The most impressive was Shreya Das who won the girls under-14 final defeating Priyam Periwal 6-4, 6-4. It was battle between the top seed and second seed but Shreya played a fantastic game to break Priyam in each set to win the match.The last match of the day was a hard-fought battle between second seed Sanjiv Kerketta and eighth seed Mohammed Azhar. Sanjiv beat Azhar 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.

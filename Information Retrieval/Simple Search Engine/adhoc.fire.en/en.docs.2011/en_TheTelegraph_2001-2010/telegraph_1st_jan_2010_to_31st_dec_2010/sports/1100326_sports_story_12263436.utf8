            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: India captain Bhaichung Bhutia Thursday said that state teams should be allowed to take part in the I-League so as to improve the standard of Indian football.         
	The states should have their own teams and they should be involved in the I-league in the future. States can bring in more players than a club team can, Bhaichung said on the sidelines of the India International Sports Summit.         
	The state teams can take help from their respective governments like getting funds among other things. Since they have to pick players from a wide pool, they will have trials and selections. That will make sure the best come up. Clubs on the other hand, sign players directly and there is a limit to how many they can sign, he added.         
	There is a lot of ambiguity, at present, in the way contracts are signed  There must be a universal contract for players across the country, he said. The AIFF must also make sure that the I-League clubs have programmes for youth development.         
	Abhinav Bindra and Geet Sethi spoke on the topic 20 Medals in 2020.         
	Bindra said that while top sporting nations have already put in place a plan for the 2020 Games, in India, we are looking at the next two years and our vision beyond Commonwealth Games is blurred.

	New Delhi: Reigning woman national champion Poulami Ghatak feels Chinese-origin paddlers will give stiff competition in the Commonwealth Games to teams like England and hosts India.         
	China is not among the 71 nations and territories who participate in the Commonwealth Games but countries such as Singapore have become forces to reckon with in the table tennis game by offering nationality to many a Chinese players.         
	And in the Games, when the womens team try to improve upon their 2006 bronze medal winning performance, these China-born paddlers will surely pose a big threat.         
	China does not play Commonwealth Games, but except India and England almost all the other countries have at least two Chinese players in their squads. So you can say the level of competition in Commonwealth Games has surely gone up over the years, Poulami said.         
	The experienced Indian also knows that her journey in the multi-discipline event is not going to be a mere cakewalk with.         
	Singapore is No. 1 in table tennis and Malaysia also have a good team. Besides these two, we have to overcome stiff challenge from Australia, England and Canada. Then there are New Zealand and Nigeria as well, she added.         
	Poulami, who will spearhead the Indian charge, said after two years of preparations, now its time to reap the benefits of her hard work in front of the home crowd.         
	My preparation was good. We started preparations for the Delhi Games two years ago and now the time has come. We are all prepared to face any challenge and everyone in the squad is in good shape, Poulami said.         
	We are not thinking about the medals right now but just aiming to give our best in the Games, which will see some tough competition in the table tennis section. But if we can play well, the medals will come automatically. We need not think about it separately, she said.         
	She is also ready to handle the pressure of expectation. There will be pressure of expectation. But, it is always encouraging when so many people support you and want you to succeed. Thats a good thing, she said.         
	As part of their preparation for the Games, Indian team has toured China as many as five times in last 12 months and the experienced paddler admitted those exposure trips will help them when table tennis competitions start on October 4 at Yamuna Sports Complex.

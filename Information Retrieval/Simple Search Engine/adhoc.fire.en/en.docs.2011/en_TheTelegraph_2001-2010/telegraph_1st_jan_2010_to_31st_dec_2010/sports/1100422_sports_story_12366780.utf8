  -   3-1 win over Mahindra takes club to third position
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bagans Edeh Chidi vies for the ball with Mahindras Kali Alauddin, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: During the 2005-06 season, when Biswajit Bhattacharya was appointed interim coach at Mohun Bagan, the green-and-maroon brigade which was languishing at the bottom of the table went on to finish an impressive third.         
	Something similar is happening this season with Bhattacharya back in the hot seat after replacing Satyajit Chatterjee.         
	The wheel of fortune seems to have turned the other way as Biswajits boys completed a Mission Mumbai on Wednesday  after thrashing Mumbai FC 4-0, Bagan made short work of another Mumbai outfit, Mahindra United, beating them 3-1 in their round 21 I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Bagan are now third on the table with 32 points from 21 matches. Churchill Brothers are also on 32 points but have a match in hand.         
	One could understand David Booths anger when someone asked the Mahindra coach how it felt being unable to beat Bagan even once this season.         
	One cant blame the British coach as the defeat put paid to any hopes Mahindra had of winning the title. Even referee S. Sureshs benevolence in awarding a dubious penalty wasnt good enough to save the Red Devils.         
	Bagan surged ahead in the 10th minute when Edeh Chidi entered the box through the left, beat Kali Alauddin with a half turn and then set it up for Ryuji Sueoka who finished the formality.         
	However, it was referee Sureshs poor decision that saw Mahindra draw level. Mohammed Rafi went to ground in the penalty area after colliding with Deepak Mondal. The referee appeared convinced by Rafis play-acting and awarded a spot-kick which was duly converted by Tthe Mahindra striker.         
	Subair Muritala Alis absence, though, became a factor for Mahindra as they didnt have the sting in their attack.         
	Led by Marcos Pereira, Bagan had a good day in office as they controlled the midfield right from the start.         
	Although Barreto didnt fire like he did on the previous day, he was mobile upfront and kept the Mahindra defence busy. It was the Brazilian who was instrumental in restoring Bagans advantage on the stroke of half-time.         
	Chidi slipped a defence splitting through ball that saw Barreto charge into the box. The Brazilian was brought down by goalie Subhashish Roy Chowdhury when he was just about to round him off. It was Chidi who took the resultant spot-kick that crashed into the net.         
	The introduction of James Singh in place of Manish Mathani in the second half increased the intensity of the attacks. With Surkumar Singh disturbing the rival defence with speedy bursts down the right, the third goal came in the 69th minute. Surkumar entered the box and his low cross, which was fended off by Subhashish, fell for an unmarked Snehasish who tapped it home.         
	Teams         
	Mohun Bagan: Shilton Paul, Biswajit Saha, Deepak Mondal, N.S. Manju, Surkumar Singh, Snehasish Chakraborty, Marcos Pereira, Ryuji Sueoka (Tomba Singh, 90+1), Manish Mathani (James Singh 45+2), Jose Barreto (Mickey Fernandes, 85), Edeh Chidi

	MoM: Edeh Chidi

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Striker Sunil Chetri is set to join the Indian team in Portugal in the next few days. According to sources in All India Football Federation (AIFF), Chetri, who is currently playing for the American side, Kansas City Wizards, would soon be released by the MLS club for national camp.         
	The deal for Chetris release has been finalised from our side, said a senior AIFF official. A letter has already been sent to Chetris agent and if everything goes off well, Chetri should be back in Delhi by next week. In that case, the federation would send the player to Portugal almost immediately, added the official.         
	The AIFF, it is believed, has agreed to pay Chetri his salary for the next six months until the Asian Cup in Doha in January 2011. The payment will be made as per his contract with Kansas City Wizards. The AIFF has also agreed to compensate the footballer with the money that he was supposed to receive fromKansas City for selling his image rights to the club.         
	Sources say the AIFF is under mense pressure from national coach Bob Houghton to get Chetri released as soon as possible.         
	But the AIFF official made it clear that neither Kansas City nor the agent of Chetri would be paid for the strikers release.

	Karachi: Criticising incumbent Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt for his poor administrative policies, former captain Zaheer Abbas has expressed his desire to head the PCB if hes asked to do so.         
	Abbas said when Butt took over as PCB chairman two years back, he had high expectations from him but the veteran administrator turned out to be a big disappointment.         
	If anyone does approach me to head the board, I will accept it as a challenge, Abbas said Wednesday. (PTI)

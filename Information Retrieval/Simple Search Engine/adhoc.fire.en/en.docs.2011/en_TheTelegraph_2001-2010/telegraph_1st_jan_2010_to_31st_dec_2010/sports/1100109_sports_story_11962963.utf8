The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hockey camp boycotted
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hockey camp boycotted
    - India Players up in arms over outstanding payments             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Pune/Chennai: Indian hockey was coming to grips with a fresh crisis Friday after the senior mens team boycotted the ongoing camp for the World Cup for an indefinite period to protest non-payment of dues.         
	The players took the unprecedented step with Hockey India (HI), the interim body managing the affairs of the game in the country, showing no signs of sorting out the payments dispute despite receiving two letters demanding that the outstanding payments for the Champions Challenge meet in Argentina be cleared.         
	We have decided to boycott the camp indefinitely, till we are paid our money. We took the decision at a meeting of the players last (Thursday) night, captain Rajpal Singh said.         
	Earlier, we used to be paid after every tournament but it is not the case now. We reminded the HI officials a few times, but nothing was done. We will now report at the camp only after getting paid, Rajpal added.         
	No bonus or incentive is offered nowadays but previously the players were paid more than Rs 1 lakh each for a successful campaign. However, they got nothing after last years Azlan Shah triumph. Neither were there any rewards for their bronze medal run at the Champions Challenge tournament in Argentina. But, in any case, it is the match fees for that meet which the players are yet to receive.         
	A player told The Telegraph: We work for our respective companies and government departments. In the last few months, we havent played a single match for these because they (HI) held continuous camps. We are paid by our employers but not by those for whom we play round the year.         
	With the hockey World Cup, in New Delhi, just round the corner, this crisis is bound to have a bearing on the preparations for the high-profile event, scheduled from February 28 to March 13.         
	Stung by the players move, HI Friday threatened to take strict action against them for their gross act of indiscipline.         
	In a letter to Jose Brasa and Harendra, Mattoo said it was a matter of great regret that instead of waiting for the outcome of Saturdays meeting, the players maligned us.         
	Mattoos letter, circulated in the media here, has him saying: I and my colleagues sympathise with their (the players) request and we will do all that is possible for us in the given circumstances. But abstaining from training is a gross act of indiscipline. HI would not hesitate in taking strict action against the players for this violation.         
	Stating that he was looking forward to meeting the players on Saturday, Mattoo asked the two coaches to advise the players to lift the boycott.         
	HI had called some of the senior players for a meeting in New Delhi on Saturday and six seniors  Rajpal, Sardara Singh, Prabhjot Singh, Sandeep Singh, Tushar Khandekar and Arjun Halappa  who were due in the city on Saturday, to attend a promotional, are expected to meet HI officials.         
	The senior players were annoyed by the delay in payments and had written a letter to Mattoo demanding that the money be paid within seven days.         
	The letter made no mention of a pullout but sources said the players had decided to withdraw from the camp if the payments did not land in time.         
	The players are claiming they had set a January 8 deadline but Mattoos contention is that he was aware of no such stipulation.         
	Rajpal said the players were forced to take such a step because HI did not care for them.         
	HI does not care for the players, it is very sad. The sponsors are paying, but the players dont get anything, he said.         
	Apart from their dues, the players are also demanding an increase in pay along with incentives.         
	The view in some quarters is that all the politicking for the upcoming HI elections had spilled over into the players camp with vested interests and rival factions pursuing their own agenda.         
	Head coach Brasa sought to stay out of the controversy though, saying what the boys needed at the moment was practice.         
	Most crucial thing is practice Things need to be solved. But I am not the person to talk to about these problems, Brasa said.

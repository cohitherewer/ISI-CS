                                                                                                                       7                                      Rivals in awe of Dhoni,   says Laxman
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman, who shared an undefeated 259-run seventh wicket partnership with Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday, feels his skipper is the most destructive batsman in contemporary cricket.         
	Laxman, at a news conference, dedicated his 15th Test hundred to wife Sailaja.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	The Eden and his success         
	It feels really good to play at the Eden. I have always enjoyed playing here. The people in Calcutta are always so warm and affectionate I always love coming here. I am glad that I was able to maintain the good record even this time around.         
	Completing 1000 runs at the Eden         
	 It will remain very special to get 1000 runs at a venue.         
	On delivering in tough situations         
	It always gives a lot of satisfaction when you perform and contribute for the team. I always enjoy batting in a tough situation and deliver for the side.         
	His unbeaten 143-run innings         
	It was very crucial in the morning as we had lost three quick wickets yesterday (Monday). (Amit) Mishra really played well and got the momentum back playing attacking shots. Then my partnership with Dhoni took the game away from the South Africans. I am always happy to take the team out of tough situations.         
	The mood after the Nagpur loss         
	We were quite positive when we went into this Test. Everyone was quite disappointed with the way we lost the Test in Nagpur. We regrouped...         
	Coming back from the injury         
	I was training well in Nagpur and even before the Test series. Trainer Ramji (Srinivasan) was working really hard on my fitness. On the last three days of the Nagpur Test, I had long net sessions and batted using the bowling machine. I was pretty confident coming into this Test.         
	On taking a while to reach his century         
	From 99 to 100, they really bowled beautifully. I was not really looking for my hundred but playing according to the merit of the ball.         
	His partnership with Dhoni         
	We stuck to our plans and just wanted to bat as long as possible and put pressure on South Africa. We are really happy to do that.         
	Their contrasting styles         
	Everyone in our team has specific roles. Its important we play to our strength. We dont try to copy or emulate, thats the beauty of our team         
	Dhonis batting         
	Dhoni is a like an all-rounder. He is such a destructive batsman. You can see it in the body language of the opponents. Whenever Dhoni gets in they become very defensive in the way they bowl and field. I think he is the most destructive batsman in the world at the moment. We are really happy that he is coming at No. 7 and doing the job required. Its also good that he is converting the fifties into big hundreds and whenever he gets a hundred, he gets it in quick pace.         
	If he wants to dedicate the hundred to anyone         
	Today is my marriage anniversary and its great... My wife and kids gave a surprise to me Monday by coming to Calcutta. Definitely, I would like to dedicate this to my wife (Sailaja). She has been a pillar of strength for my family Its tough being wife of a cricketer because we always keep travelling. I want to dedicate this to my wife.         
	On benefiting from the dropped catches         
	Dropping catches are part and parcel of matches. We should not take away the credit from our batters for the way they stuck in there and delivered the goods.         
	Paul Harris being called (wide) for negative bowling         
	I think the rules definitely say so if you bowl negative I am really glad that the umpires got it right.         
	The pitch         
	The pitch is definitely deteriorating There will be a lot of assistance for the spinners. I am sure our spinners will be able to exploit the conditions.         
	Youngsters performance         
	Every youngster who plays for the country knows the responsibility to perform. But I am glad that a lot of youngsters are coming up         
	The moderate turnout         
	Its encouraging that Eden Gardens is going to be renovated. Even though all the galleries were not available, one could see passion in the spectators with every run or wicket... The crowd and passion here are just amazing!         
	On the Deccan Chargers threat to boycott the IPL         
	Were playing a Test now and I am concentrating on that Thats after the Test series.

	New Delhi: Keen to get behind the wheel again after an extended break, Hispania driver Karun Chandhok is expecting the new updates to pay off in Sundays Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona.         
	Hispania Racing, the lone Spanish F1 team, head to their home Grand Prix for the fifth round of the FIA Formula One World Championship after a two-car finish in China last month. The team are working overtime to ready the car for the remainder of the season and Karun is optimistic that the updates will pay off in Barcelona.         
	I am looking forward to racing again after the extended break. I really enjoy driving here as the circuit is a real challenge with a complete mix of high speed and slower technical sections, the Chennai driver said from Barcelona.         
	Unlike the other teams we did not have a chance to test the car in the pre-season but we have couple of updates for the car this weekend that should give us a clearer picture for the season ahead, he said.

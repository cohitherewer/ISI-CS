The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger off to a good start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger off to a good start
                      
	Kohler: Tiger Woods buried memories of his nightmare finish at last weeks WGC-Bridgestone Invitational with a perfect start at the 92nd US PGA Championship Thursday.         
	The American world No.1, who arrived at Whistling Straits after producing the worst PGA Tour performance of his career, birdied three of the first four holes of the opening round to move into a tie for the early lead.         
	In pursuit of his first major victory since the 2008 US Open, Woods rolled in putts from 10 feet at the 10th and the 11th, after teeing off on the back nine, before sinking a 15-footer at the 13th to get to three under par.         
	That put the four-time PGA champion level with Australian Stuart Appleby, who had completed eight holes, and Germanys Martin Kaymer, after five. Australians Jason Day and Mark Leishman and American left-hander Bubba Watson were among a group of six players bunched at two under.

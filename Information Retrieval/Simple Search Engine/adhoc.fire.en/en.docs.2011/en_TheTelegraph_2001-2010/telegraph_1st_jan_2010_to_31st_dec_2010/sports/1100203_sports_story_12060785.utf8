            A STAFF REPORTER            Lajong FCs Daniel Bidemi (left) and S. Tuboi discuss a point with coach Stanley Rozario during practice at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Lajong FC will look to shrug off their away-match blues when they take on Chirag United in an I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday.         
	In the six away matches they have played so far, the Federation Cup runners-up managed only a win that too against whipping boys Sporting Club de Goa some months back. And to survive in the I-League Stanley Rozarios boys need to win some on the road.         
	Lajong on Wednesday will be missing Nepal striker Anil Gurung, who is on national duty for the ongoing South Asian Games in Dhaka. Apart from Gurung, Lajong will be without Marlanki Suiting, Romeo, Boithang and Michael Blassy due to injuries.         
	Injuries in fact have hampered the Northeast side this season and given the strength of the bench it will be quite a task if the Marlankis dont return to action soon.         
	Injuries are a problem. But we cant do much about it. On Wednesday, we will try to look for a point atleast, coach Rozario said.         
	Chirag will be missing reliable defender Eduardo Chacon who is sitting out due to a double booking. And Joshimar skipped the morning practice session with an upset stomach. I will be playing the match, assured the Brazilian on Tuesday.         
	Lajong are hoping to make the most of Eduardos absence and S Tubois speed will prove quite a handful for the likes of Arnab Mondal and Kingshuk Debnath. Chirag, who started quite strongly in the I-League are now showing signs of nervousness and a loss to Pune FC the other day should give coach Subrata Bhhatcharya something to ponder about.         
	Like it or not, barring the Brazilians  Edmilson, Joshimar and Eduardo  this team doesnt have any good name which will give any rival coach a sleepless night. The Denson Devdas, Shylo Malswamtuangas are good but winning matches consistently with them? Not possible.

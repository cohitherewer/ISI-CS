The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Only a miracle can save Kochi now
                                                                                                                       7                                      Only a miracle can save Kochi now
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Kochi franchise was relying on a miracle to keep them in the IPL after talks between the promoters and investors, on Tuesday, failed to resolve their differences over share-holding pattern.         
	The crisis-ridden team seemed to have reached a point of no return after Rendezvous Sports World Pvt. Ltd., the promoters, rejected an offer from the investors to hold 20 per cent full equity without voting or managing rights, a source close to the development told The Telegraph. They were giving us shares without any authority. After putting in place the bid and winning the franchise rights, we would not be able to vote, nor attend meetings. We rejected it and walked out of the meeting, the source said.         
	The Rendezvous-led consortium would be terminated if they fail to meet the deadline set by the BCCI in a show-cause notice asking them to set up a joint venture company. Neither T Keshav, who represents the investors  Anchor Earth, Parinee Developers, Rosy Blue and Film Wave  nor Vivek Venugopal, who has one per cent stake in the consortium as an individual, could be reached for comment.The source alleged that the investors, who were served a legal notice by RSW last week, were actually stalling talks because they did not want to register the company at all.         
	They are not deep pocketed as they originally thought they were. They want to get away with the loss of Rs 46 crore that they have invested so far instead of suffering Rs 100 crore every year for the next five years, the source said.         
	The source further added that the investors were emboldened by the fact that the BCCI would not hold back the bank guarantee (Rs 153 crore) that was paid at the time of bidding.As per the agreement signed by the investors at the time of bidding, RSW would have 25 per cent free equity, the right to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the joint venture company to be incorporated and also representation in the managing committee.         
	However, the investors seemed to have developed cold feet about giving RSW a controlling stake in the franchise.The investors seem to have demanded that RSW invest for the 25 per cent equity and give up the voting rights. In turn, the Gaikwads had offered to reduce their stakes to 20 per cent but with all the rights guaranteed as per the agreement, which the investors still did not find acceptable. When contacted, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said: I dont want to comment on a hypothetical situation. They have time till 6pm tomorrow.

	Karachi: Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi and chief coach Waqar Younis had asked for the inclusion of out-of-favour Shoaib Malik in the T20 and ODI squad for the South Africa series, but the national selectors overruled their suggestion and named Younis Khan instead.         
	Afridi and Waqar had asked selectors to replace injured Mohammed Yousuf with all-rounder Malik for the two Twenty20 and five-match ODI series against the Proteas, to be played in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	PCB and the national selectors didnt agree with the suggestions coming from the captain and coach and opted to go for Younis Khans inclusion in the team, reported a Pakistan daily.         
	Yousuf was ruled out of the limited-over series against the Proteas, beginning October 26, after he ruptured a muscle in his right leg.         
	Malik has been named the captain for the Super Sixes series to be played in Hong Kong.         
	However, on Thursday, Waqar welcomed the return of Younis.         
	It is a great for Pakistan cricket that he (Younis) is back. It will be good for the team. He has performed a lot for Pakistan and proven his worth, Waqar said.         
	Talking to the media at the conclusion of a conditioning camp for the South Africa series, Waqar also made it clear that he was hoping senior batsman Yousuf would be fit in time for the Tests.         
	Yousuf and Younis are proven performers and their presence in the middle order will give us a lot of stability. We need them against a top side like South Africa. I am hoping Yousuf will also be available for the Tests, he said.         
	Younis, meanwhile, said that he is happy that the ordeal is finally over and he is back to playing for his country.         
	Younis, one of the seven players who were banned by PCB after their forgettable tour of Australia, had to deal with some torrid times after the Board decided not to select him even though they had lifted the ban.         
	I am happy to be back and eager to play for my country I am available to play in all three forms of the game and its up to the management to play me whenever they want, Younis said.         
	There was some misunderstanding and I am happy that it is over now. It has helped me focus on my cricket.         
	I have joined the training camp and am fit to play as soon as I am given the chance. I am eager to do my best for the team, he added.         
	He also said that he is not interested in captaincy anymore.         
	To play for my country is my only desire. I am not in the race for captaincy, said Younis. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar slips to tied 25th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhullar slips to tied 25th
                            
	The Punjab-pro, who was the only one to shoot a bogey-free round on the opening day of tournament that has become a 54-hole affair due to weather-disruptions, stumbled to as many as seven bogeys against a couple of birdies in the second round.         
	The conditions were quite tough. I didnt hit the ball as good as yesterday (on Friday). I missed a lot of fairways and the iron play wasnt up to the mark. I missed so many greens in regulation, which caused my high scoring today, Bhullar said.         
	This year, Ive been starting well but have not been able to keep pace. Its just a lesson for me, he added.         
	Among other Indians, SSP Chowrasia (76) and Anirban Lahiri (73) just about managed to make the cut at the tied 56th spot with totals of five-over 147. However, it was curtains for C Muniyappa, whose nightmarish 78, left him with a total of 10-over 152, five strokes adrift of the cut-line.         
	Local Ryuchi Oda, who is searching for his second victory in Japan, held the lead with a total of four-under 138 after carding a 70 in the second round.

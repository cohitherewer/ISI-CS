The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poor finish by Indians
                                                                                                                       7                                      Poor finish by Indians
                      
	Doha: Jyoti Randhawa signed off with a modest one-under 71 to finish tied 57th but Shiv Kapur went 76, his worst card of the week, for a share of the 64th place in the Qatar Masters golf tournament here on Sunday.         
	Randhawa totalled five-over 293 with his second sub-par round of the week to join five others in the 57th place, one shot ahead of Kapur.         
	Randhawa did not have a great start with bogeys on the third and fifth holes pushing him onto the back foot but the lanky Indian sunk birdies on the seventh, 10th and 16th holes to finish with a sub-par card.         
	In Kapurs case, the double bogeys on the sixth and 14th holes marred his card.         
	Meanwhile, Swedens Robert Karlsson won his first individual trophy for 16 months when he captured the Qatar Masters title.         
	The 40-year-old Ryder Cup player shot a closing seven-under-par 65, the lowest round of the week, for a 15-under tally of 273 to finish three ahead of holder Alvaro Quiros of Spain (67).         
	Briton Lee Westwood, playing alongside Karlsson, saw his chance of victory vanish when he three-putted the par-four 16th for bogey.         
	Westwood eventually carded a 70 to share third place on 11-under with Australias Brett Rumford (69).           (AGENCIES)

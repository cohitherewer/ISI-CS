The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big challenge, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Big challenge, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT          
	 Team India go into the third and final Test on Tuesday having girded their loins and strengthened their resolve that they will level this series.                           
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni knows that it has to be his team that have to take the initiative in this match because a draw would suit Sri Lanka just as well, giving them a 1-0 win. On the eve of what, therefore, is a crucial match for the No.1 Test side in the world, Dhoni, understandably, held his cards close to his chest and assured media persons that the only way to learn what XI takes the field for the last Test was to wait till Tuesday morning.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The challenge at hand         
	We are 0-1 down, so the best we can do is level the series. It will be a big challenge. We have to maintain whatever momentum we got from the second Test. We have to see that the result of the Test is in our favour. We will have to be the team that takes the extra initiative because, even if the Test ends in a draw, Sri Lanka will win the series. We have to be careful how aggressive we can get but, at the same time, you have to see whats the best you can do in this match.         
	Team news         
	You mean the injury list. Gautam Gambhir is injured and wont play. Harbhajan Singh is doubtful. He went for a run last evening and developed a niggle. We will take a call on him in the morning. Gautam is definitely out.         
	Yuvraj Singh/Suresh Raina conundrum         
	Thats a difficult one. You have a half-an-hour serial to run today and tomorrow (Tuesday). So, I will protect the decision till tomorrow morning.         
	On Anil Kumbles code that no matter how good a stand-in player does, the first choice cricketer would get back his place         
	But this can change         
	Thoughts on the P. Sara wicket         
	There is a bit of grass on the wicket, but its not green. It looked very different yesterday (Sunday) from what it is now. There may be a bit of bounce. We thought the same about the pitch at SSC, but there really was nothing for the fast bowlers. We are hoping, because the stands are a bit low, there will be a bit of breeze blowing, which may favour the fast bowlers. But I think that as the game progresses, the spinners might get some bounce with turn.         
	Possibility of playing three seamers         
	Well, you have to see if thats the best bowling attack youve got. It doesnt look like an outright seeming track where you will get a lot of help. You have to see if, overall, it is the spinners or the fast bowlers who can help you. We will have a discussion with the senior players and the coach but, as of now, its a bit unlikely that we will play with a 3-1 attack.         
	Reverse swing         
	We have not been able to get the reverse swing going. One of the reasons being our bowling on a fresh track after losing both tosses. To get the Kookaburra ball to reverse is a bit difficult unless the wicket is scuffed up or is dry. But in this game, we are hoping we can get the reverse swing going because it really helps the fast bowlers to get a wicket in the middle of the innings.         
	The sight screen         
	We have requested the screen on the score board end to be increased in height because Sachin (Tendulkar) is short and when you have a tall baller bowling to him at an angle, it becomes a bit tough to see the ball. We have requested before the game so that no complications arise during it.         
	On Sachin         
	We speak so much about Sachin. When he is on the field he can really make a difference. His impact on the dressing room is great. The way he helps the youngsters, the way he can help you make strategies, its really amazing. For the past twenty years he has been doing that... Whatever happens, when he turns up on the field, he gives his 200 per cent. I just hope there is plenty more to come from him in Tests and ODIs. Hopefully he comes up with a big score in this game.

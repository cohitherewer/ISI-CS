The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jennings: India will miss Uthappa
                                                                                                                       7                                        Jennings: India will miss Uthappa
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Robin Uthappa                           
	Mumbai: The Royal Challengers Bangalore coach Ray Jennings on Friday said that his players were professional enough to put behind the semi-final loss and give their best in the third-place play-off against Deccan Chargers.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the teams preparation         
	The nets werent good. The pitch was under-prepared and it leads to poor training methods and poor intensity so, we shortened the net session.         
	Helping the team recover from the semi-final defeat         
	Its a tough job. Obviously the guys are very disappointed that they werent in the final but thats professional sport. The important thing is for the guys to understand that winners are guys that come back after a loss. I suppose the Deccan Chargers have got one day shorter than we have got. Its going to be tough for their side as well as ours. Hopefully, our sides a lot more professional than the opposition.         
	On paper, RCB are the favourites...         
	Games are not won on paper. The important thing in 20-over cricket is the combination of bowling, batting and fielding that work together as units. We cant have a situation where we bowled well but last five overs go for 77 and then expect to get a score thats really a way above par score. Paper really is quite irrelevant.         
	Unlucky Uthappa         
	I am very surprised that they have left Robin out of the World T20. Hes a really exciting, damaging type of cricketer. As a second wicket-keeper as well, he has kept really well and he has batted well. Every time he has got in, he has got a 200 per cent strike rate. His presence is going to be missed. I am very surprised that they havent tried him. I dont know if they can include him because they didnt include him in the original 30. But to me, he would definitely be missed by India.         
	Dip in Kallis form         
	Yes, I think Kallis has gone off a little bit on his form but he is a world-class cricketer and he can get form at any stage. In this tournament, its quite easy to go off form ... We are aware of Kallis form but again, the Deccan Chargers wont be happy to bowl against Kallis because he is a world-class cricketer.         
	On Mumbais chances in final         
	Sachin (Tendulkar) is the key guy in their batting line-up and with his finger, I dont know if he is going to play. If he does play, he might struggle to hold the bat. I dont think Mumbai can afford to lose him.

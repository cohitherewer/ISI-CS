The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wont force Yuvraj to stay back: Kings XI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wont force Yuvraj to stay back: Kings XI
                      
	New Delhi: Kings XI Punjab management Monday said it would not ask Yuvraj Singh to stay back if the star player wants to leave the team after this years Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Reacting to reports that Yuvraj, stripped of captaincy, was keen to switch allegiance to a new IPL franchise apparently showing interest in him, Kings XI Punjab co-owner Amit Burman said if the player has already decided on leaving, there was not much the management could do. If he has given such a hint, what can I do? Its up to him, said a peeved Burman. After the season is over, we will speak to him. But at the end of the day, you cannot force people to stay if they dont want to.         
	Yuvrajs three-year contract with the Punjab side ends this season and speculation is rife that the dashing left-hander, conspicuously out of form this season, is keen to leave.

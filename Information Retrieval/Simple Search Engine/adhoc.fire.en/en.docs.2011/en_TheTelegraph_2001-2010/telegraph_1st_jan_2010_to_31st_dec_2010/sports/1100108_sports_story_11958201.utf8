The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henin digs deep to oust Czink
                                                                                                                       7                                        Henin digs deep to oust Czink
                  Kim Clijsters in Brisbane on Thursday                     
	Sydney: Justine Henin was forced to draw on all her experience and renowned fighting spirit to avoid elimination in her comeback event at the Brisbane International on Wednesday.         
	The former world No. 1, playing her first official tournament in 20 months, was in danger of bowing out in the quarter-finals before she managed to squeeze past Hungarian Melinda Czink 6-2, 3-6, 7-6.         
	A final between Henin and compatriot Kim Clijsters remains a distinct possibility after the top seed survived a second-set wobble to beat Czech Lucie Safarova 6-1, 0-6, 6-4.         
	Henin appeared to be in cruise control when she steamed through the opening set in just 31 minutes but Czink took the second before forcing a tiebreak in the third. The Belgian had failed to convert four match points in the 12th game of the final set and missed another two chances in the tiebreak before finally sealing the win on the Pat Rafter centre court.         
	Thats the kind of match that I need, not that long maybe, Henin laughed as she told reporters. Its a perfect preparation for me.         
	The 27-year-old will now play Ana Ivanovic in Fridays semi-finals after the Serbian beat Russian teenager Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 7-6.         
	Its exciting to be able to play so many good matches and now Ana, that is the kind of match that I love, its a great feeling, Henin said.         
	In the mens event, defending champion, Czech Radek Stepanek, beat American Wayne Odesnik 7-6, 6-1 to ease into the last four.         
	Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy advanced to the semi-finals of the doubles event after getting a walkover from the local pair of Ashley Fisher and Stephen Huss here on Thursday. A knee injury to Fisher forced the home favourites to opt put of the quarter-final contest against the top seeded Indo-Czech pair.         
	Paes and Dlouhy will now fight it out with Jurgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner, who shocked third seeded Michale Llodra and Andy Ram in their last-eight pair match of the $372,500 hard court event.         
	The unseeded Austrian-German pair scored a 5-7, 6-2, 10-8 win over the French-Israeli combination.         
	Paes, who gave a miss to ATP Chennai Open to prepare well for the Australian Open, and Dlouhy had beaten Australian Ball Carsten and American Sam Querry 7-5, 6-3 in the first round.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Runs keep Sehwag fit
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: If Sachin Tendulkars passion for playing for the country has kept him going for two decades, it is Virender Sehwags big hundreds, despite a receding hairline, that have helped him burn thousands of calories and kept him fit.         
	Tendulkar and Sehwag were attending a function to unveil Team Indias new attire. The two were accompanied by Harbhajan Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Pragyan Ojha and Gautam Gambhir.         
	I have worked hard to be a part of the Indian team. We are proud to wear the Indian colour and we work hard for it. It makes us feel special. It is wonderful to be in the team as long as I am enjoying it. The key is to continue to work hard, never take anything for granted, try and get better and enjoy every moment And thats what I try to do, Sachin said.         
	Sehwag, on the other hand, said: It is my receding hairline that makes me realise that I too am rich in experience.         
	Sehwag credited his fitness to his recent successful run with the bat in all forms of the game. I look more fitter now because if you score big hundreds, you lose fat and gain in energy, he quipped.         
	Harbhajan, who has been involved in quite a few controversies with the Australian players in the past, quipped it was due to the love that the Aussies had for him.         
	I have many friends in Australia and have always performed well against them. I will try to do well this time too so that when we play again they will talk about me first. They talk about me because they love me a lot, Harbhajan said.         
	The wily off-spinner denied he had become a defensive bowler. People even say I have become a batsman. People say many things about me They may be right when they say I have become a batsman because I score runs But they are wrong when they say I have become a defensive bowler. I am an attacking bowler and I will always play that way, he said.         
	Pragyan Ojha found it embarrassing to mention his age when Tendulkar played his debut Test. I was only three at that time, he whispered, adding that he would like to follow in the footsteps of Harbhajan, whom he considered as his role-model.         
	Zaheer Khan said he was sweating it out to keep fit. I am at a stage where I need work hard on fitness and have been spending a lot of time doing just that, he said.         
	Gambhir termed the series against Australia as challenging. I am looking forward to the series. They are a fine team and it will be an exciting contest, he said.

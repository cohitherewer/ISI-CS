	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has shot letters to three players  Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Fawad Alam  demanding explanations for indiscipline during the ongoing one-day series against South Africa.         
	Sources say the players can be fined heavily for their breaches of the contract. Sources said team manager Intikhab Alam has issued notices to the three players in Dubai.         
	Razzaq has been asked to explain his comments after his century in the second match when he indirectly criticised the team management and coaches, while Akhtar and Fawad have been sent notices for violating curfew hours on the tour, the source said.         
	He said the new code of conduct clauses in the players contracts stipulate that they have to adhere to every rule, and no player was allowed to break curfew timings or give statements against the team management.

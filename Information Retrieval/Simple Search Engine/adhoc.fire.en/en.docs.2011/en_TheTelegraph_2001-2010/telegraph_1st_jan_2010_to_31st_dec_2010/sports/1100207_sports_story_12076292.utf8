	Dubai: A flawless back nine helped Jeev Milkha Singh turn in a two-under 70 and rise to the tied ninth spot after the third and penultimate round of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament here Saturday.         
	The seasoned pros three-round total stood at six-under 210, five strokes off the pace.         
	The other Indians in the fray, Shiv Kapur (71) and SSP Chowrasia (70) also improved their positions by one spot each rising to tied 46th with identical even-par totals.         
	Jeev, who led the pack on the opening day, started off well, finding a birdie on the second hole but was back to par soon after dropping a bogey on the sixth.         
	Even par at the turn, Jeev struck back-to-back birdies on the 15th and 16th to improve slightly on the leader-board.         
	Kapur, on the other hand, managed two birdies against one dropped stroke.         
	Chowrasia, meanwhile, endured an eventful day. The Calcutta-pro found four birdies and a couple of bogeys Saturday.         
	At the top of the leader-board, it was a four-way tie for the lead between Spaniards Miguel Angel Jiminez (68) and Alvaro Quiros (67), Englishman Lee Westwood (68) and Thai Thongchai Jaidee (69). The quartet was tied 11-under after three rounds.           (AGENCIES)

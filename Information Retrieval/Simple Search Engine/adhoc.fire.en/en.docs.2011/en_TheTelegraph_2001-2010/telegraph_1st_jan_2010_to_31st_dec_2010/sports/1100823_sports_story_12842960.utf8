The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger no longer one of a kind
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger no longer one of a kind
            NYT NEWS SERVICE                      
	What on earth is wrong with Tiger Woods? Its true he played a little better at the PGA Championship, where he at least made the cut and finished in a tie for 28th, but lately he has been spraying the ball so badly that even the sternest critics of his personal life  the ones who wanted to ostracise him from golf  have to feel a little sorry for him. At the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone two weeks ago, he looked like a hacker, hitting more trees than fairways on the way to posting a 75 and a 77 in the last two rounds.         
	For Woods, those are shocking, astronomical numbers that gave rise to speculation, unthinkable a few months ago, that maybe he doesnt even belong on the United States Ryder Cup team this fall. When the FedEx playoffs begin at the Barclays this week at Ridgewood Country Club in New Jersey, Woods will carry a rank of 108, his lowest ever.         
	Athletes go through bad spells all the time, and golf has provided some disquieting examples of players who dived into a slump and never pulled out.         
	No one thinks that Woodss collapse is permanent, but even so, we have seldom seen anything quite like it in sports. Whats startling is not so much that he has fallen, but that he has fallen so far and from such an empyrean height  from a level of skill and success that no golfer had ever attained. Its as if one of the gods were now stumbling among us, dazed and vulnerable.         
	The lesson has clearly not been lost on Woodss competitors, who are no longer intimidated by him in quite the same way  they sense hes mortal, after all  and no longer cede him an automatic advantage.         
	Most of his fellow pros seem to think that Woodss problems are in his head, not in his mechanics, and that his game wont return until he straightens out his personal life.         
	Not the least of Woodss woes, it would seem, is that he is too much alone inside his own brain these days. He is estranged from his wife, even from some friends, and he can hardly go anywhere or see anyone without attracting a swarm of the curious and finger-pointing.         
	Woodss recent history is a reminder of how very difficult golf is and of how hard it is even for the best players to sustain a winning game. Its a reminder, too, of how much good golf depends on confidence  on feeling good about yourself, as the self-help gurus say. Good shots inspire more good ones. Bad shots, as any duffer will tell you, lead to even worse ones: the oil starts to spurt up there in your brainpan, the gears begin to screech and the guy working the levers that direct your arms, shift your weight, cock your wrists, throws up his hands in dismay.         
	Whats unusual about Woods is that until recently, he seems not to have had this common experience, or at least not to the degree experienced by others. His stumble might have happened even if he had not made such a mess of his marriage and his reputation. But for whatever reason, he is now playing a kind of golf that looks more nearly like everyone elses, and the experience seems to have discombobulated him.         
	To be a god may not be such a great thing after all. If we didnt learn that from mythology, we know it now from seeing what use Woods made of his godly perks. But to suddenly become a mortal after being awarded locker room privileges on Olympus is surely no fun. He may recover his game, but that most exclusive of clubs wont have him back.

	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkars suggestion of splitting the one-day Internationals into two equal halves of 25 overs each, is to be implemented not by the BCCI but by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).         
	The ECB Thursday decided the format for the two-innings 40-over trial to be played in Second Xl cricket in the coming English domestic season involving 18 first class counties.         
	Each innings of 40 overs will be split into two phases of 20 overs and each team will have 10 wickets at its disposal for its entire innings.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Tanvir will be missed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Tanvir will be missed
                      
	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane admitted that the team will miss Australian all-rounder Shane Watson and Pakistans Sohail Tanvir during IPL-III but is confident that his team has the capability to do well in their absence.         
	Tanvir is a huge loss for us. He took early wickets and bowled well at the depth in the first edition. But we have got Morne Morkel, who is bowling well these days, and Shaun Tait who recently bowled the fastest ball ever recorded in the world. I hope Morkel and Tait will do the job for us, Warne told reporters here over phone from London on Monday.         
	Adding to that, we have Indian bowler Munaf Patel in the side and with his experience, we hope to perform well. In form player like Watson would be very difficult to replace. (PTI)

  - Hosts listless bowling allows Assam to gain first-innings lead on final day       A STAFF REPORTER            Assams Tarjinder Singh (from left), captain Amol Muzumdar, Gokul Sharma and Sridharan Sriram, at the Eden, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Assam left Bengal red-faced by successfully chasing down a colossal target of 562 runs and ended their Ranji match at the Eden Gardens here with three points in their kitty.         
	Riding on some brilliant knocks by domestic veteran Sridharan Sriram (146), Tarjinder Singh (98) and Gokul Sharma (101 not out), Assam completed a seemingly Herculean task with relative ease ending at 588 for six on the fourth and final day. With the draw, Assam now have six points and have placed themselves one spot above Bengal in Group A standings.         
	It was the highest score chased by Assam to win the first innings lead against Bengal.         
	Bengals bowling remained as ineffective as it was on the third day. Sourasish Lahiri scalped the most important wicket of the day in Sriram in his first spell, while Abhishek Jhunjhunwala castled a fire-spitting Tarjinder Singh. Strike bowler Ranadeb Boses attempts, however, remained facile. After getting a respite, when Abhishek Jhujhunwala dropped him at second slip in the 96th over, Konwar was bowled out by Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	Fridays hero Shami Ahmed, too, did not manage to get any breakthrough. Wicket keeper Wriddhiman Saha stood in for skipper Manoj Tiwary who failed to take the field due to ill health. Sriram built on his overnight score of 89 to notch up his 32nd first class hundred. He lost out on a double hundred when Lahiri took a smart catch off his own bowling. Though Srirams dismissal gave the hosts little hope, it was never actually realised.         
	At lunch, Assam were at 398 for five with Singh and Sharma at the crease. For the minnows, help came from unexpected quarters as the duo crafted a sterling sixth wicket partnership of 176 runs. Sharma hit 14 boundaries and one six to score an unbeaten 101, his maiden first class hundred. In the same vein, Singh smashed 15 boundaries to accumulate 98 runs. His last boundary brought in 562 for Assam to level the score. He was dismissed by Jhunjhunwala in the very next ball.         
	The overnight batsmen, Sriram (89) and Arlen Konwar (26), showed determination and a sense of purpose in their range of strokeplay. It almost sounded like Bengals death knell when Sriram smashed Ranadeb Boses first ball of the day for four. Thereafter, it was a barrage of sweep shots and boundaries that filled the day assisted by Bengals mediocre fielding.         
	Bengal looked unimaginative in their bowling and their fielding, too, was questionable at times. Assam skipper Amol Muzumdar, who was ecstatic at his teams performance, said: In 18 years of my career, I have not seen a side chase a 500 plus score and come back strong. Everyone deserves a big cheer. It makes all the effort worth it.         
	Muzumdar felt the result would be a definite fillip before their next match against defending champions Mumbai. This was a learning curve for the entire team. We are hopeful of a better performance ahead (against Mumbai).         
	Bengal coach W.V. Raman harped on the need to learn from mistakes. Of course, it is disappointing. But, we have to try and better ourselves. There are areas of concern that need to be addressed. We have a lot of matches ahead, so I am not giving up hope, he said.         
	Asked if Ashok Dinda could make a difference, Raman said, He was missed for sure, but we should not forget to give credit to Shami (Ahmed) who bowled even with a high temperature, and took three wickets.         
	Meanwhile, Bengals squad for the next two ties was announced. Sourav Sarkar, Sayan Sekhar Mondal, Iresh Saxena and Arnab Nandy were the new additions replacing Ashok Dinda, Rohan Banerjee, Arindam Ghosh and Shiv Sagar Singh. Dinda, Banerjee and Ghosh have been rested due to health concerns, while Singh has been dropped due to poor form.

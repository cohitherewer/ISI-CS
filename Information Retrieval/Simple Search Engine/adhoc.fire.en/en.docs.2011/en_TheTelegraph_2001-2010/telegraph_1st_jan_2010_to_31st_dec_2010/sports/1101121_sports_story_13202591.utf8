                                                                                                                       7                                        Wasnt a hard decision   to bat first, says Vettori
            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Ishant Sharma, in Nagpur,   on Saturday                            
	Nagpur: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori doesnt agree that Brendon McCullums injury before the toss triggered a confusion, which led to a dramatic collapse on the opening day of the final Test.         
	No, I dont think so... Apart from myself, it was not like the other guys got themselves out. It wasnt a hard decision at the toss to bat first. The nature of the wicket was to bat first, Vettori said on Saturday.         
	We were pretty confident that Brendon would come out to bat tomorrow and bat and run normally. Unfortunately, it didnt happen. He still showed what a quality player he is by coming out and playing so well. Brendon has a history of back spasms and they normally take a day to heal. We wanted to bat out the day and have him come out in the middle order, but unfortunately that didnt happen, he said.         
	The New Zealand captain felt that the Indians bowled superbly. You have to give credit to India They bowled well and hit the right areas. The feedback is that its not a 400-500 run wicket It may not be a 400-run pitch, but it wasnt bad for batting either. They bowled well, the spin was slow, but its not a 147 for 7 wicket, Vettori maintained.         
	If we can play hard tomorrow and get some runs, and then take early wickets, we can put the pressure back on India. Theres still lots of cricket left in the game, he said.         
	With Jesse Ryder having aggravated his calf muscle injury during his 59 on Saturday, theres a huge question mark over his participation in the one-day series.

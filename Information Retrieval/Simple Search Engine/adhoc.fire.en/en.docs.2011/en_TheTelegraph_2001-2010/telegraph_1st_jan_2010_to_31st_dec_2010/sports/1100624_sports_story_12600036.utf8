The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt is behind Younis snub
                                                                                                                       7                                      Butt is behind Younis snub
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans chief selector, Mohsin Khan has claimed that the Cricket Board (PCB) didnt give clearance to the national selection committee to consider former captain, Younis Khan for the Test tour to England.         
	Explaining the reason behind not picking Younis, a decision that had caused surprise in the cricketing circle, Mohsin said that PCB Chairman Ijaz Butt didnt give clearance for Youniss selection.         
	Normally if a player is unfit the PCB medical board gives the selection committee clearance for him and if a player has disciplinary issues then the PCB Chairman gives clearance which we didnt get in case of Younis, the former Test opener said.         
	Mohsins statement is likely to cause more bitterness and controversy as the appeals commissioner of the board, Justice (retd) Irfan Qadir had earlier this month lifted an indefinite ban on Younis Khan.         
	The ban was imposed on disciplinary grounds in March when the board banned and fined a total of seven players for misconduct on the tour to Australia early this year.         
	Former captain, Shoaib Malik was also banned for 12-months and fined two million rupees but after his ban was removed by the commissioner, he was picked for the ongoing Asia Cup tournament in Sri Lanka.         
	The appeals commissioner is due to hear the appeal of all rounder, Rana Naved against his ban and fine later this week, a source said.         
	Sources said that Ijaz Butt was unhappy with Younis for the way he had approached the ban issue and for the scathing remarks made by his lawyer against the board and Butt during the hearing process.         
	It is a case of pure personal liking and disliking. If the board can select Shoaib Malik who was accused of intrigue and creating disharmony in the team when he was banned why cant Younis be selected as he remains a honest and upright person, former Test player, Basit Ali said.         
	Younis himself has declined to comment on his exclusion which many former players believe could prove to be a big problem for Pakistan given the brittle nature of the batting. (PTI)

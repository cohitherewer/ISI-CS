The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lleyton dying to have a go at Roger
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lleyton dying to have a go at Roger
            JOE DRAPE                                Roger      
	Melbourne: There is not a more visceral competitor in all of tennis than Australias Lleyton Hewitt. He roars come on after hard-fought points, aims Popeye-styled muscle flexes to the crowd and snarls and stamps as he scrambles about the court. No matter if you love or hate him, you hear him and feel him.         
	In other words, he is nothing like the cool, crisp and efficient Roger Federer, whom he is scheduled to play Monday in the fourth round of the Australian Open. Both are 28 and know each other well. They have met 23 times on some of the games biggest stages  Davis Cup matches, Wimbledon semi-finals and the US Open finals.         
	Hewitt has won seven matches against Federer, but the last time was in 2003, when Hewitt was the worlds top player and already owned titles at the US Open and Wimbledon. Federer gained the top spot the next year and began tightening his grip on the designation as the greatest tennis player ever with a record 15 Grand Slam titles to back it up.         
	The bloke I play next is human, and Id like to get one back on him, Hewitt said, after advancing Saturday when Marcos Baghdatis retired with a shoulder injury.         
	In the next breath, Hewitt conceded that was easier said than done. In fact, he lost to Federer in four sets last summer in the third round of the US Open.         
	He understands that he is running out of Grand Slam opportunities. This is Hewitts 14th Australian Open, and he has played impressively so far. Before Baghdatis retired, Hewitt won the first set, 6-0, with an array of net attacks, slices and drop shots that were executed flawlessly.         
	Now he has another opportunity to get one back from Federer, the man who supplanted him at the top of the sport, who stands in the way of the Slam title Hewitt wants most: the one his country gives.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ian eases into final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ian eases into final
                      
	Marana (US): Ian Poulter stormed into the Accenture Match Play Championship final with a 7 amp;6 victory over Sergio Garcia on Saturday, but the Briton must wait a little longer to discover who he will face over 36 holes for the title.         
	In the second semi-final, Colombias Camilo Villegas and Poulters compatriot Paul Casey were locked all square after five extra holes of their match when play was halted in near darkness at a chilly Dove Mountain.         
	Hopes of an all-English final seemed to have disappeared on the 23rd hole of the titanic struggle as Villegas stood over a three-foot par putt for victory that he could normally sink with his eyes closed.         
	Villegas conspired to miss right of the hole and whether it was difficult to read the break in the gloom or nerves had taken hold, only he really knows, but it was a messy end to a long day that began with the morning quarter finals.         
	I should have made that putt but it is what it is, Villegas told reporters as Casey offered an excuse for his opponent. As if an unsatisfactory conclusion was bad enough, both players also endured miserable conditions early in their match when a cold front came through with heavy rain and blustery winds.         
	In the quarter finals, Poulter edged out Thailands Thongchai Jaidee 1-up while Garcia eased past Britains Oliver Wilson 4 amp;3.           (REUTERS)

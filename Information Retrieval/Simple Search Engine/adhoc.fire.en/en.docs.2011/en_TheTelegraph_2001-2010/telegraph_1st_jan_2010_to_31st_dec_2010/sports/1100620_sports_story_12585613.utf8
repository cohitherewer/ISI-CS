	Durban: Japan coach Takeshi Okada is unhappy that tactics honed in closed practice sessions have been leaked and could benefit the teams Group E opponents.         
	Okada urged his players to guard secret strategies in the wake of Japans 1-0 loss to the Netherlands on Saturday.         
	He did not elaborate on the source of the leaks but indicated that players had been too forthcoming in their comments to Japanese journalists.         
	Details of closed training have been revealed and I think that was unfortunate, the 53-year-old Okada said. I would like to again caution the players on this point.Okada said set-piece strategies are crucial to Japans success in their last group match against Denmark.

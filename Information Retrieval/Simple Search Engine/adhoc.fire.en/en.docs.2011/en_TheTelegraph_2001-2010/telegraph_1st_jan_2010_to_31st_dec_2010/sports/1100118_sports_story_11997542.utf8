      -  The No.1 Test batsman takes guard             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL             Gautam Gambhir                                 
	Chittagong: Gautam Gambhir, the top-ranked batsman in Test cricket, spoke to The Telegraph the other day.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q The year just ended was an outstanding one for you. What are your thoughts?         
	A I look back on 2009 with much satisfaction... We rose to No.1 in Test cricket, but its disappointing that we didnt do well in the two ICC tournaments (the World T20 and the Champions Trophy)...         
	You, too, rose to be the No.1 batsman in Test cricket. Are you driven by rankings?         
	(Grins) Im not driven by rankings and records... More than individual achievements, its the teams success which gives more pleasure.         
	Its not in the distant past that you werent a regular in Tests...         
	I didnt lose motivation and was determined to score big in domestic cricket... Those runs helped.         
	Having tasted international cricket, it surely couldnt have been easy watching India play, on the TV. How did you adjust mentally?         
	It was difficult... The times I was out of the team made me realise I couldnt take my place for granted... Made me aware that I couldnt ever get complacent... Im the type who believes that whatever happens, happens for the good... That belief helped me in those times... Actually, Ive experienced the lows and highs... One of the lows definitely was watching India play from many miles away. Having said that, I also became tougher in the mind... Realised that Ill need to consistently work hard to ensure that when I made a comeback, I didnt find myself in the same situation again.         
	What would you pick as the turning point in your India career?         
	The 2007-08 tri-series in Australia...I wasnt really a regular till then, but I finished as the highest scorer (440), with two hundreds... Doing so well in Australia gave me immense confidence... Convinced me that I did belong to the international level and, in the minds of many, probably removed doubts about my temperament... Indeed, if I could get runs in Australia, then Id be able to get them anywhere... (After a pause) Id also like to mention the 2008-09 Test series in Sri Lanka... Anil Kumble, the captain, gave me a lot of confidence.         
	How?         
	By telling me, even before wed landed in Sri Lanka, that Id be playing all three Tests, irrespective of how I performed in the first. Hearing something like that from the captain did wonders... I did well in that series (310 runs) and people could no longer question my temperament. Some, in fact, even had doubts about my technique.         
	Dont think technique was an issue, its just that youd play too many shots too soon...         
	But Id always played that way... Perhaps, that had much to do with my insecurity... I guess somebody who is insecure would like to get out of that situation by playing shots... Id look to get a quick 30-40... Kumbles confidence in me helped me get over the fear of failure... However, I accept that one learns from failures.         
	Anything else about Kumble?         
	Ill say that hes probably the finest captain Ive played under... He believed I could do the job for India and made me believe that as well.         
	Did you yourself have doubts about your ability?         
	Not doubts, but the failure to convert starts into something big would be very disappointing.         
	A couple of months later, you had an excellent (home) Test series against Australia, totalling an awesome 463 in three matches...         
	Getting runs against Australia is a nice addition in any players CV... It confirmed that I really belonged to the highest level... My doing well had so much to do with Kumbles words on the team bus as wed been driving to the Chennai airport for the flight to Colombo. Im grateful to him.         
	For a stroke-maker, youve actually played some very restrained innings. How do you make the adjustment?         
	The 137 in the second innings in Napier last year was a reflection of my temperament... Mental toughness, as well... It had been a challenge... Till I batted for over 10 hours (436 balls), I hadnt known whether Id be able to do so that long... That innings helped keep our lead over New Zealand and we went on to win the series.         
	Today, how do you look back on that stellar effort?         
	It was a marathon, wasnt it? There was a period, I think, when I didnt utter even one word... I must have kept quiet for an entire session (with V.V.S.Laxman at the other end)... Id then been in my zone and, clearly, focused on the job... I knew a lapse in concentration or one bad shot would harm the team...         
	Recently, Virender Sehwag saluted you as our best opener after Sunil Gavaskar. Your reaction?         
	I dont like comparisons, dont like being called Wall No.2 (after Rahul Dravid) and so on, but it still feels great to get such a compliment... Of course, Ive got a long way to go before I can get close to Gavaskar.         
	Your take on Sehwag?         
	Irrespective of the rankings, for me, Viru is the worlds No.1 batsman... Hes the most dangerous and I havent seen anybody bat like him in all forms of the game. Our bowlers are fortunate that they dont have to bowl to him!         
	One didnt see you going overboard on receiving the ICC Test Cricketer of the Year award in Johannesburg, during the last Champions Trophy...         
	Its nice to be recognised, but awards dont motivate me... I play not for awards, but to help the country win as many matches as possible... I play to make the countrymen feel proud.         
	Sourav Ganguly was an influence before you played for India (2003). Anybody since?         
	Viru... Hes the one who has been reminding me that starts must be taken advantage of... That 50s and 60s alone dont mean anything much... Hes always been encouraging me to set big targets, to aim big.         
	Are you touchy about criticism?         
	Not when its constructive and is meant to help me get better.         
	Isnt there more pressure on a No.1?         
	But I dont keep thinking that Im No.1... Even if I was No.50, but had the respect of teammates, Id be very happy... (After a pause) I probably put myself under pressure, for I havent forgotten the past... The times when Id be out of the team... I realise the dark phase could return, much as I dont want it to... When doing well, many probably forget the times when they were at a low... I havent forgotten anything and the past gives me strength, motivates me. Its good today, yes, but tomorrow could be different... Thats the pressure I put on myself and it works for me.         
	Come April and youll be completing seven years of international cricket. What have you learnt?         
	(Laughs) That winning the India cap isnt easy! That playing for India is the toughest thing... The India cap means everything to me and I can never disrespect it.         
	The final one... Arent you disappointed that were playing too few Tests?         
	Yes... T20 is entertainment and theres space for the 50-over game as well, but Test cricket is the real thing... Double and triple hundreds come in the five-day version and Id like to score big, not only 20 off 10 balls or so in a T20 match.

	Perth: Pakistan woeful run in their Australian tour continued as they were hammered by Ricky Pontings men in the fourth one-day International in Perth on Friday.         
	According to cricinfo, Australia thrashed Pakistan by 135 runs to keep alive the prospect of inflicting upon the tourists only their second 5-0 whitewash in ODIs.         
	Michael Hussey and Nathan Hauritz starred with the bat, before Ryan Harris tore through the Pakistan batting with a second successive five-wicket haul to set up the victory. However, this was Australias first win over Pakistan in an ODI in Perth.         
	On Friday, Pakistan did battle in the field but let Australia get away at a critical stage once again, and contrasting fifties from Hussey and Nathan Hauritz took them to 277.         
	For much of the innings, control was a loose concept. Every time Pakistan struck, an Australian partnership settled. But every time the batsmen threatened to take over, Pakistan struck, so that momentum never rested decisively with either side. The final shift, however, came after the 40th over as an 80-run partnership between Hussey and Hauritz propelled Australia to the kind of total Pakistan havent looked like chasing down at any point this summer.         
	Hussey had hit one boundary in his fifty, but timing is everything and as he did in Adelaide, he utilised the Powerplay beautifully, ensuring that sixty runs came in the last six overs. Death bowling was once Pakistans trump card, but on this tour it has cost them.         
	Pakistan had shaded the start, much of the groundwork laid in a fine opening spell from Asif, who immediately hit the length that makes him so dangerous, not allowing batsmen to drive or to defend back with any great ease.         
	Brad Haddin provided Australia with some momentum but just when he was looking dangerous, he went. Michael Clarke was undone in a manner in which he has sent back so many batsmen  a smooth direct hit from cover running him out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy victory for Bagan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Easy victory for Bagan 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are fast playing the catch-up game in a bid to climb up the CFL Premier Division league table. In yet another commanding display, the green and maroon brigade trounced Railway FC 3-0 on Thursday. From six games, Stanley Rozarios men have garnered 13 points and are a buoyant bunch after back-to-back wins.         
	For the record, Mohun Bagan had shoved seven goals down George Telegraphs throat, on Tuesday, recording the highest goal-margin of the season so far.         
	The plot unfolded on Thursday almost the same way, except that Subair Murithala Ali began the scoring unlike Edeh Chidi, who opened the account on Tuesday. Mohun Bagan went into the attack from the word go leaving the Railway defenders with no breathing space.         
	The team had a wonderful opportunity to take lead in the 14th minute. Surabuddin Mallick collected a long through ball and cut inside the Railway defence with lightening speed. But instead of taking a shy at the goal himself from inside the area, the Bagan midfielder rolled it to Edeh Chidi which Railway defenders intercepted easily. In the 16th minute, Jayanta Sen sent a screamer from nearly 35 yards that thudded against the crossbar.         
	Jose Barreto, too, failed to add his name to the scoresheet when he failed to direct his header into the opponents net off a Snehasish Chakraborty free kick in the 19th. But the Bagan playmaker was the source of most of his teams attacks.         
	Chidis moment of glory finally arrived in the 60 th when Barretos dummy cleared the way for the Nigerian to take a clear shot at goal. The Bagan skipper reaffirmed his authority once again in the 80th, this time thanks to a cheeky pass from Ashim Biswas.         
	Railways played the last eight minutes with 10 men after Subhranil Dutta was given the red card.

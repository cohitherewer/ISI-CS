The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to keep working hard: Wriddhiman
                                                                                                                       7                                      Need to keep working hard: Wriddhiman
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Wriddhiman Saha had just hit the gym at the CABs Pankaj Gupta Indoor Facility when Mohun Bagan teammate Mohammed Ashrafuddin gave him the Breaking News  he had been selected in the Indian team for the first Test against South Africa.         
	I wouldnt deny that there was a sense of disbelief when Ashraf broke the news. Frankly speaking, I wasnt expecting a call-up. It is really a pleasant surprise, Wriddhiman said after a session of weight training.         
	How did he feel? I am not an emotional person, the Siliguri lad said. I may get a bit excited on the field but off it, nothing really makes me overtly happy or sad.         
	Wriddhiman, considered technically the most-equipped wicket-keeper of the current crop, hasnt done too well with the willow this season. In fact, he came a cropper in his last first-class innings, getting out for nought against Central Zone in Duleep Trophy.         
	His 10 first-class innings this season yielded only 318 runs at an average of 31.8. The lone century (120) was against Delhi at the JU (Salt Lake) ground.         
	Is his batting form a cause for worry? Cricket is all about ups and downs. I need to keep working hard. I am not unduly bothered about not getting too many runs this season. If I am doing the basics right, the runs will automatically come, Wriddhiman added.         
	What he intends to learn during the five days? I have shared the dressing room with the likes of Virender Sehwag (in the last Irani Cup), Sourav Ganguly, Brendon McCullum. But this is the first time I will be part of the national team. Definitely, I would like to know the mental approach taken by the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Sehwag, (Gautam) Gambhir ahead of a Test match.         
	With skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni all but certain to don the big gloves (unless there is a recurrence of the back spasms), Wriddhiman doesnt have much chance of making it to the playing XI, but the glovesman cited the unusual example of F1 legend Michael Schumacher.         
	I was back in school then and saw the event on television. Schumacher did badly in qualifying and was starting 13th on the grid. But he still won the race.         
	I am not bothered whether I am the 14th or the 15th member. If I have it in me, I will make it one day, even if not in Nagpur, the ardent Schumacher fan concluded as Bagan teammate Shib Shankar Paul smeared chocolate cake on his face.

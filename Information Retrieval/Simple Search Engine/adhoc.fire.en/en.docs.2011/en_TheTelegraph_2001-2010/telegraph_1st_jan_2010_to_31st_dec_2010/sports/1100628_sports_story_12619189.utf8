  - Webber survives crash at European Grand Prix; Sutil finishes sixth
                    Sebastian Vettel celebrates his victory on Sunday                
	Valencia: Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the European Grand Prix on Sunday, dominating the race from pole position while his teammate Mark Webber survived a spectacular crash.         
	It was Vettels second win of the season. He completed the 57 laps of the Valencia street circuit ahead of McLarens Lewis Hamilton in second.         
	Its good to get a lot of points, its good for the championship and Im very pleased. The guys can be extremely proud, Vettel said.         
	Jenson Button was third for McLaren.         
	Webber emerged unhurt after a collision with Heikki Kovalainens Lotus flipped his car early in the race.         
	The most important fact is that Mark is fine, Vettel said. On days like this you get reminded that still the speeds are extremely high and, if something goes wrong, it can go terribly wrong so I think the most important thing is that hes fine.         
	It was Hamiltons third second-place finish in Valencia, as he overcame a drive-through penalty for overtaking the safety car.         
	Hamilton leads the overall standings with 127 points, ahead of world champion Button on 121. Vettel jumps two places to third on 115.         
	The result consolidates McLarens lead at the top of the constructors championship with 248 points, ahead of Red Bull on 218.         
	Its very very positive to be leading both championships, for myself and Jenson, Hamilton said. The results clearly show the effort that weve been putting in. Its great that were now getting the results that we deserved.         
	Rubens Barrichello of Williams, who won at Valencia last year, finished fourth and Renaults Robert Kubica was fifth. Local favourite Fernando Alonso of Ferrari ended ninth after starting fourth on the grid and he is fifth in the standings on 96 points. Force Indias Adrian Sutil finished sixth while Vitantonio Liuzzi ended 13th.         
	Track temperatures reached 45 degrees Celsius as the third Grand Prix held in Valencia got underway on the harbour site built for the 2007 Americas Cup.         
	Hamilton had warned it could be a spectacular race and his forecast looked correct as he touched Vettels car while making an early bid to pass the German. Vettel held firm and Ferraris Alonso and Felipe Massa tucked in behind Hamilton in third and fourth.         
	We touched for a moment, I broke my front wing, so I was very fortunate to be able to keep up the pace, Hamilton said.

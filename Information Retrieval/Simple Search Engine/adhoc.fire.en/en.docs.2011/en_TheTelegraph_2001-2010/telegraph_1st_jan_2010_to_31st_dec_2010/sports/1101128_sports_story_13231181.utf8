	Guangzhou: Overwhelmed and exhausted in equal measure, Indias chief boxing coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu has told his wards to stay away from the ring and him for at least the next one month after notching up two unprecedented gold in a haul of seven medals at the Asian Games.         
	I have told the boxers not to keep in touch with me and talk boxing for one month. Its a complete break for them before they start preparing for the London Olympics through the qualifying rounds which commence with the World Championships sometime in September next year, Sandhu said.

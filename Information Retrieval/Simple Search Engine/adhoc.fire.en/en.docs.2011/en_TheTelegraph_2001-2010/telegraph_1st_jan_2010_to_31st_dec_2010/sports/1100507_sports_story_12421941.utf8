The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Umesh is surprised 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Umesh is surprised 
                  Umesh Yadav                     
	Nagpur: Vidarbha and the Delhi DareDevils fast bowler Umesh Yadav, who impressed with his pace during the recent IPL, has been surprised by the call-up to the national side. Yadav replaces Praveen Kumar, who has been ruled out with an injury.         
	Yadav, 22, got the call from the Vidarbha Cricket Association earlier in the afternoon and will leave for the Caribbean on Friday from Mumbai. Yadav, who picked six wickets in the seven IPL matches, acknowledged the help he got from Eric Simons, the bowling coach.         
	I am completely surprised. And that, too, for a World Cup I really find it hard to believe, Yadav told a website. But I have been enjoying my bowling, especially in the last year, so it is bearing the fruits now.         
	Praveen had sustained the injury during a practice session and the Indian team management sent him for an MRI which revealed the abdominal strain. He bowled only one over in the victory over South Africa in St Lucia, but his services will be missed in Barbados, where the pitches are expected to have plenty of pace and bounce.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tension mounts as IOA raises spectre of ban
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tension mounts as IOA raises spectre of ban
    - Gill says move to limit tenure has backing of all political parties             OUR BUREAU                            
	The tension between government and sports federation bosses over tenure restrictions intensified Tuesday with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) warning that attempts to erode their autonomy might invite a ban on India although Union sports minister M.S. Gill showed no signs of piping down.         
	While miffed sports administrators maintained that the new regulation was against the Olympic Charter and amounted to an infringement of their autonomy, Gill said the reason for the protests was the federation chiefs desire for unlimited tenures.         
	Armed with letters of support from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), the IOA went on the offensive claiming that, as per the Olympic Charter, sports bodies could not be subjected to interference and external pressure.         
	Any restriction of the tenures of the office bearers and the fixing of age limit may amount to interference in the internal functioning of the National Olympic Committees (NOC). This is a violation of the Olympic Charter and the IOC executive board may hand sanctions, suspension or (even) withdraw recognition to such NOCs, IOA secretary general Randhir Singh told a news conference.         
	The issue of limiting tenure and fixing age limit of office bearers shall not be decided or imposed by any government or (with) external pressure but should be decided by the NOCs themselves. That should be the prerogative of the NOCs and decided by their executive committees or general assemblies, Randhir said, quoting a letter from the IOC.         
	Randhir said both letters had been forwarded to the sports ministry and that he was expecting an amicable solution to the episode.         
	We have forwarded the letters to the sports ministry and I hope better sense will prevail. Going ahead with the regulation would invite sanction, which may lead to a complete ban on India.         
	We have to decide if we really want our athletes to compete in international events and host major events in India. If IOC suspends us, all international federations would follow suit and our athletes would be the real victims in such a scenario, Randhir said.         
	The new regulation bars national sports federations presidents from occupying top posts for more than 12 years, with or without break while secretaries and treasurers can serve eight years at a stretch and seek re-election only after a four-year gap.         
	Gill, on his part, said the NSF chiefs were up in arms against the regulation because they wanted to cling to their posts forever.         
	I guess the current protest is frankly because my friends (in federations) want unlimited tenures Gill said.         
	We studied the International Olympic Council regulation and they require their president to have a 12-year term in total, no more, and to retire at 70. Therefore, our NSF presidents can continue for 12 years, even continuously. What more could we do? he asked.         
	The minister said the regulation had the backing of all political parties and was, in fact, a softer version of the original 1975 guideline.         
	On April 22, there was a full debate on my ministry in the Rajya Sabha and all parties urged me to have the regulation to limit terms (of the sports administrators), this being the demand of the sports people and the public for long, Gill said.         
	The minister also pointed out that the regulation doesnt mean the NSF office-bearers who have overstayed have to vacate positions right away.         
	We have also made it clear in the order that no one is to be disturbed right now. Elected office-bearers can carry on with their terms. The regulation will apply from future elections, as and when they occur, he said.

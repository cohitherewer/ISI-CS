                                                                                                                       7                                      Stuart loses mother
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Miche, mother of England all-rounder Stuart Broad and wife of former England opener and current International Cricket Council Match Referee Chris, passed away on Wednesday.         
	In a statement Chris, said: It is with great sadness that I announce the death of my wife, Miche. She has been battling bravely with motor neurone disease for some time now and she unfortunately passed away this morning.         
	Miche was the most energetic woman with an effervescent personality and a real zest for life. While devastated at her passing, it is at least some consolation for those of us who loved her that she is no longer suffering and she is now in a better place.         
	It was Miches wish that, on her passing, Gemma, Stuart and I should continue to fulfil our commitments and, in her honour, we will endeavour to do so.

	Colombo: Part-time bowler Tillekaratne Dilshan snapped up two West Indies wickets within the space of three balls to tilt the balance of the second Test in favour of Sri Lanka on the third day on Thursday.         
	At the close West Indies were 165 for five in reply to Sri Lankas 387 for nine declared with play ending 52 minutes after tea due to bad light. The West Indies trail by 222 runs.         
	Dilshan, bowling his off-breaks, first broke a threatening fourth wicket partnership of 83 between Darren Bravo and Brendan Nash. He trapped Nash lbw for 29 with a straight ball which the batsman played for the turn.         
	Two balls later Bravo, who had been batting confidently, played a loose drive and spooned the ball to cover point where Rangana Herath made a lot of ground and took a spectacular catch inches off the ground. Bravo hit a Test best 80.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mali wilt vs Algeria
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mali wilt vs Algeria

	Luanda: A header from Rafik Halliche just before half time revived Algerias African Nations Cup hopes as they beat Mali 1-0 in Group A on Thursday.         
	The victory followed a surprise 0-3 defeat for the World Cup-bound north Africans in their opening match against Malawi on Monday.         
	Halliche climbed above Malis defence to head home a free kick from Karim Ziani two minutes before the interval.         
	Mali had needlessly conceded the free kick after a clumsy challenge from Bakary Soumare on Yacine Bezzaz.         
	The defeat left Mali on the brink of elimination despite having an array of top players from leading European clubs. They have a single point from two matches.         
	The presence of Barcelonas Seydou Keita, Momo Sissoko of Juventus and captain Mahamadou Diarra, who plays for Real Madrid, proved ineffective for a tired-looking Mali.         
	Frederic Kanoute, left out of the team after struggling with a cold, failed to inject any new impetus when he came on as a substitute after 62 minutes.         
	Diarra was also cautioned for a second successive game and will sit out Malis last match against Malawi in Cabinda on Monday.         
	They looked spent after the excursions of the opening game on Sunday when Mali conjured four late goals to draw 4-4 with hosts Angola in a dramatic start to the three-week event.         
	Mali had several half chances early on but Algeria found an extra gear after taking the lead, coming close to adding to their tally in the second half.         
	Hassan Yebda missed a good chance in the 70th minute after being set up by Abdelkader Ghezzal and Ziani went narrowly wide with a free kick.           (REUTERS)

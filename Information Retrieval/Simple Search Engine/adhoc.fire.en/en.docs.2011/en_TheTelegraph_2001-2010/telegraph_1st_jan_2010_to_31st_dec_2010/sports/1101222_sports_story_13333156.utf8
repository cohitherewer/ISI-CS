                                                                                                                       7                                      Inter victory cannot save Benitez
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Rafael Benitez is resigned to losing his job after just six months in charge at Inter Milan, despite Saturdays victory in the Club World Cup. The Italian champions owner, Massimo Moratti, has drawn up the terms of the Spaniards departure.         
	A final decision is expected within 48 hours and it is believed Morattis offer to Bentez will include a lucrative golden handshake and there may also be a clause preventing him from managing another club in the next six months. The oil magnate is thought to be furious at Benitezs decision to use his sides 3-0 triumph against the African champions, TP Mazembe, in Abu Dhabi as an opportunity to demand funds for the January transfer window.         
	Tellingly, Moratti on Monday refused the chance to reassure the Spaniard over his future, insisting he would not be drawn on the topic for fear of creating arguments. But Benitez insists he does not want to put the president under pressure.

    - I dont dream big, says Mahendra Singh Dhoni             A STAFF REPORTER            Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the city, on Tuesday.   A Telegraph picture                                       
	Calcutta: The one-day International (ODI) World Cup maybe a little more than three-and-a-half months away, but for India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni it is still too early to think about it.         
	Having successfully demolished Australia in the recently concluded Test and ODI series, Dhoni, at a promotional organised by Lafarge Cement in the city, refused to start thinking about the Cup so soon.         
	It is too early to speak about the World Cup Theres still quite a bit of time left for that, he said.         
	According to Dhoni, preparations for the mega event basically comprises two important aspects  the fitness and the performances of the players.         
	There are a number of issues that come in between now and the World Cup Important among those are the fitness of the players and, of course, their performances, Dhoni said.         
	The World Twenty20 winning skipper also stressed on the importance of all the players remaining fit for selection before the Cup.         
	It is important that everyone stays injury-free and are available for selection. That will be good for the teams success, added Dhoni.         
	Asked what was the secret behind his success as a captain, Dhoni chose to pass on the compliments to his teammates. I am successful because I have a team which is successful, he said.         
	He was of the opinion that it is the captain who gets all the spotlight and hence the other players, who play a key role in the teams success, remain in the dark.         
	People only talk about the captain, but in reality, it is the players who contribute towards the success of the team. They push themselves to achieve a goal, help each other in difficult situations And that leads to the success of the team, Dhoni observed.         
	Speaking on his dreams, the dashing middle-order batsman, said that he never dreams big. On the contrary, he says, being practical is what he likes more. For Dhoni, it is the present which matters, while thoughts about the past and the future seldom crosses his mind.         
	I just believe in the present I neither think about the past nor about the future. Also, I dont dream big. I like being practical, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Yuvraj Singh, who failed to make it to the Indian Test squad for the New Zealand series, was also in the city for a commercial shoot.         
	The Indian selectors, instead, kept their faith in exciting Suresh Raina and the impressive Cheteshwar Pujara for the three-Test series against the Black Caps.         
	Asked if he was disappointed at being ignored, the left-hander answered in negative. When queried what his immediate plans were, Yuvraj said that he would concentrate on playing the Ranji Trophy bolster his case.         
	Im looking forward to the Ranji Trophy I hope to perform well in that, Yuvraj said.         
	But what about the ODI series against New Zealand, where his chances of making it to the squad are bright?         
	Theres still some time before the ODI series against New Zealand and Im not thinking about that at the moment, was all that Yuvraj had to say.

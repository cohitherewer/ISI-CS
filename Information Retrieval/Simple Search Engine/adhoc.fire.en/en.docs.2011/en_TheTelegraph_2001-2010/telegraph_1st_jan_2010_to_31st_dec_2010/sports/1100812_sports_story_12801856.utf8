	Melbourne: Australian cricketer David Hussey, who plies his trade with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL), will be leading the Victoria Bushrangers in this years Champions League T20 cricket tournament that starts September 10 in South Africa.         
	Making that happen was all-rounder Cameron Whites decision to turn out for his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore, in South Africa.         
	White will now join South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis and New Zealander Ross Taylor at the Vijay Mallya-owned franchise after the Bushrangers were paid a compensatory fee of $200,000 to enable the all-rounder to play for the Bangalore team.         
	We certainly would have loved to have Cameron available to play and captain the Victorian side at Champions League. But we understand the situation he finds himself in and the decision to honour his contract with Bangalore, Cricket Victoria chief executive Tony Dodemaide was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	The second edition of the multi-million dollar Champions League T20 was launched in Johannesburg Tuesday night in a glittering ceremony attended by top officials of Cricket South Africa and star players, including Muttiah Muralitharan.         
	Unveiled was the dazzling trophy that will belong to the team that wins the tournament with a total prize money of $6 million.         
	Missing out on that and Champions League action itself will be the injury-plagued Andrew Flintoff who has been left out of IPL title holders Chennai Super Kings final 15-member squad for the Champions League T20. Flintoff has had two knee operations in the last 12 months and will be out of action for the entire season.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who led the Super Kings to their maiden IPL triumph this year, will continue to captain the side.         
	The foreign players who found a place in the squad are retired Sri Lankan spin-wizard Muttiah Muralidharan and Thilan Thushara, Australias Michael Hussey, Doug Bollinger, Matthew Hayden and Albie Morkel of South Africa.         
	Three players from Royal Challengers will play for their away team rather than the home side.

    - Showcause notices to be served today over Tequila Joe incident           OUR BUREAU                            
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), taking a serious view of the breach of discipline during the just-concluded ICC World T20 Championship, on Monday decided to showcause players who were involved in an incident at a pub in Gros Islet.         
	After considering all the information gathered, the (BCCI) president (Shashank Manohar) has decided show cause the concerned players. He has asked the secretary (N. Srinivasan) to issue the notice tomorrow (Tuesday), Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCIs chief administrative officer, said.         
	The decision comes after the Indian teams manager during the West Indies tour, Ranjib Biswal, submitted his report.         
	Shetty did not divulge the contents of the managers report but said: Biswal met the president and secretary and had a discussion on the tour and the report submitted by him. He gave information about the incident to both. The BCCI also probed the incident on its own.         
	The showdown at a popular pub, Tequila Joe, after India crashed out of the World T20 involved eight players  Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Harbhajan Singh, Rohit Sharma, Piyush Chawla, Suresh Raina, and Ravindra Jadeja.         
	According to sources, Biswal didnt take any individuals name in his report and only mentioned players. This explains why the BCCI did not release the names of the players immediately.         
	Biswal, it was learnt, mentioned in his report that the players had breached the curfew that was set for 9.30 pm. The managers report said that, during the incident, the players retaliated verbally after being abused.         
	The BCCI will ask the players to show cause as to why they breached the curfew hours.         
	Biswal did not mention any pub incidents for Team Indias disgraceful exit, but blamed purely cricketing reasons for the ouster.         
	Its understood that the eight players would be given 15 days time to reply to the show cause and that those picked for the upcoming tri-series and two T20 Internationals in Zimbabwe would not be affected.         
	Raina has been named captain for the tour while Rohit and Jadeja are also in the ODI squad. Chawla would join them for the T20Is.         
	Meanwhile, Manohar and Srinivasan, along with IPLs interim chairman Chirayu Amin and vice-chairman Niranjan Shah, met top IMG officials from the UK  senior vice-president Andrew Wildblood and legal experts Paul Manning and John Laffhagen.         
	The meeting assumed significance in the backdrop of allegations by Giles Clarke, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), that suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi along with IMG had discussed with three Counties the possibility of holding an IPL-type league T20 tournament in the UK.         
	Shetty shed little light on what transpired at the meeting. The interim chairman was keen to meet the IMG officials and wanted to have an idea about all things (that happened) last year and it was a productive meeting, he said.  
	Facing the music  
	The following are some instances of the BCCI showcausing players in the recent past:  
	Sept. 2005: Harbhajan Singh showcaused for supporting captain Sourav Ganguly and accusing coach Greg Chappell of maintaining ldquo;double standards rdquo;.  
	April 2007: Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh showcaused for criticising coach Chappell.  
	April 2008: Harbhajan Singh showcaused for slapping Sreesanth in an IPL match. He was later suspended.

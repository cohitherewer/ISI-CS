The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Embarrassed Gautam wants accountability
                                                                                                                       7                                      Embarrassed Gautam wants accountability
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                
	Calcutta: Im an Indian first, then a Delhiite and, yes, Ive been very embarrassed by everything that has been going wrong in the build-up to the Commonwealth Games... It doesnt feel good...         
	Unusually strong words from Team India pro Gautam Gambhir, who generally says little.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph during a short trip to the city, Gambhir said: At this stage, theres no point discussing the merits or demerits of staging the event... Its too late... Right now, one is hoping that things go off well... National pride is at stake...         
	Gambhir added: As an Indian, Im very passionate about everything which has anything to do with our country... With so many things having gone wrong, Id like accountability... I hope people are actually held accountable... That, for me, is an absolute must.         
	Spot on, but is that ever going to happen?

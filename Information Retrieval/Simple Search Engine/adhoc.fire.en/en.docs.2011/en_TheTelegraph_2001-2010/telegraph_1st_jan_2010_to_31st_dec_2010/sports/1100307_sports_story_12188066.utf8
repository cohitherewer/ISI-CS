The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal beat Burnley 3-1
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arsenal beat Burnley 3-1
                      
	London: Arsenal climbed to second place in the English Premier League with a 3-1 home win over Burnley on Saturday but if Nicklas Bendtner had shown any sort of finishing ability they would have been on top. The Dane missed a hatful of increasingly easy chances as Arsenal sought the four-goal victory that would have taken them above Chelsea on goal difference.         
	As it was, goals by Cesc Fabregas, Theo Walcott and Andrei Arshavin took them to 61 points, the same as leaders Chelsea, who are in FA Cup action against Stoke City on Sunday.         
	With Burnley managing just one draw and 13 defeats from their 14 previous EPL away games this season, it was no surprise that Arsenal were on top from the start.         
	Burnley seemed content to sit deep and allow Arsenal to do all their neat passing in front of them.         
	The onus was on Walcott to find a way through and show himself worthy of a place in Englands World Cup squad but though the winger had some early success against his full back he failed to provide much in the way of convertible crosses.         
	Instead it was the eye-of-a-needle passing of Fabregas and Samir Nasri that eventually opened the massed Lancs ranks and enabled Fabregas to cleverly tuck in the opener after 34 minutes.

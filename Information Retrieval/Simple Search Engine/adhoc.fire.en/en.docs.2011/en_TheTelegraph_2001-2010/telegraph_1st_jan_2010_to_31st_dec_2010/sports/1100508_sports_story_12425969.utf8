The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dashing Aussies bash India
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dashing Aussies bash India
            A CORRESPONDENT            Shane Watson in Bridgetown, on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Powerplay  that is probably the best possible way, in Twenty20 terminology, to describe Australias super show at the Kensington Oval on Friday. The men from Down Under were all-rounders in the true sense of the term as they excelled in all three departments inflicting the shame of a 49-run defeat on the Indians.         
	When a team deals more in sixes (16) than boundaries (6), the opposition suffers. Ask Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. and they will tell you of the torture. And to rub salt to the wound, the Australians returned to spell havoc among the Indian batsmen with the ball.         
	However, the day had begun with promise for India as Harbhajan Singh produced a maiden, a rare commodity in this slam-bang form of the game, in the very first over of the day. But as of Friday, the morning didnt reveal the day to the Indians.         
	Faced with the task of chasing down a formidable target of 185, much depended on the Indian openers to get going from the word go. Well, they did go but only towards the pavilion. While Murali Vijay fell first, lasting a mere seven balls, senior pro Gautam Gambhir followed suit after four balls. Dirk Nannes was the achiever on both the occasions as the openers found his pace too hot to handle.         
	From there on, it was just a competition for the shortest stay at the wicket among the Indians. The irony was that Dhoni was playing an extra batsman in the form Rohit Sharma to bolster the batting line-up.         
	But as often, there is an exception and extra Rohit was the one for Team India on the day. He stood out like a monument amidst the ruins that was Indian batting. His unbeaten 79 off only 46 deliveries was classy. It was a combination of grace as well as power. Pity that there wasnt another player who showed required application to rally around the Mumbaikar in his bid to chase down the target.         
	Rohits knock was at par with that of Man Of The Match David Warners. His innings was studded with half-a-dozen sixes and four boundaries. For the Aussies, the speed merchants Nannes and Shaun Tait were the show stealers with the ball sharing six Indian wickets among themselves.         
	Earlier, it was a double W attack from the Aussies as openers Warner and Shane Watson toyed with the Indian bowlers to stack up a 104-run first wicket partnership. Watson started the rampage and Warner soon followed, in fact bettered the attack.         
	Watson, who scored a 32-ball 54, was dropped by Ravindra Jadeja off Harbhajan in the third over of the innings. The miss proved costly as the all-rounder clobbered the Indian bowlers hitting six over boundaries in the process. Warner, too, was in punishing mood hitting seven sixes in his 42-ball 72.         
	But as the Aussies flourished with some amazing strokeplay, the Indian bowlers played a supporting role providing them with either short-pitched stuff or length balls.         
	Jadeja had a nightmare with ball leaking 38 runs from his two overs which included three consecutive sixes off Jadejas first over hit by Watson. Warner did a repeat act as he thrashed the left-armer in his next over. However, like Rohit, Harbhajan was an exception on the day. When his colleagues were taken to the task, the off-spinner gave away a miserly 15 runs of his four overs.         
	With their net-run rate taking a hammering with Fridays loss, Dhoni and Co. need to tune their calypso quickly or their Carribean cruise would suffer the fate of Titanic.

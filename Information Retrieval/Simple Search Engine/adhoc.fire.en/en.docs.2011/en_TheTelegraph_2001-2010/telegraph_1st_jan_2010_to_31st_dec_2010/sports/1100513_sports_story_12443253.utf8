The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malaysia spank Indians 5-2
                                                                                                                       7                                      Malaysia spank Indians 5-2
                      
	Ipoh: India went down 2-5 to hosts Malaysia in a round-robin match Wednesday to suffer their first loss in this Azlan Shah Cup campaign.         
	However, despite the loss, India managed to top the seven-team table with 10 points. They will now have to beat Egypt in their last fixture on Saturday to make it to the summit clash. Malaysia jumped to second on the table with eight points after Wednesdays win, their biggest-ever against India.         
	The hosts sounded the board through Mohamed Amin Rahim (27th and 48th minute), Tengku Ahmad Tajuddin (39th), Mohamed Razie (41st) and Nasir Azreen Rizal (60th minute) while Danish Mujtaba (44th) and Ravi Pal Singh (67th) were on target for India.         
	Defending champions India needed to beat Malaysia to secure a place in Sundays final but the team seemed complacent throughout. The Indians looked rusty and lacked the cohesion and flair they had exhibited in the 4-3 upset of world champions Australia in their previous match.         
	Indian midfielders Gurbaj Singh, Prabodh Tirkey, Arjun Halappa, Danish Mujtaba and Ravi Pal Singh were unable to foil the Malaysia counter attacks. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | VVS Laxman is the real saviour, says Harbhajan 
                                                                                                                       7                                        VVS Laxman is the real saviour, says Harbhajan 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Harbhajan Singh shows off his MoM medal, in Ahmedabad, on Monday. (PTI)                           
	Ahmedabad: In Tests, a specialist bowler striking it big with the bat is an achievement to remember. Harbhajan Singh wasted an opportunity in Indias first innings when he got out for 69. But on Monday, he ensured that he got to the three-figure score and bailed India out from an impending defeat.         
	Speaking to the media after the hosts drew a tantalisingly close Test against New Zealand, at Motera, Harbhajan thanked VVS Laxman for guiding him to his maiden Test century.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	His feelings after the hundred         
	I am really happy that I got my first Test hundred. Now, I know what it feels to score a hundred. I am thrilled and excited. More than anything, that hundred saved the game for us.         
	VVS Laxmans influence on him         
	He is the real saviour. I was just partnering him. He was pushing me after each over, saying that I was batting well and that I need to keep concentrating. Because of him, I got my first century. It would have been different had Laxman not been at the other end. A lot of credit goes to him. In fact, he batted superbly. He was little unlucky with that decision, else he would have also got a hundred. He deserves more credit than me.         
	If he ever dreamt of picking a MoM award for batting         
	No. May be in the one-dayers, I thought if I get a chance to go up the order I can slog a quick 50 and win a Man of the Match award (MoM). But I never thought that I will be the MoM by scoring runs for India in Tests. I am happy that I could score the runs as there was hardly anything for the bowlers in this wicket. I am happy I got those runs which helped India to save the game.         
	To whom would he dedicate his century         
	There will be a lot of people But first, I would like to dedicate it to my dad And apart from that, to Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. These are the guys who have always made me believe that I have the capability to score a hundred in Test cricket.         
	Whether there was any special instruction on how he should bat         
	No one sent any messages while I was batting. Gary (Kirsten) told me in the morning that you just have to bat with Laxman and pick your shots and you know that you can play the big shots, but have to be careful in choosing the right balls to hit.         
	On his reverse sweep         
	I have tried it earlier, but I have got out most times. Had I missed the shot today, I think I wouldve been out. I am glad I could connect it and want to promise myself that Ill never play a reverse sweep in Test cricket again.         
	On what the achievement means to him         
	Everyone felt that if Ishant Sharma and VVS Laxman can win a Test match for India, then why cant Harbhajan Singh. We had a lot of belief on each other and when I got my hundred everyone was in the balcony to support me. That was a great sign.         
	If India could have declared little early and pushed for a win         
	The wicket was quite flat. Daniel (Vettori) had bowled 36, 37 overs to get two wickets. And out of those two decisions, you must have seen the replays and know what sort of decisions they were. And I think we made the right decision by not declaring because we wanted to save the game first.         
	Whether New Zealand posed more challenge than expected         
	I have always said they are a good side and one tournament will not make them a bad team. We didnt go by the records as to what happened in Bangladesh.

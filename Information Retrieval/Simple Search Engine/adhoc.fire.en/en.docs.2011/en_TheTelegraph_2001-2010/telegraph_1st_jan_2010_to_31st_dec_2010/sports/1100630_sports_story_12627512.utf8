The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Octopus favours Germans again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Octopus favours Germans again
            QUICK TAKES                
	Oberhausen: An octopus in Germany, who has shot to fame for correctly predicting the result of all of the countrys World Cup matches so far, Tuesday forecast a win over Argentina in the quarter finals.         
	Earlier in the tournament, the eight-legged oracle correctly tipped Germany to beat Ghana and Australia in their group D matches and was also right to predict they would lose to Serbia. And even though he was born in England, he also treacherously, but correctly, foretold Germanys win over his native country in their last-16 clash last Sunday.         
	Chancellor in audience         
	Berlin: Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to fly to South Africa to see Germany take on Argentina in the World Cup quarter finals this weekend. Merkel watched Germanys 4-1 win over England on Sunday along with British Prime Minister David Cameron on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Canada.         
	Game of life lost         
	McAllen: Texas police have arrested a man accused of fatally beating his 2-year-old stepdaughter when she wouldnt stop crying as he watched a World Cup game. Police say 27-year-old Hector Castro is expected to be charged Monday with murder. Police Chief Victor Rodriguez says Castro told investigators that the toddler wouldnt stop crying while he was trying to watch the US-Ghana match on last Saturday.         
	How Brazil were out         
	Sao Paulo: Readers of one of Brazils biggest newspapers were surprised to read on Tuesday that their beloved national team had been knocked out of the World Cup, the day after Dungas side had marched into the quarter finals. An advert wrongly posted in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper by a major supermarket chain expressed sadness at Brazils elimination and told fans they could at least look forward to 2014, when the South American country will host the tournament.         
	Keep chips out, says Romero         
	Pretoria: Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero went against the grain by calling for footballing authorities to resist the temptation to introduce goalline technology. Im against technology in football. If you put a chip inside the ball, youll take away the vibrancy of great players and football is for living, not for technology, he said Monday.         
	Replicas stolen         
	Johannesburg: Thieves stole seven replicas of the golden World Cup trophy from Fifas headquarters in South Africa, police and soccer officials said on Tuesday. Seven replicas of the World Cup were stolen and also several sweaters. Police are looking into it, national police chief Bheki Cele told reporters.         
	Waiting to watch         
	Port Elizabeth: Fans lined up for hours at a suburban shopping mall in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday to buy the most sought-after ticket in town: entry to Fridays blockbuster World Cup quarterfinal between Brazil and the Netherlands. Officials are expecting the first-ever sellout at the 42,286-seat Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium after empty seats at all six previous matches at the new venue. Tickets went on sale Tuesday in four categories from 525 Rand ($70) to 2,100 Rand ($275).         
	Licence to cheer         
	Johannesburg: More than just a worldwide party, the World Cup can be a tempting distraction for many workers in the host country. In South Africa, many employers have been rather lenient, allowing their workers to watch and attend football matches in the first World Cup to be staged in Africa. Where possible, employers tried, especially when the South African team was still playing, to allow workers to leave earlier if they could, said Gert van Deventer, a spokesman for the Federated Employers Organization of South Africa.

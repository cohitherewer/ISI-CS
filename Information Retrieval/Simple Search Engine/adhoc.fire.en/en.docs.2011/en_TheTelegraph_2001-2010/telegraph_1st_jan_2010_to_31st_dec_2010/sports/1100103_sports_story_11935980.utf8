                                                                                                                       7                                      Maria outplays Venus
                      
	Hua Hin (Thailand): Maria Sharapova outplayed an error-prone Venus Williams on the key points to take a 6-3, 6-4 win in an exhibition match Saturday.         
	In a warm-up ahead of this months Australian Open, Sharapova converted 75 per cent of her break points, against just 13 per cent by Venus.         
	Both players appeared in trouble in the baking heat and low sun at his beachside resort, with Venus particularly struggling to keep the ball on the court.         
	Sharapova, the world No. 14, displayed a solid and fierce baseline game to put Williams away in just one hour and 34 minutes, and record her first win over the American since 2007.         
	Sharapova broke Venus thrice to take the first set which was over in 49 minutes. The second set was on serve until the final game when Venus missed two forehands to lose the match.         
	Its good to be back. Im glad to play against Venus in my first match of the year, said the 22-year-old Russian.         
	I still remember when I first came here (in 2005). I was still young and had a great match with Venus.         
	Venus, who will still be chasing her first Australian Open title when she goes to Melbourne, acknowledged she was a little off the pace after the off-season. (Agencies)

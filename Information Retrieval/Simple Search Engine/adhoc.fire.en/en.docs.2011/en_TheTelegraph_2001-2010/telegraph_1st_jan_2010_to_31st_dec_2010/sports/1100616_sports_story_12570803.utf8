                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvi vows to come back fitter
                      
	New Delhi: Shown the door for slump in form and criticised for poor fitness, Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh Tuesday said he would come back stronger to answer his detractors with some of his trademark explosive batting.         
	It has been tough for me but I am working on my body. I have been working on my fitness for the past 15 days. There were injuries in the past one year and they took time to settle down, Yuvraj said.         
	It has been a tough year but things are getting better now. I would be back with the best of my form and fitness. The bat should always do the talking, he added.         
	Out of favour he might be with the selectors but Yuvraj has got the backing of his teammates with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and senior players like Virender Sehwag throwing their weight behind him.         
	Its nice to have the support of the boys.           (PTI)

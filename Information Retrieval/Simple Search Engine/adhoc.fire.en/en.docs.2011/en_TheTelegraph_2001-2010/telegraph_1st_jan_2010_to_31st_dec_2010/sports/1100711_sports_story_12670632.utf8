  - First timers spain take on the twice shy dutch
                      
	Spain  
	Spain (4-4-2) 
    
	1-Iker Casillas 15-Sergio Ramos, 
  3-Gerard Pique, 5-Carles Puyol, 
  11-Joan Capdevila, 16-Sergio Busquets, 
  8-Xavi, 14-Xabi Alonso, 6-Andreas Iniesta, 9-Fernando Torres, 7-David Villa          
	Xavi 
    
	Called the cerebral dictator of the Spanish midfield, Xavi is considered one of the modern day greats, a player who could be compared with French legend Zinedine Zidane. He looks unassuming at five feet seven inches but when Spain play, the Barcelona central midfielder is at the centre of everything, leading the attacks with sublime skills and wonderful passes. Known for delivering pinpoint passes, Xavi has been the mainstay of Spanish domination in this World Cup. Against Germany, Xavi was at his best and controlled the midfield with such authority, that it left the three-time champions totally clueless.          
	Andreas Iniesta 
    
	One of the three Spanish players to be nominated for the Golden Ball Award, along with Xavi and David Villa, the Barcelona midfielder was once described by Wayne Rooney as the best in the world in his position. Iniesta is only five feet seven inches tall, but has the ability to play in any position. Against Paraguay, in the quarter-final, Iniesta rsquo;s effort behind the match winner was a treat to watch. He got hold of the ball midway through the rival half and then evaded two Paraguay defenders with such smoothness that it totally opened up the goalmouth.          Vicente del Bosque  
	Vicente del Bosque, is a seasoned coach under whom Real Madrid enjoyed a string of wins from 1999 to 2003, but was shockingly sacked a day after the club won their 29th La Liga title. He was appointed the national coach after Spain won the 2008 Euro title under Luis Aragones. He has so far done a commendable job. If handling the stars has been his biggest achievement, Del Bosque should also be lauded for his clever team selection and smart substitutions that has made a huge impact in some crucial matches.   At this World Cup, he did a great job   of rallying his boys and lifting their spirit after the   shock loss against Switzerland in   their first match.             David Villa 
    
	One of the two contenders for both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball awards, the newly joined Barcelona striker could be the biggest threat for the Netherlands defence. Villa was not in his element against Germany, but rescued Spain time and again when they were struggling to find their feet. A man with startling ability to find the target, he scored in almost every match including the crucial match winners against Portugal and Paraguay in the round of 16 and the quarter final. In the group league, against Honduras, Villa struck twice but wasted the chance to score a   hattrick when he missed a penalty.      
	Road To Final
  Group League: Vs Switzerland 0-1; Vs Honduras 2-0; Vs Chile 2-1
  Pre-quarter final: Vs Portugal 1-0
  Quarter final: Vs Paraguay 1-0
  Semi-final: Vs Germany 1-0                
	The Netherlands  
	The Netherlands (4-2-3-1)
    1-Maarten Stekelenburg, 2-Van der Wiel, 
  3-John Heitinga, 4-Joris Mathijsen, 
  5-Van Bronckhorst, 7-Dirk Kuyt, 
  6-Van Bommel, 8-Nigel de Jong, 11-Arjen Robben, 10-Wesley Sneijder, 9-Van Persie          Dirk Kuyt 
    The Dutch manager Bert van Marwijk and legendary player Johan Cruyff have only one thing in common. Both feel Dirt Kuyt is the unsung hero of the Netherlands rsquo; entry into final. Kuyt, who played a stellar role in the Dutch triumph over Uruguay in the semi-final, scored the second Dutch goal in their 2-0 triumph over Denmark. In the quarter-final against Brazil rsquo;s Kuyt rsquo;s flag kick brought the equaliser as it curled into the box for Wesley Sneijder to head in. The Liverpool striker has said the famed Spanish midfield would not be able to stop the Dutch.          Arjen Robben
    
	Known for his fine dribbling skills, the Bayern Munich forward is a highly experienced footballer, having played in all major tournaments including two Euro Cups and the last World Cup in Germany. Robben suffered a hamstring injury in the last friendly match against Hungary but made a comeback as a substitute in the last group tie against Cameroon. Robben is playing impressively since then and scored two crucial goals against Slovakia and in the semi final against Uruguay. An asset for any team for his impeccable ball control and sense of position, the Spaniards will surely have to make an extra effort to keep Robben in check.          Wesley Sneijder 
    
	A rampaging midfielder, Wesley Benjamin Sneijder is in line for the Golden Boot award with five goals. A player of classical style that attracts spectators to the ground, Sneijder is enjoying huge success in the current World Cup and has won three Man of the Match awards against Denmark, Japan and Brazil. Against the five-time champions, Sneijder struck twice and propelled the Netherlands to the semi-finals after 12 years. The Inter Milan footballer is the cog in the wheel in the Dutch game plan.                Bert van Marwijk       
	Known as a gross underachiever in his 28-year managerial career and criticised back home for his unconventional pragmatism, Van Marwijk has shown that he is capable of leading the Dutch to the game rsquo;s ultimate prize that has eluded them for so long. Apart from being strong on tactical knowhow, Marwijk is believed to be a great peacemaker and doesn rsquo;t allow any ego clashes between his temperamental stars. He has been telling his boys from day one that winning the World Cup is the only mission, the Oranje shouldn rsquo;t settle for anything less.

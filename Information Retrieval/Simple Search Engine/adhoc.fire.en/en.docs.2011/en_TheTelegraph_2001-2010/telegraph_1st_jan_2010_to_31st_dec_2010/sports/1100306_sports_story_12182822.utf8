                                                                                                                       7                                      East Bengal aim to bounce back
                      
	Shillong: Looking to recover from the shock defeat to Pune FC but missing skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, East Bengal will have to be on their guard against the unpredictable Lajong FC in their Round XV I-League encounter Saturday.         
	Bhaichung had picked up a double yellow in the match against Pune FC, which his team lost 1-2. Placed seventh on the I-League table with 20 points from 14 matches, East Bengal would be desperate for a big win.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder said: We are not taking Lajong lightly despite having defeated their opponents in the previous I-League encounter as well as in the Federation Cup.         
	Lajong are a tough team when in form. It is a difficult match for us. Bhaichungs role is important We will lack our full strike force, he said, adding that injuries might force him to drop a couple of the first-team players.         
	Neither have Lajong, 13th with ten points, found the going easy. The first team from the Northeast to play in the national league have tasted four defeats and earned two draws in their last six matches after their dream run in the Federation Cup where they reached final, losing out to East Bengal.

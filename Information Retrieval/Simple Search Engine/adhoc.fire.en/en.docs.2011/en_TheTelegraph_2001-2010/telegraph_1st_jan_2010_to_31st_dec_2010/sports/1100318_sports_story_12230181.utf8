The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karthik anxious about Gautam injury
                                                                                                                       7                                      Karthik anxious about Gautam injury
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Delhi DareDevils hopes in the Indian Premier League (IPL) were dealt a blow Wednesday when their captain and star opener Gautam Gambhir suffered a hamstring injury in the match against the Mumbai Indians.         
	At the moment, I would not like to speculate on his injury, Dinesh Karthik, who led the side in Gambhirs absence, said. He is not looking good but I would tell you about his exact condition tomorrow (Thursday).         
	Karthik said that Gambhirs decision to opt for bowling after winning the toss was right but it backfired after Sachin Tendulkar launched into an offensive with the bat.         
	I would like anyone to captain the fielding team and do the field placements when Tendulkar is batting, Karthik said. It was impossible to set the field. He was hitting all around.         
	I know it was not the best way to start as captain. But Mumbai Indians scored too many runs.         
	We could have chased but lost early wickets. I think we should be able to make a comeback in the next match against Chennai, Karthik said.

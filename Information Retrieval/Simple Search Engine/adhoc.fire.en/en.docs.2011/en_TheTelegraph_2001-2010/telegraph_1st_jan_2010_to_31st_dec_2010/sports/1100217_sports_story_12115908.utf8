The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Back to Salt Lake for ODI boys
                                                                                                                       7                                      Back to Salt Lake for ODI boys
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The South African one-day specialists will again be training at the JU (Salt Lake ground) on Wednesday after they were refused permission by the Cricket Association of Bengal to train under lights at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	The five ODI specialists practised at the Eden for about an hour but were denied permission when the team management wanted an extra hour under lights.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey clarified the associations stand.         
	Prior to the commencement of the series we were briefed by the ICC that South Africas ODI specialists will train at the JU (Salt Lake) ground.         
	There was no such clause that we would have to provide them with floodlight facilities after the end of each days play. Thats what we told their team management, Dey said.         
	We have also told them that if they can bring a mail from the BCCI, we will provide the floodlight facilities.         
	The primary reason for the South African contingents unwillingness to practise at the JU (Salt Lake) ground is that it is not an enclosed one. The players are getting disturbed as a lot of students (it being a university campus) are flocking the ground to watch star batsman Herschelle Gibbs in action.         
	Meanwhile, ICC match referee Andy Pycroft has congratulated curator Prabir Mukherjee for presenting a nice Test match wicket.

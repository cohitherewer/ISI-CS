The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders, CSK in fight for survival
                                                                                                                       7                                        Knight Riders, CSK in fight for survival
  - McCullum may don the big gloves 
  -  Bond back in reckoning         INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a practice session in Chennai, on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Chennai: Long after most of the Kolkata Knight Riders players had retired following a strenuous evening session of almost three hours, Ishant Sharma was sweating it out under the watchful eyes of Dav Whatmore and Wasim Akram.         
	It was past nine, but there was no let up in intensity. Much hated and the subject of great ire, Ishant went through a rigorous round with the coach and the bowling consultant on Monday. His confidence has been dented and there is no guarantee he would play again as the Knights enter what is a make or break phase in their campaign.         
	As Akram was demonstrating the basics, a passer-by quipped: Why doesnt he bowl? He would have done a better job.         
	For the Knights, its time to stand up and be counted. The occasional errors and the time for excuses are over.         
	Will Sourav Gangulys vitriolic lashing of the team work wonders against the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday? Will the Knights be able to get rid of their inconsistencies and regain enough self-belief to beat Mahendra Singh Dhonis men in their own den?         
	Living on the edge of a cliff, they know a wrong step would send them crashing. Principal owner Shah Rukh Khans latest comments on Twitter  think the team need to introspect and play  has no doubt added to the pressure.         
	Unless Sourav and his men rally in spectacular style at the Chepauk, a long-cherished dream will remain buried. Unless the Knights introspect and show the mental and technical fortitude needed to win in T20, their remaining two home matches will be rendered irrelevant.         
	The Knights, in the current edition, havent won consecutive games since the first two. Far from learning more from defeat than victory, they have been victims of irrational game plans. Bad habit set in and bad luck followed, prompting Shah Rukh to tweet: momentum and consistency amiss.         
	Although Souravs superb form has served to give them head starts at the top of the order, the bowling has become the thorn in the flesh. David Husseys absence in the middle-order has given it a hollow look as was evident in the last game against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. From 100 for one in the 11th over, they could only manage 160 for nine.         
	As the search for the way ahead begins, the focus will be on working the right combination, especially the bowling. Ajantha Mendis is certain to get the boot. Iqbal Abdulla is being talked about and there is also a chance of Shane Bond making his way back. But the slow nature of the wicket could prove to be an impediment in Bonds inclusion. Murali Kartik, it is learnt, is yet to regain fitness.         
	There is also talk that Brendon McCullum may have to don the big gloves if Wriddhiman Saha is made to sit out. Another school of thought prefers including Hussey at the expense of Angelo Mathews.         
	Dav Whatmore was confident that the team morale was high despite the reversals. Yes, we could have fought a little bit harder in Bangalore. These things do happen People drop catches. On that night, it looked as though one teams fielding was fine while the other team was struggling to take the catch. It is never nice to be part of it.         
	What really counts is the reaction to it We are very keen to react in the right way and play some really good competitive cricket. This is part of IPL cricket. These are the sort of situations thrown up all the time. We are trying to focus on what we can control. We are trying the best we can, the Knights coach explained.         
	Much like the Knights, the Super Kings need to win all their remaining three matches although they are ahead on net run-rate. The loss to the Deccan Chargers, after three wins in a row at home, has made life difficult for Dhonis men.         
	The decision to drop Muttiah Muralidharan and include R. Ashwin hasnt gone down well in some quarters. Muralis experience is going to make a lot of difference in a high-pressure game like the one against the Knight Riders. Albie Morkel could also be tried out in place of Michael Hussey.         
	Were treating tomorrows match as a final We dont wish to leave it to the net run-rate factor, Morkel said.         
	For the record, the Super Kings have never lost to the Knights on Indian soil in their previous three meetings. Its not just the circumstances, history, too, is against the Knights.         
	Match starts: 8 pm.

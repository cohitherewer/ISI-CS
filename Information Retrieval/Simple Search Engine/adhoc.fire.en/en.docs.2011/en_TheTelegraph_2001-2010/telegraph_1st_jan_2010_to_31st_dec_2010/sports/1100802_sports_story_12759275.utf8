The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crunch tie for Bengal

            A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal players during a training session at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: A scrappy 1-1 draw was all that Bengal managed in their opening quarter final league encounter, against Delhi. And if Shabbir Alis wards harbour any hope of furthering their campaign in the 64th edition of the Santosh Trophy, they will have to give their best, preferably win, when they take on Mizoram, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday.         
	Also, Bengal have a record to protect having lifted the trophy every time they hosted the tournament.         
	Bengal, the previous edition finalists, did little to impress in their last outing. Lack of co-ordination dominated their display and had it not been for Jayanta Sens late equaliser, they would have faced the ignominy of losing to a bunch of unknowns from Delhi.         
	With an inexperienced strike-force at his disposal, Shabbir will have to infuse some kind of balance in the midfield to brighten things up. The last-match striking duo of Robin Singh and Tarif Ahmed were busy mispassing than work up some magic upfront. While Robin, the young TFA product, at least, looked promising, Tarif disappointed with his show.         
	However, Shabbir hinted that he might well opt for Shankar Oraon, who replaced Tarif in the last tie, to partner Robin in the starting line-up.         
	Also a case for worry, in the last match, was Bengals flank play. The failure of Subhashis Chakraborty and Snehasish Chakraborty to deliver quality balls from the flanks meant lesser scope for the Robin Singhs to find the net. Snehasish, however, was the better of the two and looks almost certain to retain his place.         
	Subhasish may have to vacate his place for Gauranga Dutta.         
	Its needless to say that in such a lacklustre scenario, it will all depend on the on-field chemistry of the experienced midfield duo of Jayanta Sen and Denson Devadas. If they click, the strikers wont be short on quality throughs.         
	However, containing the speedy youngsters from Mizoram will also be key to Bengals success. The act wont be that easy since Bengal will be missing the services of defender Sheikh Azim. Azim has been ruled out of the match after twisting his ankle during the last tie. In his absence, either Safar Sardar or Anupam Sarkar is expected to step in.         
	Speaking about his teams chances, Shabbir said that they will have to better their conversion for a victory.         
	Against Delhi, our rate of conversion was pathetic. We couldnt build on the momentum and that cost us a win. Against Mizoram, we have to win otherwise we are as good as out, Shabbir said.         
	For Mizoram, on the other hand, a defeat will end their Santosh Trophy campaign having lost their first match, to Tamil Nadu 0-2. They will have to overcome their inexperience with their energy to get the better of the hosts.         
	In the other match of the day, Tamil Nadu will lock horns with Delhi. While Tamil Nadu start favourites, it will be a mistake to write off Delhi, more so after their dogged display against Bengal.

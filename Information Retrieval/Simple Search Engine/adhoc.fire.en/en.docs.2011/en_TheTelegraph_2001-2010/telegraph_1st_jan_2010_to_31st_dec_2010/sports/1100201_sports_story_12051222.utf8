The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda in a spat with umpire
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dinda in a spat with umpire
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashok Dinda                           
	Calcutta: The saga of controversial incidents during the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) league matches doesnt seem to stop as on Sunday, there were trouble at two different grounds involving the umpires and respective clubs.         
	The first incident involved the controversial Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda and umpire Rabi Shankar Chakraborty during a Kalighat Club vs Sporting Union match at the Kalighat ground.         
	The other incident, at the Rajasthan ground, saw a Port Trust player  Gaurab Majumdar  chase umpire Subir Banerjee threatening to assault him with the bat in the match between Port and Rajasthan.         
	The altercation between Dinda and Chakraborty led to such a situation that the CABs assistant secretary, Naresh Ojha, had to rush to the ground to take a stock of the situation.         
	The incident happened just after lunch when Sporting Unions Sounak Das was at the crease. Dinda wrapped him on the pads and there was a loud and confident appeal by the Kalighat players. However, when umpire Chakraborty refused to budge, an agitated Dinda started quarrelling.         
	The matter was immediately reported to the CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey and Ojha was then assigned to look into the matter.         
	While umpires Chakraborty and Shakti Bhattacharya refused to make any comments citing the code of conduct, the Kalighat players seemed absolutely livid about the umpiring. One of their officials even verbally complained about umpiring being biased.         
	Dinda was a bit frustrated. It can happen when a bowler gives his all but doesnt get the desired result. One shouldnt read too much into the matter. If you ask me, the ball was hitting the middle stump But the umpire felt that the impact was outside leg stump, Kalighat skipper Manoj Tiwary told The Telegraph after the match.         
	Dinda, on his part, denied allegations of having said anything objectionable to the umpire. I just asked him why the batsman wasnt given out.         
	When Ojha was contacted, he said: I am not aware about any specific incident. I was just told that there were some problems at the Kalighat ground. The CAB will only react if any report is submitted.         
	The other incident at the Rajasthan ground happened when Gaurab was adjudged caught and bowled by umpire Banerjee.         
	A furious Gaurab chased the umpire, using choicest expletives. After some time, it was another Port player  Uday Srivastav who tried to hit umpire Gautam Burman after being run-out. Burman left the ground and wanted to leave.         
	However, he was persuaded by former India goalkeeper and Port Trust sports superintendent Shibaji Banerjee to officiate in the match. I apologise on behalf of the players for this kind of unacceptable behaviour. The players have also apologised to the umpires, Banerjee said.

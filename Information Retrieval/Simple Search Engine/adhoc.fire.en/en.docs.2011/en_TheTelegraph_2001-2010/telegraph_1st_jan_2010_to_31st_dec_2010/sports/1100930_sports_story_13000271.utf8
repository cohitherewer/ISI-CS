                                                                                                                       7                                        Butt withdraws allegations 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Ijaz Butt                           
	London: Ijaz Butt, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), has apologised to the England team for alleging they were involved in match-fixing, ending the threat of libel action.         
	Butt withdrew his remarks on Wednesday, after a meeting with Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB), and talks with the PCBs lawyers in London.         
	The ECB and the England team had threatened legal action against Butt unless he apologised for remarks, which almost caused the cancellation of the final two one-day Internationals between England and Pakistan.         
	Butt said in a carefully worded statement: I wish personally and on behalf of the Pakistan Cricket Board to withdraw the comments I made concerning the England and Wales Cricket Board, and each of the England players who played in the NatWest one day International at the Brit Insurance Oval on Friday 17 September.         
	It is regrettable that there was a misunderstanding arising from my comments. I would like to make it quite clear that in the statements which I made, I never intended to question the behaviour and integrity of the England players nor the ECB, nor to suggest that any of them were involved in any corrupt practices or in a conspiracy against Pakistan cricket.         
	In particular, I wish to make it clear that I have never seen any evidence of any wrongdoing by any England player or the ECB at any time. I deeply and sincerely regret that my statements have been interpreted to cast doubt upon the good names of the England players and the ECB and hope that this public withdrawal will draw a line under the matter.         
	The apology was accepted by the ECB and the players, while Clarke confirmed he will continue in his role as chairman of the ICCs Pakistan Task Force.         
	Butts humiliating climbdown followed 10 days of intense political pressure both from the ECB and within the ICC.         
	Butt made his allegations after the ICC launched an investigation into spot-fixing by Pakistan during a one-day International at the Oval following a tip-off from the Sun. Butt hit back, telling an Indian television station there is loud and clear talk in bookie circles that some English players were paid enormous amounts of money to lose.

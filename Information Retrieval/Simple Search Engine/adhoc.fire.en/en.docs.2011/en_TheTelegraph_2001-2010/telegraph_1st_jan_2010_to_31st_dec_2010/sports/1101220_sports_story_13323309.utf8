	Centurion: India coach Gary Kirsten, Sunday, paid tribute to Sachin Tendulkar for scoring a historic 50th Test hundred by describing him as a professor of batting.         
	Terming Tendulkars feat as incredible, Kirsten credited the batting maestros unmatched success to his sound technique, ability to play almost all shots in the book and diligent preparedness.         
	Its an incredible feat. It must be a special one and he deserves it. He has the techniques to play almost all the shots in the book. He is the professor of batting, Kirsten said while praising Tendulkar on becoming the first cricketer to score 50 Test hundreds here.         
	The key to his success is his approach to the game, his humility to learn and try to do better all the time. He diligently prepares for every match. For him, a Test match begins two days earlier, preparing for it. I am privileged to have associated with him for the last three years, Kirsten said.         
	His success at the top level under huge expectations in India is remarkable. It is quite different in India than other countries and the adulation he gets there is amazing. At any time, Tendulkar will be surrounded by 300 people, he said.         
	Kirsten said despite being the senior most player in the team, Tendulkar is the one who spends most time at the nets and faces maximum number of balls.         
	He wants to face the maximum number of balls at the nets. You will not see him play a loose shot at the nets. He is focused all the time, he wants to do better all the time, the Indian coach said.         
	He has been phenomenal this year. I think he is playing better than ever. He is enjoying his cricket at present, Kirsten added.         
	The former South African opening batsman said despite his personal achievements, Tendulkar was a perfect team-man who wants to do his best for the teams cause.         
	He is a perfect team-man and he always gives his best every time he goes out to a cricket field. He has been a huge motivational factor in the side in the past three years I have been associated with the team, Kirsten said.         
	About Indias struggle in the first Test, Kirsten said: Weve a lot to work tomorrow. South Africa are in a strong position. But let us see what happens tomorrow. May be there is help from rain also, he said.           (PTI)

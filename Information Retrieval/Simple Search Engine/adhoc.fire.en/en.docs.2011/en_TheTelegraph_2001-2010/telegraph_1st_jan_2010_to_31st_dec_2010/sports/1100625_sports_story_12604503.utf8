  - Brazil, Portugal face off in Durban
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  Brazils Luis Fabiano during a training session   in Durban, on Thursday      
	Durban: The city of Durban is one of South Africas top holiday destinations, thanks to its pleasant climate. It is also known for its sporting culture, football being on top of the priority list.         
	So, it is no surprise that Durban is buzzing with excitement on the eve of one of the most eagerly awaited match of the group phase between world No. 1 Brazil and No. 3 Portugal at the 70,000-seater Moses Mabhida Stadium, on Friday.         
	The city resembles a party destination with football fever well and truly gripping the people. While hundreds of Brazilian fans have thronged the town, the locals, too, have joined them.         
	The hotels here are making huge killings as they all stand overbooked till the match day. The Brazil fans have occupied most of the rooms on the beach sides and their flags could be spotted hanging out of almost each and every hotel window.         
	Portugal are lagging behind. A cursory look suggests not many supporters have descended on this town, thus far. The Portugal team also arrived late from their base camp and did not go for practice at the Durban Stadium. Brazil, on the other hand, preferred to practice here and for a change, coach Dunga allowed the mediapersons to sit through the entire training session.         
	Top star Kaka, whose absence because of suspension in the previous match will rob much of its sheen from the match, however, remained the star attraction. The former World Player of the Year made sure to shake hands with the group of schoolchildren, who came to watch the five-time world champions.         
	Brazil coach Dunga said Kakas absence wont harm the prospects of his team. My boys are supremely confident. Moreover, Kaka will be back in the next match. It is going to be a great match, we will play for the third consecutive win.         
	I know teams like Italy and France have crashed out. But we will continue to progress smoothly, promised the coach, who was in a relaxed mood. He even apologised to the fans for his rude behaviour on some occasions.         
	There was still some suspense over Cristiano Ronaldos availability for Fridays clash as word was that coach Carlos Queiroz may want to save his best player for the knock-out stage and not risk him with another booking that could rule him out. Another theory making rounds is that Ronaldo himself is keen to play the vital match.         
	When asked, Queiroz, dismissed any such possibility. I am not aware of any such move. As far as I know, Ronaldo is playing from the beginning, he said. Brazil is a great team and my first aim is to ensure qualification, said the coach.         
	Though any match between Brazil and Portugal promises to be a feast of skilful and attacking soccer, the lack of motivation on part of both teams could be a big factor.         
	With back-to-back wins against North Korea and Ivory Coast, Brazil have already qualified for the second round. Portugal, who have four point, have a technical chance of being eliminated but their 7-0 destruction of North Korea would give them a big advantage in terms of goal difference.         
	The fear then is that both teams could take it easy and not go that extra mile to put it across their rivals.         
	The teams will also want to top the Group of Death and boost their confidence going into the Group of 16, and even though neither team is admitting it, no one will want a clash with European champions Spain so early in the tournament.         
	Top Brazilian striker Luis Fabiano said his team was definitely going for a win. This final group game is very important for us to finish first. A draw would also be good but a win would give us the strength to go into the knock-out round really motivated.         
	Portugal are one of the teams we have faced more times in recent years. We thrashed them in Brasilia 6-2 and we lost against them in London 2-0, he said.         
	Brazils Elano and Deco of Portugal are likely to miss the match because of injuries.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Should have fastened the seat belt
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It was around 1.20 am when Lenin Cherukuri woke Ritul Chatterjee up. He told me he will be on the drivers seat as he wanted to enjoy driving on the six-lane National Highway. I was sleeping with my head on his lap. And within 10 minutes this accident happened, Ritul, still in a state of shock, said on Sunday afternoon.         
	I cant believe it. Lenin sir is not with us any more, the 15-year-old Commonwealth Games (CWG) compound silver medallist said. Ritul believed Lenin should have fastened the seat belt. That would have saved him. I strongly believe so.         
	He was bleeding profusely... We tried our best to stop the bleeding and asked for help. The ambulance came after about 40 minutes... It was all over by then, Ritul, who had a miraculous escape, said.         
	Ritul came to the Volga academy in 2007 and has been an integral part of the academy since then. He (Lenin) taught me everything. I will miss him badly, the Benaras-born archer said. We were discussing our plans for the World Championship in the car Now I will find it difficult to concentrate.         
	Dola Banerjee, the CWG double medallist was also shocked. He was cheering us on in Delhi and now he is no more. As fate would have it, his friend was driving the car, and then minutes before the accident, he took over. He was asked to coach the national compound team for the Games but he could not as his academy would have suffered, she said.         
	Jayanta Talukdar said: He was doing a wonderful job with the compound team.

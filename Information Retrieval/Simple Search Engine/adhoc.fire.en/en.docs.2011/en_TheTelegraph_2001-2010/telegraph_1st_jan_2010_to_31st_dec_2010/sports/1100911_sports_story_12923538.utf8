	Chester-le-Street: Pakistans problems didnt end on Friday as England won the rain-affected first ODI by 24 runs after Steven Davies set up victory with 87 from just 67 balls.         
	In a game, reduced to 41 overs per side, after overnight rain delayed the start by 105 minutes, England limited Pakistan to 250 for nine. Four bowlers claimed two wickets each while Kamran Akmal (53) and his brother Umar (43) offered resistance but could not remain long enough to threaten England.         
	England posted 274 for six after losing the toss in damp and breezy conditions courtesy of opener Davies innings that included 13 boundaries. Jonathan Trott hit 69 from 78 balls. Off-spinner Saeed Ajmal limited the damage with figures of four for 58.         
	Pakistan tried to get on with the game of cricket after the distraction of the spot-fixing allegations that have blighted the teams focus in recent days. The three suspended players facing anti-corruption charges  Mohammed Aamer, Mohammed Asif and Salman Butt returned home Friday. Putting in spirited performances is important for them and the game of cricket, England captain Andrew Strauss said. Cricket was the winner today.         
	Pakistan coach Waqar Younis was pleased with his teams improvement on recent performances. England are playing superb cricket in Twenty20 as well as one-day cricket they are a much better unit, Waqar said.         
	The Pakistan innings started strongly as Kamran and Mohammed Hafeez put on 62 for the first wickets in just under 13 overs.         
	Kamran was dropped on 33 by Andrew Strauss at backward point off Michael Yardy and again on 34 by Trott off Graeme Swann at long on. His eventual dismissal gave Swann his 50th wicket in ODIs.           (REUTERS)

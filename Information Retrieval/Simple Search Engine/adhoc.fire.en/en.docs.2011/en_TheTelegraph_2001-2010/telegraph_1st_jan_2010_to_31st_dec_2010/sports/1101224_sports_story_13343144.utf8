The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BWF pulls up Saina for pull-out
                                                                                                                       7                                      BWF pulls up Saina for pull-out
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Mumbai/New Delhi: Star Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal faces disciplinary action and a fine of $5000 after the Badminton World Federation (BWF) issued her a showcause notice on Thursday for pulling out of the BWF Super Series final, to be held in Taipei, next month.         
	World No. 4 Saina pulled out of the Super Series final, to be played between January 5 and 9, citing a ligament strain in her left leg, the same injury that kept her out of the Indian Open Grand Prix, in Hyderabad, last week.         
	Admitting that she has received a letter from the international body, Saina said: They (BWF) have asked for documentary evidence of injury. I will be sending the papers tomorrow (Friday), said the ace shuttler.         
	Speaking on the matter, Sainas father Harbir Singh said: The letter from the BWF says Sainas withdrawal has been accepted, but it goes on to mention that we have to submit the proof (of injury) and that the matter will go to the disciplinary committee.         
	We wanted to give her two weeks rest. Thats why she didnt play last week. But the swelling, which subsided after some rest, came back after she started practising.         
	We will give the doctors certificate, thats all we can do. We dont know how they will decide.         
	Singh ruled out Saina appearing before tournament officials at the venue for their own assessment of her injury. She cant travel, thats the problem If she sits for three-four hours, the swelling would come back, he said.         
	It was only in November this year that the BWF amended its regulation dealing with player commitment, affecting a penalty of $5000 for pulling out of the final, which offers a total prize money of $500,000.         
	The decision was much needed as withdrawals citing mild injuries are rampant in badminton. Previously, the fine was a meagre $250.         
	The final, actually a year-end event of the 2010 calendar, is the climax of the 12-leg BWF Super Series circuit. It will feature the top eight players based on Super Series rankings, as opposed to the world rankings.         
	Saina is placed seventh in the Super Series standings.         
	Badminton Association of India (BAI) sources, however, felt there was nothing to get unduly worried about and BWF would surely clear Saina once it receives the proof of the injury.         
	BAI has sent the letter to Saina. We hope she will be cleared of the charges, said Punnaiah Choudary, a senior official of the BAI.

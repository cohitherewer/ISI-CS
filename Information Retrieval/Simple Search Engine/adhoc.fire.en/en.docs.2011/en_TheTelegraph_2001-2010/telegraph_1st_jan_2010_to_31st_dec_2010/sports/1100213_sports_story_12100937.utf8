                                                                                                                       7                                        Classic draws Dhoni to HQ
  - Team India captain visits Lalbazar       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni leaving Lalbazar on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: While teammates may marvel at the latest from the Ferrari assembly line, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is known to be bowled over by bikes.         
	Trust him to say apni, apni pasand ki baat hai...         
	A Hummer stands out in the Team India captains garage (which is more like a warehouse) in Ranchi, but there are seven bikes from one manufacturer alone!         
	Dhonis fascination for that particular model took him to the city police HQ, in Lalbazar, late on Friday. The visit was arranged by Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner, HQ.         
	Its a classic, where Im concerned... It has been maintained very well, a distinctly pleased Dhoni told The Telegraphafter completing a low-on-speed round of the premises.         
	The model stopped being manufactured in the early 1990s and only two such bikes are still being used by the Calcutta police  one serves as a pilot for the states governor, the other is on duty with a Traffic Guard.         
	While the one assigned to Raj Bhavan couldnt be brought to Lalbazar as it was being serviced, the other did make Dhonis evening.         
	Even within Lalbazar, few knew that Dhoni would be coming, but his arrival around 9.30 pm saw dozens of police personnel (men and women) gather around Indias World T20-winning captain and the classic bike.         
	Shamims instructions of no asking for autographs and photographs on camera phones only were followed.         
	Dhoni spent around half-an-hour there and, before leaving, was presented a German silver mug bearing the insignia of the city police. Ill be using it, he said, touched by the gesture.         
	The presentation was made by Shamim, on behalf of the police commissioner, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	Dhoni ended the day, which had seen two-and-a-half hours of training/nets ahead of the second and final Test against South Africa, with a trip to a sportswear and sports gear manufacturing outlet.         
	The idea was to avoid fans, but some sneaked in and many gathered outside the showroom. We lead a tough life, Dhoni sighed, fastening his seat belt for the drive back to the Taj Bengal.

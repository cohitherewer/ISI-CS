	Kingstown: Shivnarine Chanderpaul hit 58 to take the West Indies to 245 for nine against Zimbabwe in the third one-day International here Wednesday.         
	Chanderpaul struck two fours and a six in 76 deliveries. Captain Chris Gayle, with 33, laid a solid platform in a first-wicket stand of 48 with Adrian Barath, who contributed 35.         
	Prosper Utseya removed both openers to stall the West Indies. Simon Taufel Wednesday joined the exclusive club of five umpires who have officiated in 150 or more ODIs during the match. Taufel, 39, made his international debut on January 13, 1999, in a match between Australia and Sri Lanka.

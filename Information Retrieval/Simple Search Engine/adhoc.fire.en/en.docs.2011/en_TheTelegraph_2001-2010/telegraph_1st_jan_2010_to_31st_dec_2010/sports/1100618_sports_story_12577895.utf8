The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robinho ready to take over
                                                                                                                       7                                      Robinho ready to take over
                      
	Johannesburg: With Kaka struggling, Robinho is willing to change the way he plays to help Brazil gain more creativity at midfield at the World Cup.         
	Kaka is not at his best after a season plagued by injuries, and his lacklustre performance in the opening match against North Korea may give Robinho the responsibility to lead Brazil in the teams second Group G match against the Ivory Coast on Sunday.         
	Robinho moved into Kakas midfield position when the Real Madrid playmaker was substituted in the 78th minute of the opener, and he may have to do the same against the Ivory Coast if Kaka is not fit to play the entire match again.         
	There is no problem if Dunga wants me to play that way, Robinho said. We have several players who can substitute Kaka if needed, but Ive played like that before so it would be fine for me.         
	Kaka and Robinho arrived in South Africa as Brazils biggest stars, but Kaka is the man responsible for commanding the midfield and creating scoring opportunities for the strikers.         
	With him struggling, Brazil had difficulties getting past the solid North Korea defence and only won 2-1 after Maicon broke through with a 55th-minute goal from a tight angle.         
	Robinho was Brazils most dangerous player against North Korea, playing well when he was up front and when he moved back to midfield. Dunga practised the team with me playing back and Im adapted to it, Robinho said. Thats how I play with Santos sometimes, coming back to get the ball and creating plays for my teammates.         
	Robinho moved to midfield after Dunga replaced Kaka with striker Nilmar, but the coach also has the option of using Julio Baptista and Elano in Kakas position if needed. He also tried right back Daniel Alves at midfield recently.         
	Brazil has many quality players and Dunga can try several different formations without compromising the team, Nilmar said.         
	Kaka is struggling to find his form after sustaining groin and thigh injuries that forced him to miss several matches with Real Madrid this season. He was still treating the left thigh ailment when he arrived in South Africa and is having a hard time regaining his rhythm.         
	Kaka is still very important in our team, Robinho said. He can be decisive even if he is not well.         
	Robinho doesnt have a problem taking over Kakas position if needed, but he knows he will have extra pressure if he is chosen to command the Brazilian midfield.         
	I know that Ill have to play like I played in the first match or even better, Robinho said. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Low turnout at Santosh camp
                                                                                                                       7                                      Low turnout at Santosh camp
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Shabbir    
	Calcutta: The senior Bengal teams preparation for the upcoming Santosh Trophy began on a disappointing note with only 12 among the 39 probables being present at Salt Lake Stadium during first days practice, Tuesday. Coach Shabbir Ali and IFA general secretary Utpal Ganguli are hopeful that there will be a better turnout over the next two days.         
	However, both admitted that there had been a miscommunication because most of the players said that they hadnt been informed properly about the training schedule.         
	Since this is the first day, we arent really perturbed with the turnout. In another two days, things will be much better. Also there has been a miscommunication on the part of the clubs. As a result, most of the players didnt know about the training schedule. The IFA had despatched letters to the clubs about the selection of players from their respective clubs. It was the clubs duty to inform the players, Ganguli said on Tuesday.         
	Coach Ali tried to put up a brave front and said that he has spoken to the senior players. I have already clarified my stand. If anyone is unwilling to play for Bengal, he wont be considered for selection. This year, we are the hosts and it is our duty to field the best team. As of now, the players we have selected are the best of the lot. I hope all of them will give their hundred per cent for the team.         
	Saumik Dey, Anupam Sarkar, Budiram Tudu and Abhra Mondal were some of the players from big clubs who reported for training.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mortaza ruled out of Test series, too
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mortaza ruled out of Test series, too
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Mashrafe Mortaza will not play in the two-Test series against India. The regular Bangladesh captain, who is missing the tri-series as well, is recuperating from a knee injury.         
	Im not playing the Test matches I need some more time to get back to match fitness, and will be only available for the New Zealand tour, Mortaza told The Telegraph on Monday. Shakib-al Hasan will lead in his absence.         
	Bangladeshs tour of New Zealand follows the series versus India. The 14-member squad for the two Tests against India, announced Monday, includes rookie pacer Shafiul Islam.         
	It was learnt that Mortaza was declared fit by the team physio, but he does not want to rush things. The all-rounder damaged his knee during the West Indies tour in July last year. The injury ruled him out of the rest of the tour and the subsequent one-dayers against Zimbabwe, both home and away.         
	Bangladeshs premier strike bowler was, however, selected in the 26-member preliminary squad, later reduced to 18, for the ongoing tri-series, and named captain. He decided against playing in the Idea Cup.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders pacer also rued missing out on the ongoing conditioning camp in Calcutta. Even if I was fit, I couldnt have been there because of this series No doubt it would have been a great opportunity to work under Dav Whatmore again, and Wasim Akram.         
	The 26-year-old was treated shabbily during his first year with the Knights in South Africa. He got to play only one match during the John Buchanan era, leaving him disappointed and frustrated.         
	Theres no doubt that he will be looking to make amends this year.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Shakib-al Hasan (captain), Mushfiqur Rahim (vice-captain), Mohammed Ashraful, Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddiqui, Mahmudullah Riyad, Roqibul Hassan, Shahriar Nafees, Shahdat Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Enamul Haque (jr), Mahbubul Alam, Shafiul Islam.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Sehwag bats for Yuvraj
    - India vice-captain calls left-hander a jewel, predicts he will be back soon                 Sehwag                           
	New Delhi: India vice-captain Virender Sehwag threw his weight behind out-of-form Yuvraj Singh, calling him a jewel and predicting that the left-hander would soon be back in the Indian side after sorting out his fitness issues.         
	He has been a jewel for India and Im a great fan of him, Sehwag said.         
	Times like this comes because of (lack of) form but Im sure he would sort out his fitness and batting skills and will make a comeback soon, said the opener.         
	All he (Yuvraj) needs is to spend time on his own and think about his game, advised Sehwag.         
	Yuvraj did not find a place in Indias Asia Cup squad because of lack of form and poor fitness.         
	Yuvraj had a forgettable outing in IPL III and he looked out of sorts in the World Twenty20 as well.         
	Sehwag too had some injury issues of late but the star batsman said he is fully ready for the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka.         
	My shoulder has healed. I worked on my shoulders in the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore and Im fully fit now, Sehwag said.         
	Asked for his view on the young Indian players technical frailties against short-pitch bowling, Sehwag said they would grow better with experience.                   Yuvraj      
	People said the same thing about me. Give them some time and they would get better as they get experienced.         
	Once they play more than 100 ODIs, they would do well. (Suresh) Raina, Rohit (Sharma), Gautam (Gambhir)  they would be ready by the time you have World Cup, Sehwag said.         
	Asked about the BCCIs decision of not sending cricket teams to the Asian Games in China, where cricket is making debut, the batsman said he could not do anything about it.         
	It is not in my hand, that is for the BCCI to decide.         
	But wherever they send us, we would go and play, said Sehwag.           (PTI)

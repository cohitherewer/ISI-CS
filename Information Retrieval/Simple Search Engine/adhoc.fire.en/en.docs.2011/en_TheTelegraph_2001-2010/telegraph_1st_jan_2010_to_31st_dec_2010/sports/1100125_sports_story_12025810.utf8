	Melbourne: Sania Mirzas campaign ended with a straight-set defeat in the womens doubles third round on a disappointing day for the Indians at the Australian Open here Sunday.         
	Sania and her Spanish partner Virginia Ruano Pascual were handed a 4-6, 3-6 defeat by the seventh-seeded Russian-Italian combination of Alisa Kleybanova and Francesca Schiavone.         
	In boys singles, Vaidik Munshaw went down 4-6, 5-7 (7) to Belgian Arthur de Greef.         
	However, Rishika Sunkara brought some smiles to Indian camp after defeating Miyu Kato of Japan 6-4 6-2 to enter the second round. The 16-year-old Sunkara, who had to play the qualifier to make it to the main draw of the girls singles, will next take on third seeded Daria Gavrilova of Russia.         
	On Monday, Indian hopes would rest on Leander Paes who will play his pre-quarterfinal match in the mens doubles. Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded third, will take on the unseeded Americans John Isner and Sam Querrey.         
	Later, Paes will team up with Zimbabwean Cara Black to take on the Uzbek-South African pair of Akgul Amanmuradova and Rik De Voest in the mixed doubles second round.         
	In the juniors event, Rishika will team up with Japans Yuki Ito in girls doubles against the sixth-seeded German-Dane duo of Anna-Lena Friedsam and Mai Grage. Munshaw will pair up with Chinas Chuhan Wang in the boys doubles and the duo will open against fourth seeds Liang-Chi Huang of Taipei and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan.

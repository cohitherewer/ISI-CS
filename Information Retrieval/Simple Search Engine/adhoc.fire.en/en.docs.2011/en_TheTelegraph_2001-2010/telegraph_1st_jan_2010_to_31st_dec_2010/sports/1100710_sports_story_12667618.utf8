The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa, Sneijder lead nominations
                                                                                                                       7                                        Villa, Sneijder lead nominations
                      
	Johannesburg: Leading tournament scorers Wesley Sneijder of the Netherlands and David Villa of Spain headline the list of Fifas 10 nominees for the World Cup Golden Ball award.         
	Fifa announced the list Friday selected by its technical study group.         
	Sneijder and Villa have each scored five goals and will go head-to-head in Sundays final at Johannesburgs Soccer City.         
	Also nominated were Diego Forlan of Uruguay, Asamoah Gyan of Ghana, Andreas Iniesta of Spain, Lionel Messi of Argentina, Mesut Oezil of Germany, Arjen Robben of the Netherlands, Bastian Schweinsteiger of Germany and Xavi Hernandez of Spain.         
	Media members will vote to determine the tournaments best player after the final, with silver and bronze balls also to be handed out.         
	Previous winners include Ronaldo of Brazil (1998), Oliver Kahn of Germany (2002) and Zinedine Zidane of France (2006).         
	Defenders are conspicuous by their absence from this years shortlist considering Fabio Cannavaro was the Golden Ball winner in the last edition. The Italy captain himself had a poor championship and bid adieu to international football after the 2006 winners failed to progress beyond the group stages.         
	Germany striker Thomas Mueller, meanwhile, could crown an unbelievable first season in top flight football with the World Cups young player of the tournament award after he was picked as one of three candidates.         
	I was just told on the way here and it is a great honour to be selected as one of the nominees, the 20-year-old Bayern Munich striker said on Friday. It is a wonderful recognition of your work.         
	The other two are Ghanas Dede Ayew and Mexicos Giovani Dos Santos.         
	Mueller has scored four goals in his first World Cup, grabbing a starting spot for Germany throughout the tournament after winning his first cap as recently as March. He could add to this goal tally in Germanys third place playoff against Uruguay after missing their 1-0 semi-final defeat to Spain through suspension.         
	Only 15 months ago Mueller was playing third division football with the Bayern reserves.         
	But in his first full season with Bayern, Mueller was instrumental in helping them win the domestic league and Cup double as well as play in their losing Champions League final against Inter Milan.         
	He then immediately joined the Germany squad at their training camp in Italy before flying to South Africa.         
	Franz Beckenbauer in 1966 and Lukas Podolski in 2006 are the only other two German players to have won this award, the German soccer federation said.         
	It is quite unbelievable because a lot has happened in the past season. But to be honest I would have preferred winning the World Cup than win this award, Mueller said.         
	The versatile striker missed his biggest game till date when he was suspended from the semi-final and had to watch his teammates lose to Spain from the sidelines.         
	Mueller said he was now looking forward to some much-deserved rest before the Bundesliga kicks off next month.         
	I am really looking forward to the three weeks being away from it all. I will go home, enjoy the three weeks of holidays. I need this peace and being away from everything after such a long season, he said.

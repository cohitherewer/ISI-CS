	Bloemfontein: Graeme Smi-th steered South Africa to a seven-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in a T20 encounter at Bloemfontein on Friday. The Proteas batsman scored a breezy 58 (off 29 deliveries) chasing down the visitors 168 with 25 balls to spare. Zimbabwe bowlers failed to put the brakes on South African batters. The hosts lead the two-match series 1-0. (Agencies)

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gary Kirsten at the Motera on Friday                           
	Ahmedabad: Team India coach Gary Kirsten didnt hide his satisfaction while trying to sum up the performance of his boys over the past few months, at the media conference before the teams afternoon training session.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Indias performance in the last four months         
	Its been an extremely satisfying last few months as a coach. We got the No.1 ranking in Tests and then did well enough to retain it. We are No.2 in ODIs. I am immensely proud of our teams achievements.         
	The recipe for success         
	Its because the guys responded when they needed to. The boys have handled pressure situations really well. I am particularly proud because we have done well as a team and the individuals have performed brilliantly as well. Sachin and the other seniors have been exceptional. They played as a unit and for one cause. They took pride in each others achievements.         
	Hoping for a clean sweep         
	We are very serious about making it 3-0 tomorrow.         
	The relatively inexperienced side         
	I would like to view it from a different perspective. A lot of young players means there is freshness in the squad. They bring in a lot of energy on the field. Also, with a year left for the World Cup, this is their chance of showing what they are capable of.         
	Opening combination in the absence of Sachin and Sehwag         
	We would like to keep it to ourselves.         
	On opportunities for the new players         
	Its up to them to make use of the limited opportunities they get.         
	Sachin thanking him for his support         
	It means a lot to me when its coming from someone like him. I am proud to be the coach of this Indian team. Its a great feeling that the effort I have put in is showing results.         
	Thoughts on the World T20         
	That is one area we need to work on. We havent done too well in this format in recent times. The IPL is round the corner and all the boys will be focused on doing well. A good performance at the IPL will certainly not go unnoticed. Although I would be in South Africa, spending time with my family, I would be monitoring the performance of the boys. I will definitely be in touch with them.         
	On the pace attack being a worry         
	Yes, thats one area where we are yet to pick out the four or five that will fit into our scheme of things. We have some eight to nine bowlers and everybody should work hard and make use of their chances.         
	On Abhimanyu Mithun and Sudeep Tyagi         
	Both are talented boys. Sudeep will, in fact, play tomorrow.

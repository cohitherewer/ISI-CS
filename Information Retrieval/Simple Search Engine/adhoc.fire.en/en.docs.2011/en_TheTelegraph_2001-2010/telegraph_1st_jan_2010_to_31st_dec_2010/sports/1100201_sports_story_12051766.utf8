	Gill view  
	New Delhi: The appointment of a Ukrainian coach by the shooters themselves has not gone down well with sports minister MS Gill who said they should have showed more patience though the marksmen argued that they could not wait longer for things to happen. Gill, however, said he has taken note of their demand and had asked his ministry officials to look into the matter.

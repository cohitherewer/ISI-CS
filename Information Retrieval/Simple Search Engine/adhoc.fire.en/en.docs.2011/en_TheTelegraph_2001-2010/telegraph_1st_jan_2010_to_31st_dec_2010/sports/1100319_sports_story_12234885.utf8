	Manchester United are aiming to steal a march on their Premier League rivals by exploiting the clubs rocketing popularity in India and riding the wave of the subcontinents IPL-inspired sports advertising boom.         
	Uniteds London-based commercial operation has conducted a detailed study into the opportunities open to the club in India. And results have highlighted the huge potential in the country.         
	A five-year deal, worth 12 million, with the Indian mobile communications company was sealed last May and moves are now under way to extend Uniteds links to India, with the likelihood of the team visiting the country within the next two years.         
	Uniteds research has shown that they have 20 million supporters in India, with their fixtures broadcast to 1.15 billion homes in 2008-09.         
	And in a direct comparison with the 2008 Formula One seasons final Grand Prix from Sao Paulo, which attracted 156 million viewers in India, Uniteds Champions League final victory against Chelsea in May 2008 was watched by 267 million people in the country.         
	In an effort to forge closer ties with India, the club recently hosted a global brands event staged by the +91 Europe, a network of Indian CEOs, which was aimed at emphasising Uniteds value to prospective Indian partners.         
	Rakesh Rawal, founder of +91 Europe, said: As India has largely shrugged off the global downturn, I can see many Indian multinationals becoming household names in the next five to 10 years.         
	And it will be fascinating to see which Indian companies embrace global sports like football to enhance their global brand recognition.         
	Uniteds focus on India was sharpened by the interest in Bayern Munichs visit to Calcutta in May 2008, which saw 120,000 fans turn out to watch the Germans.         
	Casper Stylsvig, Uniteds sponsorship manager, said: In Europe, 86 per cent of all sponsorship goes to sport. In India, that figure is just 10 per cent.         
	We expect that to change. Football is the second-most popular sport behind cricket in India and there is a huge English-speaking audience who actively watch the game.

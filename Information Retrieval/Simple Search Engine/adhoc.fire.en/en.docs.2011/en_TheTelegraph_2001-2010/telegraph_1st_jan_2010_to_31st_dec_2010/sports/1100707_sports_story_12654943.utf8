The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor may not have time
                                                                                                                       7                                        Taylor may not have time
    - CRICKET AUSTRALIA BOARD MEETS THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS THE NOMINATION ISSUE             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mark Taylor                                 
	Calcutta: Former Australia captain Mark Taylors name has been unofficially floated as an alternative to ex-Prime Minister John Howard, for the vice-presidents post in the International Cricket Council (ICC), but he may himself not be available for the job.         
	The Sydney-based Taylor has just returned home after a holiday in the US and, according to a confidant, hadnt given any thought to possibly being jointly nominated by Cricket Australia (CA) and New Zealand Cricket (NZC).         
	Taylor would, of course, be a terrific choice and the India-captained lobby wouldnt have reservations.         
	However         
	Right now, Mark doesnt have the time for any position which calls for much work, even if its largely behind the scenes Hes not the type to not put in that 100 per cent into everything, the confidant told The Telegraph, on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Outstanding as captain, Taylor was also a superb opening batsman (7,525 runs in Tests; 3,514 in ODIs). In more recent years, the 45-year-old has made a mark as a classy commentator on Channel Nine and has been a director on CAs board.         
	Taylor, incidentally, is on the ICCs Cricket Committee as well.         
	An alternative (a renomination, technically) has to be decided upon by August 31, as the ICCs Executive Board threw out Howards nomination during the recent annual conference week, in Singapore.         
	Howard has said he isnt withdrawing, but CA and NZC cant risk further humiliation.         
	Seven of the 10 Test-playing nations opposed Howard, compelling CA and NZC (the England and Wales Cricket Board, too) to not press for a vote.         
	The fierce opposition, for a number of reasons, remains.         
	Because of the stand taken by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the West Indies, the ICC is today without a vice-president.         
	Sharad Pawar, who got elevated last week, will be the ICCs president till the summer of 2012. The next vice-president is the one wholl succeed him.         
	The CA board, one learns, will meet this week itself and, once its position is clear, will again start a dialogue with NZC.         
	It wont surprise if NZC insists that after the Howard fiasco, a New Zealander gets to be the replacement.         
	For the record, NZC chairman Alan Isaac would be acceptable to India and the rest.         
	The last time, CA and NZC sought (and got) an extension from the ICC, as they couldnt agree on the joint nominee for months. Now, the situation has changed and theyve got to reach an agreement over the next seven weeks.         
	A T20 approach will have to be taken.

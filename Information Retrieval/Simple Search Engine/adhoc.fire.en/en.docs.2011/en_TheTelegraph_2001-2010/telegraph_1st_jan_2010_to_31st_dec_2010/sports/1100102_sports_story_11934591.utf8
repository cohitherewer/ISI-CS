	 Delhi speedster Ishant Sharma and Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary are expected to attend the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) camp at the Eden Gardens from January 8.       
	Ishant will play in the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Mumbai from Sunday. There is no reason why he wouldnt attend the camp. The camp is primarily for their top domestic players, like Cheteshwar Pujara, said senior KKR official Joy Bhattacharya.       
	It will also be the first camp for Manoj who has recently moved to KKR from the Delhi DareDevils. Former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar is also expected to attend the camp. The KKR management is also trying to work out a short trip to Bangladesh where they plan to play three T20 practice games.

The agreement was signed between the officials of the state sports department and BHA in presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and sports minister Kanti Ganguly. The agreement will be valid for five years.

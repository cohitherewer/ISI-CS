The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan loses   a marathon
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rohan loses   a marathon
    - Somdev too falls in a five-setter as brazil take 2-0 lead           K. KUMARASWAMY            Somdev Dev Varman, in Chennai, on Friday                                       
	Chennai: Though India did not bother much about the higher rankings of the Brazilians on the eve of the match, by the end of the day it appeared that rankings merit better skills afterall.         
	Both Rohan Bopanna and Somdev Dev Varman were outlasted by Thomaz Bellucci and Ricardo Mello, respectively, in the singles rubbers, setting back Indias quest to remain in the elite division of the mens team competition.         
	If Bellucci eked out a 6-7 (2) 7-6 (7) 7-5 4-6 10-8 victory in four hours and 28 minutes, Mello slugged it all the way for a 4-6 6-2 6-7 (3) 6-2 6-4 in four hours and 12 minutes, the second match requiring the lights at the Nungambakkam stadium to be turned on.         
	Another day, both Bopanna and Dev Varman would have taken heart from their effort. On Friday, it hurt them that they had advantage to seal the issue but were unable to do so.         
	Bopanna, the toast of Indian tennis after his US Open exploits, failed to convert three match points and Dev Varman broke back after going down 4-3 in the seventh game, only to drop serve in the very next. All that in the final sets!         
	Contrast that with Bellucci coming from 2-5 down and Mello hanging in after losing serve in their respective deciders  there in lays the tale of the two teams.         
	So, not for the first time, India would now look up to Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi to win the doubles rubber on Saturday and keep the tie alive on the final day.         
	Bopanna was easily the more aggressive player than Bellucci, who at 27 was ranked 450 places above him. But the 30-year-old from Coorg suffered due to a lack of singles matches and failed to last the distance.         
	But while he might have lacked the solidity, Bopanna showed how much his game has come up in the last two years.         
	The Bangalorean cranked 27 aces in all. More importantly, he was delivering them on his second serves. The kick serve that left Bellucci often wrong-footed was both deceptive and powerful.         
	At the other end, Bellucci had 13 double faults and also muffed several drop shots. But he also delivered 24 aces, six of them in the decider. If it was the double fault that cost him the first set tiebreak, the aces won him the second.         
	When the visitor took the third set, the momentum was well on his side, but the Indian snatched the fourth against run of play.         
	A glorious forehand winner on the run made it 0-30 when the Brazilian was serving for the set and match. Then Bellucci muffed a sitter while attempting a drop shot to give his rival the only break point of the set.         
	Bopanna converted it with a world class return winner.         
	Then the home favourite had the match in his pocket when he had a double break in the final set. But once Bellucci saved three match points while serving at 2-5, the wind seemed to go out Bopannas sail.         
	Double faults began to creep in and he dropped the very next game to allow Bellucci back into the match.         
	Dev Varman was off to a flier as he won 14 of the first 15 points. But that was too good to sustain for over four hours for any player.         
	The tide turned when he failed to carry on the momentum of winning the third set tiebreak into the fourth set in which he lost serve in games that he had game point.

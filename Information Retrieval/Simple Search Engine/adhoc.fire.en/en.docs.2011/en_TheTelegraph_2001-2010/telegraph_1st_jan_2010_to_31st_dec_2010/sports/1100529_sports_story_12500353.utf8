            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Shahadat Hossain (right) celebrates the dismissal of James Anderson, at Lords, on Friday                           
	London: It was Bangladeshs day at Lords on Friday as they fought back to ensure England will have to work hard for victory in the first Test.         
	Five wickets for quick bowler Shahadat Hossain was followed by a half centuries for opener Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique as Bangladesh dismissed England for 505 and chipped away at the follow on target.         
	Hossain became the first Bangladeshi to write his name on the Lords honours board with five for 98 as he polished off the England tail following Jonathan Trotts mammoth innings of 226.         
	Trott became the first English batsman for three years to score a Test double hundred but there was little support from his colleague with the next highest score 83 by Andrew Strauss on the first day.         
	Trott reached his double hundred off 318 balls with 18 fours and it was a chanceless innings, if not the most exciting knock ever to be played at this ground.         
	He lost his overnight partner, Eoin Morgan, in the third over of the day when he pushed at a ball outside off stump and was caught behind for 44.         
	Matt Prior, a man needing Test runs to quell the threat to his place from Craig Kieswetter, was run out for 16 following a mix up with Trott.         
	Tim Bresnan upped the tempo with a couple of powerful strokes but played at a ball slanted across him as Hossain began an impressive spell from the Pavilion End.         
	He dismissed Trott in his next over when he guided a catch straight to backward point.

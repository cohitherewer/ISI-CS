The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray loses to Ferrer

	Rome: After displaying the confident tennis that lifted him to world No. 2 last year in his Rome Masters opener, Andy Murray struggled again on Thursday, losing 3-6. 4-6 to Spains David Ferrer.         
	The Britons poor third-round display suggests he is not out of the woods after snapping a run of three defeats against Italys Andreas Seppi on Tuesday.         
	Murray put himself under pressure from the off, getting in fewer than a third of his first serves in the opening set, which 13th seed Ferrer sealed with a sweet drop volley after breaking in the sixth game.         
	The poor serving infected other parts of Murrays game and he shook himself a few times, apparently baffled by his own ineptitude, before conceding serve again in the seventh game of the second set.         
	Clay specialist Ferrer served out to beat the world No. 5 on his least favourite surface and set up a quarter-final with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.         
	World No. 2 Novak Djokovic progressed too, with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Thomaz Bellucci that was harder than the score suggested.         
	Djokovic, the 2008 champion, had to come from a break down in each set against the Brazilian, who put up a lively display but at times had trouble keeping his big serve under control.         
	The Serbian will now meet in-form Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who thrashed him in the semi-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters two weeks ago.         
	Verdasco, fresh from his triumph at last weeks Barcelona Open, booked his place in the last eight with a 6-4, 7-6 win over his compatriot Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.         
	I dont think Im the favourite at all. I suppose if I play an aggressive game, then I will have a good chance to win, Djokovic told a news conference when asked about the Verdasco match.         
	In the doubles, fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi went down fighting against American pair of John Isner and Sam Querry.         
	The Indo-Belarusian pair lost 2-6, 7-6(5), 6-10 in the pre-quarters in one hour and 29 minutes.         
	Bhupathi and Mirnyi, who had ended runners-up at the Monte Carlo Masters event last week, dropped their serve twice in the opening set to concede lead.         
	They put up a good fight and saved a breakpoint in the score-levelling second set win. The Americans, though, were in mood to give into the momentum of their opponents and kept their cool to seal the win in the Super tie-breaker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salgaocar favourites 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Salgaocar favourites 
                      
	Margao: Riding high after their comprehensive victory over East Bengal, Salgaocar look favourite against a demoralised Sporting Clube de Goa in the 19th round of the I-League, to be played at the Nehru Stadium, here on Saturday.         
	A 4-1 home win over Calcutta giants East Bengal, moved Salgaocar out of the bottom two but they are still only one point above the drop zone so coach Karim Bencharifa would know that there is very little room for error.         
	Upfront Salgaocar will be looking to Ekene Ikenwa and Keita Mandjou for the goals.         
	Meanwhile in Mumbai, relegation-threatened Mumbai FC will look to end a seven-match winless streak when they take on Pune FC at the Cooperage. (PTI)

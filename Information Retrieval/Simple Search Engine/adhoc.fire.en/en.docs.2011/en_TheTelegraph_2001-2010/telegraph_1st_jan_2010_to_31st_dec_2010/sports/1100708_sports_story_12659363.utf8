The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt may quit after the 2016 Games
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bolt may quit after the 2016 Games
                  Usain Bolt                     
	Lausanne: Jamaican triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt said on Tuesday he may end his record-breaking career after the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games.         
	My aim is to go to two more Olympics, he said. I probably will retire in Brazil, 2016. I will probably stop then.         
	The Olympic and world 100 and 200 metres champion and world record holder was speaking during a question-and-answer session with 400 sport and business executives.         
	They almost filled a business school auditorium to hear the outgoing Jamaican offer light and serious comments for nearly an hour.         
	Bolt, who turns 24 in August, said he might even try a new event like the long jump or 400 metres for his final act.         
	If you continue to break records, then you are pretty much going to get bored after a while, he said. You cant really accomplish anything else. I want to be a legend in sports.         
	After the World Championships and the Olympics in London, I probably will try something else.         
	Both his coach Glen Mills and many fellow-Jamaicans have hoped for several years that Bolt would try the 400 but he has always resisted.         
	Bolt said his main goal at the moment was to stay undefeated since there were no World Championships or Olympics this year.         
	He is currently recovering from a strained Achilles tendon and will run a 100 metres at the Lausanne Diamond League meeting on Thursday, stepping down from a previously announced 200.         
	The doctor does not want him to risk running the turn, manager Ricky Simms said via email.           (REUTERS)

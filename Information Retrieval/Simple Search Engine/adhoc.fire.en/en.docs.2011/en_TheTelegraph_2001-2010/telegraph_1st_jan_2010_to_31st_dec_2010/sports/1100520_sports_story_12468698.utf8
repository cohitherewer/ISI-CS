The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Official   poet for   Big W
                                                                                                                       7                                      Official   poet for   Big W
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                  
	Wimbledon has its first official poet after the Championships organisers decided to immortalise on and off court events in rhyme. Matt Harvey will deliver a poem each day throughout the fortnight of tennis tournament which takes place next month.         
	Harvey, a regular on the radio and a lifelong fan of the game, will be capturing a flavour of the event with verses to be published online and in special podcasts.         
	Harvey  who has already written his first poem as Championships Poet 2010, called Grandest of Slams  said he was thrilled but nervous at his appointment.         
	Quite simply Im delighted, with a little bit of healthy anxiety thrown in... Its an honour, and Im acutely conscious its the only time Ill come first in anything at Wimbledon, unless you count the queue for strawberries.         
	The new role was created as a result of Wimbledon teaming up with The Poetry Trust.         
	Harveys role will see him writing about anything from racket stringers to strawberries and cream, as well as the rain and other unfolding dramas on the grass courts.         
	His poems will feature on the trusts website and the official Wimbledon site.         
	Harvey will keep a blog, talk to fans via Twitter and perform his poems to the queues waiting to enter the grounds.         
	Honor Godfrey, curator of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum which proposed the concept, said: We are always examining different ways of interpreting the Championships and this year the club agreed that having an official Championships Poet would provide a novel and interesting way of doing this.         
	Naomi Jaffa, director of The Poetry Trust, said: We couldnt be more thrilled and excited  for Matt, whos a poet were so proud to champion, and for the tennis-loving millions around the world wholl be surprised and delighted, we hope, by some truly ace poems.

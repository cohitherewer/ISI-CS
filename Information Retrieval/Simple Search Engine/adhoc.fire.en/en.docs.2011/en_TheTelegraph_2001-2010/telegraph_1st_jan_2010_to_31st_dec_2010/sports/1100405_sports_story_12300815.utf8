            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians juggernaut continued its relentless roll with their second defeat of defending champions Deccan Chargers in five days, a 63-run hammering at the Brabourne Stadium Saturday.         
	Man of the match Ambati Rayudu struck his second half-century of the tournament, an unbeaten 55, while Saurabh Tiwary struck a hurricane 44 to help Mumbai post a challenging 178 for five.         
	The hosts then followed it up with a solid bowling and fielding to skittle out the visitors for 115 with nine balls to spare. The defeat must have had a sense of dj vu for Adam Gilchrists team who failed to chase a similar target, 173 to be precise, in their home tie at DY Patil Stadium last Sunday.         
	For the hosts, the win would reinforce their belief that they are not a one-man army as captain Sachin Tendulkars contribution was a less impacting 35.         
	With 14 points to their tally, and just one loss from eight games so far, Mumbai have more or less secured their semi-final berth, as there is only a mathematical chance of them not making it to the knockout stage.         
	The Chargers, however, are now staring down the barrel following their fourth consecutive loss which has left them with just six points from eight games.         
	Tiwary, who had two reprieves, and Rayudu lifted the Mumbai Indians innings from 62 for 3 after the top-order failed yet again.         
	Tiwary began with a loft to long on where Herschelle Gibbs spilled it over the boundary rope off leg spinner Rahul Sharma. Sharma, who had trapped Sachin Tendulkar (35) leg before earlier, had insult added to injury when Tiwary swept him over to midwicket for another six.         
	But more misfortune was to follow for Sharma when off the next balls Monish Mishra dropped a sitter from Tiwary. The batsman was on 17 and 29 on those two occasions.         
	Tiwary ultimately fell to Pragyan Ojha, but not before hoisting the bowler for his third six of the innings. And his partnership with Rayudu fetched 65 runs.         
	Rayudu, having already whacked Andrew Symonds over midwicket, was well set to take over the baton. The right-hander raced to his fifty with two fours and a six off Jaskaran Singh before his pull was grassed by Rohit Sharma in the deep.

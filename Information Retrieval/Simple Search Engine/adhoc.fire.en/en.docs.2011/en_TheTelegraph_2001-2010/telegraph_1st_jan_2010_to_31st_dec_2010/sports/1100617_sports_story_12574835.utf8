	Dambulla: The ICC Wednesday cleared Mohammed Aamer of allegations that he used a mobile phone in the dressing room during Pakistans opening match.         
	The ICC said its anti-corruption and security officer had investigated the matter and seen video footage of the incident. There is no evidence of Aamer making use of a mobile phone while sitting in the dressing room during the match against Sri Lanka in Dambulla, the ICC statement said. ...Upon closer scrutiny the fact emerges that he was actually holding on to the front grill of his helmet, adjusting it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I-League is likely from November
                                                                                                                       7                                      I-League is likely from November
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The fourth edition of the I-League is likely to be delayed by a couple of months and will only kick off in the third week of November. A final decision in this regard will be taken in the I-League committee meeting here on Wednesday.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the league, which was supposed to start in September, had to be deferred mainly because of non-availability of venues, Indias international commitments and the Commonwealth Games in October.         
	Sources also said that the number of teams is unlikely to increase, thus dismissing any chance of the two relegated teams  Sporting Clube de Goa and Lajong FC  being taken back into the I-League fold to make it a 16-team competition.         
	The league will be restricted to 14 teams for the 2010-11 season, he said. While two promoted teams, ONGC and HAL, will occupy the two new spots, the vacant position of Mahindra United will go to AIFF XI.         
	Delhi has been chosen as the home ground for the newly formed AIFF XI, coached by Desmond Bulpin.         
	Despite pressure from all quarters, including the national coach Bob Houghton, the federation is wary of adding two more teams this season as it will not only add 58 more matches to the schedule but will also increase the league expenses by more than Rs 2 crore.         
	The league could face too many interruptions if it starts in September, said an AIFF official.

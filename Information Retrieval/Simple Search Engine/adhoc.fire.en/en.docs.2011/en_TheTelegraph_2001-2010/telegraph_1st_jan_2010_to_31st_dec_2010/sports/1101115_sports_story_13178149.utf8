The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan hurt us,   says Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                      Harbhajan hurt us,   says Taylor
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Hyderabad: To be thrashed by a top-order batsman is one thing, but to be toyed with by a tail-ender can frustrate any team. Harbhajan Singh continued his profilic form with the bat from Ahmedabad and remained unbeaten on 85 at stumps on Sunday. Ross Taylor acknowledged New Zealands plight and summed up the mood in the camp as that of disappointment.         
	Reflecting on the days play, Taylor said: It was one of those days where youll take the first five hours... The last hour was just disappointing. Youve got to give it to Harbhajan, who once again batted very well. He was well supported by Sreesanth. It would have been a very good day if we were only 20 or 30 behind and had a bit of a bat tonight. Hopefully, we can come out, get the early wicket tomorrow (Sunday), and bat the rest of the day.         
	Elaborating on Harbhajans destructive display, the New Zealand batsman said: With the short boundary straight, Harbhajan just hurt us. What would have been pretty good balls to most batsmen, he was hitting for six. Hes taken two fifties and a hundred off us, and our plans will have to be revised.         
	One of the plans was to bowl short, but the short ball seemed to go a long way today. He has obviously improved his batting. After three innings, no one would have believed that hed have nearly as many runs as Sehwag, he added.

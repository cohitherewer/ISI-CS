The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harendra should take charge, say selectors
                                                                                                                       7                                        Harendra should take charge, say selectors
                  Jose Brasa                     
	New Delhi: Questioning Jose Brasas credentials as a top hockey coach and accusing him of fanning groupism in the team, four national selectors have recommended the sports ministry to immediately discontinue his services as the coach of the national team.         
	In a letter to SAI joint secretary Pravir Krishan, Ajitpal Singh, Balbir Singh, BP Govinda and Zafar Iqbal said that the reins of the national team be handed to Harendra Singh, who resigned as national coach in the wake of Indias semi-final loss to Malaysia in the Asian Games.         
	Brasas contract as the chief coach expired, on Monday, and he is leaving the country, knowing fully well that his services will not be continued.         
	We seriously doubt his ability as a top notch coach and feel that he cannot impart with more meaningful inputs to the team in terms of critical planning and strategy. He, however, can be useful for development at grassroot level particularly in the basic fundamentals, the four selectors said in a signed letter.         
	Brasa only possesses blackboard knowledge. The coach must be in a position to demonstrate practically on the filed of play and show and guide the players to correct their mistakes besides teaching them new and modern tactics, they said in the letter, a copy of which was made available to the media.         
	The cross section of the senior players have told us that Brasa has nothing much to offer now as he has exhausted his technical knowledge.         
	So, we strongly recommend that the services of Brasa be discontinued immediately in the best interest of Indian hockey and the responsibility of the team be handed over to Harendra Singh with the existing coaching and support staff, they said.         
	The selectors also felt that Brasa fanned groupism in the team. ... He has created bad blood within the team which has led to disharmony amongst the players which resulted in poor performances, they added in the letter.         
	Brasa, meanwhile, said that the current Indian hockey team has the potential to win a medal in the 2012 London Olympics but for it to happen, the training system needs to undergo a change.         
	Forget about the qualifiers, this team is capable of winning a medal in the Olympics. However, only if they are trained properly with a scientific method, having adequate support staff, a sports psychologist, proper programmes and modern equipment. None of these are available now, Brasa said before leaving for Spain. (PTI)

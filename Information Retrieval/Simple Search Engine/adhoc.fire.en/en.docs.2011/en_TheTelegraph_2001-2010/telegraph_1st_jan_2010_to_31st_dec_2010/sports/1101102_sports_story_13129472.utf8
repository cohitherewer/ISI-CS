The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hyderabad hit   an all-time low
                                                                                                                       7                                        Hyderabad hit   an all-time low
  - Youngster Chahar claims eight wickets on debut as Hyderabad fall for 21             Rajasthans Deepak Chahar, who picked up eight Hyderabad wickets, during a press conference, in Jaipur, on Monday                                 
	Jaipur: Debutant Deepak Chahar, Rajasthans 18-year-old medium-pacer, was the wrecker-in-chief with a devastating spell fast bowling which earned him eight wickets. His bowling figures were stunning  7.3-2-10-8.         
	From 7 for one, it became 12 for five in a gap of 23 balls as Chahar and his senior new-ball partner Pankaj Singh wreaked havoc.         
	Pankaj claimed the other two Hyderabad wickets.         
	At the close of the first days play, Rajasthan were 220 for two with Hrishikesh Kanitkar unbeaten on 100. The previous Ranji record was set in the first season (1934-35), when South Punjab were bowled out for 22 chasing 114, against North India, in Amritsar.         
	Chahars figures fell just short of the record effort on debut. Maharashtras Vasant Ranjane took nine for 56 on first-class debut in 1956-57, bowling Saurashtra out for 83, in Khadakvasla.         
	None of the Hyderabad batsmen got to double figures and Akshath Reddys 6 was the highest individual score. No extras were conceded by Rajasthan and Hyderabads innings lasted a mere 15.3 overs.         
	Three of Hyderabad batsmen recorded ducks and the longest stay was that of skipper D Ravi Teja, who faced 22 balls for his one run.         
	Hyderabads score also equalled the record for the lowest total in all first-class cricket in India. During the Bombay Quadrangular in 1915-16, the Europeans bundled out Muslims for 21.         
	In another Plate group tie, in Agartala, Jharkhand were 233 for seven, against Tripura, at stumps on Day I.         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Agartala: Jharkhand 233/7 (S. Gautam 38n..) vs Tripura.         
	 In Delhi: Kerala 212/3 (P. Prem 98n..) vs Services.

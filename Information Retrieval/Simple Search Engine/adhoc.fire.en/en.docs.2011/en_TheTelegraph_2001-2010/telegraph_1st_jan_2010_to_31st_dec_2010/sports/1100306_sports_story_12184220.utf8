            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Air India paid the penalty, literally, for a sloppy performance as they were held to a 1-1 draw by bottom-placed Sporting Clube de Goa in the I-League here on Friday.         
	Peter Odafe was the culprit with his handling of the ball resulting in a penalty in the dying minutes of the first half. Nicholas Rodrigues scored from the spot to level the scores for the visitors.         
	Allan Dais had put the hosts in front in the 34th minute when he latched on to a pass from ND Opara following a throw-in by Uttam Singh.         
	The second half turned out to be a dull, at times irritating, affair as both teams indulged in purposeless passing and consequently there was no attempt at goal. Air India now have 15 points and the Goan unit six.

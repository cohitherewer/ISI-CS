The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bradman is best, Sachin second: Steve Waugh
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bradman is best, Sachin second: Steve Waugh
                  Steve Waugh                     
	Abu Dhabi: Sachin Tendulkar can come only second, after the legendary Sir Donald Bradman in the list of all-time great cricketers, according to former Australia captain Steve Waugh.         
	Don Bradman is the greatest, there is no debate. Don is the No. 1 and then come the rest. And among the rest, Tendulkar probably is as good as anyone. So legitimately, he may be the second best cricketer to have played the game, Waugh said.         
	But then people will say the same for Gary Sobers and WG Grace. So its difficult to say, added Waugh, who is here as a member of the Laureus Sports Academy. Waugh also said it is dangerous that Test cricket doesnt have quality fast bowlers anymore as many prefer the 20-over format over the games five-day version these days.         
	It is dangerous for Test cricket that we are losing the quicks. It is the Twenty20 influence. Fast bowlers definitely have a lot of stress and doing this is very demanding. I think they realise that they have few years of cricket in them.         
	They get three times more money by bowling one-tenth overs in Twetny20. So we had (Andrew) Flintoff, Brett (Lee) and (Shane) Bond deciding not to play Tests, which is a shame, he said.         
	Two-time World Cup winning captain Waugh said India and Australia will start as favourites in the ODI World Cup next year, which will be held in Indian sub-continent. Australia have a very good record. Indias also very hard to defeat in India. So they will be the favourites.         
	Asked whether Mahendra Singh Dhonis men were capable of retaining their No. 1 Test team tag for long, Waugh said: I dont think anyone will hold the spot for long because we have three formats of the game. With niggling injuries and so many tours, it is very difficult to be consistent.

	Colombo: John Buchanan and Dav Whatmore, who have Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) links, will both be in the Sri Lanka capital next week.         
	While Whatmore has already been around for some days, with the KKRs development squad, Buchanan arrives on Monday for a four-day visit.         
	As of now, there are no plans for them to meet, but their paths may just cross here. That, to say the least, would be interesting.         
	Buchanan coached KKR in the first two seasons of the Indian Premier League and was then shown the door. Whatmore succeeded him late last year, but season No.3, too, was pretty much a disaster.                   John Buchanan       
	I have engagements with top corporates and will also be speaking to the local coaches... Im looking forward to the trip, Buchanan told The Telegraph, from Brisbane.         
	Of late, Buchanan has been busy planning the inaugural Coolum Invitational 6s, to be staged in Queensland, between November 19-21 this year.         
	Open to the corporate world, the tournament will feature 16 teams. While there could be one outfit from the UK, the rest are going to be from Australia.

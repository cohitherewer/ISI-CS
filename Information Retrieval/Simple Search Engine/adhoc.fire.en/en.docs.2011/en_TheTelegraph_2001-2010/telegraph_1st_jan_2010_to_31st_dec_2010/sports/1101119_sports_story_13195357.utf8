The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Water mark for Chinas Sun Yang
                                                                                                                       7                                      Water mark for Chinas Sun Yang
                      
	Guangzhou: Chinas Sun Yang impressed with an electrifying swim in the mens 1500m that was less than a second shy of the world record.         
	Sun created an Asian Games record and covered his face with his hand to hide his emotion, when he saw his time flash up on the scoreboard. I havent thought about breaking the world record, he said.         
	His achievement glossed over a dramatic disqualification for Chinas 4X100m medley relay team, who pipped Japans swimmers but had their gold medals stripped after it emerged that one swimmer Wang Shuai had taken off early.         
	The medley teams anguish should do little to dampen Chinas joy at their bumper 24-gold medal haul at the pool, where their claim to top status was never contested by a disappointing campaign by Japan.         
	South Korea stood second in the overall medals tally with 37 gold, while Japan was at the third spot with a total of 21 gold medals.         
	Chinese star hurdler Liu Xiang arrived in time to see China collects their 100th gold medal in Guangzhou  on only the sixth day of competition.           (AGENCIES)

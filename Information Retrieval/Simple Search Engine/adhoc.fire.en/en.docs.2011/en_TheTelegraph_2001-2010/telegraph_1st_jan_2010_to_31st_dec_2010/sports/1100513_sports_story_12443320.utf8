	London: There are going to be quite a few high profile absentees from the June 11-July 11 World Cup in South Africa after the coaches of the participating teams met a Fifa deadline on Tuesday to announce their preliminary squads.         
	Missing from provisional squads were such names as Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema from the French squad and Inter Milan players Esteban Cambiasso and Javier Zanetti who did not find a place in Argentina coach Diego Maradonas scheme of things.         
	Brazils Ronaldinho, absent from the initial 23-member squad, was later picked by Dunga in the full 30-member side.         
	Benzema was a surprise omission from Frances provisional squad and coach Raymond Domenech said it was because of his form on the field rather than allegations of his involvement in an under-age sex scandal with an escort.         
	Arsenals in-form midfielder Samir Nasri, too, was absent in a squad that features five uncapped players.         
	To me this is not a concern, said Domenech, who also left out veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira but selected off-form striker Thierry Henry. Im only thinking about football and about what the players want to give on the pitch.         
	World Player of the Year Lionel Messi will lead Argentinas attack at the World Cup, but there was no room for Champions League finalists, Inter Milans Cambiasso and Zanetti in coach Maradonas provisional list.         
	The 30-man Argentina squad included four high-profile forwards to support Barcelonas Messi  Gonzalo Higuain, Diego Milito, Martin Palermo and Carlos Tevez.         
	US coach Bob Bradley had no surprises in his squad but could not find a place for Charlie Davies, who has made good recovery from a car smash but has been sidelined for seven months.Brazil coach Dunga announced his main 23-man squad first, causing a fuss when Ronaldinho missed out. Dunga later unveiled a full 30-man provisional squad that included Ronaldinho, but made it clear that the AC Milan star would only be used in case of injuries.         
	Dunga has stuck to most of the players who helped Brazil win last years Confederations Cup and finish top of South American qualifying.         
	Ronaldinhos quality and capacity as a player is indisputable, Dunga said. But my decision has to be made based on reason. I have to make a decision based on what happens on the field.         
	Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa steered clear of surprises by selecting most of the players who featured in qualifying.         
	Goalkeeper Luis Marin, of Chilean club Union Espanola, was the most unexpected name, picked after being overlooked by Bielsa during qualifying.         
	Serbia published their official 30-man provisional squad on Wednesday. Serbia coach Radomir Antic had kept the list secret before sending it to Fifa for Tuesdays deadline.         
	The 30-man squad includes familiar players such as Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United, Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea and Dejan Stankovic of Inter Milan.           (AGENCIES)

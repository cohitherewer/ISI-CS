            OUR BUREAU            Dinesh Karthik                                 
	India opener Dinesh Karthik was injured while batting during a net session, in Dambulla, on Saturday. However, India manager Ranjib Biswal told The Telegraph that there is nothing to worry and that the right-handed batsman will be available for Indias crucial tri-series match, against Sri Lanka, on Monday.         
	Karthik, who has been opening the Indian innings with Virender Sehwag in the absence of Gautam Gambhir, was hit on his right hand, which resulted in a swollen finger.         
	Biswal also dismissed reports which said that India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was miffed with the uneven bounce of the practice pitch at the Rangiri Dambulla stadium.         
	According to Biswal, Dhoni himself had an extensive session at the nets where he batted against both the pacers and the spinners. The manager specifically said that there was no question of the captain being upset with the track.         
	However, agency reports quoted Biswal as saying that the players did have some problems while tackling the good-length bouncing deliveries and that the pitch was not ideal for practice.         
	Facilities for practice at the stadium are good, but the pitch is not ideal for practising We had some problems with the pitch, Biswal was quoted as saying.         
	He also informed that barring left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra, all the other players attended the practice session.         
	India had lost the series-opener by a massive 200-run margin against New Zealand.         
	The defeat also cost Dhoni amp; Co. the No. 2 spot in the ICC ODI team rankings. But with the Black Caps faltering in their second match, losing to the Lankans by three wickets, Team India reclaimed the second place on Friday.         
	Meanwhile, Sehwag and Suresh Raina, who had returned home for a couple of days, were scheduled to reach Colombo late on Saturday night. The duo will then take the three-hour drive to Dambulla.

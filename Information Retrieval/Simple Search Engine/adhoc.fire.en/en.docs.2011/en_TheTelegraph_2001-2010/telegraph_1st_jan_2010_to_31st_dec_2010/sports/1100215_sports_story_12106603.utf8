                                                                                                                       7                                      Trouble in Indian camp
                      
	Vancouver: Trouble is brewing in the Indian camp in Winter Olympics here with majority of the contingent denying luger Shiva Keshavans claim that the team didnt have co-ordinated uniform for the opening ceremony and rejecting the money raised by the Indian diaspora.         
	Keshavan has alleged that the contingent did not have co-ordinated uniform, prompting the local Indian community to raise $8000 as fund for uniforms for the Indian athletes.         
	Chef-de-mission RK Gupta, however, dismissed the allegation and rejected the money, insisting that the team had uniforms provided by the ministry.         
	Shiva thinks he is greater than India and is maligning the image of the country. We had proper attires worth Rs 29,000 each provided by the IOA and the ministry, Gupta said.           (PTI)

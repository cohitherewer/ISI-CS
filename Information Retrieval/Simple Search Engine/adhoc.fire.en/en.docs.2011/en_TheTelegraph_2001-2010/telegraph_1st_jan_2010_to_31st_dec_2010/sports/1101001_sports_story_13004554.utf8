The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More the merrier for the Indians
                                                                                                                       7                                      More the merrier for the Indians
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In a surprise move, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has decided to field a bigger contingent in the Commonwealth Games and has asked at least two national federations to select more athletes at the last moment.         
	According to IOA sources, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) and the Swimming Federation of India (SFI) have already included a host of fresh faces in their respective teams.         
	India have never won a swimming medal in the Commonwealth Games history, but will be fielding the second biggest squad after Australia, which generally win the majority of the swimming medals.         
	Initially, 27 swimmers were selected for the CWG but now 26 more have been added to the squad, said an SFI official. The IOA wanted us to field a bigger team to allow the swimmers get more exposure.         
	Chef de mission of the Indian contingent Bhubaneswar Kalita also defended the decision saying participating in the Games is more important than winning medals. We also feel that some of our swimmers might end up winning medals, he added.         
	Similarly, the AFI has also decided to field a bigger squad for the CWG. It has now 110 athletes and 49 coaches. They have included 16 new athletes and equal number of coaches in the team, said a source.         
	While the new policy has given athletes like discus thrower Anil Kumar, shot putter Navpreet Singh, hurdlers Anuradha and Kuldev Singh and several others a new lease of life, the inclusion of dope-tainted shot putter Saurabh Vij has raised a few eyebrows.         
	Vij, who tested positive, was earlier suspended by National Anti Doping Agency (Nada), but the suspension was later provisionally lifted by the disciplinary panel.         
	The shot putter now has been taken back in the squad despite the fact he has not gone through proper training in the last two weeks.         
	Meanwhile, Australian discus thrower Scott Martin and sprint hurdler Hayley Butler have pulled out because of injury, a team spokesperson said on Thursday.         
	It is very unfortunate and has nothing to do with security concerns. Both pulled out due to injuries, Michelle Cook told reporters.         
	Scott had an injury to his pectoral muscle, while Hayley suffered a calf muscle injury.         
	Neither athlete travelled with the team that touched down here on Wednesday. Martin won the discus gold at the 2006 Games in Melbourne, where he also clinched a bronze medal in the shot put.         
	A number of Australians have skipped the event for various reasons and the list includes cyclist Travis Meyer, table tennis player Stephanie Sang, swimmer Stephanie Rice, tennis player Samantha Stosur and discus world champion Dani Samuels.

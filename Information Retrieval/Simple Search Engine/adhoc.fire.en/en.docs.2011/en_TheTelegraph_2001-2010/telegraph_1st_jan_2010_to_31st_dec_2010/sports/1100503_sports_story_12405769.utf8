The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | RCA turns heat on Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                        RCA turns heat on Modi
  - State body wants BCCI to implement bombay high court observations         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Lalit Modi                                 
	Calcutta: With Lalit Kumar Modi totally cornered, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), a body he once headed, has made things hotter for him.         
	According to a well-placed source, RCA secretary Sanjay Dixit has requested the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to implement the observations of the Bombay High Court on the framing of rules to disallow those having any connection with drugs from becoming administrators.         
	The RCA wanted a discussion at Sundays working committee meeting, in Mumbai, but hadnt followed procedures. It will, therefore, have to be deliberated upon at a later date.         
	Union minister C.P. Joshi heads the RCA and, while it doesnt have a place on the BCCIs working committee, there are enough out to tear into Modi. So, too much lobbying wont be needed.         
	Clearly, the RCA has Modis plea arrangement in the US, in the mid-1980s, after hed pleaded guilty to the unlawful possession of cocaine, in mind.         
	First reported in The Telegraph, on June 3, 2005, the case also involved the holding captive and assaulting of one Alexander van Dyne.         
	Thanks to the plea bargain, Modi got a reduced sentence of two years, which was to be executed through five years of supervised probation.         
	Modi, currently suspended from all posts in the BCCI, including those of the Indian Premier League chairman and a vice-president, didnt stay that long in the US, though.         
	Its to be seen what else is raked up by the RCA, which is run by men who dont want Modi to regain even an inch in the body he once lorded over.

	 Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team director Joy Bhattacharjya will be helping Football Players Association of India (FPAI) to rope in corporate sponsorship. On Thursday, India captain Bhaichung Bhutia and FPAI CEO Sumit Mukherjee met Bhattacharjya to discuss about the organisation. I believe in FPAIs endeavour to look after the players cause. I have full knowledge about the effort that Bhaichung has put in for this organisation. I will be glad to help FPAI in getting a firm foothold, Bhattacharjya said.

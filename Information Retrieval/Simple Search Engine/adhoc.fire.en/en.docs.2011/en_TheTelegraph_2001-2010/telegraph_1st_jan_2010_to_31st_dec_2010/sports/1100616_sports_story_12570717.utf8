The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi: We aim to go all the way
                                                                                                                       7                                      Messi: We aim to go all the way
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Pretoria: The University of Pretorias High Performance Centre (HPC) is South Africas first elite performance sports facility. Launched in 2002, the centre is considered the training ground for future champions.         
	Normally a quiet place, the HPC has become the centre of attention of the world media and the soccer fans since the start of the World Cup. There is round the clock security vigil at the Centre as Argentina have made it their World Cup base.         
	On Tuesday morning, there was a big crowd around the Centre as Argentina were scheduled to practice at the training ground. A group of Argentine fans, who have travelled all the way from Latin America, were standing at the gate with huge posters of Lionel Messi in their hands.         
	We are all Messi fans, said a female member of the group in broken English. Messi will win the World Cup for us this time. His performance will be even better than what he does for Barcelona, she said with a great deal of confidence as all her other friends nodded in agreement.         
	Moments later, there were mad scrambles as the Argentine team arrived for training. Messi and Juan Sebastian Veron, however, did not practice as they are nursing minor injuries. Both are expected to be fit for the next match against South Korea Thursday.         
	Messi has been criticised in recent past for failing to perform at his best while playing for Argentina but he has silenced his critics after a masterful performance against Nigeria.         
	I have never played better football for Argentina and it was my best match for the country. It was the happiest moment in my life. Hopefully we will be able to go a long way in this tournament, Messi said.         
	Messi assured his Argentine fans that he would do his best for the national team. Ever since we arrived here, my mentality has changed. I went through difficult times with the national team when things didnt come out the way I wanted to. But you should remember, the national team does not depend on me. We have several good players and all of them would come together to make the Argentina world champions again, he said.         
	The presence of Maradona, according to Messi, is having a positive effect on the team. He is just another of the group. He gets closer to the players. He himself was a player and knows what happens to us. He gives us a lot of confidence, said the superstar.         
	There is no team in the world that can beat Argentina, declared Messi. Argentina should only be afraid of Argentina. I say this with maximum respect to all the other teams but we have the quality and talent. We must remain together and do what we have been doing. If we stay united, there is no way we can be beaten in this World Cup.         
	Everything has changed from the qualifiers. The approach has changed completely and so is the behaviour of the players. During the qualifiers, we failed to play as a group and were heavily criticised. Now we are highly motivated and playing as a well-combined team.         
	We are a different Argentina now, warned Messi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All Whites rev up for race
                                                                                                                       7                                        All Whites rev up for race

	Rustenburg: New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert leads his team into their opening Group F match against Slovakia on Tuesday hoping to spring a surprise and erase painful memories of the 1982 tournament in Spain.         
	As a 21-year-old defender in New Zealands only previous World Cup appearance, he burst into tears on the bus en route to their opener when he was left out of the side to face Scotland.         
	They lost that match 5-2 and were also thrashed by the Soviet Union and Brazil but Herbert will never forget sitting on the bench for his countrys first ever World Cup match.         
	It was the biggest disappointment of his playing career and a spur to him and his All Whites players to belie a world ranking of 78 by upsetting 38th-ranked Slovakia.         
	I understand why we are the underdogs but we dont fear anyone, he said. Anything can happen in a cup competition. If Senegal can beat France (in 2002), we can beat Italy!         
	Herberts confidence may be one of New Zealands best weapons as he tries to inspire a team, well beaten three times in South Africa during the 2009 Confederations Cup, to rise to their biggest soccer challenge in three decades.         
	Their mixed form in warm-up games  beating Serbia and then losing to Chile  has given little indication of what to expect against an equally unsung Slovakia, making their first appearance in the finals as an independent nation.         
	The Slovaks proved their potential when they beat Czech Republic 2-1 away in the qualifiers and in Stanislav Sestak, who scored in both games against their local rivals, have a striker who gives a cutting edge to their 3-4-3 or 5-2-3 system.         
	Slovakia coach Vladimir Weiss shares Herberts rare distinction of playing and coaching at the World Cup, having appeared in midfield for the Czechoslovakia team that reached the quarter finals in Italy in 1990.         
	He is also, like Herbert, hoping his team can be one of the surprise packages of the tournament. Weiss and his men recognise Tuesdays clash will be key to their confidence.

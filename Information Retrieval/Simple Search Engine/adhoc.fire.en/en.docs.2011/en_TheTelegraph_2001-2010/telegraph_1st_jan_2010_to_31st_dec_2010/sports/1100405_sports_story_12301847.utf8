	Mumbai: Air India will look to avenge the first leg loss and consolidate their position on the points table when they take on to Viva Kerala in a 20th round I-League match, at the Cooperage on Monday.         
	In the 12th round, Viva had beaten the airmen 2-1.         
	However, the task on Monday will be anything but easy for the hosts as Viva have gone from strength to strength after a rather ordinary start which saw them languishing in the relegation zone for quite a while.         
	In their last five matches, Viva have registered victories against title contenders Dempo (1-0), Sporting Club De Goa (2-1) and split points against top teams like Chirag United (1-1), Churchill Brothers (1-1) and Mahindra United (1-1).

	Durban: An upbeat South Africa captain Graeme Smith has already started playing mind games before they take on India, in the second Test, which starts here on Boxing Day.         
	I still believe that we could have handled that situation better. I would like to insist that wicket was helping bowlers when we batted for first 40-odd overs, the South African captain stated in reference to Indias 136 all-out in the first innings, in Centurion.         
	Then the track flattened out on the second day, after tea But certainly we would have done better on that wicket, Smith took a dig at the much vaunted Indian batting line-up when asked how his team would have approached if put into bat.         
	I think that our scoring rate did the trick for us as that provided us with enough time to get India out twice, the Proteas skipper added.         
	Smith insisted that by inflicting a humiliating defeat on the opposition, his team would be riding high before they take on Mahendra Singh Dhonis men for the second time in the series.         
	Look, we have won the first Test (against India) by an innings and 25 runs. So, we have lot of positives to take from that match. We are certainly going to take that confidence with us in the second Test. On the other side, doubts will certainly creep into the Indian team. But we arent thinking too far ahead. We are focussing on the process and preparing well for this match, he said.         
	The southpaw, however, expects a fightback from Dhonis men in the second Test.         
	I expect much more fight from the Indian team. They have loads of experience They will come out fighting in this Test, especially in the batting department. Dont forget that this is a fight between the top two teams in Test cricket.         
	Smith is confident that his bowlers can sort out Virender Sehwag who showed glimpses of his devastating ability with the willow during the second innings at Centurion.         
	Thats the way Sehwag plays He backs his ability and if he gets going then he takes the game away from the opposition. But like in the first innings at Centurion, if we can knock Sehwag out early on, then things change for us.         
	If we can make early inroads, then we can test the Indian lower order with a relatively new ball. That is going to be a huge challenge for us to restrict Sehwag from giving a flying start to his team.         
	But Smith is aware that South Africas record at Kingsmead, of late, has been poor as they have lost the last two Tests they have played here.         
	Yes, we have lost the last two Test matches played here at Kingsmead. Honestly, we were not good enough in all five days while playing against England. We have spoken about it and will handle the situation better this time around, he answered.         
	About the Kingsmead wicket, Smith said: We expect the bounce and carry on the Kingsmead wicket. We all know that conditions have been wet over here, but now the sun is beating down So you can expect a good wicket which will also offer some turn.         
	About Hashim Amla who will be playing his 50th Test match, Smith said: Its going to be a big Test for Hashim. He is a very composed and disciplined guy. He has become a solid performer for us in all forms of the game. It is nice to see how he has grown in stature in international cricket.

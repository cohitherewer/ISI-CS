                                                                                                                       7                                        A problem of plenty is better than worrying about options
  - For now, Srikkanth is mighty pleased
            A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: Former captain and opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who is in his third year as Indias chief selector, spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday, the day after New Zealand were thrashed 5-0 in the ODIs.         
	Mighty pleased Srikkanth was, but he acknowledged that a much tougher test is just days away, in South Africa.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Pleasantly surprised by the scoreline...         
	A Well, yes... But once it became 4-0 (in Bangalore), I knew it would be a total sweep... Its a good result for Indian cricket and the healthy competition for places has gone a step further... The real winner, in the larger context, is Indian cricket. As chairman of the selection committee, I can only be happy.         
	Has it also, in a way, made it difficult for you and your colleagues to pick the World Cup XV?         
	(Laughs) Its always good to have a good problem... A problem of plenty is better than worrying about options. The just-ended series was an opportunity for some to showcase their skills and they made full use... A few were making a comeback, some were trying to establish themselves. Then, there were those who had a reputation to live up to.         
	Rotating players, one assumes, is a big ask...         
	Look, all teams go through a phase when rotation becomes necessary... Sometimes its because of injuries... The balance, though, has to be right.         
	How did you find Gautam Gambhir, the stand-in captain?         
	On the eve of the series Id told you that Gautam is very sincere and knowledgeable... That hes smart in the manner of present-day cricketers... All that came through in the series... He led from the front, motivated the younger lot and got the best out of the seniors. What I liked most was the way he encouraged the younger players. Id give Gautam high marks.         
	Would you pick Yusuf Pathans strong comeback as the biggest gain for India?         
	I wouldnt like to single out any one player... Where Im concerned, Indian cricket has gained.         
	Delighted with Yuvraj Singhs attitude and form...         
	Yuvraj showed a good level of fitness... He also bowled well... Clearly, his confidence is back and, in cricket, confidence makes the difference.         
	For the No.2 keepers slot, its turning out to be Wriddhiman Saha versus Parthiv Patel. Your take?         
	Your question directly relates to selection... Ill only say theres healthy competition and such an environment makes for better performances.         
	Today, what are your thoughts on the big test ahead, in South Africa?         
	Its going to be a different ball game from what weve witnessed in recent weeks... The challenge for us is to prove that were actually the No.1 in all conditions. Of course, its not going to be easy, but Im hopeful... Im confident...         
	Do you believe that the tougher the competition one faces the better the preparation, or is there the risk of confidence being dented in the lead-up to the World Cup?         
	In my view, the tougher it is, the better... Back in 1983, we went to the West Indies before the World Cup and our confidence soared when we beat them in the Berbice ODI... The West Indies, then, were unbeatable... As it turned out, we beat them in the World Cup final, too.         
	Talking of 1983, how often do you reflect on that canvas-changing win under Kapil Dev?         
	Once in a while, yes... Remains a dream come true, thats for sure.         
	How should the big guns handle pressure between now and February 19, when the showpiece tournament starts?         
	(Laughs) Theyre all very experienced and sensible... They dont need advice.         
	The final one: As the chief selector, whats your biggest challenge?         
	I dont see this job as one big challenge or something... My colleagues and I look to pick the best team and, after that, the players have to deliver. Theres no complication involved.

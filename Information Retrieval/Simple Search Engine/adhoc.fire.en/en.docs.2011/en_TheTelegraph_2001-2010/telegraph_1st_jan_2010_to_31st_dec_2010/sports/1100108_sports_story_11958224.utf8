                                                                                                                       7                                        Becks shines on San Siro return
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Beckham                           
	David Beckham believes he can help AC Milan win this seasons Serie A title after making a successful San Siro return in the 5-2 victory over Genoa.         
	In front of watching England manager Fabio Capello, Beckham was one of Milans more impressive performers in a victory which keeps Leonardos side eight points behind leaders Inter with a game in hand.         
	I think after the first half of the season, weve done well, said Beckham. We are in a great position and we need to continue because Inter are a great team, they are going to keep winning games and they are the team to catch.         
	Beckham insisted he was unaware of Capellos presence, but was happy to have been given the chance to impress as he seeks to cement his place in Englands World Cup squad.         
	I didnt know he (Capello) was there, I only found out afterwards, said the 34-year-old. But he loves football and hell go to every game possible. I know he visits all of the Premier League games and, obviously being in Italy over the Christmas period, he was able to come to this game. I think its always important that I work hard and perform well and I felt that I did that but its just one game.         
	I didnt expect to start, but obviously with the injuries we got during the week, I had to, Beckham added. I was happy. I was happy with the game and happy with the win and its just great to be back. It felt great.         
	Milan now face third-placed Juventus at the weekend, and would do so with confidence after a win sealed by a brace from Marco Borriello and goals from Ronaldinho, Thiago Silva and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.         
	But you know Juventus is a huge game, not just for us but for them as well, said Beckham. Its going to be a tough one but you always enjoy playing in those games.         
	The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player was hailed by coach Leonardo for his constant willingness to help the team.         
	Injuries to Alexandre Pato and Clarence Seedorf meant second-placed Milan had to start on-loan Beckham further forward than usual on the right of a front three.         
	He had a week where we tried him in every role (in training), Leonardo told a television sports channel.         
	I think that is the synthesis of what he is all about. He has an absolute willingness to help, extraordinary quality and tactical intelligence.         
	The Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder is on-loan at Milan for a second five-month loan spell in a bid to clinch a place in Englands World Cup place during the US close season.         
	He produced some superb crosses, went close with a drive and worked hard defensively.         
	The 34-year-old even turned down Ronaldinhos offer to take a penalty at 4-1 and the ball was given to Huntelaar, short of goals since his move from Real Madrid in August.         
	Beckham, just like last season, has been a great acquisition. He is a superb player and a superb person, Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani said.         
	He earns very little from us. He came to Milan for all different reasons than money.

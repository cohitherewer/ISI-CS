The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anelka thrown out of squad 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Anelka thrown out of squad 
    - Striker insulted coach RAYMOND domenech during the loss to Mexico           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH              Nicolas Anelka and Raymond Domenech                             
	Striker Nicolas Anelka has been dismissed from Frances World Cup squad for insulting coach Raymond Domenech during the defeat to Mexico. The decision (to remove Anelka) has just been taken, French football federation vice President Noel le Graet told a French radio station.         
	According to a French newspaper, Anelka unleashed a scathing attack on Domenech after being criticised during the interval as France sank to a dismal 0-2 defeat in Polokwane on Thursday.         
	Anelka allegedly told Domenech to go screw yourself, dirty son of a whore in the dressing room at the Peter Mokaba Stadium after the coach criticised his first-half performance. When Anelka took issue, Domenech threatened to substitute him, and the player unleashed his foul-mouthed tirade, the paper reported.         
	Domenechs response was immediate. Anelka was replaced with Andre-Pierre Gignac for the second half.         
	I have a lot of respect for France and for all my teammates, I insist on that, Anelka was quoted as saying. I wish to state that the words printed in the press were not my words, he added.         
	I did have a heated conversation with the coach in the secrecy of the locker room, between the coach and myself, in front of my teammates and the staff. It should never had come out of the locker room, he said.         
	Its shocking, because if anyone has protected Anelka, its Domenech, said Le Graet.         
	Domenech has played Anelka throughout the past two years. There are of course divergences of opinion surrounding tactics and positioning, but it merits in any case friendlier conversations.         
	The 31-year-old Anelka, who has scored 14 goals in 71 internationals, had faced heavy criticism from the French media for dismal displays in warm-up games and in the teams opening 0-0 draw with Uruguay.         
	By insulting Domenech, Anelka emulated former French enfant terrible Eric Cantona, who had called national team coach Henri Michel a scumbag in 1988 and did not play for France for months as a result.         
	Further reports suggesting that a disciplinary hearing has been convened by France Football Federation (FFF) officials on Saturday afternoon and that Anelka would be sent home from South Africa have proved to be well founded.         
	Mexico secured victory with two second-half goals, leaving France  winners in 1998 and beaten finalists four years ago  on the brink of elimination.         
	France require a convincing victory over South Africa next Tuesday to stand any chance of advancing to the second round.         
	However, this result would be rendered meaningless should Mexico and Uruguay draw in the other match  a result which would see both teams advance.         
	Anelkas outburst is the latest in a series of reported conflicts to come out of the France training camp during the World Cup and comes hot on the heels of captain Patrice Evras admission that his side are a football force in decline.         
	French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot reacted to the Anelka incident by urging the France players to show dignity.         
	The very high pressure weighing on Les Bleus does not authorise any form of slip-up, Bachelot said in a statement.         
	The players must keep in mind that theyre wearing Frances colours and are considered as role models by many youngsters. This obliges them to show restraint and dignity.         
	Former France striker Just Fontaine, who scored a record 13 goals at the 1958 World Cup, had asked for Anelka to be sanctioned straight away.         
	Whats happening to the France team is moronic, deplorable and pitiful, Fontaine said. Anelka must be kicked out.

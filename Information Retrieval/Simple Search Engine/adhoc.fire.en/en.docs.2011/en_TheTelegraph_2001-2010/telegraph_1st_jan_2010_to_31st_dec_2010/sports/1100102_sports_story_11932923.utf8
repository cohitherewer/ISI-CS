The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I do not get preferential treatment, says Broad
                                                                                                                       7                                      I do not get preferential treatment, says Broad
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/London: England all-rounder Stuart Broad has denied Sunil Gavaskars claim that he gets a preferential treatment since his father  Chris  is an International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee.         
	Gavaskar had recently written in his column that Stuart always gets away despite his bad behaviour since umpires do not want to spoil relations with his father Chris.         
	However, Broad junior says thats not the case.         
	I get treated like everyone else, Stuart said.         
	Broad had argued with umpires in the drawn first Test against hosts South Africa when he was declared out on a late review decision but was not questioned for his conduct.         
	However, Stuart denies crossing the line while discussing it with on-field officials.         
	I think a lot was made of the incident at Centurion. We were told that just a few seconds would be allowed for referrals and I thought 45 or 35 was quite a long time. But it was a very relaxed conversation with me just asking whether they were sure they didnt get a signal [from the dressing room].         
	There were no raised voices or swearwords or anything like that but I probably should have waited for the tea interval to have that little chat rather than out on the field where everyone could see it, he was quoted as saying by an English daily.         
	Gavaskar, though, felt otherwise. In his fortnightly column, the Indian legend wrote: Every time he has been called for overstepping or for a wide, especially in limited-overs cricket, he has stood with hands on his hips or looking skywards and generally conveying to the whole world what an injustice has been done to him.         
	Till now he has not even been reported or called before the Match Referee and has got away scot free for offences that would make others lose a substantial portion of their match fees.         
	The reason is simple. Stuarts father, Chris is one of ICCs Match Referees and so the umpires are reluctant to make a complaint against the youngster.         
	Remember, the umpires and Match Referees are used to hanging out together in the evenings since they are in a foreign country and so forge a good relationship and obviously the umpires are not looking to spoil that by citing the young Broad for a violation of the Code of Conduct.         
	The latest instance in South Africa, where Broad questioned the umpires when the South African asked for a referral to the third umpire, was exactly as he usually does  with hands on hips and looking for a confrontation         
	He knows he can get away with it and indeed he has... Broad has been quoted as saying he didnt think he had done anything wrong in questioning the umpires decision to refer the appeal to the third umpire since he thought that it hadnt come in the expected time but a bit later than is normally the case.         
	He has therein confirmed again that he thinks he is a special case and not on par with the rest of the cricketing world.         
	Stuart, though, admits that he needs to improve on his behaviour otherwise he could land in a soup in the near future.         
	I am sure that when the time comes  as Im sure it will unless I get unbelievably better  that I get in a little bit of trouble. But I am sure I will get treated the same as everybody else in the rest of the world.         
	They [the Match Referees] are all grown men. I think if I have done something wrong they will let me know about it. My youthful exuberance sometimes gets the better of me, but hopefully not to the extent of hitting my stumps down or anything like that, he said.         
	In the Bicentennial Test in Sydney in 1988, his father had used his bat to knock over the wickets.

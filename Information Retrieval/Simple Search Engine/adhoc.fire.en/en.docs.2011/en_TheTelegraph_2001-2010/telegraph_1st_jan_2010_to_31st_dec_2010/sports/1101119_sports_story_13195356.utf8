	Guangzhou: Two silver came Indias way from the rowing teams, on Thursday, even as key players from other disciplines failed to make a mark during the Asian Games.         
	Shooter Vijay Kumar clinched a bronze medal to bring some cheer to the medal-hungry contingent.         
	The silver medals were bagged by mens four and lightweight four teams. Anil Kumar, Saji Thomas, Ranjit Singh and Jenil Krishnan won silver in the mens four, completing the distance of 2000m in 6:16.79, behind China (6:06.40). Uzbekistan won the bronze in 6:22.70.         
	In the mens lightweight four event final, the Indian quartet of Lokesh Kumar, Manjeet Singh, Rajesh Kumar Yadav and Satish Joshi finished second clocking 6:13.32, behind Japan who came home in 6:10.14. Hong Kong got the bronze, clocking 6:14.84.         
	With this silver, mens four team member Jenil Krishnan picked up his third consecutive medal in the Asian Games, after grabbing bronze medals in 2002 Busan Games and silver in 2006 Doha Games. We wanted to go for the gold and tried really hard but the Chinese were too good. They pulled away after 750m, he said.         
	Lightweight four-team member Lokesh said he felt very proud to win the medal.         
	I am feeling so proud. Never felt better. I was nervous in the beginning but eventually overcame it, he said.         
	Team coach Ismail Baig said all the rowers have been preparing hard for the Games, adding that a gold is expected, on Friday, from Bajrang Lal Thakar in the mens singles sculls.         
	They have made tremendous improvement. I expect a gold from Bajrang Lal, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Vijay was in the hunt for a silver medal but he settled for the bronze, with a total score of 583. This is his second bronze in the Asian Games after his third position finish in the 10m air pistol.         
	Gagan Narang, however, disappointed to leave the much-heralded Indian shooting squad with a meagre tally of two silver and three bronze at the end of the rifle and pistol events.         
	Other Indian shooters apart from Vijay, shot way below the mark and the team finished fifth with a total aggregate of 1726 behind champions China (1743), South Korea (1742), North Korea (1734) and Vietnam (1731).         
	Vijays medal today was the first shooting medal in four days for the country, after the marksmen and women raised big hopes on the first two days with a haul of two silver and two bronze medals.                     
	Narang, who gave the country big hopes on the opening day of the competitions with a double silver haul (individual and team) in the mens 10m air rifle event, disappointed again in the 50m range.         
	He, though qualified for the final but went off the boil to finish fourth with 1162, a point behind bronze medal winner Zhu Qinan of China.         
	Narang expressed satisfaction with his display after ending his Games campaign with two silver medals.         
	Im satisfied with my performance. I won 8 medals this year which I dont think any other Indian athlete has done, Narang said.         
	He, however, called for better ammunition to be given to the shooters to train for the 50m events.         
	I want better ammunition and rifles for 50m events. The ammunition for air rifle is good, he said.         
	Chief coach Sunny Thomas said that Vijay Kumar saved his blushes after he had boasted, on Wednesday, that India would surely crack open the medal chest after three fruitless day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India eye London berth
                                                                                                                       7                                      India eye London berth
                      
	Guangzhou: Indian mens hockey team starts their campaign against minnows Hong Kong here on Monday, well aware that only a gold medal in the event would open the door for a direct entry to the 2012 London Olympics.         
	India had missed the Olympics berth for the first time in their history two years ago, when the team, led by Dilip Tirkey, lost to Britain in the final of the qualifying tournament in Chile, leading to a total overhaul of the hockey set-up.         
	The eight-time Olympic champions had a nightmare of an experience in the 2006 Doha Asian Games where they failed to qualify for the semifinals for the first time. India ended up a lowly eighth in the last World Cup in March in New Delhi.         
	Despite these reverses, hopes continued to swell in the nations hockey followers who would be hoping that Rajpal Singh and his men would deliver the goods by winning the gold here.         
	India are expected to face modest opposition in their first two Group B matches against Hong Kong and Bangladesh (Nov 17) but things would heat up from November 20, when they clash with Pakistan.         
	Their last group match is on November 21 against Japan.           (PTI)

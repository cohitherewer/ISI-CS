            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Winning the Asian badminton title could be a tough task for top seeded Indian Saina Nehwal, according to national coach P. Gopichand.         
	The Asian meet will be played at the Siri Fort Sports Complex here from Monday.         
	Talking to newspersons on Saturday, Gopichand, a former All-England champion, said all of Sainas opponents had beaten the Indian star in the past and are capable of repeating their performance.         
	It could be tough for Saina. She is pitted against Porntip Buranaprasertsuk in the first round and Julia Pei Xian Wong in the second. Saina had lost to both of them in the past. Saina will have to give her best to win these matches, said Gopichand.         
	Asked why Chetan Anand had pulled out of the tournament at the last moment, Gopichand said the top Indian player was suffering from a knee injury. He, however, hoped the other Indians in the mens section, especially Anup Sridhar and Arvind Bhatt would do well in the tournament.         
	Apart from Saina, two other Indians  V Diju and Jwala Gutta  are seeded first in the mixed doubles.

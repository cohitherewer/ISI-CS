The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ribery charged in sex scandal 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ribery charged in sex scandal 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Paris: France international Franck Ribery has been handed preliminary charges by police for soliciting an under-age prostitute.         
	 Zahia Dehar has told vice squad officers that she had 2,000-a-night sex with Ribery and another French international, Karim Benzema. They were questioned on Tuesday as part of a probe into a suspected network of prostitutes that operated out of a night club on Paris glitzy Champs-Elysees, a judicial official said.         
	Benzema was still being questioned by the magistrate.         
	The scandal, which broke before the World Cup and has been front-page news in France, includes allegations by a self-described escort girl who says Ribery flew her to visit him as a birthday present to himself when she was still under 18. Ribery is married with two children.         
	Zahia Dehar, now 18, has told French media that several football players on Frances national team paid to have sex with her when she was a minor. She has said the players were not aware she was underage at the time.         
	Preliminary charges in France allow investigators further time to probe. Two other people  a player agent and a member of Riberys family  were also detained for questioning on Tuesday, a judicial official said on condition of anonymity.         
	Prostitution is legal in France, but prostitutes must be over 18 years old, and clients are liable if they are not. The case is in the investigation stage and four people were handed preliminary charges and put in detention in April before being freed.         
	Real Madrid striker Benzema and Bayern Munich forward Ribery could face up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euros fine if found guilty of paying to have sex with a minor. They are among the most famous footballers in France and had once been pinpointed as Zinedine Zidanes heirs in the national squad, though they have failed to deliver on their early promise.         
	Both players have denied any wrongdoing. Riberys lawyer Sophie Bottai said that for the player to be convicted he would have had to know her age, which wasnt the case.         
	She would have had to look like a minor, which wasnt the case, she would have to have told him she was a minor, which wasnt the case, Bottai said.         
	Benzemas lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.         
	Dehar said she had been paid for sex since the age of 16 when she began partying in Paris. She claimed she met Benzema at the night club and he bought her services, and alleged that Lyon and France forward Sidney Govou had, too.         
	She told a magazine that Ribery flew her to a hotel in Germany for the night as a birthday present to himself. The platinum blonde also posed for the magazines cover wearing a baby doll dress with a plunging neckline and high heels.         
	Amid the scandal, Ribery, 27, was called up for the World Cup in South Africa, where France didnt progress past the first round following a string of below-par performances. Benzema was left out, with then-coach Raymond Domenech saying it was because of his unimpressive season.         
	The 22-year-old Benzema, who has scored eight goals in 27 appearances with France, was often left on the bench this season and scored only eight goals in the Spanish league after costing Madrid $44.4 million in 2009.

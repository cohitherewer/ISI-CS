                                                                                                                       7                                      Paes on a different court
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Leander Paes has accepted an offer from the Cambodian Tennis Federation to serve as its goodwill ambassador and international spokesperson for its project, Killing Fields to Tennis Courts.         
	The foundation has a set agenda to clear areas planted with landmines by the former Khmer Rouge regime. Once the areas are cleared, all modified tennis courts will be built and tennis programmes started for the disabled. What attracted me to this foundation is that I can help bring landmine awareness to the tennis industry, Paes was quoted as saying on the ATP website.

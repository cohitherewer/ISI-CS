The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Italy must aim for early goal
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                          Italy must aim for early goal
Pirlo boost for Azzurris going into final group game, vs Slovakia      GUEST COLUMN - P.K BANERJEE                                              
	The defending champions are staring at an early exit! Did anybody believe something like that could happen at this World Cup? I dont think so. The Azzurris, known for their never-say-die attitude will exhaust their last reserves to make sure of a place in the second round.         
	On Thursday, against Slovakia their game will have to be many notches above the mediocrity they have dished out against Paraguay and New Zealand. Frankly speaking, they did not look like the defending champions.         
	An ageing side looking clearly out of sorts. I was not surprised to see Fabio Cannavaro bungling in the first two matches. At 36, he is clearly not at his best and the same goes for the likes of Gianluca Zambrotta and Gennaro Gattuso.        
	The fall from grace of the 2006 World Player of the Year, who inspired the Azzurris to glory four years ago with his superb defending, just underlines how inferior Italy have so far been at this World Cup. I understand Marcelo Lippi cant drop Cannavaro because the other central defenders are very inexperienced.        
	Right now the Azzurris have two points from as many matches, while Slovakia have one point from their two outings.         
	If Italy win the match at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, they will advance automatically, while a draw means praying that the other group game too finishes in a draw with the Azzurri scoring more goals than New Zealand do against Paraguay.        
	The Italian fans are saying they were in a similar position in the group stage in 1982 before recovering quickly enough to win the title. I think that cycle was completed with the 2006 triumph. This time it will be a different story altogether.        
	On Thursday, what Lippi would be hoping for is an early goal. In their two group-stage matches it was the Italians who conceded the early goals.         
	If that happens again, I am sure the Slovaks will close the door and play a defensive game.         
	There was good news in the Italian camp though. Andrea Pirlo may make a comeback after missing the first two matches due to injury.         
	He is the man who can bring much-needed creativity in the midfield.         
	But I am not sure how well he can perform after having his first full training session in 15 days. Isnt it ridiculous to expect a miracle from Pirlo?        
	The Azzurris lack of creativity has something to do with Serie A. The Italian League is very tough but not creative. I always think there has to be a right might mix of tough and creative football. So, when the Italian national team play, you will always see them struggling for rhythm.         
	In 2006, they had someone like Luca Toni who was getting the goals.         
	But Lippi did not bring him to South Africa and has pinned hopes on the likes of Vincenzo Iaquinta and Antonio di Natale. So far, they have looked very ordinary.        
	Slovakia have a point and can only progress with a win, although that might not suffice if New Zealand defeat Paraguay with the South Americans keeping a better goal difference.

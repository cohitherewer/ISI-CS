The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians grapple for 2nd place
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians grapple for 2nd place
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  Narsingh Pancham Yadav          
	New Delhi: The race is hotting up, and its not for the top spot.         
	India and England are involved in a no-holds-barred battle for the cherished second spot behind Australia, but at least for the moment, England are ahead.         
	Thanks to Indias high-flying marksmen and freestyle grapplers four-gold haul on Saturday at the Commonwealth Games, India are just behind England in the medals tally.         
	Rifle ace Gagan Narang, centre fire pistol-wielding pair Vijay Kumar and Harpreet Singh and freestyle wrestlers, Yogeshwar Dutt (mens 60kg) and Narsingh Pancham Yadav (mens 74kg), continued Indias golden run to take the hosts gold tally to 24.         
	The 24 gold medals are still six short of the record haul of 30 medals at Manchester in 2002, but there is still hope for India to finish second with plenty of medals up for grabs.         
	But England -- with 43 silver to Indias 17 -- edged them out in the race to second place on Saturday. Indias tally stood at 24-17-17, while Englands read 24-43-29. Australia are way ahead with 55-30-31.         
	Indias Gagan Narang looked unstoppable in shooting on Saturday. With three gold medals in his kitty already, the Hyderabad rifleman won his fourth in style when he created a new Games record in the mens 50m rifle. Vijay Kumar and Harpreet Singh won the days first gold for India in the mens 25m centre fire pistol pairs event at the Commonwealth Games.         
	The womens team of Shuma Siddharth Shirur and Kavittha Yadav added a bronze from the 10m air rifle pairs event.         
	Indias tally of gold medals from the shooting range has now gone up to 12. With four more days of competition left, the hosts are hoping to better their previous best of 16 gold from the 2006 Melbourne Games.         
	In wrestling, it was an emotional moment for Yogeshwar Dutt at the Indira Gandhi Stadium. Dutt got emotional when a jubilant crowd cheered the 60kg freestyle wrestler for winning the gold medal defeating Canadas James Mancini.         
	There was a time after the 2008 Beijing Olympics when a serious knee injury threatened to halt Dutts career. Wrestling looked a distant dream after a surgery, but the grappler kept faith in himself. It is a rebirth for me, said the 27-year-old former Asian champion, one of the most skilful Indian wrestlers.         
	I have seen real bad days. Now, I am the happiest man on earth, he added.         
	Later, India won another gold in the 74kg category in wrestling when Narsing Panch Yadav defeated Richard Adinall of South Africa 4-0.

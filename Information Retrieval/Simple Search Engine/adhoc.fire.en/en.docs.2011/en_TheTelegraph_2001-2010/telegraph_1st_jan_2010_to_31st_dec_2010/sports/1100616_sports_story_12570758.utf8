The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifa fumes at orange ruse

	Johannesburg: Controversy struck World Cup on Monday when a group of female soccer fans were expelled from the stands during the Netherlands versus Denmark match at the Soccer City stadium for alleged ambush marketing.         
	The group of fans, 27 South Africans and nine Dutch citizens, according to local media reports, were rounded up by Fifa officials and were questioned for several hours for allegedly wearing an outfit designed by a beer company from the Netherlands. The girls were wearing orange dresses and orange is the official colour of the Dutch team.         
	Fifa held a press conference on Tuesday morning and accused the Dutch brewing company of ambush marketing. This was a clear ambush marketing activity, Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot said.         
	Ambush marketing is an attempt by a third party to create an association with an event without permission and can deprive official sponsors and suppliers of public recognition, weakening their commercial investment.         
	Fifa alleged that the Dutch company, Bavaria NV, had employed similar tactics during the last World Cup, in Germany, where they encouraged fans to wear orange, which is the companys colour.         
	Fifa had foiled that attempt by asking the supporters to take their trousers off before entering the stadiums.         
	Sponsors have paid around $1.2 billion to have the right to be associated with the World Cup. Fifa lawyers have filed more than 2,500 cases globally against parties it accuses of ambush marketing.         
	At this World Cup, Fifa continues confiscating flags bearing brand names in its attempt to crack down on ambush marketing.         
	Star Dutch footballer Rafael van der Vaart found his name coming up in the controversy as his wife Sylvie is the face of the brewers.         
	The development, however, has upset the Netherlands government, which has asked its South African counterpart to explain the grounds on which its citizens were detained. The local government here said it would look into the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Westwood remains   in the lead

	Ponte Vedra Beach: When the sun was going down Saturday, it looked as if Lee Westwood was sinking with it. With his golf ball atop a storm drain in the woods right of the 18th fairway  a seeming portent of the direction his luck and lead might be heading  Westwood came up with the kind of shot that reverses trends and wins big tournaments like the Players Championship.               
	Tiger Woodss woes continued on Sunday when a painful neck forced him to withdraw after six holes of his final round. He was two over for the day and two under for the tournament when he quit               
	After a free drop from the drain, Westwood was still surrounded by water oaks dripping with Spanish moss; pine trees; and palmetto bushes. He had 196 yards to the hole and a small margin for error.         
	There would be no error.         
	Westwood hit a seeing-eye 6-iron that nearly knocked down the pin, a searing shot that may be the real harbinger for this tournament.         
	It looked harder than it was, Westwood joked at first, later saying: It was a great shot. I got a little bit lucky. I hit it on the same line yesterday (Friday) and had to hack it out sideways, basically. But today (Saturday) I found a little gap and took advantage of that.         
	The trajectory of my 6-iron really matched the trees in front of me to go under one and over the next one to fade it into that flag. His ball came to rest about 35 feet above the hole, and he calmly two-putted for a round of 70, a 54-hole total of 14-under-par 202 and a one-stroke lead over the charging Robert Allenby of Australia, who shot 67, and two over Ben Crane (68), Lucas Glover (69) and Francesco Molinari (71) of Italy.         
	The course swatted Heath Slocum, who tied Westwood for the lead with a birdie at the ninth hole and took the lead alone at 15 under with back-to-back birdies at the 11th and 12th. He made double bogey and finished with a 72 that left him in a tie for sixth at 11 under with Chris Stroud (66), Tim Clark (66) and Charley Hoffman (69).         
	So, for that matter, is Phil Mickelson, although he would have to come from five strokes off the pace and hope for some help. Starting four hours before the leaders, Mickelson blistered the course for a 66 that included a bogey at the last hole. He was aware how much that bogey might mean on Sunday, but was still talking as if he had a chance.         
	What he was not interested in talking about was taking over the No. 1 spot in the rankings from Tiger Woods.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

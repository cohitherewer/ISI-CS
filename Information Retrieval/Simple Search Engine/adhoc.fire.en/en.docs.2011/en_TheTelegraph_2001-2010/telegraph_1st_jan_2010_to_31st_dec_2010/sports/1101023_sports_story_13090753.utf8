            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: Wayne Rooney has apologised to Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United teammates after ending a turbulent few days by signing a new five-year contract.         
	The announcement was made by United on Friday afternoon, ending one of the most amazing weeks in their history, which started with hints at unrest and included Rooneys own concerns about the direction United were heading in.         
	Wayne has apologised to me and the players, said Ferguson. He will also do so with the supporters.         
	Sometimes, when youre in a club, it can be hard to realise just how big it is and it takes something like the events of the last few days to make you understand, said added Ferguson.         
	I think Wayne now understands what a great club Manchester United is.         
	Rooney said conversations with Ferguson and the Glazer family had convinced him to remain with the club, and admitted his job now was to win back those supporters angered by his stance. I am sure the fans over the last week have felt let down by what they have read and seen, said Rooney.         
	My concern over the future led to the events over the past few days... The fans have been brilliant since I arrived and its up to me through my performances to win them over again.         
	Rooney added: I am signing a new deal in the absolute belief that the management, coaching staff, board and owners are totally committed to making sure United maintains its proud winning history  which is the reason I joined in the first place.         
	The England striker will have to wait for his chance to win back Uniteds supporters, as his ankle injury will rule him out for the next three weeks.         
	It was Rooneys claim that he was not suffering from an ankle problem  which completely contradicted the words of his manager  following Englands draw with Montenegro 10 days ago that started the whole rumpus in the first place.         
	Significantly, the timescale of the injury seems likely rule him out of the first Manchester derby of the season on November 10.         
	In addition, Rooney will also miss the Champions League return against Bursaspor a week earlier, next weeks Carling Cup tie with Wolves, plus Premier League games against Stoke on Sunday, Tottenham and Wolves again on November 6.

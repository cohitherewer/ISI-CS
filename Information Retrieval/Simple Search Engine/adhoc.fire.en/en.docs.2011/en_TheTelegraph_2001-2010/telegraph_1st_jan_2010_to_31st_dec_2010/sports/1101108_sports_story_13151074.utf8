	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has fined three players  Abdul Rehman, Zulqarnain Haider and Shahzaib Hasanand  and also issued them notices for violating curfew hours.         
	Team manager Intikhab Alam fined the three players 500 dirhams each for returning late to the team hotel in Dubai, where they are playing a one-day series.         
	This exercise basically is to let the players know clearly that now the management will no longer tolerate any violations of the Code of Conduct, Alam said.         
	The team manager had earlier also cautioned senior all rounder Abdul Razzaq and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar for violating the Code.         
	Razzaq had made some contentious remarks in the media after the second one-day International against South Africa in Abu Dhabi last week while Shoaib also returned to the hotel late, breaking curfew timings.

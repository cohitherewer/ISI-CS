The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Carroll set for England debut
                                                                                                                       7                                      Carroll set for England debut
                      
	London: Striker Andy Carroll will make his England debut in Wednesdays friendly against France but will have to get a grip on his private life if he is to be an international regular, manager Fabio Capello said on Tuesday.         
	Capello said that Newcastle Uniteds Carroll and fellow uncapped Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson will start the match, as will Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs.         
	Carroll has made a great start to the season with Newcastle as his all-action approach has produced seven goals. However, the 21-year-olds off-pitch activities have also caught the attention of the media as well as the England manager.         
	Hes a good player and I think he will understand that to stay with the seniors it will be really important for him because all the people, the newspapers will be focused on his life, Capello told a televised news conference.         
	He needs to improve things in his private life now because its really important.         
	Carroll was fined $1,574 last month after admitting he had assaulted a man in a nightclub, which left the victim with a head injury requiring hospital treatment.         
	Capello believes Carroll will learn from the episode.         
	I think you have to help him because he made a mistake but he is really young. I think everyone makes mistakes during their life and you have to help the young ones, said Capello.

            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: V.V.S. Laxman, who defied the South African bowlers on Tuesday to register a brilliant 96 and help India set a 303-run target, believes that dismissing Jacques Kallis early on Wednesday will be extremely crucial for the visitors.         
	Speaking at a media conference, Laxman also credited coach Gary Kirsten for instilling fighting qualities in the Indian tailenders.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his brilliant show which helped India set a 303-run target         
	Doing well for the team is the only motivation for me The bowlers got us back well in the first innings when we bowled them out for 131. So it was very important to set a good target. It was just a matter of one partnership and, luckily, me and Zaheer (Khan) had that (partnership). Yesterday (Monday), I thought (Cheteshwar) Pujara batted really well Showed a lot of character.         
	If the target is good enough         
	You always like to get more But the position we were in yesterday, when we lost four quick wickets, we are really happy to set a 303-run target.         
	Missing a century         
	I feel a little disappointed not to get a hundred because I have never got a hundred in South Africa. I thought it would have been the right moment for me. But any knock which helps the team to do well is really satisfying.         
	On batting with tailenders         
	I thought today (Tuesday), Zaheer was more aggressive than I was. As Ive said, our tail does take pride in its batting and they have been working a lot on their batting. They have also understood the importance of contributing with the bat and Gary has instilled that in their mind. In the first innings, I thought Harbhajan did reasonably well. On my part, I always feel that its important to rotate the strike and keep the score board ticking instead of me taking the strike most of the time.         
	On Indias chances         
	The way we bowled in the first innings is an example of what we can do. They got off to a decent start, but the way our bowlers got back also shows that we have got the temperament to hold our nerve. I am sure that we will do our best tomorrow.         
	If there are any concerns         
	My back got a little stiff while I was batting today. As far as the match is concerned, tomorrows morning session will be very important. If we can get (Jacques) Kallis early, it can put a lot of pressure on the South Africans. Kalliss wicket will be very crucial for us.         
	The wicket         
	This wicket is such that you cant say that you are settled down. There has been something for the bowlers on all three days and probably, thats the reason why there has always been a chance for the bowlers to get batsmen out, even though they have got starts.         
	The approach one needs on this kind of a track         
	You need to get used to the bounce of the wicket. But patience is also very important. If you can get through the difficult times, then you get value for your shots Thats what I learnt in the first innings.

	New Delhi: Indias Ronjan Sodhi clinched a gold at the double trap event in the ISSF World Cup finals in Izmir, Turkey, on Monday.         
	Sodhi shot a stunning 195 out of 200 to emerge victorious. The world No. 5 had earlier scored 143 in the qualifying round. One of Indias brightest medal prospects in the shooting event in the forthcoming Commonwealth Games, Sodhi had struck gold in the Lonato World Cup, earlier this year, with an identical score.         
	Apart form the Commonwealth Games, Sodhi will also be taking part in the Asian Games in Guangzhou, in November. (PTI)

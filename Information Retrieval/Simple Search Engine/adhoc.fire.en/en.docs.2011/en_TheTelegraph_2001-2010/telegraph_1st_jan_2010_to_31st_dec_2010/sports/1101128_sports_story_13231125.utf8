The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dipendu gives Md. Sp. a point
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dipendu gives Md. Sp. a point
            A STAFF REPORTER            MoM Dipendu                           
	Calcutta: A day after East Bengal sealed the Calcutta Football League Premier Division title, Chirag United and Mohammedan Sporting played out a 2-2 draw in front of just a handful of fans, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday.         
	The match was inconsequential and that there was a lack of motivation was clear from Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharyas words: There was just no motivation. Once the league winners have been decided, it really is of no consequence what happens. You either are the champions, or nothing altogether.         
	Coming back to Saturdays tie, midfielder Denson Devadas began the proceedings in style for the Durand Cup champions. In the 23rd minute, receiving a pass from striker Junior Elijah, he slotted the ball home past a hapless Sporting keeper Rakesh Prasad.         
	However, veteran striker Dipendu Biswas equalised for Mohammedan Sporting 12 minutes later with a brilliant header off a Satyajit Bose corner. Chirag keeper Somnath Khara could only watch helplessly as the header flew past him into the net.         
	Chirag seemed determined to win the three points as they began the second half steadily. Elijah Junior scored the second goal for the Bhattacharyas team in the 51st minute. The Nigerian headed it home from a Bapi Saha cross.         
	Not to be outdone, Man of the Match Dipendu was on the mark again as he restored parity for his team. This time it was a penalty kick which he converted. Sporting had been awarded a penalty due to a handball by Chirag captain Arnab Mondal.         
	It seemed strange that Mondal wasnt booked for the handball because then, it would have been his second yellow. He had earlier been shown a yellow in the 39th minute. When questioned, match commissioner Hari Sadhan Ghosh stated: Not for every handball is a yellow shown.         
	Sporting coach Tope Fuja seemed happy with the result. We are happy to have drawn the match, he said. Our aim now is to get new players for our second division matches.         
	On the handball incident, the Nigerian coach said: The yellow card should have been shown because it was a deliberate handball.         
	On the other hand, Bhattacharyas main aim now is the I-League. Hopefully, my boys will be ready by then. Im hoping that my injured players will be back before our first I-League match against the AIFF XI on December 3.         
	With this draw, Sporting have 26 points from 14 matches, while Chirag have a point less from the same number of ties.         
	In the other CFL matches on Saturday, Tollygunje Agragami beat Mohammedan AC 2-1 while George Telegraph defeated WB Police 1-0. Railway FC drew 1-1 with Eastern Railway while Kalighat Club held Peerless SC to a goalless draw.

	Mandela attends kins funeral         
	Johannesburg: A sombre and frail Nelson Mandela attended the funeral Thursday for his 13-year-old great-granddaughter  Zenani Mandela, whose death in a car crash last week following the World Cups opening concert marked a tragic start to the tournament.         
	Mandela emerged stiffly from a car and leaned on a cane. Mandelas face was grave, though he broke into a smile at lighter moments during the service, including when a troupe of singers and dancers did a number in her honour. The service, which featured pop songs, hymns and a Maya Angelou poem, lasted about two-and-a-half hours.         
	Of dropped shorts         
	Irene: A portly South African student joined in Italy training on Thursday but got more than he bargained for when he lost his shorts trying a diving header and was later asked to step aside.         
	A club player who got selected was stuck in traffic so the student from the college where Italy are training gladly stepped in to the breach. After showing his bare bottom to the worlds photographers following a full length dive he then struggled to keep up with the pace of the running.         
	Gospel of life         
	Johannesburg: A South African man who wanted to watch a World Cup football match instead of a religious program was beaten to death by his family in the northeastern part of the country, police said Thursday. David Makoeya, a 61-year-old man, fought with his wife and two children for the remote control on Sunday because he wanted to watch Germany play Australia in the World Cup. The others, however, wanted to watch a gospel show.         
	One for each         
	Johannesburg: Australia midfielder Tim Cahill and South Africa goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune have each received a minimum one-match ban for their straight red cards in World Cup group matches, Fifa said on Thursday. Cahill, who was sent off in the Socceroos first group game against Germany, will miss Saturdays match with Ghana. Khune, who was dismissed against Uruguay, must sit out the hosts last Group A match versus France on Tuesday.         
	League better         
	Johannesburg: The quality of football in the Champions League is far better than that on display in the first round matches at this years World Cup, Netherlands playmaker Wesley Sneijder said on Thursday. So far the favourites didnt show what they are capable of and only Germany really impressed, said Sneijder who arrived at the finals having won the Champions League with Inter Milan.         
	Goal on target         
	Magaliesburg: Portugal need to be more daring in the search for goals against North Korea than they were in the draw against the Ivory Coast in their World Cup opener, goalkeeper Eduardo said on Thursday. Were conscious we have to win on Monday. Perhaps we lacked a bit of daring in the last third of the pitch against the Ivory Coast. We have to go for goals, Eduardo said.         
	X-common factor         
	Johannesburg: New Zealand have found an X-Factor in their squad that is helping them to surprise pundits and they go into a game against the world champions Italy on a high, players said on Thursday. Its a good group of guys and there seems to be a bit of that X-factor that you cant quite put your finger on, and you work to keep it that way, veteran midfielder Simon Elliott said.         
	Brewing trouble         
	Amsterdam: A Dutch brewer is providing legal and other assistance to the two Dutch women accused of pulling off a promotional stunt at the World Cup in Johannesburg, and said it would cancel promotional activities.         
	Italian shift         
	Erasmia: Germanys traditional breakfast of sausage, ham and cheese has been replaced by pasta as players fill up on carbohydrates early in the day for Fridays Group D clash against Serbia. The team has been trying to simulate matchday conditions in the past few days with their game in Port Elizabeth set for an early kick-off, an unusual time for German players, who were forced to drop their usual protein-rich breakfast. quot;It takes a bit of getting used to, having a bowl of pasta at 10 in the morning, quot; said Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff on Thursday.

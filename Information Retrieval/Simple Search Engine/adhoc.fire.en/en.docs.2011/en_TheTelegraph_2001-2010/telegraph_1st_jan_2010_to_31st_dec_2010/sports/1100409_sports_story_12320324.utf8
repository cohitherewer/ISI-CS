                                                                                                                       7                                      Gilchrist praises Suman
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble said at the post-match presentation ceremony that a total of 184, against the Deccan Chargers, should have been defended on a slow wicket.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Gilchrist: Its great to win this one. It keeps us alive in the competition. We have done almost 90 per cent of the things right. It was great batting by T. Suman and Andrew Symonds.         
	Kumble: Initially the ball was stopping a bit. During the latter part of the innings, the wicket played a lot better. A total of 184 should have been defended. It was a brilliant innings by Virat Kohli. But we cant take credit away from the Deccan Chargers as they batted really well.         
	Suman: My aim was to bat till the end. With players like Symonds coming in next, I knew that I could bat freely. The juniors have got a lot of help from legends like Gilchrist, Symonds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru deserved the hundred: Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                      Viru deserved the hundred: Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Zealand captain Ross Taylor termed the Suraj Randiv no ball incident as an unfortunate one and feels that it was disappointing that Virender Sehwag couldnt complete his century.               
	The following are excerpts         
	India winning (vs Sri Lanka) despite batting second         
	It shows that the toss doesnt have a big influence on the game. All teams winning the toss elected to bat but still the teams batting second won two of those matches. I think the trend will continue.         
	Ideal score on this track         
	I guess 230-240 is more like a par-score out on that wicket. In every game, the team have lost early wickets and put themselves on the back foot. We will look to retain wickets and put some pressure on the bowling team.         
	If there is any chance for batsmen to shuffle across the wicket...         
	No The openers are there and it is a tough job when the ball does swing around. I am sure they are used to it and hopefully we can lose fewer wickets at the top and give ourselves a better chance through the middle.         
	The no ball controversy         
	It was disappointing for Sehwag. I was watching the game at that time and I thought he deserved a hundred since he batted very well. It was an unfortunate incident which, I think, has been dealt with. I am sure it wont happen again in future.         
	If the controversy would serve as an advantage to New Zealand         
	The thing that works in our favour is that they (Sri Lankans) have played two games in a row which has been tough and shows that the team I guess they will be a bit tired after the tough Test series against India. That is an area which we will have to exploit         
	On pressures of captaincy         
	Yes there is some pressure... But it is slightly different and it adds a new dimension to the way you think .

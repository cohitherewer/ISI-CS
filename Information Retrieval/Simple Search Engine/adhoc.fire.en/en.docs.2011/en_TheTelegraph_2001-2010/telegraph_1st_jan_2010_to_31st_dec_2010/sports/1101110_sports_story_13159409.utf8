            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka have dislodged India to take second position in the ICC one-day rankings after securing a confidence-boosting series win over table-toppers Australia.         
	The first-ever series win in Australia has earned them three ratings points which has put them one point clear of India on 118 ratings points and 10 points behind No.1 ranked Australia, who meanwhile, has conceded two ratings points.         
	Sri Lanka won the series opener in Melbourne by one wicket and then took an unassailable 2-0 lead by winning the Sydney one-dayer by 29 runs (D-L method). Australia secured a consolation eight-wicket win in Brisbane.         
	The Indian team will have the chance to regain the No.2 spot later this month but it would happen only if it manages to win all the five ODIs against New Zealand. The series will start in Guwahati on November 28.         
	A 5-0 clean sweep will take India to 121 ratings points while a 4-1 series win will place it alongside Sri Lanka on 118 rating points. However, in that case, Mahendra Singh Dhonis side would be placed just behind Kumar Sangakkaras team by a fraction of a ratings point.         
	Sri Lankas next ODI commitment is the five-match ODI series against the West Indies which on December 9.         
	Meanwhile, South Africa and Pakistan have retained their pre-series positions after the Proteas won the just-concluded series in UAE 3-2.

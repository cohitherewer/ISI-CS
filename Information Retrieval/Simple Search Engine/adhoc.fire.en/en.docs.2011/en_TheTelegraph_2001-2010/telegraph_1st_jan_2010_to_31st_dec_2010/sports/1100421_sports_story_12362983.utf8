The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For the BCCI, Lalit Modis fate is sealed, but then...
                                                                                                                       7                                      For the BCCI, Lalit Modis fate stands sealed, but...
    - IPl chief, who is holding 'secrets', remains defiant           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Lalit Modis defiance notwithstanding, where the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is concerned, his fate is sealed.         
	With the Manmohan Singh government letting it be known that the Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner had to go, Modi cannot hang on. Not for long, at least.         
	The story, though, doesnt end with that.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Modi may read the writing on the wall and eventually leave, but could take some others down with him as well.         
	Modis confidence, or call it arrogance, stems from his being privy to a lot which may really embarrass some in high places... He could, therefore, come out with enough dirt to hurt others, is how one source put it.         
	His tweets have already cost Union minister Shashi Tharoor his job.         
	For all that, some within the BCCI are pointing fingers at the 13 other members of the IPLs governing council, too. Their point is: Wouldnt the council ever discuss anything? If it didnt, then why blame Modi only for the mess?         
	Besides eight officials, including all four principal office-bearers of the BCCI, the council has three politicians-cum-officials and as many former cricketers.         
	In the last category are legends Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Sunil Gavaskar, plus another one-time India captain, Ravi Shastri.         
	All have been advised to be present during the April 26 council meeting, inarguably the most crucial in three seasons of the IPL.         
	One option being considered by the BCCI, in the post-Modi scenario, is to make president Shashank Manohar the IPL chairman.         
	The other options being talked about are: (a) Giving that position to a senior member of the BCCI and having professionals work under him; (b) Getting an eminent former cricketer in that post, with the same arrangement.         
	Nothing is, of course, clear at this point in time.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but if Modi continues being defiant, then some in the BCCI may just decide to protest by actually boycotting the IPLs inaugural awards, on April 23.         
	Sadly, thanks to Modis tweets on Team Kochi, the most important stage of IPL III has been reduced to almost a non-event.         
	Having sweated it out for six weeks, the Sachin Tendulkars cant be amused.

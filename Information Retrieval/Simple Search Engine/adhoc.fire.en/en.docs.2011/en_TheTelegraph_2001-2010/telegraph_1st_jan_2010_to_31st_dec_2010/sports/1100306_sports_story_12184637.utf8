The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Panel fails to locate cause
                                                                                                                       7                                      Panel fails to locate cause
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Even the final effort by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) to find the real reason behind the power failure at the Eden, during a one-day International against Sri Lanka last December, failed to throw proper light on the issue.         
	The CAB had formed a three-member committee, comprising professors from three engineering institutions (Bengal Engineering and Science University, Jadavpur University and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur) in order to locate the problem.         
	But on Friday, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya informed that the report of the committee says that they have failed to pin point the real reason behind the mishap.         
	The three-member committee have submitted their report. But they have failed to pin point the exact causes behind the power failure. However, they have also said that there was no malfunctioning of any equipment in the power circuit or the control circuit of the floodlight towers at the Eden, said Damiya.         
	That then clears the association of any fault for the disruption during that one-dayer.         
	He, however, revealed that the committee has suggested a few probable reasons and some recommendations regarding the case. Among the probable causes, they have said that the failure might have been because of drastic reduction or total absence of supply voltage or control circuit voltage. A voltage dip of five to ten per cent for a duration of 10 milliseconds or less could also have led to the power loss, he said.         
	Dalmiya also said that, complying to the committees recommendations, the CAB would henceforth use generators as the primary power source, keeping the CESC power supply as a back-up option.         
	Speaking on a different issue, the former ICC president, confirmed that each affiliated unit of the CAB will receive two main pavilion and 35 outside pavilion tickets for each home match of the Kolkata Knight Riders in the third edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Also the CAB office-bearers will be allotted one main pavilion and five outside pavilion tickets. The CAB is also mulling giving the former Ranji Trophy and first-class players from the state a ticket for each match.         
	However, there wont be any tickets for the annual, associate and life members.         
	According to Dalmiya, the CAB has decided to restrict its miscellaneous expenditure during the IPL to Rs 40 lakh so that they dont incur a loss similar to that during the first chapter of the Twenty20 event in 2008. We will do some cost-cutting and restrict our expenditure, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Absurd claim by Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Absurd claim by Modi
  - IPL opener shifted to Mumbai due to Telengana crisis       OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi Thursday blamed the media for blowing the issue of Pakistani players going unsold in the recent IPL auction out of proportion and refused to apologise for the same.         
	The IPL has announced landmark deals this season but there is only one news item running (on television), Modi said. The (political) relations between the two countries are already fragile and the way you (media) are writing about this can only cause further damage.         
	Accusations and barbs have flown thick and fast ever since the auction saw no takers for the Pakistan players, with the neighbours launching into an all-out attack against India, government and all.         
	Modi, however, could have done better than just blaming the media for fanning the flames. After all, the core issue remains the snub to the World T20 champions and the IPL supremo would do well to address that. The statement blaming the media, therefore, was absurd to say the least.         
	IPL had invited Pakistani entries for the auction and it was understood that they would make a comeback in season No.3. But disinclination on the part of the franchises put paid to the Pakistani players hopes of getting a piece of the action this year.         
	The Pakistanis, it appears, have missed the bus but Modi, by launching into an attack on the media, has ensured that the attention is diverted from the plight of the Pakistani cricketers.         
	Modi was also quick to dismiss any suggestion that the Pakistanis had been deliberately kept out.         
	There was no preconceived conspiracy on the part of IPL or the BCCI to humiliate the Pakistani players. Its the prerogative of the franchise owners to pick a player, Modi said at a news conference.         
	Asked if the IPL would apologise to the Pakistan players, Modi said: Why should I apologise? The IPL has brought the best players from around the world. Why are you not talking about me apologising to players from the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and even Zimbabwe?         
	There were 11 Pakistan players on the 67-name list for the auction that took place Tuesday, but none of them found takers among the franchises.         
	Franchise owners Shilpa Shetty and Preity Zinta threw their weight behind Modi.         
	It was not a contrived attempt (to leave out Pakistan players). We (franchises) dont owe any explanation, Shetty, who has a stake in the Rajasthan Royals, said.         
	Meanwhile, the opening ceremony and the inaugural match of the third edition of the T20 league has been shifted from Hyderabad to Mumbai, the move prompted by the unrest in Andhra Pradesh over the Telangana issue.

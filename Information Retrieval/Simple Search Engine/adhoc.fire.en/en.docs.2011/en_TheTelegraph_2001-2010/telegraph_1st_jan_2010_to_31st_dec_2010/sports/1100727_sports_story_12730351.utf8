  - Both Sachin and Rahul warmly said that I deserved the Test cap       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Suresh Raina                                 
	Colombo: Young Suresh Raina, who became Indias 265th Test cricketer on Monday, following Yuvraj Singhs indisposition, spoke to the media in general and, then, to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Making his Test debut on a day dominated by Sri Lanka         
	Ek achcha mauka hai mere liye and Im thankful to God... We didnt have a great day, but still bowled well in the last two sessions, especially after tea, when we didnt give away many runs.         
	Yuvrajs sms to him on Sunday night         
	Yes, Yuvi asked me to mentally prepare myself, as he himself wasnt well... That was around 11 pm... I then called home and told my parents that I could make my Test debut in the morning... Frankly, main theek se so nahin paya.         
	Whether he again called home before leaving for the SSC         
	(Grins) I did, even though I hadnt been told anything officially... I spoke to my mother and she said she was preparing to go to a mandir.         
	On being officially told that hed be making his Test debut         
	By Gary (Kirsten, the coach) on the bus ride to the SSC... Felt very nice... Everybody had words of encouragement... Both Sachin (Tendulkar) and Rahul (Dravid) warmly said that I deserved the Test cap... (Virender) Sehwag felt I should play in a bindaas manner...         
	Having set a record, playing 98 ODIs before getting his first Test cap         
	Really! Chaliye, achchi baat hai... I didnt know Id set a record.         
	Getting the Test cap from Dravid, whod been the India captain during his ODI debut, coincidentally also against Sri Lanka, in July 2005         
	Hes been my ideal batsman, perhaps thats why he was asked to give the cap... Hed given my first ODI cap, too, in Dambulla.         
	Sri Lanka turning out to be special         
	Seems so... But it wont be for long if we have days such as today!         
	The year 2010 being memorable, with him getting the India captaincy for the May-June tri-series and T20 Internationals in Zimbabwe and, now, the Test cap...         
	(Smiles) Achcha ja raha hai... I need to make the most of the opportunities which come my way.         
	Whether it was frustrating having to wait five years for the Test cap         
	I wouldnt say so... In this period, Ive improved as a batsman... Im better now than I was then.         
	India having been quickly pushed into a corner in the second Test         
	Cricket attitude ka game hai... We have good batsmen and its a question of some good sessions... Lets hope for the best... We didnt give too many in the latter part of the day, but I agree weve got to take wickets... In my view, Ishant (Sharma) and (Abhimanyu) Mithun bowled well on a wicket with nothing for the bowlers.         
	Finally, being used as a part-time bowler         
	Ive performed this role in ODIs and T20 Internationals. I tried the leg-break, but wasnt able to get a wicket... I bowl quite a bit at nets, though.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag held by Pune FC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag held by Pune FC
                      
	Pune: Pune FC (PFC) rallied from a goal down to hold Chirag United to a 1-1 draw in a fourth round I-League match, at the Balewadi Sports Complex ground, here, on Saturday.         
	Chirag opened the account in the injury time of the first half through Junior Elijah, who trapped a cross from Joshimar. The Brazilian dribbled past two defenders and sent in a cross for an unmarked Junior, who did not hesitate in doing the needful.         
	After the breather, Pune FC made repeated forays from both the flanks. And they got the equaliser in the 53rd minute. Arata Izumis header off a Lamine Tamba throw-in found the back of the net.         
	The hosts put more pressure but Chirag goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal was in his elements. He made three acrobatic saves to deny Pune FC full points. Pune FC now have three points from four games, while Chirag United have five points from four games.

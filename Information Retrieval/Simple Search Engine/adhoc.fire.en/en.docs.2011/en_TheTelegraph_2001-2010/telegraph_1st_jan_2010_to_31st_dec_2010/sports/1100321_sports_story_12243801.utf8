The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis makes it look easy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kallis makes it look easy
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  Jacques Kallis in Mumbai on Saturday      
	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians best plans came to a nought as they suffered their first defeat in this edition of the IPL, a seven-wicket wallop at the hands of the Royal Challengers Bangalore at Brabourne Stadium on Saturday.         
	Anil Kumbles men hardly put a wrong foot down as they restricted the hosts to a modest 151 for nine, and then overhauled the target without any hiccups.         
	It was one of those days when everything turned to gold for the Bangalore franchise.         
	The bowlers executed to perfection the plans they had worked out for the rival batsmen. Vinay Kumar (3/25) varied his pace and length brilliantly. Kumble was at his meanest best (1/18) and Dale Steyn (3/26) as menacing as ever.         
	They were backed by some top notch catching, epitomised by none other than Rahul Dravid with his single-handed grab on the run.         
	Man of the Match Jacques Kallis (66 not out) then stamped his class with his fourth unbeaten knock from as many games. The South African simply toyed with the Mumbai Indians bowling and the manner in which he sent Lasith Malinga, the most difficult bowler to get away, to all parts of the ground took the sting out of the home attack.         
	Electing to bat, the Mumbai Indians simply failed to get going. The poor form of Sanath Jayasuriya did not help while Sachin Tendulkar, the one man who had the ability to single-handedly take on any bowling did, not last long.         
	Tendulkar (25) seemed to have sacrificed power for touch and sophistication. Three successive boundaries off Steyn, all directed to backward square leg using the bowlers pace with the most delectable of glances, showed the maestro at his tactical best.         
	Sadly, the ploy also brought Tendulkars downfall as he moved across the stumps once too many and was bowled round his legs by Vinay Kumar.         
	Saurabh Tiwary (25) was done in by his inexperience.         
	The left-hander was at his aggressive best as he pulled Vinay Kumar to mid wicket fence, and then lofted Jacques Kallis to long off. However, his brute force succumbed to the guile of Kumble, who beat him in flight and turn with a superb googly.         
	That Kumbles strike was followed by Vinay Kumars triple whammy in the next over. Four wickets in 10 balls broke the back of the Mumbai Indians batting.         
	Defending a modest total, the home side did not show the alacrity required on the field, and let off Kallis and Manish Pandey (40) once each, before they had opened their account.         
	And once Kallis tore into Malinga, it was as good as over for the hosts.         
	Ambati Rayudu, who was injured while fielding, was taken for an X-ray.

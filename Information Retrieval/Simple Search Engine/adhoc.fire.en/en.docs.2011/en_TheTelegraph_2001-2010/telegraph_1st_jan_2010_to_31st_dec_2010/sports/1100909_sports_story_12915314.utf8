The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dengue outbreak causes camp shift
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dengue outbreak causes camp shift
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In a shocking development, the Cycling Federation of India (CFI) has decided to shift its Commonwealth Games camp from Delhi to Patiala following an outbreak of dengue fever among the cyclists.         
	Confirming the news, a senior CFI official said: The decision to shift the camp was taken after 18 of our 27 campers suffered from dengue fever, gastroenteritis and chicken pox. Our Australian coach (Graham Seers) has advised the federation to immediately take the camp back to Patiala.         
	Delhi is reeling under dengue attacks since June and nearly 1500 cases have already been reported in local hospitals. While 25 participating nations have sent letters to the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (CGOC) enquiring about the disease, a host of countries including Australia and Malaysia have recently issued travel advisories for their citizens coming to Delhi for the Games.         
	At this rate, it would have been difficult to field the side for the Commonwealth Games, said the CFI official. Two of our coaches, Amandeep Singh (coach track) and Narender Singh (coach technician) also suffered from dengue a few days ago, he added.         
	According to CFI sources, the condition of Helen, one of the top women cyclists, was so serious that she had to be admitted to a local hospital. Another woman cyclist, Rameshwari Devi, the captain of India in the Commonwealth Games, suffered from flu, while .Bikram Singh was down with chicken pox. Cyclists like Sarpreet Singh, Hetraj Singh and Pana Chaudhary were also down with dengue.         
	Seers was adamant, the CFI official said. So adverse was the condition in Delhi that he did not want to stay here for the safety of his wards.         
	Sources in the Sports Authority of India (SAI) said the poor living conditions of the cyclists during the Delhi camp also added to the trouble.         
	The national campers were put up in a city hotel where lack of ventilation and unhygienic atmosphere caused further trouble.

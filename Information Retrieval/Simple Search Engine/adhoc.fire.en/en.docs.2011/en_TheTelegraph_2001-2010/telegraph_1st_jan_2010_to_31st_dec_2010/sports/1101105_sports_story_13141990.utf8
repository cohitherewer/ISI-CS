                                                                                                                       7                                        Chirag are deserving winners: Morgan
  - Durand Cup JCT not unbeatable, feels Subrata Bhattacharya       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mohammed Rafique, who scored the all-important goal for Chirag United                                 
	New Delhi: The East Bengal players left the Ambedkar Stadium pitch a crestfallen lot on Thursday evening. Unable to accept the solitary goal Durand Cup semi-final defeat against Chirag United, the footballers rushed to the dressing room, changed quickly and then left for the team hotel almost immediately.         
	While the East Bengal players refused to speak, coach Trevor Morgan stayed composed and was ready to give credit to the opposition.         
	I accept the defeat because Chirag played well. They are deserving winners, said Morgan. They played well in the middle; got a goal in the end So it was their day. I am not trying to cover up the defeat with excuses but playing without top five players is never easy. It really proved costly.         
	Morgan said he did not risk fielding injured Tolgay Ozebe and Penn Orji. We have a long season ahead. I did not want to push the two. I feel 18 victories in 19 matches is a good result. It was one of those off days for my team. Thus we lost. Overall, I am proud of my boys, the coach said.         
	Asked what should his aim be now, the British coach said he was looking forward to the season ahead. We have been doing well in the Calcutta Football League and would like to finish the job there. Then we have the I-League. We would like to concentrate on that.         
	Morgans counterpart, Subrata Bhattacharya, admitted that Sundays match against JCT would be his toughest ever Durand Cup final. I have won eight Durand Cups as a player and one as a coach. Playing a final is nothing new to me. If we manage to find the right strategy, JCT can be beaten. The idea is to take the trophy to Calcutta, he said.         
	JCT are a good side and have the ability to run all the time. They also have some young players. But during our playing days, JCT were a more dangerous side with players like Inder Singh, Sukhwinder Singh and GS Parmar in their ranks, said the Chirag coach.         
	Bhattacharya had won the Durand Cup as Mohun Bagan coach in 2000 when the green and maroon side won 2-1 in a dramatic final against Mahindra United with Amar Ganguly and RC Prakash scoring for the Calcutta side.         
	Chirag officials were simply ecstatic. We have already announced a cash incentive of Rs. 25,000 for the players, said an official. The official hinted that more cash awards would be given if the team win the countrys oldest tournament.         
	For the first time in 17 years, a team from Bengal and Punjab will contest the Durand Cup final. In 1993, East Bengal won the meet defeating Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) through a goal by Sanjay Majhi.

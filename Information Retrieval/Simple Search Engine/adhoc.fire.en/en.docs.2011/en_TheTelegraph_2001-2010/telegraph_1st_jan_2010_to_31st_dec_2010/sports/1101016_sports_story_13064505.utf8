	Belgrade: Serbia will ask Uefa to reschedule their Euro 2012 qualifier against Italy which was abandoned after crowd trouble in Genoa on Tuesday, the Serbian Football Association (FSS) said on Friday.         
	We will meet with Uefa president Michel Platini and the soccer governing bodys other top officials on October 18 and ask for a replay, FSS president Tomislav Karadzic told a news conference.         
	We are not optimistic about the verdict but we will try to present our case and make it clear that the FSS did everything in its power to prevent the incidents.         
	However, no punishment should come as a surprise.         
	Karadzic condemned Serbian fans, who rioted and forced the game to be abandoned after seven minutes, but also blamed the violence on poor organisation by the Italian FA.

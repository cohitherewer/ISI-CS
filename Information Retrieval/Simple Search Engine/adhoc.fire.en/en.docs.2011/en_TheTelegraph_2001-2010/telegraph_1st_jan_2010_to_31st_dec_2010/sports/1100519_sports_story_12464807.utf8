The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players get 7 days to reply
                                                                                                                       7                                      Players get 7 days to reply
  - This is not a court martial, says BCCI secretary       OUR BUREAU                            
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Tuesday issued showcause notices to seven Team India players, including Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan, for their involvement in an incident at a bar in Gros Islet during the ICC World T20.         
	Seven players have been issued showcause notices, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan told The Telegraph.         
	Srinivasan refused to divulge the names of the players, and nor would he describe the nature of the charges they had been asked to explain.         
	The bottom line is that this is not a court martial. The players dont need to be treated like that (as if it was a court martial). This is an internal matter of the board, he said.         
	Apart from Yuvraj and Zaheer, Ashish Nehra, Rohit Sharma, Piyush Chawla and Ravindra Jadeja are the others who have been showcaused.         
	For a board that talks of transperancy, the decision not to release the names of the players is surprising, to say the least.         
	The seven players got into an argument with some fans when they visited Tequila Joe in Gros Islet, on the day they lost their last Super Eights encounter against Sri Lanka to get knocked out of the tournament.         
	According to a source, the players have been asked to reply within seven days.         
	It is likely that the players will be let off with a warning for breaching the curfew hours in the West Indies. The showcause is being seen in some quarters as a move by the BCCI to impose strict disciplinary measures.         
	The Board decided to showcause the players after the Indian team manager for the tournament, Ranjib Biswal, submitted his report.         
	According to sources, Biswal didnt take any individuals name in his report and only mentioned players. It was learnt, he mentioned in his report that the players had breached the curfew that was set for 9.30 pm. During the incident, the players retaliated verbally after being abused, the report said.         
	Biswal did not mention any pub incident for Team Indias digraceful exit, but blamed purely cricketing reasons for the ouster.         
	It might be noted that Rohit and Jadeja are part of the Indian squad, led by Suresh Raina, that will play a tri-series in Zimbabwe (May 28 to June 9) with Sri Lanka as the third team. Chawla would be joining them for two T20 Internationals against the hosts (June 12 and 13).         
	We conducted an inquiry into the incident in the West Indies that was widely reported in the media. After considering all the information that we have gathered, the president took the decision to showcause the players, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said on Monday.         
	This is not the first time that players have been asked to showcause in recent memory. Harbhajan was showcaused in September 2005 and April 2008, and Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh in April 2007.         
	Meanwhile, T. Keshav, chief executive officer of Kochi franchise owners Rendezvous, met IPL counterpart Sundar Raman in Mumbai on Tuesday.         
	Its a routine meeting we had with Raman and IMG (India) officials. It was about building our team, Keshav said.         
	Asked about the allegations made by Shailendra Gaikwad, one of the franchises stakeholders, against suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi, Keshav said: No, they were not part of the agenda (for Tuesdays meeting).

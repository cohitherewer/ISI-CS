            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A person who identified himself as the regional passport officer, and also said that he was from the IPS cadre, created a scene in the press box at the Eden on Tuesday evening.         
	The person, who was drunk, parked himself in the press box with his son and security guard. On being asked to leave, he threatened that nobody from the media would ever be able to get passports done through his office.         
	The IPLs chairman and commissioner, Lalit Modi, was informed of the incident and it is to be seen what action is taken against that person.

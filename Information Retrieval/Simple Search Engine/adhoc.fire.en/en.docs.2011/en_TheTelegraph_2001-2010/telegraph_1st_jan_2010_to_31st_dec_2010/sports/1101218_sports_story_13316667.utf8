The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Four in a row for EB 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Four in a row for EB 
                  Uga Okpara                     
	Ludhiana: East Bengal recorded their fourth straight win in the I-League when they defeated JCT by a solitary goal, here on Friday. Nigerian defender Uga Okpara scored the all-important goal in the 37th minute. It is always tough to take on JCT in Ludhiana but East Bengals never-say-die attitude saw them through. Both the teams started off at a brisk pace, but it was, the local outfit, who showed more urgency to break the deadlock.         
	East Bengal got the winner in the 37th minute off a Mehtab Hossain corner. Robin Singh flicked the ball to an unmarked Okpara, who made no mistake in tapping it home.         
	In the second half both the teams got a few opportunities but failed to convert those. Tolgay Ozebe missed an easy chance when he failed to hit the back of the net from close.         
	After four matches, East Bengal are on top of the league table with 12 points, while JCT are tottering at the bottom of the table with a point from four matches.         
	In Kolhapur, Air India and ONGC played a goalless draw.         
	ONGC dominated the proceedings in the initial session, but in the second half, it was the airmen who came back strongly, but neither of the two was successful in breaking the deadlock.         
	ONGC made their intentions clear right from word go and created some close chances. One such chance was squandered by their Nigerian striker, and former Air India player, N.D. Opara.         
	After the change of ends, Air India came all guns blazing but were undone by poor finishing. Manjit Singh, Eric and Samson Singh came close failed to convert.         
	In Margao, riding on their three successive win, Salgaocar will be looking to keep their winning momentum going when they take on AIFF XI.         
	Salgaocar have started impressively, while debutant AIFF XI have one point from three matches are at the bottom.         
	Karim Bencharifa, who joined Salgaocar last year when his team was fighting to avoid relegation, pulled them to sixth place at the end of the league. He has now moulded his youngsters to play attacking football which saw them yield desire results, winning matches against Viva Kerala, Chirag United and ONGC respectively.         
	Injuries to Chinta Chandrashekar, Peter Costa, Milagres Gonsalves and Beevan DMello has restricted their options to some extent but the return of striker Ekene Ikenwa from East Bengal has strengthen their attack.         
	Midfielder Ryuji Sueoka, who is playing infront along with Yusif Yakubu, has scored three goals and coach Bencharifa, who does not want to disturb their winning momentum, will persist with him instead of Ekene who is short of match practise.

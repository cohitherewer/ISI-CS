	Calcutta: Newly-appointed Bengal coach Shabbir Ali is determined to bring back the National Championship for the Santosh Trophy after a gap of 11 years.         
	Bengal, winners of 29 times, last won the trophy way back in 1999. If Shabbirs boys can bring back the glory, it will be doubly sweet as the city would be hosting the championship after a gap of 24 years.         
	The 64th edition of the Santosh Trophy will be held here from July 15 to August 8 with 32 teams vying for top honours.         
	The tournament is very prestigious for us and its very important as the tournament is being hosted after 24 years. Moreover, its been a long time since we won the tournament. We will be totally committed to bringing the title back, said Ali.         
	The boys will assemble in the third week of June. The players from the I-League teams will assemble on July 1. We are also planning a 10-day camp, the Bengal coach said.         
	 On Tuesday, the Indian Football Association roped in Tower Group as the sponsors of the Bengal team.

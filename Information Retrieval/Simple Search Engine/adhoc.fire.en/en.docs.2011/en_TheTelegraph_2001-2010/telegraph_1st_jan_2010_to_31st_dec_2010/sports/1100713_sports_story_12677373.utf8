                                                                                                                       7                                      Ranadeb mulls coaching role
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengals pace spearhead Ranadeb Bose has already started thinking about other career options once he hangs his boots.         
	To be precise, he plans to get into coaching after his playing days are over. Ranadeb, in fact, has decided to appear for the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias Level A examination scheduled in August.         
	There have been no half measures for me in life. I have done everything very seriously. I want to get into active coaching and so I am prepared to work hard and appear for exams. I have already done England and Wales Cricket Boards Level II, but I would like to complete all the three levels recognised by the National Cricket Academy (NCA), Ranadeb told The Telegraph.         
	The CAB, on Monday, announced that Ashok Dinda has been chosen as the Cricketer of the Year. While Rohan Banerjee bagged the Gentleman Cricket of the Year, Ranadeb was named the Best Fast Bowler of the Year.         
	Shreevats Goswami was adjudged the Best under-22 Cricketer of the Year.         
	Prakash Poddar will be awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award.         
	Meanwhile, Andy Atkinson, the International Cricket Councils pitch consultant, will be in the city on July 19 for inspection of the Eden track. The inspections are part of preparations for the 2011 ODI World Cup.

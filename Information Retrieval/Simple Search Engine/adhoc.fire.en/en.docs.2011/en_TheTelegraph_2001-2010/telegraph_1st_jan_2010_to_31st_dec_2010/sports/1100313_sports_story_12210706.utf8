            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Germany will be looking to make history by winning a third straight World Cup title at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Saturday.         
	But for that they would have to overcome the challenge from a highly motivated Australia  runners-up in the last two editions.         
	No other team in the world, not even Pakistan in their halcyon days, could do what this young bunch from Germany is looking to achieve.         
	But then, as German captain Maximilian Muller said, the final could be the toughest test in their bid to keep their aura of invincibility intact. Australia have the power and skill to upstage any team.         
	The way the Aussies blocked the Netherlands progress in the semi-final was clear indication of their big-match temperament.         
	The Australians started their campaign on a losing note against England but thereafter won five matches on the trot in the most convincing manner.         
	Australia coach Ric Charlesworth was hoping it would be third time lucky against the Germans.         
	Weve learnt from the earlier mistakes and have stepped up. Now I hope we take a further step up in the final.         
	Germany are very consistent in their game and have high quality players around the field. They dont have any weaknesses, but we have to find some in the final. Who knows, it could be third time lucky for us, he said.         
	Saturdays matches: For 3rd/4th place: The Netherlands vs England (3.35pm); Final: Germany vs Australia (6.05pm).

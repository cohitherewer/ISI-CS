	Besides Modi, others summoned by the Central Crime Branch Police are Kunal Dasgupta, Venu Nair, Andrew Georgio, Seamus Brien, Harish Krishnamachar and Ajay Verma, a senior police official said.         
	They have been summoned under CrPC sections 91 (to produce documents or other things) and 160 (power to require attendance of witnesses), a senior police official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Botha back in the Test squad
                                                                                                                       7                                      Botha back in the Test squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Off-spinner Johan Botha has been included in the South African Test squad for the first time since the 2008 tour of Bangladesh for next months tour of India.         
	Cricket South Africa (CSA) selection convenor Mike Procter on Monday named the 15-man squads for the two-Test series and three one-day Internationals. The Proteas leave for India on January 30.         
	It is important to have a second specialist spin bowling option for a Test series on the Asian sub-continent, said Procter. We feel this squad covers all our tactical options and will give a good account of itself.         
	Bothas action has been under the scanner for quite sometime. He was last reported for a suspected illegal action in April 2009.         
	Bothas doosra was measured at 26.7 degrees, and was banned until the bowler proved he could deliver it at a flexion limit of less than 15 degrees. But Botha received a go-ahead from the authorities to play in the World Twenty20 and the Champions Trophy after his off break (12.2 degrees) and arm-ball (11.1 degrees) measured within the ICCs parameters. He also signed an IPL contract with the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Big-hitting opening batsman Loots Bosman has been recalled to the ODI squad following his brilliant comeback in the Standard Bank International Pro20 against England when he made 94 and helped Graeme Smith share a world record opening partnership.         
	Bosman represented South Africa at the 2007 ICC World Cup but has only returned to full fitness this summer after a succession of injuries.         
	We feel that Bosman gives us an explosive hitting option upfront and this will be the ideal opportunity for him to show his worth on the sub-continent where next years World Cup will be played.         
	There are several players who are unlucky not to make the ODI squad including Hashim Amla, Ryan McLaren and Charl Langeveldt and I must emphasise that they are all still in the running for the World Cup next year, Procter added.         
	While Nagpur will host the first Test from February 6-10, the second will be played at the Eden from February 14-18. The three ODIs will be hosted by Jaipur, Kanpur and Ahmedabad on February 21, 24 and 27, respectively.

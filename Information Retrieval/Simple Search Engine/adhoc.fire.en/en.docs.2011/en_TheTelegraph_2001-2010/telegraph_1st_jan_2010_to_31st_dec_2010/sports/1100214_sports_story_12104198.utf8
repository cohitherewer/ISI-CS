The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India bank on luck and Laxman
                                                                                                                       7                                      India bank on luck and Laxman
    - Playing three pacers is a possibility, says Team India captain           INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Calcutta: To be or not to be, that is the question. As the debate rages over how much of the grass will finally be retained on the Eden turf, one thing is for sure  there is no turner for the asking.         
	If the wicket hasnt been to the Indians liking, the South African smiles have only broadened in the last couple of days. After all, a series victory will ensure the No.1 ranking for Graeme Smiths men.         
	Unless Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men rally in spectacular style at the Eden over the next five days, there will be no stopping the South Africans. Unless the Indians display the mental and technical fortitude needed to overcome hungry opponents poised for the kill, the visitors could be well-placed for a series victory in India.         
	Whatever the circumstances, youve got to keep your fingers crossed! Remember the historic March 2001 Test, when pinned to the wall and falling apart, Sourav Ganguly and Co. had stalled Australias winning run.         
	A somewhat similar desperate situation awaits Team India in the second Test of the Jaypee Infratech Cup. Will they deliver this time too? Will V.V.S. Laxman wield the magic wand?         
	Its no secret that Laxman revels in a crisis. His cool demeanour is enough to calm the nerves and exude confidence in others. For a middle-order so badly Steyn-ed in Nagpur, his presence is vital.         
	In the absence of Rahul Dravid, one would be tempted to play him at No.3. But that would mean having two inexperienced batsmen at No. 5 and 6, something the think tank wouldnt risk. Murali Vijay will, thus, bat at No. 3.         
	With Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar among runs in Nagpur, Laxmans addition should lend the much-needed stability to the batting line-up.         
	But will the four-pronged attack prove sufficient to win the Test? We are comfortable with four bowlers, has been Dhonis logic.         
	The Team India captain said that playing three pacers was a possibility. While Sreesanth is a certainty, one among Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha and Ishant Sharma will make the cut.         
	Dhoni is pinning hopes on the youngsters. Everybody is expected to do well, whoever gets a chance Its challenging. They have done well in the domestic circuit. But at the same time we expect them not to bog down under pressure. Its important to go out there and give it your best shot.         
	The good news for South Africa has been the availability of Smith despite the fractured little finger on his left hand. But it appears Mark Boucher hasnt fully recovered from the back strain. AB de Villiers donned the big gloves for a while during practice on the match eve.         
	The big question, however, remains  Will Steyn deliver in conditions believed to be tailor-made for his bowling? South Africas fortunes will depend heavily on his success, but dont rule out a Zaheer Khan blockbuster.         
	An inspired spell might just be enough to lift the Indian spirits. And then         
	Recent memory suggests the Indians have won in alien conditions in Adelaide, Johannesburg, Perth and Hamilton. Positives to look out for in their bid to draw level. And as Dhoni said, the luck factor might play its part.

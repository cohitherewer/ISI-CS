            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	London: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has been cleared by Essex Police of betting during an English county match last season, his lawyer has said. The news comes as a relief for Pakistan cricket which is having torrid time over spot-fixing allegations.         
	In May, Kaneria, who has played 61 Tests and taken 261 wickets, was questioned by police investigating claims that two Essex players placed bets on their Pro-40 match against Durham last September.         
	Kaneria, 29, and former England under-19 pace bowler Mervyn Westfield, 22, who was released by Essex last month, both denied the allegations.         
	The police have cleared Danish as they didnt find any concrete evidence to support the allegations, Furqan Anwar, Kanerias lawyer, said on Wednesday.         
	But it is understood that Westfield could still be charged.         
	Kaneria had been allowed by police to play for Essex this season until September 15 while they conducted their investigations into the betting allegations.         
	Kaneria said he would not make any comments on the case and was just relieved to be cleared of any charges.         
	The leg-spinner was released by the Pakistan team management after the first Test against England last month.         
	Kaneria, who has till date played 180 first-class matches has taken 885 wickets.         
	The leggie last played for Essex, last Saturday, in a Pro-40 match against Yorkshire.

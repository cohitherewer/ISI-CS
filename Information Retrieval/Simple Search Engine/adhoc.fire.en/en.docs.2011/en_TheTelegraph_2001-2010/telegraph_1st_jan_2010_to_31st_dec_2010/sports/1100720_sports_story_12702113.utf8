	Melbourne: Dean Jones admission of fathering a child outside his marriage has cost him the Victorian Father of the Year title, which the former Australian cricketer won in 2007.         
	Jones was stripped of the title following his recent shocking revelation that he had an affair for nine years with Sydney flight attendant Kerri-Anne Hamilton and has had a child with her, which he is believed to have never seen.         
	Father of the Year Council president Don Parsons said they decided to revoke the award after the 49-year-old cricketer openly admitted of having a child outside his marriage.         
	From now on, 2007 will simply show as blank  thats our attitude, Parsons was quoted as saying.         
	To take off and have a love child, and that he hasnt even seen the child... We are somewhat rocked by it. What sort of fathering is that? questioned Parsons.         
	He said it was the first time the council had encountered such a problem.         
	These awards have been made since 1956 and we have never had to revoke one. But we have no hesitation in revoking it. Father of the Year should mean that youre in a happy relationship, your children love you, and you love them.         
	Were not a bunch of old fuddy-duddies, but theres an image to being Father of the Year, and hes stepped outside it, Parsons said.         
	Jones is married to wife Jane for 24 years and has two daughters with her, Phoebe (19) and Isabella (14).           (PTI)

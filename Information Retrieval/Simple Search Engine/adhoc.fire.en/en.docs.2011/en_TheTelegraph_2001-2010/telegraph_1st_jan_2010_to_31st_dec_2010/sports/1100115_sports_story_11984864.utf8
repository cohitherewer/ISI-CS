	Sydney: Serena Williams survived a scare from Frances Aravane Rezai on Thursday before booking her spot in the Sydney International final against Russian Elena Dementieva.         
	The Australian Open champion was teetering on the brink of defeat after losing the first set and trailing 5-2 in the second but she raised her game to win 3-6, 7-5, 6-4.         
	I was lucky to get through today, the American told reporters. Im just super mentally tough, I feel like thats definitely one of my strengths.         
	While Serena had to dig deep, Dementieva had no real problems winning her semi-final against Victoria Azarenka of Belarus.         
	Dementieva cruised to a 6-3, 6-1 victory at the Olympic tennis centre to remain on course to defend her title.         
	I was trying to be very aggressive from the beginning of the match, Dementieva said. I didnt want it to go three sets, because I need to save some energy for the final.         
	Serena was well below her best against Rezai but used all her big-match experience to turn things around in an ominous sign of her intentions before next weeks Australian Open.         
	I felt like I literally lifted my game at that point, because I knew I was gonna be headed to Melbourne if I didnt, the world No. 1 said. I kept thinking, I want to get a little more practice and Id hate for it to end now.         
	France were at least assured of a place in the mens final after Richard Gasquet and Julien Benneteau won their last-eight matches.         
	Gasquet, who resumed playing this month after being cleared over a positive cocaine test, defeated Italys Potito Starace 6-3, 7-6 and Benneteau beat Leonardo Mayer of Argentina 6-4, 6-7, 6-0.         
	Former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus also reached the semi-finals by beating Australian Lleyton Hewitt 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.

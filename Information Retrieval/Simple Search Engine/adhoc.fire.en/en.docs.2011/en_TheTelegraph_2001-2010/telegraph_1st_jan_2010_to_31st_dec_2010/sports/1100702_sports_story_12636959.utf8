The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No politics, says Pawar
                                                                                                                       7                                        No politics, says Pawar
    - I wont be withdrawing, insists howard                 Pawar is the second Indian after Dalmiya to become the ICC president                           
	Singapore: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sharad Pawar Thursday formally took over as the International Cricket Council (ICC) president, succeeding Englishman David Morgan. Pawar became the second Indian, after Jagmohan Dalmiya, to head the ICC.         
	Barely a few hours after taking over his new role, Pawar, at a media conference here, spoke on a number of issues ranging from the rejection of former Australian Prime Minister John Howards nomination for the ICC vice-presidents post, to the cricketing ties between India and Pakistan.         
	He also said it his responsibility to build on the legacy left behind by outgoing ICC president David Morgan.         
	Following is what he said on the various topics:         
	Rejection of Howards nomination: What is the political connotation? There is no question of political connotation. We (will) wait for their (Australia, New Zealand) recommendation.         
	[Howard, on Thursday, refused to withdraw his candidacy for the ICC vice-presidents post. I wont be withdrawing. Even in private discussions they (the opposing boards) are very reluctant to give a particular reason. Its a very unusual situation, Howard said.]         
	India-Pakistan cricketing ties: Recent foreign secretary and home ministers visit to Pakistan is a welcome sign. If India and Pakistan start playing and it influences the bilateral relations of the two countries and also if both the governments permit, we will be happy to encourage. The ICC wants India and Pakistan to continue their bilateral series. But the ICC had not taken the initiative to stop that. It was because of some unforeseen circumstances that both the countries had decided to stop it. But now that the process to improve relations between the countries is on, it will give some dividends to cricket too.         
	On his new role: David Morgan has set the principles by which the ICC operates and now it is our responsibility to build on his legacy. In the past few days many people have thanked me for my contribution to cricket. All I would say is that cricket has been kind to me it has given me much more than I have given back.

	Mumbai: The football wasnt exceptional but Mahindra United, playing their last competitive match, managed to bow out on a winning note with a 2-1 victory over JCT in their final I-League engagement on Thursday.         
	Sukhwinder Singh put the hosts ahead in the 33rd minute with an effortless shot after Mohammed Rafi, after receiving the ball from Paresh Shivalkar, set him up nicely.         
	The lead doubled when Shivalkar chipped the ball over an out of position goalkeeper Karanjit Singh with one minute left in the first half.         
	Nna Henry reduced the margin with a header from set piece four minutes into the second half.

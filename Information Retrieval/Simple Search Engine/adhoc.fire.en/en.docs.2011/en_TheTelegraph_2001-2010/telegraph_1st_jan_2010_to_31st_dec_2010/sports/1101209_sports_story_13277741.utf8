The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wanted: Warne in action
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wanted: Warne in action
                      
	Melbourne: With Australias Ashes campaign on the ropes after a crushing second Test loss to England, local sports writers have resorted to trying to cajole 41-year-old leg-spinner Shane Warne out of retirement to save the cricket team in their hour of need.         
	Warne, as famous for generating tabloid headlines as match-winning performances, would revitalise Australias blunt attack which took only six wickets in their past two innings, columnist Peter Fitzsimons, a former Australia rugby international, wrote in Wednesdays Sydney Morning Herald.         
	Yes, England are on course for their first stunning victory since 1986-87 and it will be at our expense. Unless we do something. Who ya gonna call? Not Ghostbusters. Why not Shane Warne?         
	You need to get these wickets. You have a choice of, say, Xavier Doherty, Nathan Hauritz, Cameron White and Shane Warne, in his Channel Nine commentary gear. How many would really throw the ball to any of the first three in such a scenario?         
	Warne relished terrorising English batsmen over the course of a long, illustrious career, but retired from international cricket after Australia white-washed England 5-0 in the last home series.         
	There has been a bit written in Australia and people have been asking me about making a comeback. All I can say is that it is very flattering to hear those words, Warne wrote in The Daily Telegraph.         
	He instead plumped for Michael Beer for his left-arm spin and local knowledge of Perths Waca.

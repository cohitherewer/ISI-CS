	Mumbai: Yuvraj Singh, who is struggling with a wrist injury that ruled him out of the home Test and ODI series against South Africa, has been asked by the Board of Council for Cricket in India (BCCI) to see a specialist in Australia.         
	The BCCI has asked Yuvraj to go to Melbourne for consultation. But I dont know whether he has left yet, said BCCIs chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty Monday.         
	The Punjab batsman has informed on his Twitter page that hes off to Australia for treatment after India beat South Africa Sunday night in the first ODI in Jaipur.         
	Great stuff India! Am off to Australia for treatment  bye guys, he wrote in his Twitter page.         
	Yuvraj suffered a ligament tear on his left wrist during the second an d final Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka last month and has not played since then.         
	Shetty, however, couldnt say which specialist doctor Yuvraj was to consult in Australia. Yuvraj has been off cricket since the Bangladesh series. He missed the Test series and ODIs against South Africa.         
	The season has been bad for Yuvraj. After fracturing the little finger on his right hand during a training session before the Champions Trophy in South Africa, the lefthander suffered another fracture on his left little finger during the T20 against Sri Lanka in Mohali.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea enter   Cup final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chelsea enter   Cup final
                            
	London: Holders Chelsea beat Aston Villa 3-0 to sweep into the FA Cup final for the third time in four seasons on Saturday and keep alive their dream of a first FA Cup and League double.         
	All three goals came late in the game with Didier Drogba breaking Villas resistance after 67 minutes before Florent Malouda (89th) and Frank Lampard, deep in stoppage time, gave Chelsea an ultimately comfortable victory.         
	Chelsea will meet Tottenham Hotspur or Portsmouth, who play in the second semi-final on Sunday, in the domestic showpiece at Wembley on May 15.         
	The final scoreline belied the close nature of the match as Villa, determined to atone for their 7-1 defeat at Chelsea in the Premier League two weeks ago, matched the favourites stride-for-stride.         
	In Premier League action, debt-ravaged Portsmouth bowed to the inevitable on Saturday when they were relegated on the eve of their FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur.         
	The south coast club went down without kicking a ball on the day, any flickering hopes of survival finally snuffed out by West Ham United beating Sunderland 1-0.           (REUTERS)

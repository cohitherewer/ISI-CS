The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Bhupathi retires in final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Injured Bhupathi retires in final
                      
	Monte Carlo: Mahesh Bhupathi had to retire due to a leg injury, forcing the Indian and his partner Max Mirnyi to settle for the runners-up trophy in the mens doubles competition of the Monte Carlo Masters here.         
	The fifth seeds were trailing 3-6, 0-2 against top seeds and defending champions Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia when Bhupathi retired due to a leg injury after 44 minutes of play.         
	Nestor and Zimonjic broke serve in seventh and ninth games of the 29-minute first set, winning 16 of 20 service points and hitting five aces.         
	After breaking in the second game of the second set, the match continued for a further two points before Bhupathi  appearing in his 80th tour-level final (45-35)  called it a day.         
	Of course we got a little fortunate today with the injury which is unfortunate for them. Theyve been playing really well recently, getting to the final in Miami and theyll definitely be one of the teams to contend with throughout the rest of the season, said Nestor.         
	Nestor has now captured 67 doubles titles, while Zimonjic has a 35-23 final record. He also lifted the Monte-Carlo title in 2004, 2005 and was runner-up in 2006. (PTI)

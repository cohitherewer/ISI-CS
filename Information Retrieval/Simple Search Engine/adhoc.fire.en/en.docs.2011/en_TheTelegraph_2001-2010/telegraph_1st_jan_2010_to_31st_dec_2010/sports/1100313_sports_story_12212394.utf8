The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav, the captain, a winner
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav, the captain, a winner
    - SHAH RUKHS KNIGHTS MAKE iT A NIGHT TO REMEMBER           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Mumbai: It took just three-and-a-half hours or so for Sourav Ganguly to experience the lows and highs of life in the IPL.         
	With Manoj Tiwary falling on the first delivery and he himself getting out for a duck, three balls later, the evening on Friday couldnt have begun on a more despairing note.         
	It ended very differently, with the Kolkata Knight Riders captain holding Ishant Sharma in a tight embrace and returning to the dugout arms raised.         
	Without saying a word, Sourav actually said a lot, moments after a fantastic victory over the Deccan Chargers.         
	The Chargers had beaten the Knights in the first game last year, starting a journey which eventually gave them the crown.         
	In Navi Mumbai, it was, in many ways, a win for Sourav  back as captain, after being humiliated 12 months ago, and having to shoulder most of the franchises expectations.         
	Indeed, Sourav captained as only he can and the trademark flailing of arms was much in evidence. As also the ticking off of those who werent quite switched on.         
	Dadagiri it was, not on the sets for a TV shoot, but before an audience of millions, live and through television.         
	Its debatable just how many captains wouldve managed to turn things around, through smart changes, in the last 10 overs of a T20 opener.         
	The Knights recovered from 31 for four to a competitive (match-winning, as it turned out) 161 for four, while the champions stumbled after being 99 for one.         
	Ive asked the boys to enjoy themselves... Not take too much pressure, quot; principal owner Shah Rukh Khan told The Telegraph shortly after he saw his team off, at the Trident Bandra-Kurla, around 5 pm.         
	Yes, the teams left that early for IPL IIIs inaugural game.         
	Of course, the boys did look a bit edgy... Thats understandable... First match, after all... Im sure the remaining six teams are mighty pleased they didnt have to play the inaugural game, Shah Rukh added, grinning.         
	Souravs wife Dona and daughter Sana, incidentally, were at the Dr D.Y. Patil Sports Stadium, adding to the Knights in-house cheering squad.         
	Oh, we enjoyed ourselves... Sana got so carried away that she was yelling right through the last over (from Ishant), Dona remarked, while waiting to congratulate her husband.         
	Thankfully, Ishant didnt get carried away, though he did over-step on the first delivery. In some ways, it was his victory as well.         
	Sourav and Co. return to Calcutta on Saturday afternoon, some 26 hours before the next match, against Royal Challengers Bangalore.

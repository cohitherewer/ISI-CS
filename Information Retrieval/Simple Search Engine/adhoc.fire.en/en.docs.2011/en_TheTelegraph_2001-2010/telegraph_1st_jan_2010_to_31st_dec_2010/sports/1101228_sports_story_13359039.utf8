	Melbourne: Jonathan Trott glued together Englands first innings so well that it could be their only one. It was his third century in five Tests against Australia, and his fifth in this calendar year. Dont come in, No. 3  your time is not up yet.         
	Grinding Australia down was defined by England as their strategy at the start of this tour, and the two arch-grinders have been Alastair Cook and Trott. Neither is a pretty batsman, but they have ground Australia down in three of the four Tests.         
	In Brisbane Cook and Trott, as a pair, added 329 together. In Adelaide it was 173 for Englands second wicket. Only in Perth have they not glued  which is no coincidence as they are happier on slow pitches which give their adhesive qualities more scope.         
	Cook added only two runs to his overnight 80. But already he and Andrew Strauss had given England a first-innings lead and taken the match, and the Ashes, away from Australia, who were psychologically beaten after being dismissed for 98.         
	All that Australia could muster for meaningful resistance was a fine opening spell by Peter Siddle, some vigorous bouncers from Mitchell Johnson  and some petulance from Ricky Pointing after a couple of umpiring decisions.         
	Otherwise, they were ground down by Trott, firstly in a stand of 92 with Kevin Pietersen, then in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand, with Matt Prior, of 158, that made an innings defeat for Australia a strong possibility: their second of this series, after Adelaide.         
	The nearest Trott came to being denied his century was when he had made 46 and clipped  as so often  wide of mid-on. Ponting chased back and, with as powerful an arm as any in cricket, threw to the bowlers stumps. Trott had to launch into a full-stretch dive to make his ground.         
	After more grinding  it is indicative of his functional style that Trott reached his 50 with two fours, one of them inside-edged  Trott reached 76 and his second adventure, a painful one. He edged Ben Hilfenhaus on to the inside of his unpadded knee, keeled over, and could only hobble between wickets thereafter.         
	Trotts greatest virtue is that he aims to bat all day  as he did after Cooks early dismissal. He does not find ways of getting out. He sticks to his few shots. Much the same things were said about Herbert Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire opening batsman between the wars, whose career Test average of 60  the highest hitherto for England  Trott has surpassed for the moment.         
	Ponting, in his frustration (this will be the third Ashes series he has failed to win, out of his four as captain), first lost his cool when he complained to Aleem Dar. The third umpire gave Pietersen not out caught behind on 49, rationally enough because no inside edge was shown up on the replays  but Ponting raised his finger to wag it at Dar.         
	Ponting was peeved again when Prior, at the start of his innings, edged a catch to Brad Haddin off Johnson. But Dar, after giving Prior out, called for a replay as he suspected that Johnson had no-balled.         
	He had  so Prior was reprieved, and Ponting peeved. Prior needed no further invitation to enjoy his second innings.         
	He had not reached 30 in this series, but he had scored a century here in the state game against Victoria. He too enjoyed the fact that this pitch is much slower than Perth, for his attempts at hooks were not shown up too badly.         
	The attempts at hooks of Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell were shown up. Hooking with two fielders out deep at the MCG, with its enormous boundaries, was not good shot-selection. But at least it was one of the few strokes that Collingwood middled.

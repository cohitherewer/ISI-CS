The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra are firm favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahindra are firm favourites
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                                  Mahindra coach David Booth		      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United would be keen to sustain a sparkling form when they take on city rivals Air India in a Round XV I-League clash here on Tuesday.         
	David Booths men hit the ground running with a 4-1 away demolition of defending champions Churchill Brothers when the final phase of the national championship resumed last week.         
	The only concern for Mahindra would be injuries to stopper-back N.P. Pradeep and skipper Ajayan and, with three away games coming up after Tuesday, it would be a tough call for Booth on whether to include them.         
	Incidentally, the team have dropped points in their last two home matches.         
	Booth was also wary of the pressure due to the expectations in the wake of the victory over Churchill.         
	Its very important that we keep things in perspective... Every game has a different turn to it and now we are playing at home and the expectation is that we should win. That attitude makes for a dangerous situation if we are not careful, quot; he said.         
	Air India, with 11 points from 15 matches, would be keen to record their second win of the season.         
	In another match Tuesday, Sporting Clube de Goa will take on Mumbai FC in Margao. Sporting Clube would be desperate to end their losing streak at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.         
	Sporting Clube are still winless and languishing at the bottom with just six points.

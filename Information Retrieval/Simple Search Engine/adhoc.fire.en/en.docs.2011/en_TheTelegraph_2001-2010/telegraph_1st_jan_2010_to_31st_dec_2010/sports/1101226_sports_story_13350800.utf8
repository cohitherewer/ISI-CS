The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ hope   to turn around

	Auckland: With New Zealand cricket in turmoil on the field and Pakistan in tumult off it, there is plenty at stake for both sides when they lock horns in a Twenty20 game, in Auckland, Sunday.         
	Over the next seven weeks, New Zealand and Pakistan, led by Shahid Afridi, will attempt to turn their fortunes around as they play three Twenty20s, two Tests and six one-dayers before heading to the subcontinent for the one-day World Cup.         
	Pakistans internal turmoil has forced them to field a weak team with several of their stars left at home, including the suspended trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif.         
	To add to the pressure, they were skittled out for a meagre 91 by Auckland, in their one-day warm up game and then saw the home side overhaul the target for the loss of only five wickets and with nearly seven overs to spare.         
	New Zealand have rushed in former opening batsman John Wright to coach the Black Caps, who have lost their last 11 one-day Internationals.         
	Stand-in skipper Ross Taylor said he is looking forward to working with Wright. I am a batsman and him (Wright) being a batsman too, Im looking forward to gain from his enormous experience. The whole team will benefit from that, said Taylor.         
	Wrights first squad contains three newcomers in all-rounder Luke Woodcock, batsman Dean Brownlie and teenage fast bowler Adam Milne. (Agencies)

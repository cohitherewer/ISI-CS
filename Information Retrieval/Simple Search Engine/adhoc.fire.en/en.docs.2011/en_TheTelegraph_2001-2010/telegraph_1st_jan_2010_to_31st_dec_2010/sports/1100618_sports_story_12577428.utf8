The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Behind the goal is girlfriend! 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Behind the goal is girlfriend!

	Iker Casillas has been accused of taking his eye off the ball during Spains shock 1-0 defeat to Switzerland and his pitchside girlfriend is the one to blame, according to angry Spanish fans.         
	Gelson Fernandes goal provided the biggest upset of the World Cup thus far, but neither the much-criticised Jabulani or the deafening vuvuzelas have been made the scapegoat.         
	Casillas clashed with Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok and Gerard Pique was unable to stop the ball falling to Fernandes, who clipped the ball into an empty net.           
	Some in Spain have pointed the finger directly at Sara Carbonero, the girlfriend of goalkeeper Casillas.   
	Carbonero, a TV sports presenter, is in South Africa to report on the progress of the European champions and her presence caused uproar in a nation already highly suspicious of WAG culture.         
	Before the Switzerland game, Carbonero was seen presenting to camera directly behind the goal where her partner was warming up, and later conducted a live post match interview where a puzzled Casillas was asked How did you manage to muck it up?         
	And now it seems that Carbonero, who has been voted the sexiest journalist in the world, may have provided the answer to her own question after becoming the exception to a blanket ban on Spanish WAGs due to her job.         
	Doubts were raised in Spanish circles even before the tournament began but the 25-year-old presenter was quick to defend the accusation that she may have a destabilising effect on the team as nonsense.         
	The English WAGs of Baden-Baden came under heavy criticism for their much publicised appearance at World Cup 2006 and have since been given their marching orders by Fabio Capello.         
	But, like Carbonero, Abbey Clancy  partner to England striker Peter Crouch  has found the World Cup spotlight too hard to resist by becoming a regular feature on ITVs World Cup live show presented by James Corden.

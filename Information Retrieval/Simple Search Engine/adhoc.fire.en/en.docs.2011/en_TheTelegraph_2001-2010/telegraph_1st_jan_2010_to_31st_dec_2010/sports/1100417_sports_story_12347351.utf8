The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Dan shows his genius
                                                                                                                       7                                      Super Dan shows his genius
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: There were only a handful of people in the stands on Friday when reigning Olympic champion Lin Dan walked on to court three, at the Siri Fort Stadium, to play a quarter final match against Yun Hu, his seventh-seeded opponent from Hong Kong.         
	The spectators, who were waiting for top seeds Jwala Gutta and V. Diju to play a mixed doubles tie, looked purely disinterested at the beginning but once the Chinese left-hander started winning points with superb smashes from steep angles, the crowd soon realised they were watching someone special.         
	Seeded second in the tournament, Super Dan, as he is known in the badminton world, is the overwhelming favourite to win the Badminton Asia Championship title here, especially after the exit of Indonesias Taufik Hidayat.         
	At 27, the Chinese is extremely popular and equally controversial. A highly temperamental figure, he is known for disrupting matches to protest line calls and often, playing to the crowd even in the most competitive of matches.         
	I like playing here. The crowd is good and I am confident of winning the title he has said.         
	On Friday, after Lin Dan demolished Yun Hu 21-11, 21-10, someone asked him why he has never won the Asian title, he only said: I am the world champion.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Lothar Matthaeus in the city on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Lothar Matthaeus may have played at the Inter Milans San Siro, or Bayern Munichs Olympic Stadium, but, by his own admission, Salt Lake Stadium is not far behind. A beautiful stadium. Now I know why they call Calcutta the home of Indian football, the 1990 German World Cup captain said on Saturday.         
	You people must be in love with football. And why not? Its a very nice game, Matthaeus told a crowd, who came to have a glimpse of the World Cup the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Matthaeus said he always loved to score. Its a nice feeling to score goals. And it gives you double delight if you score in a World Cup match, he said. Matthaeus rated his first goal against Yugoslavia during the Italia 90 as the most satisfying strike in the World Cup. That gave me immense pleasure, he said.         
	As usual there were those usual jostling and shoving in the crowd and Matthaeus seemed to be a bit amused. You have seen me yesterday, and will again see me tomorrow. So please be quiet, Matthaeus said trying his best to be heard in the chaos.         
	As the crowd finally became quite, it Matthaeuss turn to enthral. He juggled, backheeled and then volleyed the ball into the crowd. And when the Emcee asked him to show the way he used to celebrate after scoring, the 48-year-old pumped his fist and let out that cry so synonymous with the German workhorse. The crowd, not to mention, loved every bit of it.         
	Moneys worth. The World Cup and Matthaeus, said one.         
	There was an air of festivity in the Stadium on the day. A 10-minute 3D show on World Cup from 1974 till 2006 and then what football will be like 2022 was an instant hit. And then there was a photo opportunity with the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team Indias brittle batting exposed; Dilshan delights
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team Indias brittle batting exposed; Dilshan delights
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Dambulla: Mahendra Singh Dhonis optimism wasnt enough to inspire his teammates scale another peak on Saturday. There was neither any combative effort, nor any individual brilliance to see Team India through.         
	Instead, the captains worst fears came true as the home bowlers yet again exposed the visitors brittle batting to annex the Micromax Cup.         
	Up against a target of 300, never achieved under the Dambulla lights, the Indians huffed and puffed before losing by 74 runs.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshans superb 110 from 115 balls had set the tone for the Lankan innings and their bowlers simply built on that effort. The Indians were outbatted, outbowled and outthought on the day.         
	They had very little going for them for the better part of their riposte. They were left floundering, in fact, once Virender Sehwag departed in a bizarre fashion.         
	Nuwan Kulasekaras inswinger seemed to have trapped the tournaments most successful batsman in front, but umpire Asoka de Silva negated the appeal. In his bid to steal a leg bye, Sehwag failed to beat Chamara Kapugederas throw from backward point.         
	The chase began on a poor note with Dinesh Karthik falling to a horrible decision from Asad Rauf. The ball had brushed his thigh pad on way to the wicketkeeper but the umpire thought otherwise. Karthik couldnt hide his disappointment on the way back to the pavilion.         
	Loaded with seven batsmen, the Indians perished like novices with none other than Dhoni, showing the zeal and temperament to put up a fight. There were scratchy efforts from Sehwag (28 off 22 balls), Virat Kohli (37 off 57 balls), Yuvraj Singh (26 off 31 balls) and Suresh Raina (29 off 28 balls).         
	As a result, the partnerships never got going and the Indians were left to rue their missed chances. Having come ahead of Raina in the batting order, Dhoni was the last man out, his 67 coming off 100 balls with five fours and a six. If only someone had shown the temperament to bat around him         
	The Sri Lankans had made their intent clear and were cruising from the moment they won the toss.         
	Dilshan, who hasnt been among runs in the one-dayers, took it upon himself to shoulder the responsibility as the four-pronged Indian pace attack struggled on a fresh wicket. In association with Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, the Man of the Match ensured that Sri Lanka reached a total that was a day earlier thought to be unachievable in these conditions.         
	It was not that the ball didnt seam or swing, but better application from the hosts batsmen enabled them to call the shots. They stuck to a gameplan of taking the minimum of risks in the initial stages and relying more on rotating the strike.         
	Both Praveen Kumar and Munaf Patel tested the batsmen with a fuller length with Jayawardene surviving a close call. The Kookabura balls dont do much after the first few overs and once Mahela and Dilshan saw that through, it was a struggle for the bowlers.         
	Sensing trouble, Dhoni was forced to rotate his four pacers in the first ten overs itself. It hardly helped as the full-house was treated to a scintillating exhibition of strokeplay.         
	The 121-run partnership was the highest opening stand in the tournament and also set the platform for an imposing total. Frustration got the better of Munaf as he got into a verbal spat with Dilshan after Mahela had hit a boundary. Umpire Rauf had to intervene before Dhoni calmed the pacer.         
	The openers targeted Ashish Nehra and Ishant Sharma as Dhoni struggled to stop the flow of runs. Praveen showed his limitations with the old ball once the pitch eased out and Yuvraj and Sehwag were forced to share 13 overs.         
	Dilshan added 85 for the third wicket with Sangakkara after the Lankans had reached 95 in the first 15 overs. Once Dilshan fell to an expansive pull, Sangakkara saw to it that the advantage wasnt surrendered.         
	The going has been tough for Dilshan with happenings on and off the field. The sense of relief and show of emotion on reaching his eighth one-day hundred exemplified his mental state.         
	Few quick wickets were lost towards the closing stages but that couldnt prevent them from setting the daunting target.

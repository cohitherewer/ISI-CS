The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warriors ready for the ambush 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warriors ready for the ambush 
                      
	Port Elizabeth: High on confidence after their opening match victory over Wayamba XI, South African domestic side Warriors will look to continue in the same vein when they take on Australias Victoria Bushrangers in the Champions League Twenty20 here Monday.         
	Mark Boucher led a solid batting display with a hurricane 26-ball unbeaten 40 to lead Warriors to victory Saturday. Bushrangers, however, will be a different ballgame altogether for the Warriors.         
	The Australian side may not have regular captain Cameron White, who is turning out for Bangalore Royal Challengers, but in stand-in captain David Hussey, Brad Hodge, and Aaron Finch, Bushrangers have a host of Twenty20 specialists.         
	From the teams point of view, it will be important that these star players fire on all cylinders.         
	Rob Quiney is another batsman expected to shine for the Australian side. The opener struggled on the slow and low wickets in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Rajasthan Royals, but is likely to find the South African conditions much easier for his style of play.         
	The Bushrangers have an enviable record in this format of the game, winning the KFC big bash four out of five times.         
	The side had beaten teams like Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australian Redbacks on their way to title triumph in the last edition of the KFC tournament.         
	John Hastings was the most successful bowler of the tournament, claiming 10 wickets in seven matches, while Finch, with 189 runs in six matches, finished as the sides top scorer.

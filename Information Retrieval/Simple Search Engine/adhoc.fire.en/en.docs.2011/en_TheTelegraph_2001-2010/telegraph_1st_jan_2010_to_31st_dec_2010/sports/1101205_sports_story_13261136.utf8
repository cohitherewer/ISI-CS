                                                                                                                       7                                      World Cup probables likely on Friday

	Calcutta: Indias 30 probables for the 2011 World Cup are most likely to be named on December 10, in Chennai.         
	Its not official, but the selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat) are expected to meet that day, coinciding with the final ODI against New Zealand...         
	After that, Hirwani and Bhave will be off to South Africa for the three-Test series and all five wont be together again this year... Having a tele-conference wont be the same as exchanging views face-to-face, a well-placed source told The Telegraph, on Saturday.         
	Where the International Cricket Council is concerned, the probables have to be named by December 17, with the final 15 by January 17. As for the tournament itself, it starts on February 19, with the final scheduled for April 2.         
	Assuming that all 18 whove been picked for the ongoing ODIs are going to make it, plus Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha, only eight places remain.         
	With Abhimanyu Mithun, Manoj Tiwary, Ashok Dinda and Ajinkya Rahane also being talked about, its possible that no more than four slots will actually be debated over by Srikkanth and his colleagues.         
	Dinesh Karthik, for one, must already have begun praying. The general belief is that hes been given enough opportunities and just hasnt made the impact he ought to have.         
	Wriddhiman Saha and Parthiv Patel are, at this stage, well ahead of Karthik. The captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) is, in any case, a keeper.         
	Yashpal and Raja, meanwhile, are going to replace Hirwani and Bhave and will be on duty during the solitary T20 International and the five ODIs.         
	For India, the ODI series in South Africa is going to be the last tournament before the World Cup.

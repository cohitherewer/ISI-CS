The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara: Mahelas experience did it for us
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sangakkara: Mahelas experience did it for us
  - Bowlers set up win in the first 15 overs of the match, says Kumar         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Nuwan Kulasekera with the Man of the Match trophy at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Dhaka, on Wednesday. (AFP)                                 
	Dhaka: Kumar Sangakkara said Mahela Jayawardenes batting made the difference in the final. He was all praise for Nuwan Kulasekara at the press conference.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The secret of the victory         
	Our bowlers set it up in the first 15 overs. We let it slip slightly in the middle of our innings but pulled it through. Suresh Raina was exceptional. Dew didnt play a role and full credit to the Indian bowlers for putting pressure on us.         
	His impressions         
	Any victory is sweet but one tournament win or defeat doesnt make you a good or bad team. But it certainly adds value to your side. I didnt win as a captain but it was the team effort that achieved it.         
	Jayawardenes batting         
	Mahelas experience did it for us. Weve got a lot of matchwinners --- Tillekaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv But Mahela is a big-match player and he showed it once again today.         
	Kulasekeras performance         
	Hes the man in form. Its not easy to bowl day in and day out against the same opposition. He was exceptional today. He has worked hard on his game and variation. Its a reward for his hard work.         
	The youngsters in his side         
	We always play collective cricket. Weve started the new year with a new set of players. Weve built a culture in the side to make performance count. This performance is a great thing for them.         
	The Indian spinners         
	Harbhajan Singh bowled well. Ravindra Jadeja has been improving every day. Yuvraj Singh always picks up wickets. They nearly took it away from us today         
	If Sanath Jayasuriya can still come back         
	This win is a victory for our young team But I hate using the word youngsters. If you are good enough you can perform at any age. The door is open to whoever performs.

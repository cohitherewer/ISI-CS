	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar has become the latest to heap praise on Indian woman boxer M.C.Mary Kom for her unprecedented feat of five world titles, describing her achievements as remarkable.         
	The 27-year-old mother-of-two from Manipur is the only woman boxer to clinch a medal at each of the six World Championships, starting with a silver in the inaugural edition in 2001.         
	Sachin lauded the diminutive boxer after coming back from South Africa from the Champions League Twenty20.         
	Got 2 knw abt Mary Koms stupendous achievement when I got back frm SA. Simply amazing! All the more remarkable aft taking break havin 2kids, the batting maestro wrote on his Twitter page.         
	An overwhelmed Mary Kom, who clinched the light flyweight 48kg gold in the latest World Championships, said she felt honoured after being complimented by one of her favourite athletes.         
	I am honoured to get appreciation from him. I dont watch much cricket, but I like Sachin Tendulkar. He is somebody who every Indian sportsperson should learn from, Mary Kom said.         
	I have never met him but from whatever I have seen of him on TV, he comes across as very humble, she added.           (AGENCIES)

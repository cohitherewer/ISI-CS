    - United draw level with Chelsea at the top                 Tottenham Hotspurs Gareth Bale (left) challenges Arsenals Bacary Sagna, in London, on Saturday                           
	London: Wayne Rooney made his return for Manchester United on Saturday as Alex Fergusons side capitalised on defeats for title rivals Chelsea and Arsenal, with a 2-0 home victory over nine-man Wigan Athletic.         
	Goals by Patrice Evra and Javier Hernandez put United level on 28 points with leaders Chelsea, who suffered their second successive league defeat when they lost 1-0 at Birmingham City.         
	Rooney, who got a mixed reception in his first game back since his drawn-out contract saga, was a second-half substitute against a Wigan side who had Antolin Alcaraz and Hugo Rodallega red-carded in quick succession after the break.         
	Arsenal collapsed under a second-half fight back by Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, squandering a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to their north London rivals in a Premier League cracker.         
	Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul completed a remarkable turnaround for Spurs with an 86th minute headed winner after goals from Samir Nasri and Marouane Chamakh had given Arsenal a comfortable 2-0 interval lead.         
	Not only did Arsenal lose at home to Tottenham for the first time since 1993, they also wasted the chance to move above leaders Chelsea.         
	Tottenham looked like extending their miserable record against Englands so-called top four to 69 away league matches without a victory but they were transformed in the second half with Gareth Bale halving the deficit and a Rafael van der Vaart penalty levelling it up before Kabouls late winner.         
	Spurs manager Harry Redknapp praised defender William Gallas, making his first return to the Emirates since leaving Arsenal at the end of last season.         
	William Gallas was top drawer today, Redknapp, who raised eyebrows when he signed the former Arsenal and Chelsea player in August said. He was superb.We were hesitant and didnt get the ball in the first half but we took the game to them after the break...it was a great second half performance.         
	Redknapp even suggested Tottenham could be contenders for the title. We are in the race...we can achieve anything. It will be tough but its open this season.         
	Arsenal dominated the first half and were ahead after nine minutes when Spurs keeper Heurelho Gomes failed to smother a through ball and Nasri rolled the ball into an empty net. Chamakh made it 2-0 after 27 minutes after a typical Arsenal counter-attack ended with Moroccan tapping in.         
	Jermain Defoe replaced Aaron Lennon at halftime and the England striker enlivened Spurs and his header allowed van der Vaart to pick out Bale who scored with ease after 50 minutes.

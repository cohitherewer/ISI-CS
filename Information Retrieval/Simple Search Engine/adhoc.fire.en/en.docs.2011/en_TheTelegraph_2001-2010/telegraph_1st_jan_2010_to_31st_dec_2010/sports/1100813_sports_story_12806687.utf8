            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	Calcutta: A nine-horse strong field has line-up for Saturdays main event, the 1,400m Independence Cup. The field includes four youngsters  Make My Day, Xavier, Strike A Deal and Must Be Magic. Three-year-olds have been, however, performing poorly in the open classes. Therefore, much is expected from them in the prestigious sweepstakes race.           
	Barring, Must Be Magic, an Eljohar filly who was a facile winner, recently over 1,200m, none of the other baby has tested its hooves on the monsoon track. However, trainer Rashid Byramjis filly Make My Day is looking racing fit. The Emerald Cat daughter has had three runs during the just concluded Bangalore summer season. Xavier and Strike A Deal, on the other hand, are burning the track and their respective camps are very hopeful of winning. There are six races on the cards and the first race starts at 2.15pm.

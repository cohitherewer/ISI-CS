            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: I. M. Vijayan on Tuesday stepped down as Southern Samity coach for failing to deliver the goods.         
	Speaking at a news conference, Vijayan said: If you do not perform well, you have to face criticism. It is the same for East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and any other big club.         
	Vijayan. however, said that he was hurt by the constant abusive behaviour of the supporters but that had nothing to with his decision. He also denied media reports that he was given the boot by the club on Monday itself.         
	Speaking about his coaching experience he said: It taught me how to work under extreme pressure and handle a team.         
	Asked if he thought he guided the players well, he said, They are all professionals and grown-ups. I can not tell them every little thing, or check when they go to sleep. They know they have to perform or face the consequences.         
	Revealing his plans, one of countrys all-time best footballers said he is heading home at the moment.         
	I aim for higher and better things. I will continue coaching. If a Kerala club offer me a position, I will consider it. If I get an offer from any Calcutta club, I am game for that also.

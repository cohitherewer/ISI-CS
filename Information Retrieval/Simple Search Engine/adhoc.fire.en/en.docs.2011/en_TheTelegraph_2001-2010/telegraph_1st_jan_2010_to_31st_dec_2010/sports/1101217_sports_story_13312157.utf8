                                                                                                                       7                                      Probables list is delayed
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has delayed announcing its probables for the World Cup after asking three players, including former captain Shoaib Malik, to submit details of their assets and bank accounts due to suspicion that they might be involved in spot-fixing.         
	Reliable sources in the PCB confirmed that the delay in announcement of the World Cup probables and the one-day squad for the New Zealand tour came after meetings with Kamran Akmal, Danish Kaneria and Shoaib Malik.         
	All three have been told to submit their bank account and other asset details to the board for scrutiny before they can be cleared to play again, a source said.         
	This is the first time that the Board has asked players to give details of their assets and bank accounts.         
	The source said Kaneria had even submitted details of his accounts to the board on Wednesday. But they want more details including assets they own at home and abroad.         
	The decision to seek details from the players came after the national selection committee advised the board to not waste the three players for such an important event like the World Cup.

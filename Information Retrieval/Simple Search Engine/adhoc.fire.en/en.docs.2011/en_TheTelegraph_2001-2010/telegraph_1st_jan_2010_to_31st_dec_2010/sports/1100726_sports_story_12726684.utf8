            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The annual general meeting of the West Bengal Badminton Association (WBBA), that was to have been held on Sunday, was adjourned till August 29 upon an order from Registrar of Societies, Ashok Ghosh. The AGM was to have covered two years  2007-08, 2008-09.         
	At a news conference, WBBA president Ushanath Banerjee alleged that Ghosh had been influenced by certain people with vested interests. Twenty of the associations affiliated units are eligible for voting at the AGM. Sixteen of those were present on the day as show of their support for the ruling group.         
	In a signed letter, the units have said that the move to stop the AGM was wrong and alleged that the intention was to protect former secretary Robin Pal Chowdhury, who has been suspended for misappropriating the associations funds.         
	Banerjee alleged that bureaucrat Subrata Gupta was orchestrating the conspiracy and trying to influence the state machinery.         
	Its almost the same scenario we had witnessed during the CAB elections a few years back. Well fight to save the game from these unwanted elements. We want free and fair elections and are all for transparency, the WBBA president said.         
	He also said that internal bickering had also robbed the city of an Open international tournament featuring the likes of, among others, world No.2 Saina Nehwal.         
	I feel theres a nexus to stop badminton and make it commercial, Banerjee said.

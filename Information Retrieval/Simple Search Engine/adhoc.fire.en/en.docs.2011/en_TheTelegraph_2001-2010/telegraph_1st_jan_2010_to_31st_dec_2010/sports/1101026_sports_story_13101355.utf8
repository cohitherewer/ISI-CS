The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My place not yet cemented
                                                                                                                       7                                      My place not yet cemented
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Virat Kohli on Monday voiced his support for the player rotation policy adopted for the Indian team in the lead up to the World Cup. He said it would give the selectors options when it came to picking the squad for the quadrennial event.         
	It is great if you have a whole lot of players waiting. There are many who are skilful and talented, its a good move. It gives a sense of competition and urges the players to do well, Kohli, in city for a promotional, said.         
	And Kohli seemed to be only too aware of what it is to be on the toes, as he admitted that he was not sure if he had cemented his place in the ODI squad despite his series-clinching century in the second tie against Australia at Visakhapatnam.         
	Its difficult to say that my position is secured. My career is at an early stage and like everyone it is my dream too to play in the World Cup. I have to consistently perform to be in the final squad, the 21-year-old batsman from Delhi said.         
	India are to host New Zealand in three Tests and five ODIs from November 4 to December 10.         
	Kohli said it would be a mistake to under-estimate the Kiwis who were handed a 4-0 drubbing by neighbouring minnows Bangladesh in an ODI series recently.         
	The Kiwis were visiting Bangladesh after a long time, so probably they were not familiar with the conditions. As far as we are concerned, we dont want to take them lightly as they are a much better team than the results show. They did well in Sri Lanka, so we are not taking any chances, he said.

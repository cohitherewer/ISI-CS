	Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to hold the appeal hearings of the tainted Pakistani trio, Salman Butt, Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif, in Qatar instead of London.         
	The ICC had notified the lawyers of the three players in writing about the venue and dates, likely between October 30 and 31, for the appeal hearings, sources said.         
	As per reports, the hearings were earlier scheduled in London, but later shifted to Qatar, on a request from the players, who felt the British media is not in support of players.         
	The cricketing body had provisionally suspended Butt, Aamer and Asif under the code of conduct for spot-fixing allegations. (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Wessels: Should bat as long as possible
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Former Proteas captain Kepler Wessels, the present batting consultant, who attended the post-match news conference on Saturday, lauded the batsmens effort for recovering after early jitters.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the first days performance         
	It was a difficult start today (Saturday), losing two wickets cheaply. But credit goes to the batsmen for recovering fast. Kallis and Amlas concentration was exceptional Their shot selection was great. The way they tackled Harbhajan (Singh) showed that they had a proper game plan against him and executed it well.         
	Kalliss innings         
	He has worked on his game over the years. The key is to adjust to the different situations. He is an ideal example for anyone in the world to learn how to build your game.         
	On how Amla has evolved over the years         
	No. 3 is an important position in the batting line-up. He has done an excellent job there.         
	Game plan for the second day         
	The main emphasis will be on not taking anything for granted. In these conditions, if you lose one wicket, you might quickly lose a few more. I have told the boys about that. We should bat as long as possible.

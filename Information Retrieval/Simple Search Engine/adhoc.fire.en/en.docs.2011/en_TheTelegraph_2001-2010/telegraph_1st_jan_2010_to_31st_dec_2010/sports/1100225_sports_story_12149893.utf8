The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Edmilson shines as Chirag lift title
                                                                                                                       7                                      Edmilson shines as Chirag lift title
                      
	Kannur: Chirag United defeated Lajong FC 3-0 to win the EK Nayanar Memorial Gold Cup Football tournament at the Jawahar Municipal Stadium, here on Wednesday.         
	Edmilson, Gauranga Datta and Lalkamal Bhowmick were on target for the Calcutta side.         
	Chirag drew first blood in the 11th minute. Edmilson raced to a long Rahul Kumar through from the right flank and although there was no apparent danger to the Lajong goal, the Chirag striker had other ideas. He cut inside and made room for himself before finishing emphatically.         
	The second came five minutes later. A Denson Devadas through freed Gauranga Biswas whose delivery was sent home smartly by his namesake who was unmarked.         
	Chirag could have got their third soon after. Another Denson through found Edmilson but the Brazilian was brought down by Lajong keeper Lalthuammawia.         
	The third came in the 77th minute.         
	In a fast counter attack, Edmilson took two defenders in his stride and crossed for Bhowmick who calmly slotted home.

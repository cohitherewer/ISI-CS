            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The election scenario in Hockey India (HI) got murkier on Monday when the sports ministry announced that the no objection given to the July 28 polls was conditional on abiding the recent age limit guidelines of the government.         
	The announcement is seen as a clear attempt by the ministry to stop the present HI acting president, Vidya Stokes, from contesting for the post of president.         
	In a letter to Justice RC Chopra, the returning officer for the elections, government observer S.K. Mendiratta said, the age restriction with regards to the president, secretary general and treasurer shall be applicable in relation to the present elections.         
	Stokes, however, was quick to shoot a letter to the returning officer, saying the HI has its own constitution and elections should be held as per the constitution.         
	In case Stokes is barred from contesting, former India captain Pargat Singh, the only other candidate in the fray, would automatically be elected.

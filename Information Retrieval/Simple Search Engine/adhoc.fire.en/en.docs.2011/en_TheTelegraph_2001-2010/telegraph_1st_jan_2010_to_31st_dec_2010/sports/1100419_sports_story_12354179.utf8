	Dharamshala: The Chennai Super Kings had to rely on a sensational late charge from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to register a six-wicket victory over the Kings XI Punjab and seal a semi-final berth in the third edition of the Indian Premier League on Sunday.         
	Chasing a mammoth 193 for victory, Dhoni cracked an unbeaten 29-ball 54 with a late flurry of fours and sixes to see his side home with two balls to spare in a high-scoring thriller at the HPCA Stadium.         
	Needing 16 runs from the last over, the Super Kings captain hit a hapless Irfan Pathan for 18 runs with the help of two sixes and a four as his side finished on 195 for four.         
	Dhoni, who hit a six to finish the match in style, had been dropped in the penultimate over by Pathan off Juan Therons bowling. He was on 32 then.         
	Dhoni struck five fours and two sixes in his blistering innings and shared a 47-run stand for the unfinished fifth wicket with Albie Morkel. S. Badrinath and Suresh Raina too chipped in.         
	With this win, the Super Kings ended their league engagements on 14 points from as many matches and a net run-rate of +0.27, thus assuring themselves of a semi-final spot.         
	Earlier, put into bat, the Kings XI compiled 192 for three, thanks to a breezy 99-run unbeaten fourth wicket partnership between Shaun Marsh (88) and Pathan (44).         
	The Super Kings lost two quick wickets when off-spinner Ramesh Powar removed Murali Vijay (13) and opening partner Matthew Hayden (5) cheaply.         
	Hayden departed in the third over, caught behind by wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara while Vijay was found short of the crease by the Sri Lankan.         
	Raina then joined Badrinath with the Super Kings struggling at 27 for two and added 62 runs before the former was removed by Theron in the 10th over.         
	After Rainas dismissal, Badrinath, who hit seven fours and two sixes, and Dhoni tried to accelerate and added 59 runs for the fourth wicket.           (PTI)

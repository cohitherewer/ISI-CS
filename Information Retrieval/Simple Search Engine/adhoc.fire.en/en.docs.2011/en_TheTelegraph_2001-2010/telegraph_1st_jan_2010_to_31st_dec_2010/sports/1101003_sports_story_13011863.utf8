The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Luck was in our favour: Morgan

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Cuttack: East Bengal coach Trevor James Morgan admitted that luck favoured his team in the Federation Cup final against Mohun Bagan, here on Saturday.         
	Luck was in our favour today. But then fortune always favours the brave. In football one side has to lose. You cant do anything about it. Through out the tournament we played well, and so I think we deserved to win this match and the title.         
	A beaming East Bengal captain Saumik Dey was overwhelmed after the match. I just cant believe it. We have won and I am the captain.         
	Saumik did not want to give much heed to Mohun Bagans disallowed goals. In a high-voltage match like this, you get some bad decisions. Today Bagan was on the rough side, tomorrow we may be there. I dont want to spoil the mood by thinking about those things.         
	An upset Bagan captain Ishfaq Ahmed, who did not play due to a hamstring injury, blamed referee Dinesh Nair for the loss. Murithala Ali scored a beautiful goal and he ruled it off side. His marching order was very unfair, Ishfaq said.         
	R Vashum, who scored the winner, was also over the moon. This is my first season in Calcutta and also the first East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match. I feel so proud. I would also like to thank our coach (Morgan) for all tne good work he has done with this team.

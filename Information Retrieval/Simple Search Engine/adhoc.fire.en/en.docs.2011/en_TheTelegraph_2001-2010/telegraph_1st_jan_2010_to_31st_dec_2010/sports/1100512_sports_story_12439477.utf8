	Gros Islet (St Lucia): England just about made it to the Super Eights of the World Twenty20, but once there, proved to be an absolute revelation.         
	Indeed, Paul Collingwoods men won all three matches in the tough phase and, by beating New Zealand on Monday, even helped Pakistan through to the last-four.         
	The lads are in form, are fit and are hungry, is how a former England player and coach, David Lloyd, summed it up, in a chat with The Telegraph.         
	Fitness has been critical and, so, is form... Then, theyve been wanting to do well... The results are there for all to see, he added.         
	The wicket here is going to be slower, so thats a disadvantage of sorts, but having got this far, its now a matter of only two more matches.

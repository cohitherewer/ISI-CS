The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chances of early return look dim
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chances of early return look dim
            OUR BUREAU                                  Tiger woods        
	Will he or wont he? The professional circuit has been abuzz with rumours of Tiger Woods return to the game, and now, its being said that the world No. 1 golfer could make his highly anticipated comeback at WGC Match Play Championship, which begins in Arizona on February 17.         
	The world No. 1 would have to confirm his decision to enter by next Friday. Rumours of his return actually surfaced in Australia and were initially greeted with scepticism, but it has always persisted. Even though it would be very surprising, reliable sources said that Tiger would play in Arizona.         
	An Australian newspaper reported that Woods management team had approached the organisers about the logistics of playing at Dove Mountain in Arizona. However, doubts remain over his participation in the event, which the champion golfer won in 2003, 2004 and 2008. In 2008, he defeated Stewart Cink 8 and 7.         
	In the WGC Match Play, the worlds top 64 players automatically qualify. But the match play format could leave Tiger open to even more intense interest than usual. And its being perceived that at this moment Tiger would not want it.         
	Another reason that might prevent Woods from entering is Accentures sponsorship of the event. The global technology firm was one of a number of companies that ended their sponsorship deal with Woods in the wake of the damaging revelations into his private life.         
	Woods has taken an indefinite break from golf to sort out his private life after he admitted that he had been unfaithful to his wife, Elin Nordegren, 30.         
	A fortnight ago, Woods checked into a sex addiction centre in Mississippi in attempt to get his life and career back on track.         
	His whereabouts had been unknown since he crashed his car outside his home in Orlando, Florida, on November 27, during a row with his wife over his infidelities. The scandal intensified as more affairs were revealed.         
	Woods is rumoured to be planning to play in the Masters at Augusta in April. So, its safe to assume he will not turn up cold at Augusta and give up a chance to close on Jack Nicklauss record of 18 Majors.         
	Meanwhile, media reports said that Elin has reportedly joined Tiger at the clinic for the final part of his therapy.         
	Seemingly, the last round of Woods therapy demands the presence of his Swedish wife.         
	Woods is expected to come out of the rehab this weekend. Woods is also planning a second honeymoon with Elin aboard their private yacht.

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Gros Islet: Captain Paul Collingwood said England would love to face arch rivals Australia in the final of the ICC World Twenty20 after seeing off Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the last four.         
	England were dominant after an all-round effort in the field restricted Sri Lanka to a below-par 128 for six, and innings from Michael Lumb (33), Craig Kieswetter (39) and Kevin Pietersen (42 not out) saw them over the line with four overs to spare. Collingwood concedes a preference exists for a meeting with Michael Clarke and Co. in the summit.         
	Ill be watching and be very interested, Collingwood said. Everyone would love to see an England versus Australia final but we have to give a lot of respect to Pakistan too, so well wait and see who it is.         
	However, he did his best to resist wallowing too much in his sides brilliant performance and instead delivered a message to his team that the job is yet to be completed.         
	We have not won anything yet, he said. I am going to keep drumming that into the guys. We will not get carried away but we have got ourselves in a position to win and that is what I am delighted about.         
	Let us be honest there are not too many areas we can improve on as long as we keep the same mentality. That is going to be the hard thing going into a big game.         
	But the boys keep responding to every challenge. They have been very easy to captain and over next couple of days we will continue with confidence building in training to get that belief into us and hit Sunday as hard as we have over the last few days.         
	Sometimes the finishing pieces of a jigsaw slot into place, said Collingwood of Lumb and Kieswetter.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Cuttack: Fourteen-time champions Mohun Bagan suffered a setback as they were held goalless by Mumbai Football Club in their group D quarter final league match of the 32nd Federation Cup here at the Barabati Stadium Friday.         
	With this draw, Mohun Bagan joined Salgaocar SC at the top of the table with four points each.         
	The clash between the two sides on Sunday will decide which team advances to the semi-finals from this group.         
	The Calcutta giants had themselves to blame for the draw as they missed two gilt-edged chances against Mumbai FC.         
	Chidi Edehs shot from the left corner of the box beat opposition custodian Ishant Debnath in the 79th minute but bounced back after hitting the far post.         
	In a quick reaction, Debnath grabbed the ball on the second attempt.         
	The Mumbai FC custodian emerged as the hero of the match, effecting another save two minutes later.         
	He first punched away a powerful shot by opposition striker Jose Ramirez Barreto and then fisted a volley from Edeh over the bar.         
	Earlier in the first half, Mohun Bagan enjoyed an edge over their opponents, creating and squandering chances at regular intervals.         
	Nigerian recruit Muritala Ali missed the easiest opportunity in the 17th minute when he headed the ball out from close range. Bagan also wasted several corners.

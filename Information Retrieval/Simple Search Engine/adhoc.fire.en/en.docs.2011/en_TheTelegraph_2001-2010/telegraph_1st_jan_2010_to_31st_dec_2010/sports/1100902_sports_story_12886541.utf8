            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ace archer Jayanta Talukdar shot 684 points as Indias mens recurve team ended the qualification round of the Stage-IV of the World Cup behind leaders South Korea with a total of 2030 points, in Shanghai, on Wednesday.         
	According to a press release, Talukdar himself finished second in the individual ranking behind Im Dong-Hyun, whose 691, broke the existing world record of 687, that he established at the Athens Olympics in 2004.         
	Korea also bettered the world record score of 2043 set in 2039 at Antalya.         
	National champion Tarundeep Rai was the next best placed Indian after Talukdar. His 674 points gave him the eighth rank.         
	Rahul Banerjee was 12th with 672 and Mangal Singh Champia, who will only be participating in the individual event, was 38th with 656.         
	Champia had earlier missed out on a Commonwealth Games berth but made it to the Asian Games squad.         
	Indias first round opponents in the mens team championship will be Great Britain.         
	The womens team however had a disappointing outing.         
	The senior archers  Dola Banerjee and Laishram Bombayla Devi  found their form dipping and had the mortification of finishing 39th and 33rd respectively.         
	Dolas 626 was the worst score among the four Indians, which earned her the 39th place.         
	Bombayla did a little better with a score of 629 which gave her the 33rd spot.         
	Cadet world champion Deepika Kumari had the best performance among the Indians, with a 13th place finish.         
	The fourth member, Rimil Buruily, was 19th with 641.         
	The womens team will clash with Japan in the first round.         
	In the mixed team event, Deepika Kumari and Jayanta Talukdar, were ranked third with 1329 and will face the Mexican duo in the first elimination round.

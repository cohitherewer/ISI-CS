The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It was a great toss to win: Anderson
                                                                                                                       7                                      It was a great toss to win: Anderson

	Melbourne: James Anderson hailed a perfect day for England as Australia were routed in front of a massive Boxing Day crowd at the MCG.         
	Australia were bowled out for 98, their lowest ever Ashes score in Melbourne, with Anderson taking four for 44 and Chris Tremlett four for 26.         
	By the close England were already building a first innings lead at 157 for nought having produced a startling turnaround from their huge defeat in Perth.         
	England will now feel they are one good day of batting away from retaining the Ashes with a Test match to spare.         
	Only four Australian batsmen reached double figures and all were dismissed by catches behind the wicket as Englands seam bowlers enjoyed perfect overcast conditions and a responsive pitch to justify Andrew Strauss decision to bat first.         
	Ive probably not [had a better day] off the top of my head, said Anderson. To bowl Australia out for under 100 and then be 150 for none at the end of play is really unheard of. Looking back, it was a great toss to win.         
	There is a danger when you win the toss that as a bowling unit you get carried away expecting to get wickets. We stuck at our task of trying to keep pressure in all day, asking questions and putting the ball in the right area. We did fantastically well.         
	Throughout the series we have bowled really well, beaten the bat quite a lot and had lbws turned down. We have created chances and today was the day when all those bits of luck came together and we got the nicks we have missed in the past.         
	(Mike) Hussey may have played and missed at that one in Perth but today he nicked it. It was just one of those days when it came right.         
	Australia were left reflecting on their lowest Ashes total for 42 years as a succession of batsmen played loose strokes and displayed a poor technique against a moving ball.         
	Our shot selection was not great and all of our wickets were caught behind so we certainly have no excuses, said Michael Clarke, who top scored with 20.         
	We played some poor shots today and did not show enough discipline. As we have seen the sun has come out and dried the wicket out and it is now a nice wicket to bat on.         
	The positive is we get another bat and another opportunity. You have got to give credit where credit is due. England bowled really well. They bowled good areas to us. Nice and full.         
	All our batters were caught behind the wicket which shows very good disciplined bowling and we have to come out here tomorrow and do that.         
	The projected world record attendance of more than 91,000 failed to materialise with a crowd of 83,345 announced.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

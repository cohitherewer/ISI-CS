The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Davydenko pulls out
                                                                                                                       7                                        Davydenko pulls out
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Davydenko                           
	Mumbai: The Indian Davis Cup team received a good news ahead of their World Group first-round tie against Russia, in Moscow as world No.6 Nikolay Davydenko pulled out with an injury.         
	Russia are a tough team with or without Davydenko. If we could win one of the singles rubbers on the opening day, it will be good for us, captain SP Mishra told The Telegraph from Moscow on Tuesday.         
	As far as we are concerned, we will try hard. When it comes to Davis Cup, we are known for playing much better than our rating.         
	India are playing in the World Group for the first time since 1998 and they couldnt have drawn a tougher opponent. Among the other three in the Russian squad for the March 5-7 tie, Mikhail Youzhny is ranked 13 in the world, Igor Kunitsyn 107 and Teimuraz Gabashvili 109. Dmitri Tursunov, the probable replacement for Davydenko, is No.111.         
	Apart from Davydenkos withdrawal, the Indians have also been in for a mild surprise in terms of playing conditions.         
	The court has been made on an ice skating rink with plywood, and could play a little slow. That would suit Somdev, the captain said.         
	However, the conditions have been typically cold with the temperatures below the freezing point.         
	It has been forecast that the temperature this weekend will be around -10 degree Celsius.         
	The team, including Rohan Bopanna and reserve players Sanam Singh and Ashutosh Singh, have been practising since Sunday, while the senior duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, who played in Dubai last week, were expected to join on Wednesday.

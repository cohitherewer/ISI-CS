The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My future is not clear: Diego
                                                                                                                       7                                      My future is not clear: Diego
                      
	Cape Town: Diego Maradona says his future as Argentina coach is unclear after the teams 0-4 loss to Germany in the World Cup quarter finals. Maradona said I may leave tomorrow at a news conference after Saturdays match, but added that Ill have to think carefully about it ... and talk with my family, and the players. There are many issues here. In a country where you breathe football, nobody will be happy about a game in which you lose 4-0.         
	The first cross produced a goal, and suddenly we were looking at a different game. They took advantage of all their chances, Maradona added.         
	He also said whoever comes after me will follow Argentinas attacking style of play.         
	Maradona was derided in Argentina before the tournament for leading the team by instinct and emotion rather than a tactical plan.         
	He lashed out at his critics with a stream of profanities when Argentina defeated Uruguay, finally ending a draining struggle to qualify for the World Cup. But the criticism abated as Argentina won four consecutive games in South Africa, raising hopes that the team could lift the World Cup trophy for the first time since Maradona won it as a player in 1986.         
	German coach Joachim Loew believes his young team have the countrys first World Cup triumph for 20 years within their grasp after demolishing an Argentina side he suggested were now past their prime on Saturday.         
	There is still a lot for us to achieve, said a calm Loew, following the three-time winners mesmerising 4-0 trouncing.         
	There are still two matches to go. We have got it in our own grasp to win the big prize, the 50-year-old told reporters.         
	Germany, who won the title in 1954, 1974 and 1990, looked sharper against their much-fancied opponents, whom they also beat at the same stage of the 2006 tournament on penalties. But spot kicks were not needed this time as Germany outran, outsmarted and outclassed Argentina, making them look like a team past their best.         
	Our players are younger, faster. Some of the Argentine players perhaps do not have this speed anymore, said Loew, who in his first World Cup in charge has already seen Germanys youngest World Cup team since 1934 fire four goals past England and Argentina.         
	In todays victory we were highly disciplined, but we were also willing to put in the extra effort, he said.         
	After 20-year-old Thomas Mueller put them ahead in the third minute with a glancing header, the Germans stepped on the gas in the second half with Miroslav Klose adding one either side of an Arne Friedrich goal.         
	We knew at half time we would need to get a second goal because we knew Argentina would put a lot of pressure on us in the second half, he said.         
	I am very proud of this team, the great way we played in the second half was first class. The team played like champions, Loew said. I hope we meet Spain next, they are favourites, an excellent team, said Man-of-the-Match Bastian Schweinsteiger, who set up the first goal with a curled free kick.         
	We lost to them two years ago in the (final of the) European Championship and I always enjoy most playing against top teams, he said.         
	To lose like that is very painful, Argentina striker Carlos Tevez said. We played badly and sometimes when you make mistakes you go home. They did what we knew they were capable of doing.         
	The only blemish on Germanys performance was a yellow card for Thomas Mueller following a handball, which will keep him out of the semi-finals.         
	 quot;If I want to become top scorer, I will have to count that my fellow players do everything right in the semi-finals, so I can score again in the final, quot; said Mueller, who has scored four goals in South Africa.

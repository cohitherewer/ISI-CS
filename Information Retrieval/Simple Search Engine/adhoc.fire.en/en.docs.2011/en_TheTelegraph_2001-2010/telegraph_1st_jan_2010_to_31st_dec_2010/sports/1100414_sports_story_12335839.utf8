  - WEST INDIAN'S ALL-ROUND EFFORT GIVES MUMBAI INDIANS VICTORY       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kieron Pollard, in Mumbai, on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: Kieron Pollard finally stamped his class on the Indian Premier League, powering the Mumbai Indians to a comprehensive 39-run win over the Delhi DareDevils at the Brabourne stadium Tuesday. The 22-year-old from Trinidad, bought for a huge sum, well above the price cap of $75,000, at this years auction, had shown glimpses of his destructibility in earlier games but when he finally came to the party, he almost single-handedly steamrollered the DareDevils.         
	The big hitting West Indian first cracked an unbeaten 45 off just 13 balls, that included two fours and five sixes, to help the hosts post a challenging 183 for four.         
	The historic Cricket Club of India venue then became the setting for Pollards performance as his team tried to defend that total. His combination of athleticism and cricketing acumen would have warmed the cockles of any veterans heart.         
	The DareDevils, with back-to-back defeats, most definitely had been looking to improve their chances of entering the semi-finals by taking advantage of the changes made by the Mumbai side, who have already qualified.         
	Sachin Tendulkar did make some changes, but really, they were cosmetic. The core of the team was retained, sending a clear signal of intent to the rivals. In any case, Pollard ensured all that was consigned to the statistics. For the record, Gautam Gambhirs men ended up with 144 for seven.         
	The Mumbai Indians, who made a sluggish start, owed their total to Pollard.         
	Arriving at the crease after the fall of Ambati Rayudus wicket and with only three overs remaining, Pollard turned the match, which had until then moved on at a lethargic pace, on its head with his hurricane knock.         
	After hoisting Sarabjeet Ladda over long-off, Pollard stunned the field with a back-scoop off Ashish Nehras full toss for a six over the wicketkeepers head. He then hit three sixes and a four in the last over by Andrew McDonald. The last six balls fetched 25 runs, 24 of them coming from Pollards bat.         
	Rayudu (24) and Saurabh Tiwary (38) played their role as well as the hosts accumulated 75 runs in the last five overs. Tendulkar made a composed 30 at the top. However, if anyone had thought that Pollard was all brawn, the latter showed what a complete package he is with his brilliant pick up and throw from the deep to run out Virender Sehwag (20).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well have   last laugh, says Lippi
                                                                                                                       7                                      We'll have   last laugh, says Lippi
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Pretoria : Italy coach Marcello Lippi is under fire after his teams 1-1 draw in the World Cup opener against Paraguay. Back in Rome, a host of former footballers, including Antonio Cassano, the striker Lippi dropped from the final squad in the last World Cup, have accused the coach of not selecting enough creative players.         
	To make it worse, one of the major radio channels in Italy that is believed to have the backing of a highly influential political leader, was heard cheering Paraguay after they took the lead.         
	Lippi, however, remained defiant when he addressed the media at the Casa Azzuri Media Centre on Tuesday.         
	While the Italian newspersons who were present in strong numbers, attacked him for selecting an ageing squad, Lippi retorted stating that Italy are still the world champions and would end up on a winning note in this edition also.         
	I see no reason to feel pessimistic, said the Italian coach. It was only the first match. In the World Cup, you have a long way to go.         
	No team should be judged on the performance of their first match. I can assure you that my team will have the last laugh.         
	Asked whether his team treaded a cautious path, the coach defended saying that Azzurris played normal football. In the second half, I feel, my team played well but couldnt score more than once.         
	Perhaps we were under pressure. After all, we are favourites on paper though I never made such a claim, said the coach.         
	Lippi refused to accept that his team were uninspiring against Paraguay. I have all the respect for the opposition.         
	They fought fiercely. Why dont you give them the credit? My only regret is that we could not get three points. We deserved that.         
	If yesterday we had scored four goals, won 4-0 and dominated of course I would have been happy, Lippi said.         
	But for something like that to happen its nearly impossible. It happened to Germany because the match took a certain turn. Lets not forget that they played with an extra man after the Australian was sent off.         
	Lippi said he was at loss to understand why his team was labelled as an ageing squad. Are we the oldest? I dont think so.         
	There may be some other teams also. There are nine players in the 23 who were a part of the victorious 2006 squad.         
	No team in the world turns up with a complete new squad in every World Cup. Thats not possible.         
	In Rome, Lippi was severely criticised for excluding creative players like Francesco Totti and Alessandro del Pierro.         
	There were even suggestions that Lippi did not select some of the players because he had personal problems with them. Thats ridiculous, said the veteran coach. I have been coaching for years and no one ever accused me of such a thing.         
	Once the team starts winning, everything would be fall in place. In my opinion, this is the best available Italy team for the World Cup.

	Melbourne: A refreshed Novak Djokovic has been quietly working his way through the Australian Open draw, leaving the other contenders for the first Grand Slam of the season to steal the limelight and the headlines.         
	It was only two years ago when Djokovic lifted the trophy at Melbourne Park, grinding down Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets to win his maiden Grand Slam.         
	Yet the gifted 22-year-old has almost been the forgotten man this year despite easing effortlessly past his first four opponents to book a place in the last eight.         
	After a crushing 6-1 6-2 7-5 win over hapless fourth-round opponent Lukasz Kubot on Monday, Djokovic faces a quarter final re-match against Tsonga, and feels quietly confident.         
	Nikolay Davydenko continued his run with a tense 6-2, 7-5, 4-6, 6-7, 6-3 fourth round victory over ninth seed Fernando Verdasco.         
	The Russian sixth seed, the form player on the mens Tour over the past six months, had not lost a set coming into the match but the Spaniard showed in the third and fourth sets that he was vulnerable.         
	Verdasco, who made the Australian Open semi-finals last year, sent the match to a deciding set, however, the Russian achieved the crucial break in the sixth game and clinched victory when the Spaniards return crashed into the net.         
	The Williams sisters won their fourth-round matches, extending a mark in which an American woman has been in the quarter finals every year since 1977. The two are still on course to meet in the semi-finals.         
	Venus Williams beat Francesca Schiavone 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 and Serena defeated Sam Stosur of Australia 6-4, 6-2 in just over an hour.         
	Serena broke Stosur in the opening game of the second set Monday. The American faced two break points in her next service game, but fought back to deuce with an ace and a service winner, then served another ace on game point.         
	Stosur, who beat Serena the last time the pair met in California last year, set up break point in the seventh game with a double fault, then Serena hit a forehand winner to go up 5-2.         
	Its important when youre playing a local girl to not let the crowd get too involved or else theyll kill you, Serena said.         
	Venus, who has won seven singles majors, struggled to hold serve in the first set against Schiavone but was in command by the end, when she won the last six games after the 29-year-old Italian broke her to open the third set.         
	Williams advanced to the Melbourne Park quarter finals for the seventh time to set up a meeting with Li Na. Li, who beat No. 4-seeded Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 6-3, joins Zheng Jie, the 2008 Wimbledon semi finalist, in the last eight.         
	Serena Williams will play Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who won the final 10 games in a 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 victory over Russian Vera Zvonareva.           (AGENCIES)

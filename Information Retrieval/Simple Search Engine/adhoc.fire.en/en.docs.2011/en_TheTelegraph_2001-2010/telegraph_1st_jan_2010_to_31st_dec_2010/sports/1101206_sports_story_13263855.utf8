	London: West Bromwich Albion climbed into the top half of the Premier League on Sunday after two goals by Peter Odemwingie and one from Somen Tchoyi secured a 3-1 win over Newcastle.         
	Tchoyis first goal at the Hawthorns gave the Baggies a deserved halftime lead as they dominated the opening 45 minutes. In another match, Sunderland beat West Ham 1-0.         
	Odemwingie then completed his sides first league win over Newcastle for 26 years before Peter Lovenkrands scored a late goal for Newcastle.         
	I thought everything about today was good, West Brom manager Roberto Di Matteo said. We scored three great goals and we controlled the game for the majority of the time. We recovered possession quite well.(agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger set for Chevron challenge

	Thousand Oaks (US): Quality is the watchword at this weeks Chevron World Challenge where 18 of the games best players will be vying for supremacy in a $5 million event hosted by Tiger Woods.         
	Simply qualifying for the elite field is an achievement in itself with every player at Sherwood Country Club ranked inside the worlds top 50.         
	This is definitely a way you want to finish off your year, American Sean Hair said while preparing for Thursdays opening round.         
	You do that, you know youre doing something good. Its a limited field ... but its the best players so youre going to have to play good golf. Its just nice. Youre competitive but its somewhat relaxed. Im excited to be here and be a part of the field.         
	Woods, who will be competing in his own event for the first time in three years, expressed delight over the quality of the players assembled at Sherwood this week.         
	Our field is the deepest and the strongest its ever been, the American world No. 2 told reporters after working on his putting in front of the imposing clubhouse. Were really looking forward to getting out there and hopefully putting up a good show.         
	A four-time champion here, Woods missed the 2008 World Challenge while recovering from knee surgery and last years edition after being engulfed by a torrid sex scandal.         
	Although yet to win this season while coping with the break-up of his marriage and the fourth swing change of his career, he retains his renowned appetite for victory. This is the last chance for him to win this year, though the event doesnt officially count in the PGA Tour.         
	My goal is to win every tournament I tee it up in and be prepared for every event, said Woods, who was replaced as world No. 1 by Britains Lee Westwood earlier this month.         
	But that does entail right now learning a new golf swing that requires a lot of work, some new motor patterns. Its not exactly easy, but its a fun challenge.         
	While Woods has lost the aura of golfing invincibility he once enjoyed, Hair expects his fellow American to return to winning ways. He went through a lot personally and hes obviously disappointed with his year, said three-time PGA Tour champion Hair. Hes got a lot of good goals and hes working hard on his game. Next year I fully expect him to play his normal Tiger game. You want to beat the best and you want to play with the best and hes definitely the best.         
	This week, 10 of the worlds top-15 players will be vying for supremacy over the Jack Nicklaus-designed layout at Sherwood.           (REUTERS)

	Melbourne/New Delhi: Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson opted out of the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he fears that playing in the Twenty20 tournament may lead to injury and a burn out, his manager said.         
	The names of Johnson and Australian captain Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke were not among the 416 released for next months player auction in Bangalore.         
	The resurgent Johnson, who last week bowled Australia to victory in Perth, has thus turned his back on a possible $1.5million income from the IPL, which starts in April, days after the World Cup.         
	According to reports, Johnson could have commanded a price tag of about $500,000 a year had he been available for the auction to be held on January 8 and 9. Players sold at the auction are given three-year deals, but IPL franchises have the option of severing contracts after two years due to performance concerns or injury.         
	We want to manage his career so he can continue to play on at the elite level for six, seven or eight more years. We dont want him to be burnt out by overcooking himself. We dont see how that will be aided by playing too much cricket and playing IPL is too much cricket. Its also a long time from home, said Johnsons manager Sam Halvorsen.         
	When hes not playing cricket, hes working extremely hard in the gym to ensure his core strength is right where it needs to be to enable him to bowl the way he bowls, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has categorically instructed the 10 IPL franchises to stay away from getting into any kind of contractual obligations with the uncapped domestic players for the upcoming season of IPL till further notice.         
	It has been learnt that the BCCI is upset that most of the franchisee owners are in talks with uncapped domestic players who wont be up for auctions. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cink, Stricker give US advantage
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cink, Stricker give US advantage
                      
	Newport: Steve Stricker and Stewart Cink led the way as the US opened up a 6-4 advantage over Europe, after the second session of the 38th Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor, on Saturday.         
	After winning the rain-delayed opening fourballs 2 1/2 - 1 1/2 in the morning, the holders took the afternoon foursomes 3 1/2 - 2 1/2 on a typical day of fluctuating fortunes in the biennial team event.         
	Strongman Stricker played the anchor role in his partnership with Tiger Woods, holing a series of long-range putts in their 4 and 3 win over Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez and Swede Peter Hanson.         
	World No. 1 Woods was not quite at his best and left his bunker shot in the sand, when he tried to escape from a greenside trap at the 10th.         
	The victory by Stricker and Woods, who were unbeaten together in four encounters at last years Presidents Cup, maintained their 100 per cent record in this weeks match.         
	Cink produced the days best golf on Friday, as turned his foursomes match around in stunning fashion. He rammed in a 30-foot putt at the 17th.         
	Cink and Matt Kuchar seemed to be up against it in their contest with Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell when US Open champion McDowell arrowed a majestic tee shot to within six feet of the pin at the penultimate hole.

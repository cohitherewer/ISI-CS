	Benguela: Egypt came from behind to make a winning start to the defence of their African Nations Cup as they beat Nigeria 3-1 in the opening Group C match in Benguela on Tuesday.         
	A deflected shot from captain Ahmed Hassan on 54 minutes and a late goal from substitute Mohamed Nagui made sure of the points after the two sides went into halftime level at 1-1.         
	Hassans shot took a wicked deflection off Nigeria defender Taye Taiwo.         
	The diminutive midfielder had earlier started the Egyptian comeback with a defence splitting pass that allowed Emad Moteab to round the goalkeeper and score a 34th minute equaliser.         
	Naguis 87th minute goal came after another pass through the middle of the Nigeria defence. (Reuters)

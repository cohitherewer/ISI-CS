The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirsten will miss Malinga!
                                                                                                                       7                                        Kirsten will miss Malinga!
    - Team India would like to play against the best, says coach             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Colombo: Gary Kirsten, the Team India coach, wouldve actually liked tormentor Lasith Malinga to play in the second Test, beginning on Monday.         
	Its not a question of us being relieved that Malinga isnt in the Sri Lanka squad... Hes a quality bowler and I wouldve liked him to be there. We do have a point to prove and would prefer to play against the best 11, Kirsten told The Telegraph, at the Taj Samudra, on Saturday.         
	He added: We didnt play well in Galle (losing by 10 wickets) and, really, its now up to us to set it right... I know that the rankings issue is there, too.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. have been No.1 since early December last year, but a 0-2 defeat or worse in this three-Test series is going to give that envied position to Kumar Sangakkaras rather hungry team.         
	At the best of times, regaining lost ground in a chota series isnt the easiest of tasks.         
	The Sri Lanka selectors wouldve been tempted to retain Malinga, who was often unplayable in Galle (picking up seven wickets, including a fiver in the second innings), but the quick let it be known that his body wasnt at a 100 per cent for the five-day game.         
	Speaking exclusively, Ranjith Fernando, one of the four selectors, explained: Look, its not that Malinga couldnt have taken the field... But hes only just made a Test comeback, after almost three years, and he alone knows his body best.         
	Fernando, a former wicket-keeper, added: In the circumstances, hes been given a break... Then, dont forget that our priority is the World Cup, which begins next February... Malinga will be a key weapon for us...         
	With Malinga not in the 16, Dilhara Fernando is expected to make a return. Muttiah Muralidharans place should go to Ajantha Mendis. Suraj Randivs name is also doing the rounds, though.         
	As for India, despite going wicketless in Galle, Pragyan Ojha may hold on to the second spinners slot. That senior pro Harbhajan Singh, too, went without a wicket could well work in the left-armers favour.         
	If a change is made, then Amit Mishras there in the squad.         
	While Indias spinners drew a blank, on the same surface, Murali grabbed eight wickets to sign off with 800...         
	Yuvraj Singh, meanwhile, is fit. Hed suffered cramps in the neck and worse during the course of his 52 in the first innings in Galle.         
	I was in considerable pain for two-three days and couldnt even sleep properly. Im fine now, Yuvraj said.

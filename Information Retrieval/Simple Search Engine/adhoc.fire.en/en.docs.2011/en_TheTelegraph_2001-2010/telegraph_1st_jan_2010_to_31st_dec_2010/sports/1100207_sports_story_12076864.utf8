            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The 10 surviving members of the Class of 71, which created history in the West Indies, are set for a reunion, in Mumbai, on March 4.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Sir Garfield Sobers, inarguably the greatest all-round cricketer and the home teams captain then, has agreed to be the chief guest at the reunion.         
	An announcement is expected once all ends have been tied up.         
	Captained by Ajit Wadekar, India defeated the West Indies in their backyard, for the first time, before repeating that feat in England.         
	All within a few months in 1971, the year which also saw the emergence of Sunil Manohar Gavaskar.         
	The 40th year of those achievements, particularly in the West Indies, has begun... Who knows how many may survive by the time the 50th year arrives and, so, the move for a reunion, a well-placed source pointed out.         
	Of the 15 who toured the West Indies, P. Krishnamurthy, M.L.Jaisimha, Eknath Solkar, Dilip Sardesai and Ashok Mankad are no more.         
	The Class of 71 survivors are: Wadekar (who is playing an active role), Gavaskar, Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Salim Durani, Syed Abid Ali, K.Jayantilal, D.Govindraj and the city-based Russi Jeejeebhoy.         
	Apparently, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag have agreed to be present, as special invitees, at the reunion.

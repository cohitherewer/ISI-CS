  - TRI-SERIES 
  -  Mahendra Singh Dhoni plays safe by deciding to field first         INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Man of the Match Virat Kohli with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni after the win over Bangladesh in Dhaka, on Monday. (AFP)                                 
	Dhaka: Virat Kohli has turned into a deft finisher. Displaying amazing calm and composure against Bangladesh on Monday, he carved out what, in the end, looked another facile victory.         
	In scoring his second ODI century, he ensured that Team India went into Wednesdays final with three successive wins.         
	The target of 248 was not intimidating, but most of the top-order batsmen perished to indiscreet shots. Both Dinesh Karthik (34) and Gautam Gambhir (41) failed to capitalise on the hard work and Yuvraj Singh, too, did not last long.         
	But Kohli showed good temperament and immense concentration in carving out useful partnerships with Mahendra Singh Dhoni (32 off 35 balls) and Suresh Raina, to guarantee the six-wicket victory.         
	The youngster has not looked back since scoring his maiden century at the Eden last month. His superb run of scores has given solidity and depth to the middle-order. He followed up his 91 and 71 not out in the tournament with an unbeaten 102 off 95 balls (11x4) on Monday.         
	It was only after crossing 80 that he tried a few flamboyant shots, and was lucky to survive on 83. But by then the victory had been sealed.         
	A near empty stadium and lack of enthusiasm among the locals, despite the home teams participation, were enough to suggest that there was very little at stake for India and Bangladesh in this match.         
	The Indians, though, decided against experimenting, and brought back Ashish Nehra. The move seemed to pay off till Shakib-al Hasan and Mahmudullah stitched a fine 106-run partnership for the sixth wicket.         
	After a maiden from Sudeep Tyagi, who opened the bowling, Bangladesh tried to claw back, but some reckless batting and a freak run out saw them being reduced to 95 for five near the halfway stage.         
	Shakib and Mahmudullah then exposed the inadequacies of the Indian attack as the hosts scored 47 from the batting Powerplay, and 95 from the final ten overs. Eric Simons, no doubt, will have a tough job on hand.         
	The Bangladesh captain contributed a superb 85 off 97 balls that included eight boundaries and a six. Mahmudullah, who played the supporting role to perfection in the initial stages, remained unbeaten on 64. It was mainly because of their efforts that Bangladesh reached 247 for six.         
	A dead rubber always opens up various options, but Dhoni decided against taking any risks. The team composition did raise quite a few eyebrows. This was a chance to try out a few of their reserve players, but the team management decided to play it safe. Unless there is a dramatic turn of events, Rohit Sharma and Ashok Dinda will have to return without playing a single match in the tri-series.         
	This was probably the best opportunity to test the rookie Bengal pacer, who made a decent debut in Twenty20 Internationals, against Sri Lanka last year. For Rohit, it will come as a double blow since he also missed out on playing the Ranji Trophy final against Karnataka.         
	Dhonis decision to field first meant India missed a golden chance to give their bowlers a fair run under lights and the dew, ahead of the final. This was what Kumar Sangakkara did against India Sunday, though with disastrous consequences.         
	Having already booked a berth in the final and with nothing to lose, Dhoni, too, could have tried it out against Bangladesh. The risk involved would have been comparatively low.         
	Not only were the bowlers denied of getting a feel of the trying conditions, the batsmen, too, missed out on a longer knock in the middle.         
	All that hardly mattered as Shakib and Mahmadullah went about their task. Having got a reprieve on 38, the Bangladesh captain took full advantage with a wide repertoire of strokes.         
	There was a perfect scoop off Tyagi that landed near the fine leg ropes, but when he tried a repeat, it led to his downfall. Nehras delivery was a little slower than expected and Dhoni made amends for his earlier mistake.

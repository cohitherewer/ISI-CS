The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Loew backs Spain
                                                                                                                       7                                      Loew backs Spain
                      
	Erasmia: Coach Joachim Loew said Spain are the strongest team Germany have faced at the World Cup and added that the Spaniards were title favourites. Germany take on the European champions in the second semi-final, in Durban, on Wednesday.         
	We have hope that we can win. For me, Spain are the favourites for the title. They have been the most consistent team of the past two or three years and have played at a very high level. Spain have not one Messi, but several Messis who can decide a game, Loew said.         
	Loew was referring to Argentina star Lionel Messi, who was virtually shut out of the game when Germany routed Argentina 4-0 in the quarter finals. Germany also eliminated England 4-1 and have scored the most goals, 13, while displaying perhaps the best football at the tournament.         
	Loew, however, believes Germany can beat any opponent, including a Spain team whose passing game he praised as a model for his own style.         
	Germany lost to Spain 0-1 in the final of the 2008 European Championship.         
	We are not speaking of revenge, that hasnt been on my mind at all. We lost the final in 2008 because we were beaten by the best team of the time, Loew said.         
	Spain will be a tough challenge, Loew said. He added the only way to beat the European champions is to force them into mistakes.         
	They make almost no mistakes but we have to force them into making errors, said Loew, who devised masterful tactics to beat England and Argentina, seizing on the two teams defensive liabilities.         
	Spain are very strong as a unit Both in offence and defence, they have several players who can decide games and tactically they are very good. But at the moment we are capable of beating everyone.         
	Loew said Germanys technical skills allow the team to dominate for the entire game. We always try to be a constant offensive threat and to convince with our skills, Loew said. And Spanish football also places a lot of importance on technical skill. Their passing game is a celebration of football and how easy they make it look is a model for me.         
	Loew said the mood in the team was very good, but not euphoric after their convincing wins against England and Argentina.         
	Germany will be missing Thomas Mueller, one of their two top scorers with four goals, who is suspended. Backup striker Cacau remains questionable with a back problem.         
	The semi-final will feature two of the leading scorers of the tournament, David Villa of Spain with five and Germanys Miroslav Klose with four.         
	Loew said they were too different players to compare, but both have shown great finishing qualities.         
	Klose needs one goal to pull even with Brazils Ronaldo as the top World Cup scorer of all time with 15.           (AGENCIES)

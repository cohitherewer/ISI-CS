	London: Ferrari will carry out tweaks to their Formula One team but not big changes after their failure to win a title this season, president Luca di Montezemolo said, on Sunday.         
	Fernando Alonso ended the year second overall after a strategy error in the final race at Abu Dhabi ended his hopes of a third world championship and crowned Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel instead. The Italian team finished third in the constructors standings.         
	We have very clear targets, the team website quoted Montezemolo as saying. He added, Changes within the team? That is not our philosophy... A few minor adjustments are possible, but no major upheaval.

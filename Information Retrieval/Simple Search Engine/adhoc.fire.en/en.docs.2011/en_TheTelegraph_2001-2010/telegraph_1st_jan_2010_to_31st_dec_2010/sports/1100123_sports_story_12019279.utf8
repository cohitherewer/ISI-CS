	Melbourne: The much-anticipated potential quarter final between the back-from-retirement Belgians dissolved in 52 minutes on Friday at the Australian Open.         
	Thats the time it took for Kim Clijsters to lose, in embarrassing fashion, her third-round match at the seasons first Grand Slam tournament. The 6-0, 6-1 defeat to Nadia Petrova was the worst of Clijsters career and as one-sided as the score indicated. Clijsters lost the first set in just 18 minutes and won only five points in her first seven games.         
	Justine Henin, another Belgian who was inspired to return to the tour following a 20-month absence after Clijsters won last years US Open, had earlier held up her end of the bargain, with some difficulty, in beating Alisa Kleybanova 3-6, 6-5, 6-2. The two Belgians had been on track to meet in the final eight at Melbourne Park.         
	Defending champion Rafael Nadal advanced to the fourth round Friday along with Andy Murray, US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, Andy Roddick and Fernando Gonzalez.         
	Nadal, who beat Roger Federer in last years final, beat Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-4, 6-2, 2-6, 7-5 in a night match. The Spaniard broke Kohlschreibers serve in the 11th game of the fourth set, then held serve to take the match with a forehand winner. In the fourth round, Nadal will play Ivo Karlovic, who beat Ivan Ljubicic 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7).         
	The fifth-seeded Murray, bidding to win his first Grand Slam singles title, beat Florent Serra of France 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 and is one victory away from a potential quarterfinal with Nadal.         
	First, Murray will have to beat American John Isner, winner of the Auckland tournament last week for his first ATP title. The 6-foot-9 Isner continued his strong form by beating 12th-seeded Gael Monfils of France 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5).         
	No. 4 Del Potro beat Florian Mayer of Germany 6-3, 0-6, 6-4, 7-5 and No. 7 Roddick advanced 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (3) over Feliciano Lopez of Spain. Next up for Del Potro is Marin Cilic, who beat Stanislas Wawrinka 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. Second-seeded Dinara Safina, the 2009 finalist, advanced with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Britains Elena Baltacha. She will next play Maria Kirilenko, who beat Italian Roberta Vinci 7-5, 7-6 (4). Former No. 1-ranked Jelena Jankovic was upset 6-2, 6-3 by No. 31 Alona Bondarenko.

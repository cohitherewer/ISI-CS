The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | How the Blues bounced back
                                                                                                                       7                                        How the Blues bounced back

	Harsh words seem to surround John Terry this season  Martin Neill being the latest to launch into an unrestrained attack on him  but the defender revealed that there had been a frank exchange between the Chelsea players following their recent slump.         
	The dispiriting draw against Blackburn Rovers on March 21, five days after the Champions League exit to Inter Milan, prompted a squad meeting in which everyone spoke their mind, Terry said. The Chelsea captain added: We got a few things off our chest. We knew we were disappointing and didnt really show the fight.         
	First and foremost, you have to show that you want it more than them. On that day, Blackburn wanted it more than us. We should have been the team fighting to keep our place at the top of the table and they showed more fight than we did, which was not acceptable.         
	Chelsea can open up a four-point lead over Manchester United in the Premier League title race by beating Bolton on Tuesday.         
	Uniteds 0-0 draw at Blackburn on Sunday gave Chelsea more good news after the Blues reached the FA Cup final by beating Aston Villa 3-0 Saturday. The match against Bolton at Stamford Bridge is one of the five remaining league games for Chelsea, who last won the title in 2006.         
	Chelsea have a dressing room full of strong personalities such as Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba while Terry also named Michael Ballack and Petr Cech as players who are worth their weight in gold in a bad time.         
	Everyone spoke honestly. It is important that we have players who are prepared to speak their minds, Terry said, adding that the management also had their say.         
	The meeting followed another exchange after the defeat to Inter after which it is understood the atmosphere at the training ground was strained. Results were needed. Pressure was building with owner Roman Abramovich frustrated at what he feared would be another campaign of under-achievement. Manager Carlo Ancelotti was particularly under pressure.         
	It also coincided, of course, with Terrys off-field problems in his private life which undoubtedly impacted on how he was playing. Terry accepted that some criticism was justified but bridled at suggestions he was more to blame than others. I read some of the comments, he said, but in a couple of games I understood them. Im my own worst critic. When I have a bad game, I say it, like I did at Everton when I came out publicly and said it was my fault for the two goals (in a 2-1 defeat).         
	But other than that, I didnt really see myself playing badly. As a team we werent playing well and subsequently it was my fault.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Straight from the heart, for Kapil

  - Icons Australia trip to accomplish unusual mission       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                 
	Calcutta: Not for the first time, emotions have got the better of Kapil Dev, the first cricket captain from Asia to win a World Cup.    As a result, Kapil will be boarding a flight for Melbourne (via Kuala Lumpur) from New Delhi, on Thursday night, to accomplish an unusual mission: Bring back the ashes of one Pooran Singh, who died in Australia over 63 years ago!  What rsquo;s even more unusual is that Kapil has absolutely no ties with Singh rsquo;s family.  ldquo;Look, I was in Chandigarh last week when I heard about Singh rsquo;s ashes and that they rsquo;d been lying at a funeral parlour in Warrnambool (a three-and-a-half hour drive from Melbourne), thousands of miles away from the land of his birth hellip;  ldquo;That nobody had collected the ashes and fulfilled Singh rsquo;s last wish mdash; their immersion in the Ganges mdash; made me emotional hellip; I thought let me do the needful hellip;  ldquo;I rsquo;ve been touched that an Australian company (Guyett rsquo;s Funerals) has taken care of the ashes, all this while. It rsquo;s quite incredible and I said as much when a radio station interviewed me, from Australia, the other day hellip; One reads and hears about race-related attacks in Australia, but look at this example, rdquo; Kapil told The Telegraph.    Speaking late on Wednesday, Kapil added: ldquo;Singh hailed from a village near Jalandhar, but his family isn rsquo;t that well off hellip; lsquo;Pooran Australiawala rsquo;, I believe, is the name of the deceased rsquo;s house...  ldquo;The radio station offered to find sponsors for my trip, but I declined hellip; I mean, if I rsquo;ve decided to do something as charity, on humanitarian grounds, I don rsquo;t need sponsors hellip;  ldquo;I rsquo;ll be joined by the son of one of Singh rsquo;s brothers hellip; He rsquo;ll be coming from the UK hellip; On learning that he rsquo;s coming, I offered to step aside, but he requested that I go ahead as I rsquo;d taken the initiative...  ldquo;A ceremony is planned for Sunday and I rsquo;ll probably return home immediately after that hellip; I intend handing Singh rsquo;s ashes over to whoever comes from his family (in Punjab) to New Delhi. rdquo;  Kapil, clearly, fits no stereotype. For him, it rsquo;s all dil se.

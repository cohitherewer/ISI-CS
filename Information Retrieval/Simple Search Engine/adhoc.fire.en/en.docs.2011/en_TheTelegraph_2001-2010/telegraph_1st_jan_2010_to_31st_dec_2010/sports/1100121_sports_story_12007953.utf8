The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB alleges betrayal
                                                                                                                       7                                        PCB alleges betrayal
  - IPl snub might further affect Indo-Pak relations, says Butt       
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt has accused the Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi of betraying them after none of the 11 Pakistan players got a buyer in the auction and said he would take up the matter with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Butt told reporters at the Gaddafi stadium that he was very upset with what had transpired at the players auction.         
	I had several discussions with Lalit Modi on the participation of our players in the IPL this year and he had assured me they would get a chance to play in the tournament, Butt said.         
	Now we dont understand what happened because we did everything from our side including getting government clearance to allow our players to be eligible to play in the IPL, he said.         
	Eleven Pakistan cricketers, including their Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi, Sohail Tanvir, Rana Naved and Umar Akmal had registered for the IPL auction but none of the eight IPL franchises bid for them.         
	Butt also said the treatment meted out to Pakistani cricketers during the auction could have a bearing on the normal Indo-Pak cricket relations.         
	We might not have bilateral cricket relations with India at the moment but in future, after this IPL episode, obviously we will prefer to seek government advice and clearance before agreeing to playing against India, Butt said.         
	We saw the IPL as a step towards trying to normalise cricket relations with India. That is why the Board was also keen about the players participation in the IPL. We also had the financial benefits available to the players in mind, he added.         
	Meanwhile, former Pakistan great Javed Miandad has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to take control of Twenty20 tournament.         
	When we call the IPL an ICC approved tournament, it should mean that at least all the Test playing countries will get a substantial representation in the event, Miandad, who is also PCBs director of operations, said.           (PTI)

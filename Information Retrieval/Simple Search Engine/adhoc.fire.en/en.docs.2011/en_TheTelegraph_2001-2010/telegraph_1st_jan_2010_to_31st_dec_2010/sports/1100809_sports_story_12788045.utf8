The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muralis dig at Bedi was well-timed: Atapattu
                                                                                                                       7                                      Muralis dig at Bedi was well-timed: Atapattu
                      
	Colombo: Calling Muttiah Muralidharans outburst against his long-time detractor Bishan Singh Bedi a perfect parting shot, former Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu said that the iconic bowler brilliantly timed his verbal attack on the Indian.         
	Of course, it was with amusement that I read Muralis parting shot at Bedi. It was brilliantly timed too, Atapattu said.         
	He (Murali) has hardly said anything on his way to 800 wickets and when his work was done with a world record tucked under his belt he came out with this quip to Bedi. Who can take him on? Perfect timing of the ball, Atapattu wrote in his column.         
	Muralidharan uncharacteristically attacked Bedi, calling the former Indian captain a controversy monger and an ordinary bowler who would have been hammered by any batsman if he was playing now.         
	The former opening batsman also praised all-rounder Suraj Randiv and hoped that the 25-year-old takes inspiration from Muralidharan to improve his off-spin skills.         
	Randiv had a great start to his career and he should develop something new in his armour like Murali did. He would do well, I am certain, said the cricketer-turned-commentator.         
	Speaking about the just-concluded three-match Test series against India, Atapattu said that the good scores registered by Sri Lankans proved that the countrys batting order is now able to handle a strong pace attack.         
	In the early 80s through to the 90s people had doubts whether the Sri Lankans could play genuine fast bowling.         
	The local fans, as well as those playing, first thought of the strengths of the opposition fast men.         
	Recall when Duleep Mendis and Sunil Wettimuny were felled by the Australians?         
	Atapattu also made a special mention of Thilan Samaraweera and said he had the right temperament for the longer version of the game.           (PTI)

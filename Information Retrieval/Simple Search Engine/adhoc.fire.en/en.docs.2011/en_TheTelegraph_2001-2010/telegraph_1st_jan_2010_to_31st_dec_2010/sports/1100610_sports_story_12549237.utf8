The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BAI, govt head for bitter showdown
                                                                                                                       7                                        BAI, govt head for bitter showdown
  - Azhar cuts short official trip to Europe                     Mohammed Azharuddin                     
	New Delhi: Barely four days before the BAI elections, badmintons long-serving boss V.K. Verma on Wednesday set himself on a collision course with the government by rejecting its financial support and guidelines, saying the body was self-sufficient to run the game in the country.         
	BAI doesnt need to follow the government guidelines because like BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) we are financially self-sufficient and we can run the international calendar without taking a single rupee from the government in future, Verma said from London.         
	By astute marketing we have lined up sponsorships to the amount of Rs 5 to 6 crore and we are self sufficient, he added.         
	Verma, however, said BAI wants to maintain a good relation with the government, like the BCCI, but didnt want any further interference. At loggerheads with the ministry over its upcoming elections, BAI has become the first national sports federation after the BCCI to claim financial self-sufficiency and refuse government aid.         
	The sports ministry had written a letter to Verma on Tuesday dismissing BAIs claim that it is self-sufficient and also quoted figures over the last few financial years to explain its stand.         
	Verma said he has already received letters from 23 out of 28 state units who has registered their protest against the candidature of Mohammed Azharuddin for the presidents post.         
	We are questioning if Azharuddin, who is serving a life ban, can be eligible to contest the elections. We will put to vote his candidature in the AGM on June 13.         
	The entire drama started after Azharuddin announced his candidature for the BAI presidents post in the upcoming elections.         
	Azharuddin, meanwhile, gave a clear indication of his resolve to replace Verma at the helm of BAI when he returned home midway through a Parliamentary trip to Europe.         
	Azharuddin was part of a four-member delegation travelling with vice-president Hamid Ansari for the June 5-11 trip to Czech Republic and Croatia. The former captain, who represents Moradabad in the Lok Sabha, completed the Czech leg of the tour before heading back home Tuesday via Frankfurt to address some pressing issues.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tri-series result not a debacle: Srikkanth 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tri-series result not a debacle: Srikkanth 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The chairman of the senior selection committee Krishnamachari Srikkanth downplayed Indias poor show in the tri-series in Zimbabwe.         
	Talking to newspersons here after the selection of the Indian team for the Asia Cup, Srikkanth said: Yes, we lost and the selection committee takes the responsibility. But, dont call it a debacle or setback.         
	For the Zimbabwe tournament, we wanted to see how some of the youngsters play. How do we test the youngsters if we dont give them a chance to play, Srikkanth asked.         
	Some people have this habit of blaming the selectors when things go wrong but ultimately its the players who go out and play. After the current selection committee took over, India became top-ranked Test team and number two in ODIs in the world. I think as selectors, we made our little contribution, the chief selector said.         
	Dont get carried away by disappointing results in one or two series. If we emerged as top Test team, the process began under the leadership of Sourav Ganguly and then continued with Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble at the helm. Its all about a process, said the former India captain.         
	Asked why Yuvraj Singh was dropped from the team, Srikkanth said This is the best possible side.Im not going to speak about any individual player, he said.         
	 Skipper (MS) Dhoni was present for the meeting and it was a lovely discussion with the captain regarding the selection of the team. I think the captain is also convinced, he said.

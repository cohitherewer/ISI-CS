The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen doubles Australias agony

            Scyld Berry            Kevin Pietersen celebrates his double century, in Adelaide, on Sunday. (AFP)                            
	Adelaide: Only five England batsmen have ever scored a Test double-century in Australia  and three of them happen to be in the current side that is starting to lord it over Australia, with a lead already of 306.         
	Kevin Pietersen added his name to the most distinguished of lists in English cricket, before rain called a halt to his majestic progress at tea time on the third day. By then he had reached 213 off only 296 balls.         
	Alastair Cook had done it in the last Test, at Brisbane, and Paul Collingwood on the last tour, at Adelaide. So in four years three current England batsmen have made a double-hundred, compared with only two others in well over a century before then: Reggie Foster, a double international, and Wally Hammond, who made three separate innings of 200 or more in Australia.         
	This is not just an idle stat, something to carve on the bed-post. These records  substantial ones, which raise the bar  are worth having because they bolster, with reason, the confidence of a side. Pietersen, in the process, went a long way to destroying Australias.         
	To his overnight score of 85 he added 128 runs nothing less than masterfully: making the statement to everyone watching that he, and through him England, had mastered everything that Australias bowlers and fielders and captain could offer.         
	After reaching his 17th Test hundred, Pietersen launched into some strokes of outrageous brilliance. He whipped Doug Bollinger from outside offstump through midwicket then popped him over mid-off. With every over he bowled, Bollinger lost about one kilometre an hour.         
	No England batsmen had hit a six in the series, for all their growing dominance. Pietersen was first to the mark, driving the hapless left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty over long-off.         
	Ever since Andrew Strausss dismissal, England have punched out substantial stands: 173, 175, 101, and 99 so far. Never have Australia been allowed a sniff of getting back into the game.         
	Cook completed his work by staying on the third morning for a further half an hour, seeing off the second new ball and Pietersen into his immense stride. He inside-edged a catch off Ryan Harris, easily the best of Australias bowlers, and was brilliantly caught by Brad Haddin.         
	Cook thus set the new benchmark of 1057 minutes for an England batsman without being dismissed in a Test. The West Indian Shiv Chanderpaul has done four 1000-minute vigils but it is still one of those records worth having.         
	Another one for Cook was scoring 383 Test runs without being dismissed: his unbeaten 235 in Brisbane added to his 148 here. That beat the aforementioned Hammond who held the previous record of 365 runs.         
	Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell made ideal junior partners, even if Collingwood is older in years. They did not try to match Pietersen for majesty but were content to accumulate in his wake, often with fine strokeplay of their own.         
	You would never have guessed that it was Pietersens first Test hundred since March 2009  except from his celebrations. He pushed a single to mid-off, sprinted  oblivious to his cramp  and leapt in the air not once but twice before brandishing his fist at the Barmy Army, gleefully not threateningly. At lunch Pietersen had reached 158, his signature score, but he was hungry enough  after no century for almost two years  to play himself in again and press on.         
	At the afternoon drinks break he cadged half of a banana brought out to the umpires. At tea he looked set to pummel the Australians, even the spirited Harris, into complete submission.

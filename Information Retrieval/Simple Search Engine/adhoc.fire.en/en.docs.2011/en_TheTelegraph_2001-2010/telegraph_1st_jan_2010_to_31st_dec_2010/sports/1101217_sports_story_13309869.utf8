                  Edinson Cavani of Napoli celebrates after scoring the winner against Steaua Bucharest, in an Europa League match, on Wednesday                     
	London: Napoli required an injury-time winner from Uruguay forward Edinson Cavani to beat Steaua Bucharest 1-0 and scrape into the last 32 of the Europa League, on Wednesday, joining two-time winner Sevilla and PAOK Thessaloniki.         
	Napoli needed to win to overtake Steaua and join Liverpool in progressing from Group K. Cavani, one of his countrys stars at this years World Cup, popped up in the third minute of stoppage time to clinch the victory.         
	Sevilla, who won the competition in 2006 and 2007, when they were called the Uefa Cup, drew 2-2 with Borussia Dortmund to seal second place in Group J behind Paris Saint-Germain.         
	PAOK defeated Dinamo Zagreb 1-0 away to beat the Croatian team to the runners-up spot in Group D.         
	Twenty-one sides have now advanced out of the group stage, and defending champions Atletico Madrid will be one of six teams battling for the final three qualifying places, on Thursday. Eight teams join the competition after finishing third in their Champions League groups.         
	Cavani had been denied on two occasions by goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu before he rose to head home Marek Hamsiks corner.         
	There was still enough time for Napoli defender Paolo Cannavaro to be sent off for a second bookable offence, but his team held on in the final seconds to finish three points behind Liverpool.         
	If Cavani hadnt scored, it would have been the first time an Italian club had failed to qualify for the last 32 of the competition.         
	Five-time European Cup champions Liverpool, who had already qualified as group winners, left out most of their first-team regulars in their 0-0 home draw with FC Utrecht.         
	Dortmund, who are top of the German League, had to beat Sevilla to go through and made the perfect start when Shinji Kagawa scored in the fourth minute.         
	Ndri Romaric and Frederic Kanoute found the target within four minutes of each other before the break to put Sevilla 2-1 ahead. And although Neven Subotic levelled in the 49th, Dortmund could not find a winner.         
	PSG drew 1-1 at Karpaty Lviv to go through as group winners.         
	Dinamo, who started the match against PAOK as favourites, needed a win to qualify and piled the pressure on in the first half, with Jorge Sammir coming closest to scoring when he hit the post with a free kick.         
	The Croatian side conceded a goal on the counterattack in the 59th, when Stefanos Athanasiadis played in Dimitris Salpingidis, who shot left-footed low past Ivan Kelava from the edge of the area.         
	Spanish side Villarreal clinched first place with 12 points, thanks to Italy forward Guiseppe Rossis two goals in the 2-1 win at FC Brugge.           (AGENCIES)

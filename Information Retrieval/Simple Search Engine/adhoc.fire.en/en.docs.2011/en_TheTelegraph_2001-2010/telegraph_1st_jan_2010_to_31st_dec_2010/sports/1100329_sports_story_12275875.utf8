The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One-match ban for Sangakkara
                                                                                                                       7                                        One-match ban for Sangakkara
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Sangakkara                           
	There seems to be no end to the Kings XI Punjabs problems. After suffering their fifth loss in six matches to the Kolkata Knight Riders, it was announced on Sunday that they would miss Kumar Sangakkara for their next game against the Mumbai Indians on Tuesday.         
	The Kings XI Punjab captain was banned for one match and fined $50,000 for slow over rate during Saturday nights match in Mohali.         
	At the end of the match, Kings XI Punjab were assessed to be one over behind the required rate after allowances were taken into consideration, an IPL release said.         
	Since it was the Kings XI Punjabs third offence of the season, under the IPLs Code of Conduct relating to minimum over rate offences, captain Kumar Sangakkara was fined $50,000 and each player in the team $20,000. Sangakkara is also banned from playing in the teams next match, a clash against the Mumbai Indians on 30 March, the release added.         
	The losses have also led to other issues cropping up. The cricket fraternity has already taken note of Sangakkaras recent remarks in a TV channel.         
	Yuvraj Singh hasnt delivered, but the Kings XI captain, Sangakkara, is in the same boat. Therefore, his asking predecessor Yuvraj to take more responsibility hasnt really gone down well. How can only one player be asked to shoulder a bigger burden?         
	Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia tried to put things in order saying the decision to replace Yuvraj Singh with Sangakkara as captain has not backfired and that he hopes the team would come up with few wins in the upcoming matches.         
	No, it (captaincy) doesnt make a difference. It is not an issue, Wadia said on Sunday.         
	Even as they are placed last among the eight teams, the sides misery continues as they will now have to pick a new captain for their next match.         
	On the teams performance, Wadia said: The boys are putting in hard effort and despite that if results are not in your favour, what can you do about it...thats life.         
	On foreign players in the team not coming out with any noteworthy performances so far, he said: They may not have performed up to the mark, but they will, I am sure.         
	We just have to relax, have fun together and then if we win, we win, and if we lose, we lose, he said.         
	We have shown in the past (in earlier editions) that we are capable of winning at a stretch. We have won games in a row and thats what we will have to do from our remaining 7/8 games now, he said.         
	Bollywood actress and another co-owner of the team, Preity Zinta, also sounded optimistic.         
	We still have eight games. Everything is not lost yet, said Zinta.

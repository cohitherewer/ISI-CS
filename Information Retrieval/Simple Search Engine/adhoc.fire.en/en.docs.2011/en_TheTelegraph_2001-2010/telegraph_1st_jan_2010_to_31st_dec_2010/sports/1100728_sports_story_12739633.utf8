The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India have Everest   to climb
                                                                                                                       7                                      India have Everest   to climb
    - Jayawardene does one better than Bradman; Sangakkara scores 219           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Colombo: Kumar Sangakkara posted a double hundred, while Mahela Jayawardene came within 26 runs of doing the same. Four Indians, too, returned three-figure performances. Only, their CVs didnt get enhanced.         
	Day II of the second Test, Tuesday, didnt exactly see scintillating cricket at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC), which may well be renamed the Mahela Sports Club, but the batting was exceptional.         
	Often hailed as Sri Lankas Bradman, Jayawardene now has 10 Test hundreds at the pleasing venue, the most at any ground, eclipsing Sir Don Bradmans nine at the MCG. His tally of 100s is 28, one shy of the legendary Australian.         
	Be it Sangakkara or Jayawardene, there were classical drives on both sides of the wicket, runs were also taken square and there was nothing rustic about their lofted shots.         
	At the end of an extended day, India were 95 for no loss, trying to match yet another mammoth total by Sri Lanka  642 for four declared. The hosts are already ahead in the three-match series for the Micromax Cup.         
	Four wickets in two days doesnt speak much about the quality of bowling, nor can such wickets be a great advertisement for Test cricket. Fact, however, is that India are under acute pressure and the weight of 642 is awesome.         
	Its a good position to be in and it definitely feels good to get a double hundred (seventh, incidentally). Im a bit tired, though, Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, told The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra.         
	Resuming on 312 for two, Sri Lanka batted till well into the final session, with the declaration coming on Jayawardenes dismissal. Harbhajan Singh had him caught on 174 (358 minutes, 244 balls, 20x4, 1x6).         
	Sangakkaras was the first wicket, consumed by Virender Sehwag on a blemishless 219 (399 minutes, 335 deliveries, 29x4). By then, he and the vice-captain had added 193, ensuring that India would have an Everest to climb.         
	Both Sangakkara and Jayawardene average 50-plus in Tests and, over the years, have featured in numerous terms-dictating partnerships. For them, then, it was business as usual.         
	Of course, they didnt come anywhere close to their world record 624 for the third-wicket against South Africa, at the SSC itself, four years ago. Actually, thats a record for any wicket.         
	Still, Sangakkara and Jayawardene reduced the visitors to B-grade cricketers. Short on energy, terribly short on ideas.         
	Once Sangakkara departed, Jayawardene took charge and, in the company of another solid bat, Thilan Samaraweera (76 not out), put on 176 for the fourth-wicket.         
	Traditionally, the SSC wicket is at its best, or worst, if youre a bowler, on the second day. It lived up to its reputation.         
	Just once was Jayawardene in trouble, when Mahendra Singh Dhoni failed to stump him at the first attempt, off Harbhajan. He was then on 166 and, by his own admission, very tired.         
	Unlike on the first day, when the momentum faltered late in the afternoon, Sri Lanka kept a fast pace right through. And, so, as many as 145 runs were scored in the first session and 130 in the second.         
	With Sehwag around, trust that to be matched, if not bettered.         
	Indeed, thats how the script unfolded in the last 18 overs of the day. Sehwags unbeaten 64 came off 63 balls, with Indias 95 coming in that many minutes.         
	The day saw 425 runs being scored, which is high even in times of T20.         
	Unless you make silly mistakes, you wont get out... Its a very good wicket for batting... Its rock solid, with nothing in it for us bowlers... We should (ideally) be having wickets where theres competition between bat and ball, is how Pragyan Ojha, one of Indias centurions, put it.         
	Each of the other three specialist bowlers  Harbhajan, Ishant Sharma and Abhimanyu Mithun  too conceded in excess of 100 runs.         
	Thankfully, nobody did a Sangakkara.

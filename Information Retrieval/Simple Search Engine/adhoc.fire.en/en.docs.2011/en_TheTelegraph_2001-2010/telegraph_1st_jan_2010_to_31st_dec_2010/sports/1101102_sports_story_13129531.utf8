	Perth: England spinner Graeme Swann suffered an injury to his right thumb while batting during the teams first full training session in Australia ahead of the Ashes series.         
	Swann applied strapping to his thumb Monday, but an England spokesman said the injury wasnt serious and the 31-year-old Swann remained available for the match against Western Australia state starting Friday.         
	England paceman Stuart Broad also dismissed any concerns surrounding the injury, saying, its just a bit of precautionary strapping, I dont think hes in any trouble at all.         
	The first of five Ashes Tests begins November 25 in Brisbane. England won the last series 2-1 in England last year. (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Canadian Alexandre Despatie, on Tuesday, won his ninth Commonwealth Games diving gold after he and fellow diver Reuben Ross won the mens 3m springboard synchro title.         
	Despatie and Ross had been trailing Australias Matthew Mitcham and Ethan Warren going into the final dive, but they handled the pressure to pull off a stunning inward 3.5 somersault to take the title.         
	Today (Tuesday) proved that nothing is ever over until the end. To pull it off was really satisfying, he said. Despatie, 25, won his first gold in the Commonwealth Games as a 13-year-old, in Kuala Lumpur, and could make it 10 if he wins the 10m platform competition on Wednesday.         
	Only three athletes have ever won 10 gold at the Games. They are Australia swimmers Ian Thorpe, Susie Neill and Leisel Jones. Jones won her 10th gold in New Delhi last week.         
	In athletics, Mark Lewis-Francis rolled back the years, to anchor England to sprint relay victory at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi  six years after he romped over the line to secure Olympic gold for Great Britain.         
	Just as he did in Athens in 2004, Lewis-Francis, 28, received the baton from Marlon Devonish and roared down home straight to continue his careers resurgence, and lead England to a superb gold medal.         
	In fact, England swept the gold medals in the 4x100 relays, winning both the mens and womens races.         
	The mens team of Ryan Scott, Leon Baptiste, Marlon Devonish and Lewis-Francis won in 38.74 seconds, holding off the Jamaican team that was missing top sprinters Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell.         
	In the mens 4x400, Australia took gold in 3:03.30. Kenya was next in 3:03.84 and England won another bronze in 3:03.97.         
	Silas Kiplagat of Kenya won the mens 1,500m in 3:41.78, and teammate James Magut was second in 3:42.27. However, defending champion Nick Willis of New Zealand helped avoid a Kenyan sweep by claiming bronze in 3:42.38.         
	Kenya, however, were able to sweep all the medals in the womens 5,000m, with world champion Vivian Cheruiyot winning in 15:55.12 and world silver medallist Sylvia Kibet next in 15:55.61. Ines Chenonge fell off the pace on the last lap, and took the bronze in 16:02.47. It was the fourth Kenyan medal sweep at the games.         
	Jarrod Bannister of Australia won the mens javelin with a throw of 81.71 meters. Stuart Farquhar of New Zealand was second at 78.15.

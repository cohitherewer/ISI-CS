The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant make mistakes, says Loew
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cant make mistakes, says Loew
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Germany coach Joachim Loew has tried to put an end to the prematch war of words by claiming his team respect their Argentine opponents.         
	Several Germany players criticised Argentina ahead of Saturdays match and Loew said there was freedom of speech in his team. He followed this statement up on Friday by labelling their opponents incredibly aggressive and borderline legal on the field.         
	Loew said Argentina were physical to the limit and that he expected the greatest possible resistance from the South Americans.         
	Recalling the scuffle that broke out after Germany eliminated Argentina on penalties in the quarter final stage four years ago, Loew said there had been no problems during the match.         
	Until the penalties, the match was hard but not unfair or brutal, Loew said.         
	The problems came after the game and thats why well try to win before the penalties this time.         
	Loew praised Diego Maradonas team, commending them for their early tournament form and the potency of their forward line.         
	Just look at their bench, Diego Milito is a reserve and he was one of the top players in Europe. They have a lot of offensive quality and its not only Lionel Messi, Loew said.         
	Of course, we dont have a lack of respect for Argentina. We cant make mistakes, because they are icecold in using every opportunity they get. Well have to defend with discipline and we all have to take part in defending, as well as in attacking.         
	Loew, however, also returned to the subject of Argentine behaviour.         
	Their tackles are borderline legal, he said. They are physical to the limit, its their mentality. It has nothing to do with their real character, they are friendly and warm people. But they are incredibly aggressive on the field and thats one of their strengths.         
	We think highly of them as players and we know well run into the greatest possible resistance.

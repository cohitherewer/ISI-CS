The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1960s: Tackling tough days
                                                                                                                       7                                      1960s: Tackling tough days
                            The triumphant England players take a victory lap at the Wembley after defeating West Germany   in the final of the 1966 World Cup      
	Football nearly lost its way as the beautiful game in the mid 60s. Brazils spectacular success in back-to-back World Cups  1958 and 1962  left many other top soccer nations, especially in Europe, deeply unnerved. Led by Pele and Garrincha, the Brazilians mesmerised the world with their amazing skills and there was hardly any respite for others in the fray.         
	The plot thickened when the teams assembled in England for the 1966 World Cup. A group of European countries, with South Americans Uruguay and Argentina also joining the party, restored to brutal, power football in an attempt to stop the Brazilians.         
	The ploy was successful as Brazil failed to go beyond the group stages but it also put footballs future as a game of skill in great danger. Thankfully, sanity prevailed when the championship shifted to Mexicos high altitude four years later.         
	The plan was clear once Brazil took the field in 1966. In the first match against Bulgaria, the holders won 2-0 but Pele was hacked so badly that he couldnt take the field against Hungary. Brazil lost and were faced with a must-win situation against Portugal but Pele received much the same treatment and the 1-3 loss put Brazil on the early plane home.         
	So incensed was Pele that he threatened to quit international football soon after. He was persuaded to stay on and four years later, he returned to Mexico to help Brazil take the Jules Rimet Trophy home permanently.         
	But 1966 was to be Englands year with the nation willing the Bobby Moores to win. And the hosts did, but not without some controversy as debate still rages over whether Geoff Hursts shot for Englands third goal in the final had actually crossed the line. But Hurst scored again and England won their first and only World Cup with a 4-2 victory over West Germany.         
	While Pele largely remained the face of world football, there were some other stars who dazzled in each edition of the World Cup in the 60s. Garrincha and Amarildo were the heroes in 1962 while Jairzinho shone in 1970.         
	In between was the great Eusebio. The Portuguese couldnt win the Cup but his great deeds confirmed his place in footballs Hall of Fame.         
	THE SWEEPING CHANGE         
	Several great players were to make their presence known during this period but Franz Beckenbauer, who first played the World Cup in 1966, was class apart. Nicknamed the Kaiser, he was equally at home marshalling a defence or leading an attack and introduced a new system in world football.         
	Because of Beckenbauer, West Germany were able to adopt a sweeper system, for he was able to stand in front of the back four to intercept and break up attacks. His magnificent movements on and off the ball meant that he had time to send forward the most telling passes. He was largely responsible for West German successes in international football.               
	MEMORABLE MATCH         
	On June 20, 1970, Brazil and Italy, who had two triumphs each under their belt, battled to win the Jules Rimet Cup for the third time and be entitled to keep it permanently. More than hundred thousand spectators in Mexico were rewarded with some spectacular passing and movement from the Brazilians who dominated right from the start. In the 18th minute Rivelino crossed from the left and Pele rose majestically to head into the goal. Boninsegna equalised for Italy but Brazil just carried on, as they had been, to score thrice more in the second half and earn the right to keep the trophy forever.               
	TRIVIA         
	The Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen four months before the start of the 1966 championship causing huge embarrassment for the organisers. Fortunately, it was found just seven days later, wrapped in a newspaper and discovered at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge by a dog named Pickles.

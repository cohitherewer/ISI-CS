            A STAFF REPORTER            Andy Atkinson at the Eden, on Friday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The Eden got a thumbs up from International Cricket Council (ICC) pitch consultant Andy Atkinson, who was in the city on Friday, for a routine inspection ahead of the 2011 World Cup.         
	However, according to Prabir Mukherjee, chief curator of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), though the ICC had initially wanted three playing pitches at the Eden, only two will be available at the venue for the four World Cup matches.         
	They (ICC) had initially asked for three 22-yard strips But I reasoned with them that two pitches were good enough and a third is not necessary. They agreed with my point of view, and so there will be two pitches at the Eden, said Mukherjee.         
	Speaking on the issue, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: We will follow the ICC guidelines Whatever that says is final.         
	The joint secretary also informed that a separate room for dope-testing was also being constructed as per the ICC norms. Earlier there was a makeshift arrangement for the same.         
	Though Atkinson didnt interact with the media (citing ICC regulations), Chitrak Mitra, who heads the CABs stadium committee, said that the ICC team, which also had Eugene van Vuuren, ICC venue consultant, were satisfied with the renovation work in progress at the Eden.         
	They were surprised to see that within four months, since we began the renovation work, we have progressed so much They were happy with what they saw, Mitra said.         
	Asked if the association was confident about meeting the deadline, Mitra said: The ICC didnt give us a specific deadline We, on our part, had set a goal of completing the work before December 31. We are confident of finishing work by that date. However, even if we are late by 10-odd days, it wont really be a big problem since the tournament starts in February.         
	Mitra further added: We hope to complete the renovation work for the dressing rooms by October 30. We will be hosting two Ranji Trophy matches (against Assam and Mumbai) in Novemeber (as per the ICC guidelines of hosting two games before the Cup).         
	According to Dey, the CAB has to send an update of the renovation work every 15 days to the ICC. We have to keep the ICC informed about the renovation work. For that, every 15 days, we send a report, along with CDs to the ICC headquarters, Dey said.         
	The next inspection, on a bigger scale, by the ICC is scheduled for December 8.

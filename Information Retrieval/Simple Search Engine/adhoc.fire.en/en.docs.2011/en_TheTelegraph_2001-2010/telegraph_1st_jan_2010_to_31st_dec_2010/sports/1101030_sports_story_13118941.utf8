            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA)s board of directors on Friday unanimously confirmed the composition of the National Selection Panel (NSP) with David Boon, Greg Chappell and Jamie Cox joining chairman Andrew Hilditch on the four-member panel, according to a media release.         
	Merv Hughes was squeezed out after the recent appointment of Chappell as the countrys National Talent Manager and with it a role as a selector.         
	After a presentation by Hilditch to the board, it was decided that Merv Hughes would be the one cut from the existing five-man group. The board also reaffirmed its belief in four selectors.

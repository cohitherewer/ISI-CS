            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Spectators at the Kotla would be hoping to watch a sparkling display of batting when the Delhi DareDevils host the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Sunday.         
	Both teams have won five out of their eight matches so far and owe a large part of their success to depth in batting.         
	On paper, the visiting side appear to have the better balanced combination. They have also been strengthened by the addition of Pietersen, who joined the team this week after completing his international engagements.         
	The former England captain made his presence felt almost immediately with a match-winning knock of 66 off 44 deliveries against the Kings XI Punjab on Friday. Another new arrival, New Zealander Ross Taylor, is also likely to figure in the scheme on things on Sunday.         
	The hosts, however, have been bolstered by the arrival of left-arm spinner and New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori. DareDevils bowling coach Eric Simons hinted that the New Zealand captain could be inducted into the team on Sunday.         
	Vettori arrived only 48 hours ago but he could be considered for the match against the Royal Challengers, said Simons. The Bangalore side have one of the best batting line-ups and we have our plans and strategies in place, he said.         
	However, the DareDevils, who won their last two home matches, against the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Rajasthan Royals, have been weakened by the finger injury to their top strike bowler, Dirk Nannes.         
	Going by the trend in the last few matches at the Kotla, the toss could prove to be a vital factor as the pitch tends to get slower in the later stages, making it difficult for batsmen to play their strokes. In the last two matches, the DareDevils won the toss and opted to bat on both occasions.

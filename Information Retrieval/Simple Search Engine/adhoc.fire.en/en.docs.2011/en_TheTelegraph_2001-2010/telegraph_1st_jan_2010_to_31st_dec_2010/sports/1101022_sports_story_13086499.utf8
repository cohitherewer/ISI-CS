                                                                                                                       7                                      India, Lanka are Marshs pick
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: India and Sri Lanka are the hot favourites to win next years World Cup to be held in the subcontinent, according to former Australian wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh.         
	Marsh, who played in the 1975 and 1983 World Cups in England, believes it will be the teams from the subcontinent who will be the ones to watch out for.         
	I think the fact that the tournament is being held in the subcontinent means it will be very difficult for teams like England, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa to win. I would think a team from Asia would be successful, perhaps Sri Lanka, I quite fancy them for the title and of course India, he said.         
	Marsh also said that Australias performance in the one-day Internationals against India and England would give an idea about their chances in the World Cup.         
	I think well get a fair idea of how Australia are going to fair in the World Cup once weve seen the results of the one-day games Australia are playing against India and also against England. Well also get an idea of how England and India are going to fair too with those results, Marsh said.         
	Marsh also spoke on the merits of Tim Paine versus Brad Haddin behind the stumps for Australia: Tim Paine is a more of traditional type of player whereas Brad Haddin with the bat can be as explosive as anyone Ive seen.         
	However I think it will be hard for Brad to claim his place back from Tim, since Tim has been playing so well.         
	[The Telegraph had reported on October 11, during the Australias second Test against India, in Bangalore, that regular keeper Haddin, who recently underwent surgery, isnt assured of an automatic return to the team and that Paines impressive performances in the Test series had bolstered his case.]

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy for Manoj: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      Happy for Manoj: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was all praise for Manoj Tiwary on Sunday. The Kolkata Knight Riders captain said at the press conference that Manoj had set up the victory for them after the bowlers, led by Angelo Mathews, had bowled brilliantly.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The secret of success         
	I dont know the secret of our success... We are playing well in this format of the game and thats what is important. Its important that somebody stands out, thats been happening. Angelo (Mathews) played brilliantly in the last game and today it was Manoj (Tiwary), (Brad) Hodge and Angelo (Mathews) again... Somebody or the other is delivering. Thats very good. Most importantly, we bowled really well today.         
	If the change in the support staff has made the difference         
	Its everyone... The staff, the mindset, the atmosphere... everybody makes a difference in the team. Thats how a cricket team goes. Its about building an atmosphere. The game is about playing freely. You dont have time, you just got to keep playing shots. Thats what we are doing.               
	The combination once the other foreigners arrive         
	I pick players according to form... Four of them are top-class international stars whether its (Brendon) McCullum, (Chris) Gayle, (David) Hussey or (Shane) Bond. We are winning and we will see when they arrive.         
	Manojs innings         
	Hes got the talent. I have always said players like (Cheteshwar) Pujara, Tiwary and (Wriddhiman) Saha are talented. Its a question of giving them opportunities. In this format, the best place to bat is at the top of the order. He played freely, played big shots and set up the game for us. Im so happy for him. Hopefully, he does well right through the tournament. That will be good for him and good for us as well.         
	The difference Wasim Akram has made         
	He is working with the bowlers. The time is very short. We dont get much practice time because we are travelling and playing. But he speaks to them and hopefully, he will be a part of this franchise for many years. Young boys like Ishant (Sharma), (Ashok) Dinda, Varun Aaron, along with Bond and Langeveldt, will get a lot of help as far as bowling is concerned.         
	On how they plan to celebrate         
	First year we had a lot of celebration! The hangover is still there! Hopefully, we will get some more wins and then celebrate.

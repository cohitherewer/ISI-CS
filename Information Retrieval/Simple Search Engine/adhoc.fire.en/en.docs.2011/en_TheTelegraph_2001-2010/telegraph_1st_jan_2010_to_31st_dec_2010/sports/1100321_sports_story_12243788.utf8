The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A dream come true for me: Abhishek
                                                                                                                       7                                        A dream come true for me: Abhishek
  - I dont know why, but Ive always liked the Royals       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhishek Jhunjhunwala in Ahmedabad, on Saturday                                 
	Ahmedabad: Abhishek Jhunjhunwala didnt get a fifty, but his 45 off 36 balls was enough to win him the MoM award against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).         
	The 27-year-old not only top-scored for the second time in four matches (he had a 53 not out against the Delhi DareDevils), but helped the Rajasthan Royals finally open their account in IPL III.         
	Jhunjhunwala spoke to The Telegraph late on Saturday, an hour after a general interaction with the media.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q On a Calcutta boy helping defeat KKR         
	A (Laughs) Its like a dream come true... My first MoM award in the IPL and its against the KKR... It cant get better than this... In fact, this match will always remain special.         
	The emotions involved         
	Plenty of emotions were attached to this match... KKR... Then, playing against my Bengal teammates... It just wasnt any other match... Knowing the opposition so well, I could, of course, plan my innings better.         
	Whether hes disappointed that the Royals took him on board and not KKR         
	I wouldnt say I was, at that point, disappointed... I dont know why, but Ive always liked the Royals. Plus, Warnie (Shane Warne) has been my childhood hero... Being in the same dressing room as him is in itself such a terrific feeling... Ive been given a role... Have been given a responsibility... Im very happy being with the Royals.         
	If Sourav Ganguly and Co. congratulated him         
	Nothing specific... As you know, players of both teams shook hands after the match... A couple of my Bengal teammates did say well done... Thats it.         
	Co-owner Shilpa Shettys reaction         
	She seemed very excited and said very well done... This was, after all, a big match for the Royals... After three defeats in a row, we definitely needed to beat KKR.         
	Whether hes one day looking to play for India         
	Im not looking that far ahead... I first need to be consistent in this IPL... I must also be eligible to play for the country...         
	[Those whove left the ICL will become eligible from June 1.]         
	The influence of Warne and performance coach Jeremy Snapes         
	Huge... Theyve impressed upon me the need to play to my strengths only... I now know my strengths and my weaknesses that much better... Basically, Ive been advised what to do and what not to do. So much of the game is mental... Today, I do know my game.         
	Strengths         
	My body being such, I cant slog! I rely on timing and picking the gaps... Ive been assigned a role, which is to bat for the maximum number of overs, allowing the big hitters to play around me.         
	Role models besides hero Warne         
	Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting...         
	His priority         
	To be consistent... To help the Royals win more matches.         
	Celebrations         
	Theres an IPL party after every match... After that, well have something of our own... An all-Royals affair only!         
	Finally, dedicating the MoM award to...         
	(Laughs) My wife Karishma, who is in London, where I stay when Im not playing in India... Then, my parents (Sumitra, Arun), who have been such a pillar of strength right through my career... Im so thankful to them for their support.

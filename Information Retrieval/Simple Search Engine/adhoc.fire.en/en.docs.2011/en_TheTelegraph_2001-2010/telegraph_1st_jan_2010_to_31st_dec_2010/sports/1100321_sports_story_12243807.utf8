The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings are firm favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                      Super Kings are firm favourites
                      
	Chennai: Kings XI Punjab will have to play out of their skin if they are to upset a rampaging Chennai Super Kings in their own backyard and open their account in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Sunday.         
	The first week could not have been worse for the Kings XI, who lost all their three matches, with the batsmen and the bowlers failing to perform as a unit and largely relying on individual effort.         
	In all the three matches, the Kings XI worked themselves into a position from which they could have won. But they faltered each time. Kumar Sangakkaras men will have to get over the last-minute jitters.         
	The hosts, on the other hand, look well-settled and formidable and are clear favourites.         
	Meanwhile, Mahendra Singh Dhoni could return to action sooner than expected, with the wicketkeeper-batsman likely to take the field against the Mumbai Indians on March 25, Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming said Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA plan   was   Kirstens
                                                                                                                       7                                      SA plan   was   Kirstens
                                  
	Margao: The players might not have told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about skipping the upcoming ODI series against New Zealand to prepare for the South African tour, but coach Gary Kirsten had wanted the team to reach his home country a week in advance.         
	Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said Saturday that no communication was sent from top players to the BCCI desiring to skip the ODI series against New Zealand but it turned out that it was Kirsten who mooted the idea of some senior players going to South Africa in advance.         
	Kirsten, in a letter to BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan a few months ago, had expressed his desire to prepare for the South Africa tour, that immediately follows the home Test and ODI rubber against New Zealand, by allowing the team to reach there a week in advance.         
	I understand the commitments the BCCI has to honour with the FTP and television and I know it is a difficult process for you. I do, however, request your consideration of the proposed schedule for pure cricketing reasons on the basis that it will give us the best chance of success, especially in this very demanding five months of cricket ahead.         
	The extra week that could be created so we can get to South Africa earlier, I believe will be crucial to our chances of success, he said. (PTI)

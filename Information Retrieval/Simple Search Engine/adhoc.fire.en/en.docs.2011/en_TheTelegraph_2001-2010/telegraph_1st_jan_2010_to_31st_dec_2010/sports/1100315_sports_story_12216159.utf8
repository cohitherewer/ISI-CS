The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals hopes rest on Pathan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Royals hopes rest on Pathan
                      
	Ahmedabad: On a high after making a winning start to the Indian Premier League III campaign, title favourites Delhi DareDevils will be looking to carry on their momentum against an unpredictable Rajasthan Royals here on Monday.         
	Semifinalists in the last two editions of the Twenty20 tournament, the DareDevils are desperate to better the mark this time, They began their IPL III campaign in style, beating Kings XI Punjab by five wickets with skipper Gautam Gambhir leading from the front.         
	Taming the Royals, however, would be far from a cakewalk since the Shane Warne-led side, powered by Yusuf Pathans blistering century, nearly pulled off a stunning chase against Mumbai Indians on Saturday.         
	Gambhir, however, can rely on his bowlers who put up an impressive display, restricting Kings XI Punjab to a modest 142. Left-arm pacer Dirk Nannes sparkled with the new ball, while Farvez Mahroof, Pradeep Sangwan, Yo Mahesh, Amit Mishra and Tillekaratne Dilshan proved decent enough to deny Kings XI a big score.         
	On the batting front, Gambhir led from the front with a well compiled 72 while Mithun Manhas and Dinesh Karthik gave him good support at the middle-order.         
	To add to Rajasthans woes, the dangerous trio of Virender Sehwag, Dilshan and AB de Villiers are due for runs, having missed out on the opportunity on Saturday.         
	In contrast, Rajasthan Royals, their batting line-up at least, looks more or less a one man army, completely dependent of Yusuf Pathan.         
	Chasing a mammoth 213, Pathan singlehandedly brought the Royals in sight of a victory with a majestic 37-ball 100-run knock but eventually it was heartbreak for the Shilpa Shetty-owned side as they fell short by just four runs.(PTI)

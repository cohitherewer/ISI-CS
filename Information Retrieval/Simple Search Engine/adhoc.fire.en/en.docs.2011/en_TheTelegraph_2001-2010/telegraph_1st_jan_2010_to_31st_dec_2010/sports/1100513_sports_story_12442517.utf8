The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Game is more important than parties, says Azhar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Game is more important than parties, says Azhar
  - Former cricketers blast Team India for disastrous performance                         
	New Delhi: Former India captains and chief selector criticised Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his boys for the lacklustre show that led to their exit from the World Twenty20.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)               
	Mohammed Azharuddin: If you stay up the whole night, it would affect you. Players should be responsible enough. The game is more important than the parties. Excuses like these cannot be given after you lose. For a player, cricket should come first and everything else is secondary.         
	Sourav Ganguly: You dont expect to go to the World Cup semi-final if you play the way the team has played in the Caribbean. Yuvraj has to look at his game. If he doesnt perform for long periods, the selectors will not play him just on the basis of his reputation. Some of the players have got a lot of opportunities, but have not delivered. They have been around for quite a while and the entire country wants performances from them.         
	Sunil Gavaskar: Indias lack of adaptability has been a disappointment. What is baffling is that even though most batsmen showed a distinct sense of discomfort against the short ball during the World Twenty20 in England last year, they were picked again for an event on even bouncier pitches in the Caribbean. All other teams remember what happened last year and the tactics employed by them against the Indians prove this.         
	Syed Kirmani: There was complete lack of application and concentration from Indian players and they cannot complain of fatigue after crashing out. If the players were tired, they should have told the board that they need rest. I dont want to criticise them just because they failed in a tournament. I think maybe the board should identify some youngsters who will play only T20.         
	Ravi Shastri: Its hard to put a finger on the exact reason but of all the tournaments Dhoni has led India in, it is the most disappointing. At times you can be stubborn and stick to your ideas but he might want to be a little more flexible in future. Only 73 runs were scored in the last 10 overs despite having nine wickets in hand. There is no explanation for that. Tactically Yusuf Pathan should have come up in the batting order. Selectors will have to look for Twenty20 players who can play in all kind of conditions.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar: I guess the Indian players looked jaded and tired as the high pressure, high intensity IPL has taken its toll on them mentally and physically. It was very difficult for them to play with the same intensity in such a big tournament.

	Madrid: Barcelona beat 10-man Athletic Bilbao 3-1 to move ahead of Real Madrid in the Spanish league standings, on Saturday. Madrid were held to 0-0 at Levante, as Valencia went clear at the top of the standings with a 2-0 win at Sporting Gijon.         
	David Villa played a pass from Andres Iniesta on to Seydou Keita, who placed the ball past Gorka Iraizoz in the 54th minute. In the 74th, Xavi Hernandez received the ball on the edge of the area and his shot deflected off a defender into the net. Igor Gabilondo cut the deficit in the 90th for Bilbao, tapping in from close range, then Sergio Busquets shot into the top left corner for Barcas third. The win means Barca is second in the standings on 12 points after five games, a point behind Valencia. Madrid is third on 11 points.         
	Mehmet Topal put Valencia ahead in the seventh minute, rising to head in Manuel Fernandes corner from the left. The second goal came with Roberto Soldado stroking in Juan Manuel Matas cross with his right foot in the 10th.

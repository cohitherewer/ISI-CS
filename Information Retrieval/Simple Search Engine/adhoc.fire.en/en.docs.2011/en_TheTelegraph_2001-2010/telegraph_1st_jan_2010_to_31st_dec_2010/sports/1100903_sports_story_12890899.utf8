The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A narrow victory for Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                      A narrow victory for Pakistan
                      
	Taunton: If anyone was expecting demonstrations from disgruntled Pakistan fans at the teams warm-up match against Somerset on Thursday due to match-fixing allegations, they would have been disappointed.         
	A small gathering of Pakistan supporters among the 4,000-strong crowd at Taunton were quiet and well behaved as their team won by eight runs in their practice match before playing England in two Twenty20 games and five one-day Internationals. Shahzaib Hasans century allowed Pakistan to overcome a difficult start to their innings as Pakistan reached 264 in 47.3 overs.         
	The victory was built on a 169-run stand for the fourth wicket between Hasan and Fawad Alam, who himself fell three short of a century. They came together with Pakistan wobbling at 43 for 3 but hauled their side into a position of strength before Somerset fought back with England Under-19 bowler Lewis Gregory taking 4 for 49 as Pakistan lost their last seven wickets for 53 runs.         
	The Pakistan batting has been prone to collapses all summer and was weakened further by Umar Akmal being ruled out after taking a blow to the face in practice. But the fight showed by the fourth-wicket pair will do the under-fire tourists no end of good ahead of the upcoming limited-overs series against England.         
	Umar Gul and Saeed Ajmal took three wickets each as Somerset were restricted to 256 for nine in 50 overs.         
	Akmal was ruled out of the match after being hit in the nose by a ball during practice. Akmal received medical treatment on the spot after being hit in the nets on Thursday morning. He has a bit of bleeding but nothing is broken, Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed said.         
	Saeed said Akmal, who was replaced for the match by Azhar Ali, would be fit for the T20 and ODI series. (agencies)

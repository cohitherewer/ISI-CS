            A STAFF REPORTER                                
	Calcutta: India may have missed out on a bronze in the Asian Games chess, but there were some good performances by individuals.         
	According to chess-results.com, in the tie-off for the bronze, India were held to a draw by Vietnam.         
	IMs Dronavalli Harika and Tania Sachdev drew on the top two boards while IM Eesha Karwade lost to WGM Nguyen Thi Thanh An.         
	WGM Nisha Mohota outplayed WIM Nguyen Thi Tuong Van to set India for a 3- board tie break blitz match. An agency report Friday wrongly reported that Mohota had lost the match.         
	India, surprisingly, ignored the best blitz player of the team Karwade and fielded S.Meenakshi in her place.         
	The decision probably cost India a bronze as India went down to Vietnam 2-1 in the tie-break blitz with Tania scoring the sole win for India.         
	In the preliminaries, both India and China scored 13 points winning 6 each and drawing amongst themselves.         
	But China were placed first in the preliminaries on account of their better tie-break score of 22 points. India were placed second with tie-break score of 21.5 points.         
	Uzbekistan were placed third with nine points (18.5 on tie-break) while Vietnam made the semi-final with nine points (17 tie-break points).         
	In the semis, India, who had beaten Uzbekistan in the preliminaries, suffered a shock defeat against them 2.5-1.5, while China outclassed Vietnam 3.5-0.5.         
	In the finals, China beat Uzbekistan 2.5-1.5 to take the gold while Uzbekistan settled for the silver.

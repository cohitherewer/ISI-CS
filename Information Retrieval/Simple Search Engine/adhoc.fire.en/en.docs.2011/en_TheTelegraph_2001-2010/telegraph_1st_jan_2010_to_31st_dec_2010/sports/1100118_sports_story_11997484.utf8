The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Very proud, very excited, says Eric Simons 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Very proud, very excited, says Eric Simons 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Chittagong: Eric Simons couldnt have asked for a more stunning first day in office, with the Team India batsmen looking to be in the dressing room rather than battling it out in challenging conditions.         
	They cut a sorry picture.         
	Yet, when The Telegraph spoke to the bowling consultant, on Sunday evening, he was rather enthusiastic: Im very proud and very excited to have come to work with the No.1 Test team...         
	Simons, who coached South Africa for two years from late 2002, will basically act as an observer during the first Test. Hell be much more involved both before and during the second and last match of the series, in Dhaka.         
	Meanwhile, regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and senior pro Harbhajan Singh (who woke up with a stiff neck) expect to recover in two-three days.         
	Speaking exclusively, on Sunday evening, Dhoni said: Im better... The back is responding to treatment... I should be fine in two-three days.         
	Harbhajan, who had to ma ke himself unavailable almost at the last hour, also gave himself the same time frame to recover. I got up not being able to turn my neck to the left... Im a little better and expect to be okay in two-three days.         
	Had Harbhajan been fit, Amit Mishra wouldnt have made a Test comeback.

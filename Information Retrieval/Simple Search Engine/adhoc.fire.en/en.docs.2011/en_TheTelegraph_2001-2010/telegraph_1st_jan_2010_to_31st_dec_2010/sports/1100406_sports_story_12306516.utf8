	New Delhi: After Sunil Chetri, it is Subrata Pauls turn to try his luck in the Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States.         
	According to sources in Pune FC, Indias No.1 goalkeeper is leaving for Canada later this week to appear in the trials for Vancouver Whitecaps FC, a club who are set to play in the MLS. Paul is expected to be there for 10 days.         
	Vancouver Whitecaps are currently part of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF)s second division, but will be playing in the MLS from next season, which starts in December.         
	Paul was supposed to leave for Canada a few days ago, but stayed back because of a groin injury, Pune FC sources said, adding the custodians trials with the Canadian club have been arranged by his agent, Arvind Narayan.         
	Though no official in Pune FC was ready to go on record, sources said Paul decided to go only after he received permission from the club management including coach Derrick Pereira, about leaving the club midway through the I-League.         
	If selected by the Canadian outfit, Paul would return to India to finish the season with Pune FC before joining Vancouver Whitecaps. Salgaocars former American coach Tim Hankinson is also believed to have put in a word in favour of Paul to the Canadian sides team management.

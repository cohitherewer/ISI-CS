The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gerrard loses shirt off his back to Bolt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gerrard loses shirt off his back to Bolt

	Usain Bolt, the worlds fastest man, is such an admirer of Steven Gerrard that he has requested, and received, a signed shirt from the England captain. Gerrard, who says he draws inspiration from watching Bolt, sent the sprinter the top he wore as captain in the friendly with Egypt in March.         
	Usain Bolt is an athlete I really look up to, said Gerrard of the world record holder in the 100m and 200m. As a sprinter hes the man, isnt he? Hes there to be shot at but keeps on winning. It takes some doing to be at the top of your game like he is. Hes a winner, an inspiration, a character and someone I love watching.         
	Id heard he was a big football fan and it was really flattering that he wanted my shirt. Im just disappointed I havent got his pace. Pity hes a Man United fan, though. I was going to ask him to one of our training sessions when hes in England but I might not bother now!         
	Three times an Olympic gold medallist and a promising schoolboy footballer in Jamaica, Bolt  whose world record in the 100m stands at 9.58sec  said: Steven Gerrard is one of my favourite players in the world. Even though Im a big Manchester United fan, I appreciate a great player when I see one.         
	Hes such a powerful footballer, full of energy and scores brilliant goals. Ive always wanted a shirt from him to go in my collection. It will go with ones I have from players like Raul, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Kaka.         
	England have a really good team and, of course, Wayne Rooney is a fantastic striker. The thing with Rooney is he sees the play all the time.         
	When he gets the ball, he doesnt put his head down and just run, he looks up and knows everything that is going on around him.         
	He checks where the defenders are and where his teammates are and goes for the best play. Rooney has been getting better all the time. He took on the big responsibility at United when Cristiano Ronaldo left and in team sports if the main guy leaves, its up to others to say Listen, its my time and thats what hes done.

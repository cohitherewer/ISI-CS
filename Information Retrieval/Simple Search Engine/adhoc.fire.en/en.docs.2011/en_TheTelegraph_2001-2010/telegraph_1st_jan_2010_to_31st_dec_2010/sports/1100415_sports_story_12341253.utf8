                                                                                                                       7                                      KXIP: Yuvi integral part
                      
	Mumbai: Kings XI Punjab Wednesday welcomed Yuvraj Singhs statement that he has no intentions of leaving the team and said the stylish left-hander was an important player who had contributed a lot to the sides performance in all three seasons of the Indian Premier League.         
	Yuvraj is an integral part of Kings XI. We are happy that he would like to stay with us, said chief executive officer Anil Srivatsa in a statement.         
	He is a valuable player and has contributed immensely to the teams performances in all the three seasons of IPL, Srivatsa added.         
	Srivatsas response came in the wake of the flamboyant southpaws clarification that he never wanted to leave Kings XI Punjab and enjoyed playing for the Mohali-based team in the IPL. At no time have I said Ill shift to another team. Ive always enjoyed playing for Kings XI, Yuvraj had said.         
	Yuvrajs clarification came a day after KXIP co-owner Mohit Burman said that the team management could not do much if the player had already decided to part ways.         
	If he has given such a hint, what can I do? Its upto him, a peeved Burman had said.         
	After the season is over, we will speak to him. But at the end of the day, you cannot force people to stay if they dont want to, he said. When time comes, we will discuss the issue with him and arrive at a solution that both are happy about.

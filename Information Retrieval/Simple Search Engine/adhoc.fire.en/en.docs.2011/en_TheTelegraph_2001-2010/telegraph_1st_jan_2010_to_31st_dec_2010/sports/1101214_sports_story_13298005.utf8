            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Looking for an outright win against the Railways in their concluding league match to qualify for the quarter finals of the Ranji Trophy, Bengal had a serious net session at the Karnail Singh Stadium, Monday morning.         
	Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who will be playing this match, is yet to arrive and according to team sources, will join the squad on Tuesday.         
	With 12 points in their kitty, Bengal are placed fifth in Group A. Railways are just one point behind with 11 points and also have a chance to make the last-eight stage.         
	Fresh from their triumph over Delhi in the previous tie, Railways are likely to offer a spinning track to the visitors. Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary is aware of it and even hinted that Bengal might include an extra spinner in the playing 11.         
	I had a look at the Karnail Singh wicket and it is likely to assist the spinners, said Tiwary.         
	I can understand their plan since they have Murali Kartik in the team. We, too, have good spinners and I am hopeful of getting a result from this match. The spinners will definitely play a big role, added the Bengal skipper.         
	Tiwary said he was satisfied with the teams performance so far though they have failed to score an outright win. Except against Mumbai and Assam, we have played well. We could not produce results because we played on dull pitches, he said.

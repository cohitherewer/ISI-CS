	New Delhi: Indian shooting ace Gagan Narang Tuesday said he is ready to participate in the Commonwealth Games after regaining his motivation to represent the country at the October 3-14 event in the capital.         
	Gagan had earlier threatened to pull out of the Delhi Games saying the government has repeatedly ignored him for the countrys highest sports award, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, which the shooter felt he deserves for consistently performing well at the highest level.         
	The change of heart, Gagan said was due to the response from his family and fans who urged him to compete at the Games.         
	An overwhelming response from well-wishers, family and the shooting fraternity has moved me. I have made up my mind to shoot at the Commonwealth Games, Narang was quoted as saying on a shooting website.         
	There is no lack of motivation when you see so many people supporting you I shall start training for the Games shortly, he added.         
	Meanwhile, the Sahara India Pariwar Tuesday felicitated Gagan, Tejaswini Sawant and Asher Noria for winning medals at the 50th ISSF World Shooting Championship in Munich, Germany.         
	Sawant created history by becoming the first woman from India to win a world championship gold medal, in the 50 meter rifle prone event, while Gagan bagged bronze in the 10 meter air rifle to become the first Indian to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics. Noria won gold in mens junior double trap.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya asks tough questions
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dalmiya asks tough questions
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who heads the Cricket Association of Bengal, is understood to have posed some uncomfortable questions relating to the BCCIs earnings from the Indian Premier League during Sundays working committee meeting here.         
	Apparently, Dalmiyas questions were on the distribution to the affiliated units from the earnings out of the IPL.         
	One learns that Dalmiya, who wasnt available for a comment, was told that he will be provided with answers in writing, along with documents, if necessary.         
	That a huge majority of the BCCI units are unhappy with the functioning of the IPL and the behaviour of its suspended chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi, came through when the Mumbai Cricket Association representative, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, raised the issue of the limited role which the associations have been made to play so far.         
	Through a written request, the Rajasthan Cricket Association, which isnt a member of the working committee, has called for a review of the IPLs contracts with the franchisees and the state associations.         
	With so much unhappiness, the working committee decided that, henceforth, the IPL could only negotiate with the concerned association (for example, the MCA in Mumbai) and not with any other institution.         
	Meanwhile, junior cricket in the country is in for a revamp if the suggestions placed are ratified.         
	The inter-schools tournaments have been affected by over-age issues consistently. Therefore it has been suggested that we should go back to the Under-15 and Under-17 tournaments, a source said after the meeting.

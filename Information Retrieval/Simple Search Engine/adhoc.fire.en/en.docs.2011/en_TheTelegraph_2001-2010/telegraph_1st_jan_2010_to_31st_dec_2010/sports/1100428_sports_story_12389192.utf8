The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No fatigue, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      No fatigue, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Tuesday said that the squad, which departed for the West Indies to play in the ICC World T20 Championship from April 30 to 16, would neither be fatigued from playing in the hectic IPL nor find the tournament scheduling problematic.         
	Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten addressed the media before the team boarded the plane for the Caribbean. The coach, like his captain, was not too worried about Indias schedule but agreed that the concern was well founded given the Indian players involvement in the IPL.         
	We have got the schedule and cant do anything about it now, Kirsten said. The Indians may feel the heat of it more because all of them (except Ravindra Jadeja) played in the IPL. But our responsibility is to go out there and ensure we are well prepared. We will do what we can in these circumstances.         
	Preparation would be topmost on a coachs mind before an international event, but here too the South African backed his wards to be ready to take on the best in the world, saying: Every player is aware of what he plans to do and how he wants to set up his game plan. Im sure the players themselves would know the bowlers they would be facing and will try to exploit the potential weaknesses in those individuals. We will do as much work as we can in the limited time available to make sure we are as well prepared.         
	Dhoni is fresh from the IPL triumph and was looking forward to pitting his wits against the worlds best in crickets shortest format. The India captain shared his views on everything from Yuvraj Singhs form to Ravindra Jadejas lack of match practice.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Leading India after winning the IPL with CSK         
	Playing for the country is bigger than playing for an IPL franchise. With the Indian team, we have also the best resources and the best 15 players from the country. So there is no headache in that regard. But still, we have to be more organised. For me, its about planning and giving the best on the field.         
	Prospects         
	If we play to our potential (then) we have a good chance. If one is beaten by the opposition instead of losing the match, its better. If you prepare well and execute your plans but still lose, you can say the opposition was better than you.         
	Opening match against Afghanistan         
	You cant take it easy (versus the Afghans). Most teams are talented and potentially dangerous. Whichever team plays its best cricket during those one-and-a-half hours each of batting and bowling will win.         
	Scheduling         
	Sometimes you have to respect the schedule, what is available. What we have are the best possible dates. The IPL finished on April 25 and we have two-three days (between reaching the Caribbean and the first match), which is more than enough. We play throughout the year, so it shouldnt be a problem at all.         
	Fatigue factor         
	This is not the first World T20, and nor is this the first time we are playing a lot of cricket. We are always playing. We have no major injuries and that will definitely help Personally, I am rested and fresh as I missed four matches.         
	The pitches in the West Indies         
	It can play to our advantage. They will be on the slower and flatter side.         
	Yuvraj Singhs form         
	He is a great player, among the best. He is one of the biggest hitters and contributes with the ball as well. He may not have contributed in the IPL but its not a worry. In T20 it just takes 5-10 deliveries to find your way back to form.         
	Jadejas lack of match practice         
	He would be fresh at least. He has been doing well in domestic cricket and I am sure he must have practised hard knowing he is in the World T20 squad.         
	Importance of specialist spinners         
	It depends on what you mean by specialist spinners. Harbhajan Singh, Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja have done well enough to be considered specialist spinners. We have part-timers who have done well for their respective franchises (in the IPL), so thats not a problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania blazes back
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sania blazes back
                  Sania Mirza                     
	Birmingham: Indian tennis star Sania Mirza suggests she may have only two more years on the tour after winning her first match on Monday since her marriage to Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik.         
	Despite twin distractions of a high-profile wedding and a persistent wrist injury, Sania played with remarkable assertiveness to beat rising young Taiwanese Chan Yung-Jan 6-1, 6-4, in the first round of the Aegon Classic.         
	Sania spoke positively about being separated so soon from Shoaib, and for a lengthy period of time.         
	The distance between us is difficult. But we will be together for life hopefully, so two years isnt long, she said.         
	Marriage is something which happens to everyone at some point. Its just whether you want to wait to finish your career or get married now.         
	For me, marriage is personal and tennis is professional. Its two separate things so it doesnt feel like a distraction.         
	Sania said the best she can do with her injury was to contain it, which made the win over Chan  only her second in a mere seven matches all year  in this Wimbledon warm-up event so much sweeter.         
	I was just happy to be competing and happy to be out there and feeling healthy, said the player who became the first Indian woman either to win a WTA Tour title or capture a Grand Slam title (with Mahesh Bhupathi in the Australian Open mixed doubles).         
	When you come back after a long time and win, its good for your confidence.         
	Up until 6-1, 3-0, Sania hardly struck a shot wrong, connecting with the ball as cleanly as though she had never been away from the tour.         
	On the softish grass this enabled her to strike winner after winner, but when she tried to hurry things along her progress slowed.         
	It brought two double faults to cause her to drop her service game, after which Chan, ranked No.83 in the world, began playing more like a player with top 50 ambitions and rallied to 5-4 down.         
	But when it came to closing out the match Sania made no mistake, delivering two solid first serves from 30-all and both times following up with weighty forehand drive winners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL-bound Aussies seek ACA advice
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL-bound Aussies seek ACA advice
                      
	Melbourne: Jittery about the security situation in India, Indian Premier League (IPL)-bound Australian players will meet their Cricketers Association Tuesday to deliberate on whether to compete in the lucrative event next month or give it a miss this year.         
	Batsman Simon Katich and pacer Shaun Tait said they expected to get some clarity on the situation in India after meeting the ACA chief executive Paul Marsh. The ACA has commissioned an independent security assessment from English expert Reg Dickason, who has reportedly found the threats to be credible in his report.         
	Katich, who plays for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL, said he expects the meeting to be a stormy affair as players are bound to differ on what is essentially a commercial event.         
	Its going to be a big decision because obviously there are going to be guys that might think it is fine to go and others who probably dont. But tomorrow (Tuesday) well find out for sure where everyone stands, he said.         
	Its hard to say (what they will decide) at this point, and its hard to say what the other countries are going to decide as well.         
	We, as players, always trust the security advice were given. In the past weve not gone on tours like to Pakistan, and if theres issues with India ... well find out the full extent when the meeting is held in Sydney, Katich added.         
	Tait, who is contracted to Rajasthan Royals, said he wants to play in the event and hoped that security arrangements would be strong enough.         
	The whole situation is a little bit disappointing because I would love to go for the IPL personally and hopefully everything can work out and we can go, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	ACA chief Paul Marsh has already stated that ensuring foolproof security in the IPL, which is spread over many venues, is a difficult proposition.           (PTI)

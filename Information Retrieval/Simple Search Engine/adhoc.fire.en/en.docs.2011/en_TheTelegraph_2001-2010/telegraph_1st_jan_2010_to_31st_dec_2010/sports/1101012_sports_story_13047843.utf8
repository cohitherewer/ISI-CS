            JAYDEEP BASU                                      Osayomi Oludamola      
	New Delhi: The 100m sprint for women in the Commonwealth Games seems to be a jinxed race.         
	Four days after Nigerias Osayomi Oludamola was awarded the gold medal after Sally Pearson of Australia  who had originally finished first  was disqualified for a false start, the Nigerian sprinter failed a dope test.         
	Confirming the news, the president of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), Mike Fennell said on Monday that Osayomi had tested positive for a banned stimulant methylhexaneamine.         
	Interestingly, a dozen Indian sportspersons failed dope tests for the same substance, a month before the Commonwealth Games. They were suspended by the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada), but that was revoked after Wada reclassified the drug. However, not all the athletes were cleared for participation. The next date for their hearing is October 21.         
	If Osayomi, who has been placed under provisional suspension, is stripped off the medal, Saint Vincent and Grenadines Natasah Mayers will take the gold.         
	Katherine Endacott of England, who crossed fourth in the race, but received the bronze medal after the disqualification, would then be moved up to silver and Bertille Delphine Atangana of Cameroon would get bronze.         
	Osayomi, who was notified of the positive result for the A sample, has been asked for the B sample to be tested. She attended the provisional hearing of the CGF court on Monday afternoon. The hearing ruled that the provisional suspension of the athlete would continue until the result of the B sample is received. The B sample result is expected by Wednesday.         
	As far as anti-doping is concerned, we have conducted over 950 tests till date, and we have had results from just over 700, said Fennell.         
	Unfortunately, I have to report to you that we have had a positive result. This result was in relation to the winner of the womens 100m final, Osayomi Oludamola from Nigeria. She has been notified, in accordance with the anti-doping standard that applies to these Games, Fennell said.         
	Any positive test, whether its in a high profile event or not, is something that is very much regretted. We all strive for clean games, clean sport and clean competition. One does not know what sort of damage will accrue because of this particular test. We just want to let everyone know we are very vigilant, added the CGF chief.         
	Wada recently loosened the classification of methylhexaneamine for next year to the specified stimulant list, which covers drugs that are more susceptible to inadvertent use and can carry reduced penalties.         
	Sanctions for use of the drug can be reduced if athletes can prove they did not intend to enhance performance. Penalties can range from a warning to a two-year ban.

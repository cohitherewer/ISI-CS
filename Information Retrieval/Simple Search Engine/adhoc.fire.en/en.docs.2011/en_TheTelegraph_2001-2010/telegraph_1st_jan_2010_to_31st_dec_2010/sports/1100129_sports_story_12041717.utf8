The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mithun is   on top of the world
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mithun is   on top of the world
                            
	Bangalore: An ecstatic Abhimanyu Mithun Thursday described his Test call-up as reward for his hard work, while former players Anil Kumble and Gundappa Viswanath hailed the fiery pacers inclusion in the Indian team.         
	Delighted with the call-up for the Test against South Africa beginning on February 6 in Nagpur, Mithun said: Im feeling really great. I cannot express how I feel, Mithun said from Indore.         
	The opportunity to play for India is a reward for my hard work and performance, said the 20-year-old. Ill continue to work hard and improve my bowling. If I do that, I should be able to live up to peoples expectations, he added.         
	Mithuns selection got the stamp of approval from former India captain Anil Kumble. It is a great reward for a youngster who has performed very well. It is a good opportunity to get a break against a quality side. He should be his usual self and go about bowling the way he has been doing through the season, said Kumble.         
	Kumble was hopeful that Mithun would do well. He has pace and is aggressive. If he continues to bowl as well as he has done in the Ranji Trophy, I am sure he will do well, said Kumble.         
	Praising the national selection committee for picking the youngster, Gundappa Viswanath felt Mithun deserved this break.         
	He deserved the break, said Viswanath. He has been consistently clocking 140-plus. As he gains experience at the top level, he should get quicker. I would advise him to bowl fast while maintaining line and length.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Patience paid off, says Patel
                                                                                                                       7                                      Patience paid off, says Patel
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: Patience pays. So believes Jeetan Patel as the New Zealand spinner came back strong against India on Friday after being plundered for 79 runs on the first day of the opening Test.         
	The off spinner picked up three wickets in Indias first innings and made his Diwali special by depriving Sachin Tendulkar of his 50th Test hundred. It always feels good to get a big scalp like that. He was pushing for his 50th Test hundred. Its always exciting to get Sachin out. I got whacked yesterday (Thursday). We hung in there and it paid for us, Patel said.         
	The Black Caps missed the services of Hamish Bennett, and the pressure was on Patel and Daniel Vettori to make up for the missing quota. But unlike, Thursday, the spinners bowled to a plan and did well to contain the Indian batsmen. Patel explained: We were going through a patch where we were mainly trying to bowl as many dot balls as we could. And it paid off in the end as we got three wickets before lunch.   
	Day ii highlights  
	 When the partnership between Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman added 25, the duo became the eighth Indian pair to post 3,000 runs together. In 59 innings, this pair have now scored 3041, with an average of 54.30, including 8 hundreds and 16 fifties.  
	 Tendulkar by failing to reach a fifty in the first innings missed an opportunity of equalling a Test record of 11 consecutive fifties in as many matches. He would have equalled the record of 11 fifties in 11 matches by West Indian Viv Richards and fellow Indians Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag. Tendulkar, though, can still equal and go past this tally if he manages to score a fifty-plus score in the second innings of this Test.  
	 Tendulkar was dismissed caught and bowled for the 6th time in his career; the last time being when Andrew Flintoff dismissed him in this manner in Chennai for 37, in December 2008.  
	 Jeetan Patel has now dismissed Tendulkar for the second time in Tests. It may be recalled he had also dismissed Tendulkar for 29 at Napier in 2008-09.   
	 India (487) has now posted 400-plus totals in their first innings in the last 5 consecutive Test matches.  
	 Harbhajan Singh registered his eighth Test fifty. Co-incidentally his last Test fifty was also scored against the Black Caps (60) at Wellington 2008-09.  
	 Harbhajan (69) registered his highest score in Tests. His previous highest was 66 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, 2001.  
	 When he claimed the wicket of Harbhajan, Daniel Vettori (4/118) claimed his 100th wicket as captain. He thus becomes the only 8th captain to claim 100 or more wickets. He is only the third slow bowler to claim 100 wickets as skipper. The others being Richie Benaud (138 wkts) and Bishan Singh Bedi (106 wkts).

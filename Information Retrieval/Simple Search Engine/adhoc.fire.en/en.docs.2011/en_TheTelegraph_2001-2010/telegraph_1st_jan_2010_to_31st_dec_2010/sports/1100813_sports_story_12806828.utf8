	Toronto: Top-ranked Rafael Nadal survived a marathon first-set tie-breaker before he was finally able to shake off Swiss challenger Stanislas Wawrinka with a 7-6 (12), 6-3 win in the second round of the Rogers Cup.         
	Defending champion Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic had less trouble advancing.         
	Second-seeded Djokovic had a 7-5, 7-5 win over Frances Julien Benneteau and Murray beat Belgiums Xavier Malisse 7-5, 6-2.         
	Nadal, who broke a tiring Wawrinka to go up 3-1 in the second set, said after the match: I had difficult moments, I had moments where I played well.         
	In other second-round matches, No. 6-seeded Nikolay Davydenko had a 7-5, 6-1 win over Italian Fabio Fognini, while Jeremy Chardy of France had an upset 6-7 (7), 7-6 (5), 6-2 win over ninth-seeded Fernando Verdasco.         
	Ukraines Alexandr Dolgopolov ousted No. 12 Mikhail Youzhny 1-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 and Frenchman Michael Llodra beat No. 14 Nicolas Almagro of Spain 7-6 (5), 6-2. David Nalbandian continued his impressive comeback from injury with a 6-3, 6-0 win over Tommy Robredo.         
	Among the Indian players, Mahesh Bhupathi is the lone survivor as Somdev Dev Varman, Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna crashed out of the event. Bhupathi and his Belarusian partner Max Mirnyi, seeded fourth, are into the second round after getting a bye.         
	Somdev entered the singles event as a lucky loser after Fernando Gonzalez pulled out but lost his first round to world number 18 Gael Monfils 6-7 (7) 3-6 after a gallant fight.         
	Third seeded Paes and Czech Lukas Dlouhy, who had got a bye in the first round, lost 1-6 6-7 (6) to French pair of Julien Benneteau and Michael Llodra. Bopanna and his American partner Eric Butorac lost their first round 6-3 3-6 5-10 to Frantisek Cermak of Czech republic and Michal Mertinak of Slovakia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Friendship on Pak lips
                                                                                                                       7                                      Friendship on Pak lips
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Pakistans World Cup hockey team, which arrived in the capital on Monday after a 15-hour bus journey through the Wagah border in Amritsar, is here to extend the hand of friendship to India, their captain Rehan Butt said.         
	Minutes after the four-time champions checked in amid security cover, the Pak skipper said he hoped his teams visit would help bringing the people of the two countries closer.         
	We are here to extend the hand of friendship, said the 30-year-old striker, who was adjudged the best Asian player in 2008.         
	Before we left for India, our Prime Minister told us that we were the sporting ambassadors of the country. We consider this visit very important.         
	Pakistan, who will take on arch-rivals India on the first day of the World Cup on Sunday, at the Major Dhyanchand Stadium, started their bus journey at 4.30 am in the morning and reached Delhi at 7.30 pm.         
	The journey was indeed tiring but we wanted to come by road, said team manager Asif Bajwa, a former international and secretary of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF). This way we could meet common men in Amritsar and other places.         
	We are the first to say that we are satisfied with the security arrangements provided by the Indian government, Bajwa added. Terrorism is a global issue and it is not specific to India and Pakistan. We think India is a safe place to host the World Cup.         
	Asked to comment on the India-Pakistan clash, Butt admitted they are under some pressure.         
	This is a match we are looking forward to play. For being the first match, it has become more important. Our first two matches in the group league are going to be extremely crucial. Frankly, we are here to regain the lost glory of Pakistan hockey. We had a month-long camp for the World Cup and the team is in form. We are confident of winning the Cup this time, Butt said.         
	India and Pakistan are in the same group along with Australia, Spain, England and South Africa. The Australian hockey team also reached the capital in the morning and was immediately taken to the team hotel under strict security.         
	Hockey New Zealand (HNZ) had put the departure of the team on hold in Perth, where they were playing warm-up matches against Australia. They cleared the team for participation in the World Cup on Sunday.         
	Hilary Poole, chief executive of Hockey New Zealand, said: The details we have received have reassured us that the required level of security is in place, therefore we have kept the team in the tournament.         
	Also to arrive were the three-member support staff of the Canada team, including the coach.         
	Alan Brahmst, the Canadian coach, said: The whole team will be coming tomorrow (Tuesday). We are happy with the security. However, its a bit stifling, with so many security personnel around.

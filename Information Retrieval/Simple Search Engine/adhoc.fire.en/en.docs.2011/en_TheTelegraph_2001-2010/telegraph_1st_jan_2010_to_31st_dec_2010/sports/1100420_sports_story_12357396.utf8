The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB face tough test
                                                                                                                       7                                        EB face tough test

	New Delhi: East Bengal have lost all their four matches so far in the AFC Cup and, as they look to buck that trend, the club face a tough challenge in Al Ittihad of Syria in their return leg tie in Aleppo on Tuesday.         
	To reverse the disappointing run seems a tough enough task; what makes their chances seem bleaker is that a team lying at the bottom of group D have decided to travel to Syria with an inexperienced side.         
	At least five key players, including star striker Bhaichung Bhutia, did not take the flight to Syria.         
	Besides Bhaichung, who played for just 15 minutes in their last I-League match after recovering from a hamstring injury, East Bengal are without captain Syed Rahim Nabi, Rennedy Singh, Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Abel Hammond. So ,the onus will be on Yusif Yakubu to score the goals.         
	This was to be expected after East Bengal stumbled out of contention for semi-final places.         
	They also have a local Calcutta league derby against Mohun Bagan on April 24 and coach Philippe de Ridder would not want injuries to any senior players.         
	Moreover, the AFC Cup has not been top priority in De Ridders scheme of things as he feels his side will not be able to do well in the continental tournament due to a lack of experience.         
	East Bengal, though, will be slightly buoyed by the win over Mumbai FC on Tuesday which snapped a six-match winless streak.         
	Al Ittihad, who won the first leg 4-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium, will come hard at East Bengal as they need to win the second led tie to qualify for the next round.         
	The Syrian side, who played in the top-flight AFC Champions League till 2008, are second in group D on eight points with two wins, one draw and one loss in four outings. (PTI)

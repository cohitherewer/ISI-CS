The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar an inspiration   for Ponting
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tendulkar an inspiration   for Ponting
          
	Melbourne: Sachin Tendulkars age-defying stupendous form of late has inspired Australia captain Ricky Ponting who says he wants to continue playing international cricket and score heavily despite turning 36 next month.         
	Ponting, often compared with Tendulkar for the tag of the best batsman in contemporary cricket, said he planned to play into his late 30s and make amends for his recent poor form in the coming years.         
	If I play well through the Ashes and well through the World Cup, then Ill continue to play. I want to play and if theres younger guys out there that I feel Im keeping out of the team, then Ill step aside, Ponting said.         
	Even at my age we can find ways to improve and I think Sachin Tendulkars been a great example of that. I think he (Sachin) made nine international hundreds in the last year at 37 years of age, so hopefully I can do something similar in the coming years, Ponting was quoted as saying by a news agency.         
	Ponting justified missing the third ODI against Sri Lanka on November 7 by saying that reclaiming the Ashes was his top priority.         
	All were trying to do is give ourselves the best chance of winning the Ashes. If Cricket Australia and I and the rest of the team decided it was in my best interest not to play the game, then thats all we can do, he said.         
	Instead of playing the third ODI, Ponting chose to prepare for Tasmanias Sheffield Shield clash against Queensland and said the plans had been in place for quite sometime now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders hope to keep up momentum
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knight Riders hope to keep up momentum
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A capacity crowd at the Kotla is set to witness a royal battle when the Delhi DareDevils take on Sourav Gangulys Kolkata Knight Riders in a crucial Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Monday.         
	A victory for either side would put their IPL campaigns back on track while a defeat would be a kind of a setback that both the teams will be desperate to avoid.         
	Both the Knights and the DareDevils made rousing starts in the eight-team tournament with back-to-back wins in the first two matches only to find themselves losing the next three on the trot.         
	However, both the teams have returned to winning ways with the DareDevils beating the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Knights humbling the Kings XI Punjab.         
	Though both the teams possess a bunch of true entertainers who can liven up the shortest version of the game, the Knight Riders captain, Sourav, who had retired from international cricket one-and-a-half years back, remains the star attraction.         
	We are flooded with requests for tickets for the DareDevils-KKR match, said an official of the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA).         
	All of them want to watch Sourav play. Among Delhi fans, he is still one of the most popular cricketers, the official added.         
	The Knights had no time for net practice on Sunday as the team arrived in the capital, from Chandigarh, in the evening.         
	Led by Sourav, the team members had a jogging and stretching session near the hotel swimming pool before retiring to their respective rooms. Some of the players, however, spend some time in the pool.         
	The spectators on Monday would be hoping to watch some electrifying batting from the Knights Chris Gayle and DareDevils Virender Sehwag.         
	The Knights are likely to replace Mandeep Singh with Cheteshwar Pujara in the playing XI. Also, the possibility of Ishant Sharma playing the match is high. Ishant, who hails from Delhi, would then replace Ashok Dinda.         
	Gayles inclusion has definitely given the Knight Riders a new lease of life.         
	The West Indian was unlucky to get out early against the Kings XI at Mohali, but his 60-ball 75 against the Mumbai Indians was enough of an indication of what he is capable of.         
	But then, on Saturday, it was not Gayle but Manoj Tiwary who provided the necessary firework to help his team register the much-needed victory. He not only struck a fine 47-ball 75 but also took a superb catch to dismiss dangerman Yuvraj Singh during the Kings XI innings.         
	DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd, however, is more concerned about handling Bond.         
	Bond has been very impressive with the new ball, said Shipperd. The match is evenly poised and both the teams can reach the semi-finals, he said.         
	Though the DareDevils management did not reveal whether their injured captain Gautam Gambhir would return on Monday, the home team have batsmen like opener David Warner, AB de Villiers, Tillekaratne Dilshan and newcomer Kedar Jadhav, all of whom have proved their mettle.         
	Yet, Sehwag remains the main player as his terrific knocks of 75 and 74 against the Rajasthan Royals and the Chennai Super Kings respectively, will play on the mind of the opposition.         
	Jadhav also had a good day in office against the Royal Challengers when he hit a quickfire 50 off 29 deliveries.

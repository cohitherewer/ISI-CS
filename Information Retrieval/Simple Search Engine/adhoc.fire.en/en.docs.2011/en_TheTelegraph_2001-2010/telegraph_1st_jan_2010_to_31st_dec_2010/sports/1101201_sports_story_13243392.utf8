            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Jaipur: Former England coach Duncan Fletcher has been appointed consultant by New Zealand Cricket (NZC). He will be with the New Zealand side for the rest of the one-day series against India.         
	Asked how fruitful would be the addition of Fletcher in the coaching staff, captain Daniel Vettori said: Fletcher is here as a consultant. He has lots of experience with international teams and hopefully can add some real value to the team.         
	Coach Mark Greatbatch welcomed Fletchers appointment and said the players need to lift their game in all the departments after a 40-run loss in the first ODI in Guwahati.         
	We have to look to control the game in the middle period (when batting) If we cant control the game, weve got to have parity whether we are batting or bowling, he said.

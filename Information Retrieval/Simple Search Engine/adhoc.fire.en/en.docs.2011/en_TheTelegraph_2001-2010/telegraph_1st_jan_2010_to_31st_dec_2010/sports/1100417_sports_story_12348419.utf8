	Calcutta: Daniel David tripped on the last hurdle, losing the trainers championship but his fellow-professional Vijay Singh, the winner, rated his effort as the last ball victory. It was, however, a dramatic turn of event as Daniel started the day with one-point advantage and he also had some pontential runners to increase his days tally. Luck never favoured him to retain the advantage.           
	The following are the top three in their respective fields:          
	Top three trainers: Vijay Singh (37 winners, 38 seconds), Daniel David (37 wins and 33 seconds), Arti Doctor (26).          
	Top three jockeys: Christopher Alford (42), A. Imran Khan (37), P. Kamlesh (22).          
	Top three apprentice jockeys: Babu Singh (8 wins), B. Mahesh (7), Md Sameer (5).          
	Top three Tipsters: Racing Guide (574 points), The Telegraph (566), The Hindustan Times (557).          
	Horse of the year: Bruckner          
	Horse of the season: Aamar Kaku.

    - Poor day for Indians as jeev, bhullar miss the cut             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Leader Barry Lane of England lines up a putt on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Gurgaon: On a day when most of the top names of Indian golf failed to make the cut in the rain hit Avantha Masters, Calcutta s Rahil Gangjee managed to stay in the top 10 with yet another impressive performance.         
	While Gangjee brought some cheers to the Indian camp with a bogey free three-under to stand eighth at the end of the day two, Englands Barry Lane posted a five-under for a two-day total of 10-under par 134 to take the lead after heavy rain forced play to be abandoned on Friday.         
	Thirty-six players are yet to complete round two and will come back early morning on Saturday to resume play.         
	Also, the cut will be announced and third round draw will be made immediately after the completion of round two on Saturday.         
	Despite Gangjees heroics, it had been a disappointing day for the Indians at the DLF Golf and Country club as only four other Indians  Jyoti Randhawa, Arjun Atwal, Ashok Kumar and Digvijay Singh  could make the cut.         
	Among the big names who fell by the wayside and wont return at the DLF course for the next two days are Jeev Milkha Singh (145), the top-ranked player in the tournament, rising star Gaganjeet Bhullar (145), SSP Chowrasia (145), Gaurav Ghei (146) and Shiv Kapur (145).         
	Gangjee, who was tied third on the opening day, played his back nine first and nailed birdies on the 14th , 18th and seventh holes to stay in contention.         
	I made the right decisions in the course today (Friday), the Calcutta pro said later. I am feeling good even though I was a little nervous initially.         
	My long game looks solid and I am reading the green light, Gangjee added.         
	On the first day, I came here without any expectations But since I had a decent opening round, the expectations were higher.         
	Gangjee said there were some ups and downs on Friday but he chose not be too aggressive.         
	The course is playing well. For the next two days, I am not thinking too ahead. Just one shot at a time is my mantra, he said.         
	Randhawa (139), who was 57th, after the first day, dished out a vastly improved performance to hit a five-under and place himself at the 20th position.         
	He started with a birdie and hit three more later in the day.         
	Randhawa said he was happy to have capitalised on his opportunities on the second day. It was a much better round than it was on the first day. I focused too much on the results during round one, but today (Friday) I just wanted to play to my potential, he added.         
	I putted well and was in a better frame of mind as compared to the first round. I handled the pressure very well in round two. I want to work on my driving now, he said.

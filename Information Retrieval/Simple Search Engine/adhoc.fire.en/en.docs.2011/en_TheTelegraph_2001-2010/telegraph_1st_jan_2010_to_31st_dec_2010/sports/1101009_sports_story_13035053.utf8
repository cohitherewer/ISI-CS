                                                                                                                       7                                      Dola amp; Co. hit bulls eye
  - Mens team of Rahul, Tarundeep and Jayanta settle for bronze       ANSHUMAN ROY                            
	New Delhi: The trophy cabinet at the Baranagar residence of Dola and Rahul Banerjee will have a Commonwealth Games gold medal and bronze medal to show off. Yes! The trio of Dola, Bombayala Devi and Deepika Kumari won the recurve gold  Indias first in Commonwealth Games history  pipping England by a point, at the Yamuna Sports Complex, here on Friday.         
	While it was ecstacy for Dola, for brother Rahul, it was agony. The top seed Indian mens team of Rahul Banerjee, Tarundeep Rai and Jayanta Talukdar were stunned by Australias Matthew Gray, Mat Masonwells and Taylor 211-216 in the semi-finals.         
	The trio, however, made amends in the bronze play-off, beating England 221-218 for a podium finish.         
	The story of the day, however, was the brilliant comeback by the womens team, led by Dola. It was a dream come true. At one point when England were leading by four points we thought we might not be able to do it. But we held our nerves and finally, we had the last laugh, a beaming Dola told The Telegraph.         
	Trailing 151-154 till the third set, the women rode some luck and perfect 10s by Dola and Deepika to pip England 207-206.         
	Dola saluted the crowd and said their vociferous backing might have put the English archers under pressure.         
	I think so. The crowd was amazing and I would like to thank them for the support, she said         
	In the semi-finals, Dola and Company thrashed a fifth seeded Malaysians 213-185. England trio of Naomi Folklard, Amy Oliver and Alison Williamson got the better of Canada 208-200 in the other last-four.         
	Bombayala shot a poor 6 out of 10 to let down the Indian team, who managed 48 at the end of six arrrows in Round One as their opponents took a four-point lead.         
	Down 48-52, India reduced the deficit to one-point as England shot 102 at the end of the second round.         
	In a thrilling third round, both the Indian and English teams shot an identical 52, handing the hosts some advantage as the crowd support created a perfect atmosphere for the home team to go for the final kill.         
	The script went Indias way in the final round, as an otherwise erratic Bombayala did not let down, shooting two 9s, while in-form Dola and Deepika remained consistent.         
	It was Oliver who did a Bombayala, shooting 6 that tilted the match in Indias favour as the crowd began to roar.         
	With the final arrow, Williamson shot an 8, that meant the veteran, Dola, needed a perfect 10 in her last attempt.         
	Dola, who is the only Indian woman to win the World Cup Finals (2007) did not disappoint, shooting the bulls eye to earn Indian womens team the team gold.         
	In the mens semi-finals, the World Cup Stage IV champions Indian team dished out an inconsistent performance as the fifth-ranked Aussies performed better to make the final cut.         
	Rai, who was eliminated in the individual round after a 13th place finish, shot a poor 6 as India trailed 50-56 after the first set of 12 arrows.         
	Rai slowly gained his form as the trios shot matched the Aussies with identical 55s in the second round.         
	But it was not enough as they still trailed England by six points. Rai shot two perfect 10s but this time Banerjee let down with a six in third round, as the Aussie trio settled the issue by over five points.         
	I am feeling bad for not winning the gold. Its very depressing, said Rahul. We should have won the gold.         
	The day however, had its share of chaos with the foreign teams complaining of boisterous crowd. The International Archery Federation (FITA), threatened to stop the sport in the Commonwealth Games unless the boisterous crowd exercised restrain in supporting the home team.         
	Also, allegedly, an English official, miffed with his teams loss in womans recurve event, abused Indian archery head coach Limba Ram.

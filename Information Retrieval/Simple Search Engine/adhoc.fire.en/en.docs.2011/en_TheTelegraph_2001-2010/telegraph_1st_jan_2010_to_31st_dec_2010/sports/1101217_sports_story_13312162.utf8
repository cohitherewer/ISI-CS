	New Delhi: Bengals chances of making the Ranji Trophy quarter finals suffered a jolt on Thursday when the Railways took a 49-run first innings lead with four wickets in hand at the Karnail Singh Stadium.         
	In reply to Bengals first innings score of 201, the hosts batted in a disciplined manner to finish the second day at 250 for six. Twenty-year-old Prashant Awasthi (73) and wicketkeeper batsman Mahesh Rawat (52) top scored for the Railways.         
	To add to their woes, Bengal also lost the services of Arindam Das for the day before the lunch break when the opener injured his left elbow while trying to stop a Awasthi shot at point. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment and returned to the dressing room a couple of hours later.         
	It is only a tissue injury thankfully there is no fracture, said Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman. Das will undergo an MRI later but hopefully he would be able to bat in the second innings, he added.         
	Bengal enjoyed a good pre-lunch session as they were able to restrict the Railways to 90 for three but finally lost the battle against the grit and determination of Awasthi and Rawat. The duo added 81 runs for the fifth wicket to snatch the initiative from the visitors.         
	Bengal were quick to get rid of the two openers with Ranadeb Bose removing Faiz Fazal (7) in the first over and Laxmi Ratan Shukla sending back Shreyas Khanoklar (26) just when the batsman started playing his shots comfortably. It was Shuklas first delivery of the day and Khanoklar played on.         
	Shukla, in fact, had a good day as he also bowled Karan Sharma (13) in the post lunch period after the batsman spent 73 minutes at the wicket playing 67 deliveries. The medium pacer (2/25) should have tried been out for some more overs, but the Bengal skipper Manoj Tiwary thought otherwise.         
	The morning session also saw Bengal removing the Railways captain and experienced Sanjay Bangar after he scored 29 with the help of five fours and one six. Bowling from the pavilion end, Ashok Dinda trapped him leg before. Bengal, at that moment, looked like having a firm grip over the proceedings.         
	Awasthi and Rawat, however, had other ideas. They batted with utmost discipline and never allowed the Bengal bowlers to have the upper hand. At the same time, both batsmen did not hesitate to hit the loose deliveries and played some delightful strokes.         
	Awasthi, playing his fourth-first class match, faced 137 balls and hit seven boundaries before Ires Saxena trapped him leg before. Rawat, a former India A and Rajasthan Royals keeper, scored 52 off 102 deliveries with the help of five hits to the fence.         
	Apart from Shukla, no other Bengal bowler could live up to his reputation. Tiwary, in consultation with former India captain Sourav Ganguly, made several bowling changes but none could really make an impression on Awasthi and Rawat.         
	While Saxena was only able to restrict the batsmen from scoring to some extent, Sourasish Lahiri failed to make any impact.

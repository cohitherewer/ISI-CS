The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ogilvy stays in lead on Day III
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ogilvy stays in lead on Day III
                      
	Sydney: Geoff Ogilvy increased his one-shot overnight lead to five strokes after three rounds at the Australian Open, shooting a five-under-par 67, on Saturday, at The Lakes, to leave most of the field out of contention for his countrys national championship.         
	Ogilvy, the 2006 U.S. Open champion, had a 54-hole total of 16-under 200. Australian Matt Jones, who trailed Ogilvy by a stroke going into the third round, fell off the pace with a 71, one shot better than Australians Greg Chalmers (66) and Alistair Presnell (67), who are tied for third, six back of Ogilvy.         
	John Senden, who won the Australian Open in 2006, was in fifth place after a 70, level with fellow Australian Matthew Griffin, who shot 72, each seven strokes back.         
	Ogilvy, who has won three World Golf Championship titles as well as his 2006 major, has never won the Australian Open. His only pro win Down Under came at the Australian PGA in 2008. He bogeyed the final hole Saturday, a tough par-3.         
	I played so well the past few days, so I guess I cant complain about that, he said. Ive given myself a little bit of room from the field, which is good.         
	However, Ogilvy headed to the practice range after his round, upset with himself for pushing a five-iron right of the 18th green.         
	I would not normally rush to the range, but I wanted to get it out of my head straightaway, Ogilvy said. Even if you shot 59 and you bogeyed the last, you wouldnt be happy. I just wanted to hit a few similar-type shots on the range and get it out of the system.         
	Greg Norman, who shot 70 Saturday and is 13 shots off the lead, said he was no fan of the new, slow undulating greens at The Lakes.         
	Theyre too slow for me, Norman said. Im a fast-green putter and I cant get the right line or the speed with them, so youre always fighting and youve got to hit the ball too hard to really get comfortable.         
	Theyve got so much undulation, they cant get them too much quicker. If you got them any quicker, balls would be rolling into the water and balls rolling off the greens.         
	The 55-year-old Norman said the greens were basically not fit for an Australian Open.         
	Its a problem if youre going to have a golf championship here, Norman said. For the members, its not. For the members, youre going to have to keep them pretty slow for them or theyd never get around here.         
	But obviously someones feeling good with it. Theyre shooting 13-under, but theyre just not my cup of tea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ehsan Mani terms PCB as stubborn
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ehsan Mani terms PCB as stubborn
                      
	Karachi: Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani Tuesday lashed out at the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for taking a stubborn stance when the spot-fixing allegations first came out and said it should have promptly suspended the tainted players.         
	Mani said that the ICC had to take the decision of suspending Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer after the PCB insisted on playing them in the one-day International series in England.         
	The PCB was stubborn after the spot-fixing and betting allegations came to surface and were adamant the players will play the ODI series even after they were named as suspects. The ICC could not tolerate this and suspended them, Mani said.         
	It is unfortunate that the PCB did not realise the gravity of the situation when the allegations first came out. The PCB itself should have first suspended the players, but they did not. ICC had no choice but to step in.         
	To keep the inquiry within its ambit and save itself from further embarrassment, the PCB should have suspended the players and taken up its own investigation. Now, because of its unprofessional and careless attitude, the spot-fixing scandal is out of its control, he said.         
	Meanwhile, former Pakistan coach Richard Pybus has criticised the ICCs anti corruption unit over its inability to act against match-fixers and blamed it for the spot-fixing scandal. I am not sure about it (match-fixing) being wide-spread. I mean this story by the News of the World in England has brought to light the laxity in the way the ICC is administrating in Anti-Corruption and Security Unit, Pybus told a TV Channel here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City bow out of FA Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      City bow out of FA Cup
                      
	London: Big-spending Manchester City look destined to end another season without a trophy after they produced yet another anaemic display to go down 1-3 at Stoke, Ryan Shawcross and Tuncay Sanli scoring extra time goals in their FA Cup fifth-round replay on Wednesday.         
	After a dramatic night of penalties, extra time and a red card Stoke City, along with Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, and, for the first time in 87 years, Championship (second division) Reading, went through to the last eight of the FA Cup.         
	While Tottenham and Villa made it safely with the replay victories, Citys only realistic target now is finishing fourth in the Premier League, which would at least mean qualification for next seasons Champions League.         
	City are lying in fifth place in the league standings and have 15 points to make up on leaders Chelsea but manager Roberto Mancini denied he would be under extra pressure for failing to deliver a trophy at the hugely wealthy club.         
	No, no, absolutely not, he said. Im disappointed because we lost. We had a good chance to go to the next round and the final, but this is football. We must improve.         
	Stoke now face Chelsea in the last eight of footballs oldest club competition as they bid to win the trophy for the first time in their history.         
	In a dramatic game at the Britannia Stadium, Dave Kitson gave Stoke a 79th-minute lead but Craig Bellamy levelled for City two minutes later.         
	City striker Emmanuel Adebayor was sent off before the game went into extra time and Shawcross regained the lead for Stoke, who have twice drawn with City in recent games, in the 95th minute.

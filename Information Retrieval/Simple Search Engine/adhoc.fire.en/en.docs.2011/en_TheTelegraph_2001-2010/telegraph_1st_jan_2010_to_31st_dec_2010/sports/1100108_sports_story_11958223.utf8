            A STAFF REPORTER            Okolie Odafe with Churchill coach Carlos Pareira, at the Mohammedan Sporting ground, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Churchill Brothers could not have asked for a better start to Thursday morning. Early in the day, the team management got a call from the Indian Football Association (IFA) informing them that the I-League match against Mohun Bagan had been postponed by a day and moved to the Barasat Stadium from Salt Lake.         
	That means East Bengals match against Chirag will now be played at the same venue, but on Saturday.         
	The reason? Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid a visit to the city to call on the ailing Jyoti Basu and the police thought it would not be prudent to hold a match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	A lot of VVIPs are coming to the city and the police will be busy with that.         
	The match was postponed due to security concerns, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli said.         
	Battered and bruised by the constant media glare since Tuesdays mid-air fiasco, the match had Churchill looking down the barrel and Bagan fancying their chances. Thus, Thursdays postponement gave rise to contrasting moods in the two camps.         
	If coach Carlos Pareira and skipper Okolie Odafe were happy with an extra day to recuperate, Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra did not mince his words as he blasted IFA.         
	They have postponed the match without a proper reason. In Delhi there are so many VVIPs. If thats the case then Delhi should not be hosting any tournaments, a miffed Mitra said.         
	We are now on an even keel with Bagan. An extra days rest and, whats more, we will be playing on grass, not on the artificial turf. It will be 50-50 on Friday, the venerable Pareira was candid enough, after a practice session at the Mohammedan Sporting ground on Thursday afternoon, their first since landing in the city.         
	Odafe said they world be ready for the battle on Friday.         
	We are fresh and raring to go. Bagan will not have it easy Weve put the hostess slur behind us.         
	Churchill will be missing L. Robert and Nascimento Silveira, while Rowilson Rodrigues is nursing a slight niggle. Pareira, however, said he had enough ammunition at his disposal. We have good bench strength.         
	According to Pareira, Bagans James Singh would be the man to watch out for.         
	He has always been the dangerman. I rate him very highly, he signed off.         
	Some Bagan fans who had no idea that the match had been postponed, turned up at the Salt Lake Stadium only to find an empty stadium.         
	Feeling frustrated the irate fans blocked EM Bypass for around 20 minutes. They cleared the road after police intervention.         
	Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers have cancelled their SpiceJet return tickets and will be flying a different airline back to Goa.         
	After what happened on Tuesday, can we ever fly that airline, a senior player said on Thursday.

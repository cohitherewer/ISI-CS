            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Lajong frontliners S. Tuboi (left) and Anil Gurung, in Guwahati, on Saturday. Picture: Eastern Projections                           
	Guwahati: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder admitted that his side enjoyed a slight advantage over opponents Lajong FC in the summit clash of the 31st Hero Honda Federation Cup Sunday, but reminded that the young team from Shillong will be tough nuts to crack.         
	Lajong are a young side with very strong willpower. We will have to work really hard to overcome them, he said.         
	My main players are also not fully fit and we are still plagued by injuries. For instance, Alvito (DCunha) is yet to be fit for Sundays match.         
	Well have to get him examined in the morning and then only will we be able to say if he will be playing, the Belgian coach said.         
	Alvito had sustained the injury during East Bengals semi-final clash against Mohun Bagan Thursday.         
	Terming soccer as an unpredictable game, De Ridder said: An injury to a player or even a single decision by the referee can change the whole course of a game.         
	Speaking about the opponents, he said: Lajong are a young side with a very good coach. Stanley Rozario has raised the team as a unit and they are playing some good football. I know they will go all out right from the start and so we will have to work very hard if we have to win the title.         
	Star striker Bhaichung Bhutia echoed his coach as he said that Lajong were no less stronger even without their foreign recruits. They are capable of playing a fast and strategic game... And thats dangerous.         
	For Bhaichung, the final has an added motivation as he said: It will be something special for me to win the tournament because I have been in East Bengal teams that have won almost all other major tournaments but never in a team winning the Federation Cup, he said.         
	Asked if there was a chance of complacency creeping in after their impressive 2-0 victory against Bagan, Bhaichung dismissed the possibility saying: I think these are creations of the media because for any team, every game is a new game.         
	There cannot be any question of complacency and if any team becomes complacent, then the result becomes obvious.         
	Lajong coach Rozario, on the other hand, preferred to concentrate more on the final against his former club rather than dwelling on taking his own revenge.         
	Interacting with the media after a practice session Saturday, Rozario, who was unceremoniously sacked by the red and gold brigade last season, said: I would like to first concentrate on the match rather than look for my own revenge.         
	We will miss the services of four main players which is definitely going to be a problem Especially in the defence. But my boys are determined and I am sure they will give a tough fight. They are very confident and their fitness will be our main strength, Rozario said.         
	Speaking about his strategy on the morrow, Rozario said: We have nothing to lose. We will go all out from the very beginning. East Bengal will be here in full force with all their internationals fit and raring to go.         
	When asked if he was worried about East Bengal coach De Ridder, who was present during Lajongs practice, taking a note of his tactics, Rozario said that he was not concerned.         
	First of all they are all familiar of my techniques and coaching because I was with them. They are as professional as we are. I have great respect for players like Bhaichung (Bhutia), as well as their coach De Ridder. So I dont think it is going to affect the game any way, he said.         
	Besides, we did not do anything extraordinary today (Saturday) which would reveal our strategy because I was aware that they were watching us, he added.

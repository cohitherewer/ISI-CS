	Georgetown: Mahela Jayawardene (81, 51 balls, 8x4, 2x6) notched up his career-best score in the shortest format to steer Sri Lanka to a none too impressive 135 for six against New Zealand in the inaugural match of the third edition of World Twenty20 here on Friday.               
	New Zealand were 67 for three after 10 overs. Jesse Ryder scored a 27-ball 42. Ross Taylor (3n..) and Scott Styris (1n..) were at the crease               
	While his teammates struggled to score runs in the slow Providence Stadium wicket, experienced Jayawardenes breezy innings was a classic example of effortless yet sensible hitting.         
	He also shared a crucial 59-run fourth wicket stand with debutant Dinesh Chandimal (29 off 23 balls, 1x4, 1x6) to lay the foundation for the Lanka total.         
	Shane Bond turned out to be the pick of the New Zealand bowlers as he accounted for two Lankan batsmen giving away 35 runs in the process. Opting to bat in the sluggish pitch, the Lankan openers found runs hard to come by.         
	Out-of-form Tillekaratne Dilshans (3 off 19) stay at the crease was a struggle which finally ended with Jacob Oram cleaning him up. The Lankan total was 35.         
	Skipper Kumar Sangakkara too struggled on the slow wicket as he took 11 deliveries to score his four runs before Styris castled him.         
	Jayawardene, however, showed his team-mates how to build an innings on the wicket and in the effort brought up his third T20 half century in just 33 balls.         
	Young Chandimal also blossomed in Jayawardenes company as he hit a four and a six during his 23-ball innings before he was brilliantly caught at the boundary by Ross Taylor off Nathan McCullum. Jayawardene single-handedly shouldered the Sri Lankan innings and hit as many as eight boundaries and two sixes before he was holed up at deep mid-wicket by Nathan McCullum off Tim Southees bowling.

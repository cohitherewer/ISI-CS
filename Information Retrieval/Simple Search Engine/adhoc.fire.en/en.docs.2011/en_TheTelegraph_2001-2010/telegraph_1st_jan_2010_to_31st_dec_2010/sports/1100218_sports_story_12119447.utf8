The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well be able to save match: Kallis
                                                                                                                       7                                      Well be able to save match: Kallis
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis feels they will be able to save the Test match with batsmen like Hashim Amla and Ashwell Prince at the crease and JP Duminy still to come. Kallis feels Thursday would make a hero out of these players.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Lady Luck smiling on Proteas         
	We would have hoped to bat out two days. But definitely, we have been a bit lucky by getting help from rain and bad light.         
	The game plan for the final day         
	We are prepared to bat out the final day. Although we are three down, we would like to take one ball at a time. I think runs are as important as batting out time.         
	The behaviour of the pitch         
	The wicket is still very good. There is turn but not as much as we expect in the subcontinent. Theres not much for the seamers also. It is still pretty good for batting.         
	On tackling Harbhajan Singh         
	Harbhajan is turning the ball but not much. But yes, hes getting a lot of bounce. I feel theres no reason we cant bat out the day.         
	On his dismissal         
	I got out to a good ball. Probably, the cricketing God was not with me. You will get good balls at this level. Some you will keep out and some you will miss.         
	Prince, Duminys off form         
	They are good players and will certainly come good. Tomorrow is the day when they can turn things in the teams favour. Tomorrow is the day which will make heroes.         
	Hashim Amlas dream run in the series         
	He is in fantastic form. I believe when one is in good form, he should try and keep up the good work as long as possible. Hashim is mentally very strong and has powers of concentration. He is someone who knows his limitations very well, and plays to his strengths. His performance is a valuable lesson for cricketers all over the world.         
	The reasons for poor bowling         
	There wasnt much in the wicket. Our guys tried very hard but we must give credit to the Indians for the way they batted.         
	If someone in the South African dressing room will do a rain dance tomorrow         
	(Laughs) I dont think so. We have enough ability to bat out the whole day.

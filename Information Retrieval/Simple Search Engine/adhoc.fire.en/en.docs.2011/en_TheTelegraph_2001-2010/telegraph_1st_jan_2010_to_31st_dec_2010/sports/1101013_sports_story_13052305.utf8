The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Classic final day is on the cards; edge with India 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Classic final day is on the cards; edge with India 
  - Spinners cast a spell on Aussies; Sachin falls for 214       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting en route to his 72 in Bangalore, on Tuesday. Related reports, scorecard, stats: Page 15, 16                                 
	Bangalore: The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is set for a classic finish, an outcome which would surely please the legends whose names are inscribed on the silverware.         
	Indeed, the two most common results  win for one or a draw  are possible on Wednesday, the concluding day of the two-Test series sponsored by Airtel.         
	That both India and Australia would be fancying their chances only adds spice to an already tempting script. Being 0-1 down, the desperate measures must all come from the visitors, though.         
	However, where percentages go, the advantage is with India. Australias lead, after all, is 185 (202 for seven) and the tail may not make an impact.         
	Debutant Peter George, who got the most desired wicket of Sachin Tendulkar as his first at the highest level, said: Well try and make as many as we can in the morning and well be confident about defending it...         
	We learnt a lot from the last Test... A narrow defeat like that (one-wicket, in Mohali) is a learning experience and, hopefully, well be able to turn it around here...         
	In the morning, Australia recovered superbly, restricting Indias first innings lead to just 17. The afternoon, though, saw the hosts regain the initiative through splendid bowling at the Chinnaswamy.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting counterattacked and produced yet another wowing innings (72), but deputy Michael Clarkes fourth failure in as many innings, hurt the team.         
	A poor decision from Ian Gould, which ended Michael Husseys stay, didnt help Australia, but theyve got to introspect on why the consistently good starts from Shane Watson and Simon Katich werent made capital of.         
	The ball was often keeping low and turning viciously. There was swing, too, but more was expected from a team out to square the series.         
	For once, Pragyan Ojha outshone the senior-most spinner, Harbhajan Singh, but both got excellent support from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	That Ojha and Harbhajan struck the right length made the biggest difference.         
	Dhoni also had a hand in Sreesanth getting a wicket. Many felt he ought to have upped the scoring rate in the morning, when Sachin was at the other end, but there were more applauding his keeping, in the afternoon.         
	Georges wicket of Sachin (214 in 547 minutes, off 363 deliveries, 22x4, 2x6) ignited a collapse, more dramatic than a crash on a black day at the bourse. The four remaining wickets fell for as little as nine runs.         
	No wonder Ponting and his men were cock a hoop. The story, however, changed.         
	Even if Australia lose, George will still have fond memories. Why? Because of his debut wicket. I definitely hadnt given up hope... It came down to patience... We had to keep plugging away and keep trusting the plans we had... To get Sachin was great... A shock... I was elated.         
	Sachins 24-carat innings came to an end when, appearing to be tired after over nine hours out in the middle, he chopped the ball on to the stumps. Hed been intending to drive.         
	Footnote: Australias manager, Steve Bernard, whose first tour to India was in 1998, has seen many ups and downs. He told The Telegraph: Were heading for another great finish... Another down-to-the-wire affair... Our boys, let me tell you, are confident.

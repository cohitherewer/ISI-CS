The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Italy have a point to prove
                                                                                                                       7                                        Italy have a point to prove
    - Defending champions face highly-talented Paraguay           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro in Cape Town, on Sunday                                 
	When the World Cup draw was announced in December last year, Group F was widely considered to be the weakest, with Italy, Paraguay, Slovakia and New Zealand. So when Italy square off with Paraguay at Cape Town Stadium on Monday, the match could be between the top two teams in the group.         
	The Italians enter the tournament as defending champions, but manager Marcello Lippi has brought with him an aging side that has plenty of question marks. But Italy insist they have the right mix of youth and experience to successfully defend the Cup.         
	Their preparations have been far from ideal with a defeat to Mexico and a draw with the Swiss, which has seen them come under pressure from the Italian media.         
	In a better display, they beat local team the Guateng All Stars 6-0 in a practice match on Friday with Lippi giving his clearest indication yet of what his starting XI and formation will be. He played what seemed to be his top side for one hour in a 4-3-3 system.         
	The defence comprised Gianluca Zambrotta and Domenico Criscito flanking captain Fabio Cannavaro and Giorgio Chiellini in the centre ahead of Gianluigi Buffon.         
	Andrea Pirlo and Daniele de Rossi were rested due to injuries, Gennaro Gattuso joined Riccardo Montolivo and Claudio Marchisio in midfield with Vincenzo Iaquinta and Simone Pepe either side of Alberto Gilardino up front.         
	The ice-cool Lippi, who delivered a fourth world championship to the country in 2006, is unconcerned about their form, or worries that the squad is too old.         
	Weve got old players but age doesnt mean broken down, it means experience, charisma, he said.         
	Captain Cannavaro, who will retire after the tournament, admitted the defence needed to be at its best to keep out Paraguay.         
	Defence is vital, but that doesnt mean well stay in our own half of the pitch, said the 36-year-old, who is coming off a poor season at Juventus.         
	It means being compact. Well never play an attacking game like Brazil, Portugal or Spain but theyll never be able to defend like us.         
	There are two ways of looking at Italy. The first is that which Lippi is focussing on  that they are the holders, have bags of experience throughout the team and a history and a culture of winning. The other, though, is that they are in crisis with no stars, a squad made up mostly of players unknown outside Italy and a team that is usually less than convincing on the pitch.         
	Paraguay are a typical South American side and we saw how tough Uruguay played France, midfielder Gennaro Gattuso said, referring to Fridays scoreless draw in Group A. They fought for every ball. We realise were going to have to fight for 90 minutes.         
	We really only face South American teams once every four years. You can study all you want but you dont really know a team that well until you see it in front of you, Gattuso said.         
	Paraguay are in great shape having beaten Brazil and Argentina in qualifying. They can no longer be considered minnows having reached their fourth straight finals, with much of the credit given to Argentinian coach Gerardo Martino who has managed to negotiate a delicate transition phase for his team.         
	He has taken a new generation of players under his wing, notably Nelson Haedo Valdez of Borussia Dortmund, Roque Santa Cruz of Manchester City and Oscar Cardozo of Benfica in attack. Their tight and effective defensive unit is marshalled by goalkeeper Justo Villar. Martino is confident his front line can deliver the goals to beat Italy.         
	Now there is so much variety in the attack of Paraguay, who have never had this amount, he told reporters. In the past it has been attacking, but not like now - alongside Haedo (Valdez) and Santa Cruz there is Oscar Cardozo and Lucas Barrios. This is a team that is more complete than Paraguay teams of the past.

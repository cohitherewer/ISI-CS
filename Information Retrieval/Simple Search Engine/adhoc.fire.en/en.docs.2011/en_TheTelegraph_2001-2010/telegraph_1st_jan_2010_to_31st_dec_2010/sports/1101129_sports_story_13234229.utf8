                                                                                                                       7                                      Usha not unhappy with Luka
                                  
	New Delhi: Indian sportspersons, who put up a scintillating show at the just concluded Asian Games, returned here, on Sunday, with fans and supporters giving them a grand welcome.         
	The first batch, including athletes, kabaddi players and basketball players, landed in the evening, at the Indira Gandhi International airport.         
	Indias sprint queen in her days, P. T. Usha lauded Indias performance while talking with the waiting media.         
	I am happy that India produced its best performance at the Asian Games. Athletes really did well, I am happy for that, she said.         
	Asked about her protege Tintu Luka, who won a bronze in 800m run, Usha said, I am not disappointed with Luka not winning gold. Age is on her side, she is quite young. Also she could not give a final kick in the last 100m because of a hamstring problem.         
	Hundred of fans gathered here to welcome the Indian contingent, which registered its best ever performance at the Games, in Guangzhou, by winning a record 64 medals, including 14 gold.         
	The athletes were garlanded when they came out of Terminal 3 amidst deafening sound of drums. The fans also showered rose petals on the players when they made their way out of airport.         
	Indian Olympic Association (IOA) joint secretary Lalit Bhanot, who was also secretary general of the CWG Organising Committee, was among the officials who received the players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yeh banda hain kaun?   asks Akram about Eric 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yeh banda hain kaun?   asks Akram about Eric

	New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram was surprised with the appointment of South African Eric Simons as Indias bowling consultant Wednesday and questioned the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) decision and expressed doubts whether the Protea could give a facelift to their bowling department.         
	Yeh banda hai kaun (Who is this guy)? I never heard of Simons before, Akram said.         
	I read his (Simons) name in the newspapers and was surprised at the choice. I dont know if he possesses any exceptional coaching skill. If he does, then its good for India, Akram told a private sports channel.         
	The BCCI on Monday appointed former South Africa coach Eric Simons as the Indians bowling consultant for the two Tests against Bangladesh and the subsequent home series against South Africa.         
	Akram also feels that such a short-term contract would not do much good to the team, rather the Board should appoint a bowling coach for a minimum tenure of six to eight months.         
	These short stints will certainly not help the players. If I tell a few things to the players for a period of two weeks, then I will have to ensure that they are followed or implemented for some time. Only then a coach will get the desired results, the former left-arm pacer said.         
	I feel a coach should stay with the boys for a minimum period of six to eight months and only then the bowling will improve, Akram added.         
	A former Western Province player, Simons was picked for the national side in 1994 at the age of 32. He has played 23 ODIs and taken 33 wickets but failed to impress with the bat. After retirement, he was appointed as the Western Province coach before he was assigned as the national coach in September 2002.         
	Simons tenure lasted two years until he stepped down in October 2004 after a string of poor show by the national side.         
	Akram was also not impressed with the increasing tendency of engaging foreign coaches and specialists by the countries in sub-continent.         
	I dont understand the fact why do Asian teams employ foreign coaches? And if a South African coach is appointed then why does he bring along a South African guy for the fielding or bowling coachs role, Akram said.         
	Former South Africa opener Gary Kirsten is now the Indian coach while another Protea Paddy Upton is the support staff of the team.         
	A home coach cannot only impart good enough knowledge to the players but can also gel with the players and talk to them in their own language, Akram said.         
	India have been without a bowling coach since October last year after Venkatesh Prasad was sacked.           (PTI)

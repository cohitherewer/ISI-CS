	Ahmedabad: Gary Kirsten feels that one defeat is not good enough to draw conclusion whether India have a good bench strength or not.         
	Its difficult to judge a few players on the basis on one game. I wouldnt like to pass a judgement so soon, the coach said on Saturday.         
	On the current crop of young players Kirsten said: From a batting perspective, yes we can. Because this is the best talent we have as far as batting is concerned. If we talk about bowling, we havent really reached a stage where we have been able to identify the core four or five bowlers we will need in a years time.         
	Its really tough on the youngsters also         
	He had words of praise for debutant Abhimanyu Mithun.

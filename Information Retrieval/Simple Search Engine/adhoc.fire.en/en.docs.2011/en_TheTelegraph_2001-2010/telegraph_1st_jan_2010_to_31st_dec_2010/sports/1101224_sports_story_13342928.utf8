The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mortaza doubtful for Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mortaza doubtful for Cup
                      
	Dhaka: Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafe Mortaza sustained an injury to his right knee during a domestic match, the countrys cricket Board said, putting his 2011 World Cup appearance in doubt.         
	Tests confirmed that Mortaza sustained a tear of his reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the Bangladesh Cricket Board said in a statement Wednesday.         
	After consulting a number of physicians, including Australias David Young, the Board declined to make any predictions on whether the injury would affect Mortazas chances of playing in the World Cup starting in February.         
	The injury-prone bowler returned to international cricket in October, against New Zealand, after he had been ruled out for months due to injuries he sustained during Bangladeshs tour of the West Indies, in July 2009.         
	But he sprained his ankle in the first match against New Zealand and was ruled out of the series again before returning against Zimbabwe, in December. However, a 30-member preliminary squad named by the Board for the World Cup includes Mortaza.         
	But his chances of playing in the showcase event, which will be jointly hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, are slim as generally any injury to the ACL takes months to heal fully.         
	The Boards statement said that Mortaza would rest for 10 days and his condition will be reviewed after three days. (Agencies)

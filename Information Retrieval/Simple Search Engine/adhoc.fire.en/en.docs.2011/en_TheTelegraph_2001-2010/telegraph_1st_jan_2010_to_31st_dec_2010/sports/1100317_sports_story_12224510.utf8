	New Delhi: Almost two-and-a-half months after a one-day International was abandoned at the Kotla because of an unplayable pitch, some of world crickets most extraordinary performers will gather at the same venue on Wednesday for the Indian Premier League match between the Delhi DareDevils and the Mumbai Indians.         
	Both the teams have made thumping starts to the competition and have players who are capable of setting the stands on fire in any form of the game, leave alone the shortest version.         
	If the Delhi side have an array of stars like Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, AB de Villiers and Tillekaratne Dilshan, the team from Mumbai are not far behind with Sachin Tendulkar leading from the front along with Sanath Jayasuriya, Dwayne Bravo, Jean-Paul Duminy, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan.         
	Thankfully, the pitch is unlikely to play the spoilsport this time. While the chief curator of Kotla, Venkat Sundaram assured the pitch would behave fine, Tendulkar said he was happy with the track.         
	It is a good pitch, commented the master blaster after inspecting the wicket. Its a typical Delhi pitch. I believe its a very good track to play on at the moment, he said.         
	The DareDevils assistant coach Eric Simons also agreed with Tendulkar. The pitch looks absolutely fine, he said.         
	Coming back to the match, it is expected to be a cracker of a contest as both the teams are in fine form. The DareDevils have notched two wins on the trot after Sehwag blasted a typical 34-ball 75 against the Rajasthan Royals on Monday in Ahmedabad, while the Mumbai Indians have also beaten the Royals in the only match they had played so far.

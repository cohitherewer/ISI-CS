	Barcelona: Fernando Verdasco and David Ferrer both won Friday to set up an all-Spanish semi-final at the Barcelona Open. Fifth-seeded Verdasco saved seven break chances late in the second set as he held on for a 6-2, 7-6 (4) win over Ernests Gulbis of Latvia, while Ferrer moved a step closer to reaching his third straight final after beating Thomaz Bellucci 6-4, 6-0.         
	Hes (Ferrer) a top tennis player, especially on clay, Verdasco said.         
	Itll be a difficult but nice match. At least one of us will be in the final.         
	Verdasco, who lost Sundays Monte Carlo Masters final to Rafael Nadal, broke Gulbis in the fourth and eighth games to take the first set before starting out 2-0 in the second.         
	But 44th-ranked Gulbis broke back before drawing level.         
	Both players held their serves until the 11th game, when Gulbis failed to convert seven break chances to move ahead. Gulbis threw his racket into the air in frustration after hitting his seventh chance long, and Verdasco finally took the set with a winner at the net.         
	Verdasco led 5-1 in the tiebreaker before clinching it on his second match point after Gulbis hit a backhand wide.         
	Im happy to be in the semi-final for the first time here, said Verdasco, who is 5-3 against Davis Cup teammate Ferrer.         
	The eighth-seeded Ferrer, who lost to five-time champion Nadal in his two final appearances, broke his Brazilian opponent four times to reach the semi-final for a fourth consecutive time.         
	Earlier, world No. 8 Robin Soderling, the highest-ranked player left in the Barcelona Open after a slew of withdrawals, sprinted into the quarter finals with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Spains Feliciano Lopez on Thursday.

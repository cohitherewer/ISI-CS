The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle comes to the party, India set for an early exit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gayle comes to the party, India set for an early exit
    - Bizarre decisions and performances take centre stage           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Bridgetown: Less than 24 hours after coach Gary Kirsten made the point that India had the skills to beat the West Indies, his players used those skills to beat themselves.         
	After the 14-run defeat at the hands of a turbo-charged West Indies, on Sunday, the Indians are only mathematically in with a chance of making the last-four of the World Twenty20.         
	If they stay afloat till Tuesday, then Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. will have to thrash Sri Lanka in St Lucia, that day, and hope for three teams in group F to finish with a win each.         
	That calculation wont come into the picture if Kumar Sangakkaras men beat Australia in the days second match here.         
	Its too much to ask... One needs to play well in such tournaments, accepted Dhoni, who has seen his side play poorly in three ICC competitions on the trot  the 2009 World Twenty20, the last Champions Trophy and this event.         
	The fact is that weve been losing, but I cant place my finger on one... I dont know the exact reason for not doing well, Dhoni added.         
	Dhoni, who captained the Chennai Super Kings to victory in IPL III, didnt blame that tournament for Indias ills. If youre in form, you should look to carry it forward, otherwise, look to get into form...         
	Of course, Dhoni was hard-pressed to justify the retaining of Ravindra Jadeja. Introduced in the 13th over, he conceded 27 in two; during the chase, he was sent at No.9, behind Harbhajan Singh, who isnt a recognised all-rounder.         
	Lest one forget, Jadeja again dropped a catch.         
	The Saurashtra player had been so short on confidence, after Friday, that even a crane wouldnt have lifted it beyond a point. Quite simply, he ought to have been omitted.         
	That Ranganath Vinay Kumar wasnt capped, when the decision had been taken to bowl on a wicket with moisture, was just as baffling.         
	Also, one failed to understand the reluctance, once again, to set a target.         
	Bizarre decisions by the team management and bizarre performances... The perfect recipe for disaster.         
	The West Indies quicks operated from the ends named after Joel Garner and the late Malcolm Marshall and, clearly, were inspired.         
	After Murali Vijay fell to one bowled short by Darren Sammy, vice-captain Gautam Gambhir got an unplayable delivery from Kemar Roach. Actually, he tried everything, yet couldnt get out of the way.         
	The Oval erupted.         
	From then on, it was an uphill task, though Suresh Raina (32) and Dhoni himself (29) did make an attempt to wrest control.         
	With two overs to go, and 32 remaining, Dhoni did fancy his chance, but a direct throw from the deep, by Dwayne Bravo, ran him out.         
	When things arent going your way, nothing will... My run out couldnt have come at a worse time... Thirty two from two overs was tough, but not impossible, Dhoni told The Telegraph.         
	Earlier, capitalising on a mix-up between Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan, captain Chris Gayle scripted a power-packed 98 (66 balls, 5x4, 7x6) to rocket the West Indies to 169 for six.         
	It was a one-man show from the MoM, prompting the legendary Clive Lloyd to quip: When Gayle comes to the party, its time for the others to leave...         
	As this report is being filed, it does seem India will have to do exactly that.

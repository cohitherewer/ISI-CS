                                                                                                                       7                                      Game is over for Kochi
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The drama involving the Kochi Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise finally came to an end on Thursday with the consortium pulling out of the T20 tournament, two days before the deadline expires for the franchise to respond to a termination notice from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The (franchise) owners have written to the BCCI. A final decision will be taken after discussing the matter at the meeting (of the IPL governing council), in Nagpur on Sunday, Rajiv Shukla, BCCI vice-president and a member of the governing council, said.         
	With the BCCI having already decided that there would be eight sides for the next three seasons, fresh bids will thus be invited for the eighth team.         
	In case the Kochi franchise rights are cancelled, there would be a tender and an open bidding process. The dates would be decided soon after a decision is taken on the Kochi issue, a BCCI source said.         
	That could be as soon as in the first week of December. The BCCI had already set the ball rolling for the 2011 season by deciding at its last IPL governing council meeting last week to have the player auction on January 8-9.         
	The tournament is scheduled from April 8 to May 22. The BCCI had issued the consortium, promoted by Rendezvous Sports World Pvt. Ltd (RSWPL), a termination notice on October 27 with a 30-day deadline to register a joint-venture company to manage the franchise as required under the Franchise Agreement.

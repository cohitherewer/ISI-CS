The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer to skip Davis Cup 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer to skip Davis Cup 
                      
	Basel: Roger Federer will skip Switzerlands Davis Cup match in Kazakhstan this weekend to stay fresh for the rest of the season.         
	I need some extra time to relax after the intense weeks in North America so I can finish the year strong, Federer said on his official website on Wednesday.         
	Federer reached the US Open semi-finals, losing in five sets to Novak Djokovic last Saturday  won the Cincinnati Masters, and lost in the Toronto Masters final.         
	Federer is next scheduled to play at the Shanghai Masters starting October 10, then return to Europe for the indoor hardcourt season in Stockholm, his hometown event in Basel, and the Paris Masters.         
	His competitive season ends at the ATP World Tour Finals in London from November 21. Federer cited schedule problems when he missed Switzerlands 4-1 loss in Spain, in the world group, in March.         
	The Swiss had retained their place in the elite 16-nation group last September when Federer won both his singles in a 3-2 victory in Italy.         
	Obviously we would have liked to have Roger with us for this match but we knew also that his participation was uncertain.         
	Switzerland captain Severin Luethi said. They travel to Kazakhstan for the playoffs starting Friday to decide which country will remain in the world group next year. The Swiss team will be led by US Open quarter finalist Stanislas Wawrinka.

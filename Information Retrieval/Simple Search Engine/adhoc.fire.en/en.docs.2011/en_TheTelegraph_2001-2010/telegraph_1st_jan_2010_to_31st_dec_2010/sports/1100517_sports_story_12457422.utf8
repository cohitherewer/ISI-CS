     Ravi Shastri            Consistency is the key in Twenty20 cricket      Challenge yourself in tough situations to enhance mental strength        
	I am a middle-order batsman. How do I make out the difference between a flipper and a top-spinner?              
	(Subhash Bhowmick, Calcutta)              
	Watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand. You will see the forward rotation for a top spinner.    
	I am a right-handed batsman. What does one do to enhance mental strength?              
	(Rony Dutta, 15, Calcutta-20)              
	Build up tremendous self-belief. Thats the key. Also challenge yourself in tough situations.    
	I am a right-arm medium pacer. My line and length often goes haywire and I fail to control swing. Please help.              
	(Apurba Saha, 17, Calcutta)              
	Watch that your head doesnt fall away at the time of delivery. Also, work on the wrist position with your coach.    
	I am a wicket-keeper and have problems in anticipating the ball on the leg side against spinners. Please help.              
	(Soham Saha, 22, Calcutta)              
	Just open up your stance a bit so that you can get a better sight.                
	I am an all-rounder. But after every off-season, I struggle to get back to my rhythm. Why does this happen?  
	(Arnab Guha, 22, Calcutta)              
	Work on your fitness and cardio during the off season.                
	I am a right-handed batsman. What does one do to improve footwork?  
	(S. Dutta, Siliguri)              
	Do a lot of skipping so that you are light on your feet. And, of course, practise against spin in the nets.    
	How can one concentrate better when batting?              
	(Roktim Banerjee, 15, Calcutta-34)              
	Keep talking to yourself and focus on the next ball and dont think too far ahead.    
	I am a right-handed batsman. I have a high backlift and that leads to problems when tackling short-pitched deliveries. Please help.              
	(Tapan Sampath, 19, Calcutta)              
	Adjust your backlift and use the depth of the crease when playing back. It will give more time.    
	I often get bowled when attempting the sweep against a leg spinner. Please help.              
	(R. Mukherjee, 17, Calcutta)  
	You are going too far across with your front leg rather than towards the ball.    
	Whats the yardstick for judging excellence in T20 cricket?              
	(Rabindra Nath Malakar, 60, Calcutta-37)              
	Consistency is the key.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Samba Boys out to hunt Elephants
                                                                                                                       7                                      The Samba Boys out to hunt Elephants
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: Moving around the Soccer City stadium without a valid pass in hand has become a near impossible task in the past 24 hours.         
	The sprawling complex has been turned into a virtual fortress with armed guards posted at every entry point. Even the stadiums media centre has not been spared and the volunteers there have been replaced by South African police with sniffer dogs.         
	Obviously, the organisers are not taking any chances on the eve of the Group of Death humdinger that pits Brazil against Ivory Coast on Sunday. A capacity crowd of more than 90,000 are expected to watch the encounter that is being billed as a clash between the five-time world champions and the pride of Africa.         
	Yet, the spirit was dampened somewhat late on Saturday, when Brazil lodged a protest against Fifas decision to allow Didier Drogba to play with a protective cast around his fractured elbow.         
	In the morning, Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had hinted that Drogba would be in the starting line-up. Late in the evening, during the official media conference, the Brazil officials said they would raise the topic at the technical meeting before the start of the match.         
	When Brazil coach Dunga was asked to comment on the issue, he passed the question on to team doctor Luis Runko. The doctor said the matter would be taken up with the technical committee.         
	We have nothing against the player, Runko said. But if there is any metal object in the protective cast around Drogbas elbow, it could be dangerous for the other players.         
	Brazil are not the only team to protest against the decision to allow Drogba to take the field with his arm in a cast. Even Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz said that Fifa rules had been changed so that Drogba could play with a protective cast while other players are not allowed to wear even a simple string bracelet.         
	Eriksson later said that he wasnt too bothered about Brazils protest. We did not force the decision. It was Fifa which allowed Drogba to play. Had the protective cast been a dangerous one, Fifa would not have let the player play. We will go by their decision, said the coach.         
	Brazil are looking for a win that will be enough for the Latin Americans to advance to the second round with their match against Portugal still in hand.         
	The Elephants, who drew goalless with Portugal in their first match, need to beat Brazil to get into a good position. Even a draw would keep the African teams hopes alive before the meeting against North Korea in their last group match.         
	For Sundays clash, Brazil are hoping that, unlike the North Koreans, Ivory Coast will not play a defensive game.         
	We hope that Ivory Coast will come out playing more offensive football, said Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Its harder for us if a team play thinking only about defending.         
	Brazils worry, however, is not the defensive tactics of the opposition but the form of the talismanic Kaka. After a not-too-impressive performance against North Korea, the playmaker would be expected to leave his injury worries behind and explode into life.         
	For the moment though, it is Robinho who is donning the mantle of the creator. But Kaka has promised to improve as the tournament progresses.         
	I was out for a long time but Im sure that Ill improve as the tournament progresses, said Kaka.         
	As for the Ivory Coast players, they believe a victory over Brazil would be a triumph for African football. Kolo Toure, the Manchester City defender, said even a point against the Samba Boys would start a party back home.         
	Our fans would go crazy. People have a hard life in the Ivory Coast so we need to give them a reason to cheer and smile. Nobody will sleep for days if we get a point. It would bring the country to a complete standstill.         
	Brazil arent unbeatable but they are unbelievably good on the break and can punish you severely. Well have to play like hell to qualify for the next round, Toure said.

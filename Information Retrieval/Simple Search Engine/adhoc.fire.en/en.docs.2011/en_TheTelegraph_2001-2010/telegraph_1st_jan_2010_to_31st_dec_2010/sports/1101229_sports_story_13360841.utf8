                                                                                                                       7                                      Waqar and Afridi raise more doubts   on the trio
                            
	Islamabad: Pakistan Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi and coach Waqar Younis have raised doubts over the role of three suspended cricketers during the controversial Lords Test against England in August.         
	A leading Pakistan daily claimed on Tuesday that Younis  in his statement to the International Cricket Councils Code of Commission  said he was surprised with the no-ball of Mohammed Aamer and told the fast bowler during the break in Punjabi language, what the hell was that.         
	Afridi told the commission when he met the suspended trio Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Aamer in the hotel room, I thought they looked guilty.         
	The final hearing of the three players against the suspension will be heard by an anti-corruption tribunal in Doha next month.         
	The ICC suspended the trio in September after a British tabloid alleged fast bowlers Asif and Aamer bowled predetermined no-balls during the Lords Test and had links with a businessman Mazhar Majeed.         
	Younis told the commission that before Aamer could have responded to his question regarding the no-ball, Butt interrupted from across the dressing room, saying: I told him to do it because the batsman was coming on the front foot. I told him to come forward and bowl him a bouncer.           (AGENCIES)

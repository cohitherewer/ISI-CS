The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chanu stares at a life ban
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chanu stares at a life ban
                      
	New Delhi: Dope tainted weightlifter Sanamacha Chanu was staring at a life ban after her B sample test, conducted by Nada, also turned out to be positive for a banned stimulant.         
	The A sample of Chanu, one of the most successful woman weightlifters in the country, which was taken during the trials for the Commonwealth Games here last month had tested positive for methylhexaneamine.         
	This is the second dope offence for Chanu, a former Asian champion and 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games gold medallist, after her dope flunk at the 2004 Athens Olympics.         
	Chanu was added in the CWG Core Group of lifters in August last year after serving out her two-year ban. She, however, could not make it to the CWG team as she could manage only the third place in a three-woman field in the 53kg category trials here last month, totalling 172kg.         
	Chanus B sample had also come out to be positive for methylhexaneamine. We have sent the notice to Chanu and IWF. We will fix a date for her if she wants to appear before the Nada disciplinary panel, director Rahul Bhatnagar said.         
	The dope flunk came days after IWF completed payment of a hefty $500,000 fine to the international body after its six lifters failed Wada dope tests conducted last September.         
	The countrys lifters were allowed to take part in next months Commonwealth Games here after the CWG OC gave an interest-free loan of Rs 1.75 crore for the IWF to pay the remaining two installments of $500,000 fine by August 31.

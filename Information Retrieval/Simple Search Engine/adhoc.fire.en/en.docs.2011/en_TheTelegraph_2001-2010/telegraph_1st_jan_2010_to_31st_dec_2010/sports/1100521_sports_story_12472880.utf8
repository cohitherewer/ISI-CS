                                                                                                                       7                                      Maradona adds insult to injury
                      
	Buenos Aires: Argentina coach Diego Maradona yelled insults at an injured cameraman after accidentally running over his leg following his World Cup squad announcement.         
	Driving a Mini to a news conference on Wednesday, Maradona was surrounded by newsmen but one was hit and he fell to the ground. According to a witness, Maradonas car then rolled over the lower part of his leg.         
	What an a****** you are, Maradona shouted from the car. How can you put your leg there where it can get run over, man?         
	Fifa mistake         
	Johannesburg: Fifa will change its ticketing system for the next World Cup in Brazil after learning from mistakes made in South Africa, secretary general Jerome Valcke said on Thursday.         
	He had already admitted the ticketing system, based on internet sales, was not suitable for South Africa, where the poor black population who are the countrys biggest football fans do not have access either to the Web or bank accounts.         
	Villar hope         
	Asuncion: Justo Villar will be hoping it is third time lucky when he leads Paraguay out for their opening Group F match against Italy in Cape Town on June 14. The Real Valladolid goalkeeper, Paraguays captain, has played a mere eight minutes in two previous finals.         
	He did not expect to play in Asia in 2002 although he was part of Paraguays squad. He made his debut against England in 2006 but after only eight minutes suffered an injury that put him out for the rest of the tournament.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Syrias Al Ittihad beat East Bengal 2-1 in an AFC Cup group H league match at the Aleppo International Stadium on Tuesday. According to information received here, the Syrian club went ahead after 14 minutes through Ahmmad Kalasi before Tamer Rasheed made it 2-0 in the 59th minute. B. Beikhokhei pulled one back for the visitors in the 83rd minute.         
	Al Ittihad have 10 points after three wins in their last five games. East Bengal have now lost five out of the five matches so far.         
	The home team started strongly and got the first chance of the game after seven minutes when Abdulfatah Al Agha made his way down the right before smashing an effort against the left upright.         
	They continued to pressurise the visitors defence and it was no surprise that they opened the scoring with 14 minutes gone when Rasheeds free-kick was cleared by an East Bengal defender but only as far as Kalasi, who volleyed home.         
	As East Bengal struggled to get into the game, Al Ittihad almost added a second after 25 minutes but Rasheeds rasping drive was cleared for a corner by goalkeeper Abhra Mondal.         
	The visitors finally managed a foray into the rival half and produced their only effort of note in the opening 45 minutes but Sanju Pradhans shot from outside the area was off target.         
	Al Ittihad continued where they had left off after the break and again came close in the 52nd minute as a Rasheed shot rattled the woodwork.         
	But the lively Rasheed was not to be denied when, in the 59th minute, Kalasi ran down the right before crossing for the forward to head home.

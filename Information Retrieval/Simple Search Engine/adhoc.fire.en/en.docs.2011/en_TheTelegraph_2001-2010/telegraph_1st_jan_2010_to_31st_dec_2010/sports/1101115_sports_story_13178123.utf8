	Abu Dhabi: Sebastian Vettel has become Formula Ones youngest ever world champion, and only the second ever to hail from Germany, after taking a dramatic victory beneath the floodlights at Abu Dhabis opulent Yas Marina Circuit.         
	The 23-year-old from Heppenheim began the race from pole position but was only second favourite for the title with Fernando Alonso, starting from third, needing only to finish fourth or higher to claim his third world crown.         
	However, Alonso was overtaken right at the start by McLarens Jenson Button and a disastrous decision by Ferrari to pit the Spaniard early left him in traffic.         
	The man from Oviedo spent the rest of the race stuck behind the Renault of Vitaly Petrov and eventually trailed home in seventh place.         
	He appeared to gesticulate angrily at the Russian as they crossed the line. He finished second, overall, followed by Mark Webber. No one could say, however, that Vettel was not a deserving world champion, even if this was the first time all season that he has led the standings.         
	The man nicknamed Baby Schumi by the German press after becoming Formula Ones youngest ever race winner at Monza in 2008 has been in unstoppable form in the latter part of the year.         
	Vettel took a total of 135 points in the final nine races of the year, including three victories in the last four races. It would have been four from four but for an engine failure 10 laps from the end in Korea.         
	As he crossed the line, Vettel choked back tears as he was told what he had achieved. Thank you guys, he managed in a high-pitch voice.         
	Unbelievable. I love you.         
	The victory may also be seen as a victory for karma after Red Bull refused to impose team orders on their drivers.         
	Alonso had seemed destined to win the title by fewer than the seven extra points he collected in Germany thanks to Ferraris decision to order Felipe Massa out of the way.         
	However, Red Bull refused to back Mark Webber over Vettel  coming in for a certain amount of criticism in Brazil last week  and were rewarded on Sunday with the drivers crown to add to the constructors title they picked up at Interlagos.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The public works department (PWD) officials on Friday inspected the Super Hospitality Structure constructed by the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Led by PWD secretary Ajit Bardhan, the officials inspected the structure which has undergone a few modifications as per the departments directive.         
	Bardhan was accompanied by the two assistant secretaries, Naresh Ojha and Debabrata Das.         
	Although they are yet to receive the NOC, it is learnt that the PWD officials seemed quite satisfied with the structure after the modifications were carried out.         
	It was also learnt that the fire and emergency services department will inspect the structure in a day or two.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB authorities are livid after receiving an email from an International Management Group representative on some security measures adopted.         
	The e-mail, which has been sent to joint secretary Arun Mitra, states that apart from the entry pass, the association staff would have to furnish a photo ID proof from April 1 (even on non-match days).         
	Many senior CAB officials have found no logic in such a measure, that too after the tournament goes into its third week.         
	Some are also feeling insulted that such an absurd thing has been suggested by the organisers.         
	Its our venue after all. Do we need to take permission for entering our own house         
	Thats something really stupid, said a senior official who is also a former office-bearer.         
	What has irked the officials is that despite everyone having a valid photo accreditation card for entering the premises, they are being told furnish a other visual identification.         
	The CAB brass is planning to speak to the police authorities regarding this issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi will not change style
                                                                                                                       7                                        Messi will not change style
I dont feel the pressure                  Lionel Messi                     
	Barcelona: Lionel Messi doesnt feel any pressure to deliver for Argentina at the World Cup, with the World Player of the Year saying he wont change his Barcelona playing style to suit his country.         
	Four years on from watching Argentina lose to Germany in the quarter finals, Messi is a very different player from the 18-year-old who watched from the bench in Berlin that June afternoon.         
	This time around, Messi heads to the tournament in South Africa having won a string of personal honours and titles with Barcelona, largely due to his extraordinary playmaking and scoring prowess.         
	I dont feel the pressure, Messi said. The truth is Im arriving in good shape. I have a strong desire to do as well as I can, as do my teammates. We want to give our best for Argentina and we hope things turn out well.         
	Coach Diego Maradona has yet to capture Messis best, with the forwards performances for Barcelona seemingly on a different plane to his international displays.         
	I wont change. Ill keep playing in the same way, Messi said. I hope to be able to do what I do (in Barcelona) in the national team without my form suffering, because that (way of playing) is what has made me able to achieve everything I have (up until now).         
	Messi looks best employed on the right side of Barcelonas habitual three-pronged attack, although he has also had a prolific season as a central striker for Pep Guardiolas team. Messi was the Spanish leagues top scorer with 34 goals and led Europe with 47 goals to equal both of Ronaldos club record tallies from 1996-97.         
	Up until now, Maradona has opted to select Messi in a free role behind the two strikers, but the Argentina coach has an array of attacking talent in Diego Milito, Carlos Tevez, Gonzalo Higuain, Angel di Maria and Sergio Aguero at his disposal.         
	Argentina routed Canada 5-0 on Monday in their last friendly before the finals, with Maradonas tactics offering little intent on trying to replicate Barcelonas Ajax-inspired formation with suitable players.         
	I dont know. Its Diegos decision, said Messi said. But I think Argentina are fortunate to have so many top-quality forwards. That has been proven in this last year because if you look at all the important leagues, there is an Argentine there at the top.         
	We are approaching the World Cup on very good form and thats great news.         
	Bizarrely, Messi has been forced to endure criticism in Argentina following some off-colour performances for his national side.         
	The criticism on how I play doesnt hurt, the Rosario native said. If its because of my performances then Im the first to criticise myself and the first to know that I havent done things well enough  its not a problem. But what hurts is when people talk about things unrelated to football. Things beyond football, things from outside.         
	Such criticism has seen Messi accused of being concerned solely with money or not being interested in playing for his national side, part of which stems from the Barcelona star having lived away from Argentina since the age of 13.         
	Lets hope we can do things well and that we can become champions with Argentina and lift the Cup, he said. There is no doubt that winning a World Cup would be something unforgettable for the country, for me and for everybody.         
	I have won everything individually and now I would like to do the same with Argentina.         
	Messi calls playing for icon Maradona very special, but he is quick to dismiss the comparisons that have arisen following his breathtaking displays this season.         
	It bothers me for him more than it does for me, Messi said.           (AGENCIES)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Abhinav Bindra                           
	New Delhi: A rat bite during the Pune trials in June cost Arjuna awardee Sanjeev Rajput a place in the 50m three-position team for the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday.         
	Rajput, who suffered the rat bite, was in terrible pain after taking a series of anti-rabies injections and could not do well in the June trials. During the current trials, he asked the NRAI to consider his score of 1169 during the World championships in Serbia but his request was turned down by the association.         
	Yes, Rajput did ask for exemption, admitted a senior NRAI official. But that couldnt be granted at that point of time. It is unfortunate a shooter like Rajput will not be there in the squad for Commonwealth Games. But we are happy that he is in the Asian Games team, said the official.         
	Considered, as one of Indias most talented rifle shooter, Rajput also could not make the 10-m air rifle squad, as his brilliant score of 597 did not prove good enough to beat the average score of 595.75 by World championships bronze medallist Gagan Narang.         
	While Rajput crashed out of contention with an average score of 593, Abhinav Bindra (592.3) made the squad on the strength of the three bonus points he received as the Olympic champion.         
	Bindra and Narang, along with Hariom Singh and Imran Hassan Khan form the four-member rifle squad for the Commonwealth Games. Bindra and Narang will represent India in the 10-m air rifle event. Narang, however, will also compete in the 50m prone and 50m three- position events and will be the only shooter to participate in three rifle events.         
	An NRAI official said that the trials were done without making the shooters go through the dope tests. There must be some communication gap. The NRAI did write to the National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) but finally went ahead with the trials without the dope tests, he said.

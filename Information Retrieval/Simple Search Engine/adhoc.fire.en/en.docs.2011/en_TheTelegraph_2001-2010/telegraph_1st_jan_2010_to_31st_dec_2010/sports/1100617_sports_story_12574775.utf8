The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It wasnt our day: Spain coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      It wasnt our day: Spain coach
                      
	Durban: Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said that Wednesday wasnt simply their day after his teams shock loss to Switzerland in a Group H match on Wednesday.         
	Today just wasnt our day, Del Bosque said at the media conference. We have two games ahead of us. We have to find a way to win them.         
	We had plenty of chances but they defended very well, stopper Gerard Pique said. I dont think we adapted adequately to their game.         
	Hero of Swiss victory Gelson Fernandes admitted that he was surprised after scoring the goal. To be fair, Im not used to scoring goals, so I was a bit surprised, Fernandes said. It was a bit of luck.         
	Switzerland coach Ottmar Jitzfeld admitted that it was a conscious decision to play defensively as that was only way to counter Spain. These were three unexpected points, Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said. He added: If you play an attacking game against Spain, youll lose and concede one goal after the other.         
	History was not on Spains side either. Only two of the last eight reigning European champions have won their opening match at the World Cup. France in 1986 and Germany in 1998. And Spain have not advanced past the World Cup quarterfinals since its best finish of fourth in 1950.         
	It was a match we tried to play without abandoning our style, Del Bosque said. We tried to play heroically and they fell back and tried to stop us.         
	Spain had 63 percent of possession, and had eight shots on goal to Switzerlands three. But when Spain did find the target, they encountered Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, who made a string of saves. Hes a world class keeper, Hitzfeld said. He was decisive to our win.         
	Teams         
	Switzerland: Diego Benaglio, Stephan Lichtsteiner, Philippe Senderos (Steve von Bergen, 36), Reto Ziegler, Stephane Grichting, Gokhan Inler, Benjamin Huggel, Tranquillo Barnetta (Mario Eggimann, 90), Gelson Fernandes, Blaise Nkufo, Eren Derdiyok (Hakan Yakin, 79).

	Referee: Howard Webb (England) (Agencies)

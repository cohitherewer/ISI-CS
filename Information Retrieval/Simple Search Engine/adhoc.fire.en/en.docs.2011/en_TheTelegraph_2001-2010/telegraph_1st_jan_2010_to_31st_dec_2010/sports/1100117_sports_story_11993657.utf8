The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand to open vs Karjakin 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand to open vs Karjakin 
                      
	Wijk Aan Zee: World champion Viswanathan Anand will start his campaign with black pieces against defending champion Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine in the first round of the Corus Chess tournament. The 14-player round robin event has some of the best names of the game including Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Levon Aronian of Armenia and World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen of Norway.         
	Five-time champion Anand will be eyeing his sixth title on one of his favourite hunting grounds and will also use this opportunity as a much-needed practice before the World championship clash with Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria slated for April this year. Topalov is giving this years tournament a miss.         
	Apart from the big guns in group A, there are two more important events  B and C group  to be organised simultaneously.         
	Grandmasters P Harikrishna and worlds second youngest Grandmaster ever Parimarjan Negi will be seen in action in the tough B group while in the C group the Indian challenge will be headed by former world junior champion Abhijeet Gupta and reigning world junior girls champion Soumya Swaminathan.         
	Anand drew the number-14 in the drawing of lots which means that the Indian ace will get seven black and six white games during the 13-rounds long tournament. The last outing by Anand was in the Tal Memorial in November 2009 and his party was spoiled by Aronian in the final round when he had chance of a joint first finish.         
	The Indian ace starts as the second seed here behind Carlsen who has had some very impressive results in the past year. Carlsen is likely be amongst the frontrunners here too along with Anand, Aronian and Kramnik who won the Tal Memorial showing his true mettle.         
	In the group B, Harikrishna is seeded third while Parimarjan is seeded eighth. This one too is quite a strong field headed by Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany. Out of the 14-participants here the lone International Master is Anna Muzychuk of Slovenia while everyone else is a Grandmaster.

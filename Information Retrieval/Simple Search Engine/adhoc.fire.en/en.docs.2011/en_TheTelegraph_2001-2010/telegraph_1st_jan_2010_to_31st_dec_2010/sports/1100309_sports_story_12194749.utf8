The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians draw after poor show vs SA
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians draw after poor show vs SA
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  
	New Delhi: Striker Shivendra Singh scored four minutes before the hooter as India barely managed to avoid the humiliation of yet another defeat in the Hero Honda hockey World Cup after drawing 3-3 with South Africa at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Monday.         
	Leading 2-1 at half-time, the hosts, who were backed by a vociferous crowd, nearly lost the plot as the South Africans came back strongly to take a 3-2 lead. With a fourth consecutive defeat looming large, the Indian fans heaved a sigh of relief when Shivendra flicked in from a goalmouth melee.         
	India finished pool B with four points to grab the fourth place ahead of South Africa on the basis of better goal difference. The home team will now fight it out in the seventh/eighth place playoff on Friday. Four-time champions Pakistan ended last in the group. Indias playoff opponents will only be identified on Tuesday after the completion of the pool A matches.         
	Its a poor result considering we played at home, said former star Ashok Kumar, the man who scored Indias winning goal in the 1975 World Cup final.         
	Ashok did admit that luck was not in Indias favour. South Africa scored the third goal at a time when we were in full control of the match.         
	Ashok was not far from the truth. With the match evenly poised at 2-2, Sarvanjit Singh found the target in the 47th minute and even though the umpire signalled for a goal, the South Africans insisted on a referral claming that a foul had been committed by an Indian defender as the hosts began the move.         
	The two umpires consulted for a few minutes before asking for the referral that not only cancelled the goal but also confirmed the foul in the Indian penalty area. A penalty corner was awarded to South Africa and skipper Austin Smith scored to leave the Indian players looking shocked.         
	That goal was definitely a big blow to India, who till then were doing a fine job upfront. Sensing the chance to snatch back-to-back victories, the South Africans started questioning the decisions of the umpires regularly to put further pressure on India.         
	Interestingly, South Africa captain Austin Smith said there were flaws in the referral system. Perhaps it needs to be looked into to make it more perfect. Even we were a bit confused when we asked for it, he said.         
	South Africa had stunned Pakistan in their previous match and played with a lot of grit and agility in the beginning to take the lead in the 9th minute. Their persistent pressure resulted in the first strike with the Indian defence yet again conceding a soft goal.         
	An unmarked Lloyd Norris-Jones scored for South Africa from top of the circle after dodging past a few Indian players with his fast-paced run from the mid-field.         
	India then shrugged off their lethargy to launch a series of attacks and struck twice in a span of eight minutes to put the visitors on to the back foot.         
	The goal by Norris-Jones was a rude jolt for the Indians. With both Rajpal Singh and Arjun Halappa playing with great determination, India pulled level in the 17th minute when Sarvanjit found the target off a Halappa pass.         
	Eight minutes later there was wild excitement in the stands as India scored again  Diwakar Ram slamming it in with an angular shot from a difficult position after India failed to take advantage from two consecutive penalty corners.         
	South Africa, trailing by a goal at the half-way mark, mounted pressure on the Indian citadel, levelling the scores three minutes into the second period through Justin Reid-Ross who pushed the ball over the goalline from close.

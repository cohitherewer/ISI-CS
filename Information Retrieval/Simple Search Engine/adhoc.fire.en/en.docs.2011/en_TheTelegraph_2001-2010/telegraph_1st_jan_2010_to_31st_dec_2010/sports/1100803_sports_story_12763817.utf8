            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England included pace bowler Tim Bresnan in a 12-man squad for this weeks second Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston, according to an ECB press release on Monday.         
	Bresnan was the only player picked in addition to the side that beat the tourists by 354 runs in four days of the first Test.         
	The key to consistency is building on that success throughout the rest of the series, national selector Geoff Miller said. We saw a number of outstanding performances at Trent Bridge, not only with bat and ball, but also in the field. The challenge is to maintain those standards over the next three Test matches.         
	Bresnan had also made the first Test squad, but did not play. He had come in as a late replacement when Ajmal Shahzad withdrew with an ankle injury.         
	The squad         
	Andrew Strauss (capt), James Anderson, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Graeme Swann, Jonathon Trott.

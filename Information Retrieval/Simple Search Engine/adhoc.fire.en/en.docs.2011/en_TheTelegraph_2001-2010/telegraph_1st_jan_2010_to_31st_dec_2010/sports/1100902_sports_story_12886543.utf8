	Jamshedpur: Mumbai Indians batsman Saurabh Tiwary Wednesday said that he would looking for consistent performances in the upcoming Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20) to be held in South Africa from September 10 to 16.         
	It is an important tournament for me and I am confident to give my best in South Africa, Tiwary, who joined Tata Steel as a sports manager, on Wednesday, said.         
	I have been working hard and had practised with Team India members to ensure consistency in my performance, said the left-handed batsman on the sidelines of the ongoing Jharkhand trial camp for the Ranji Trophy, here.         
	Tiwary, who was a member of the Indias ODI squad in the recently-concluded tri-series in Sri Lanka, said that for a batsmen to survive in the shorter version of the game one has to become a hard-hitter.         
	Asked about his failure to make the playing XI for Team India, Tiwary said that it was the prerogative of the skipper. Besides, the Indian team had experienced players and the captain will obviously settle for winning combinations, he quipped. Right now, I am focussing for the upcoming Champions League and leaving for South Africa Thursday to take part in the tournament, he added.         
	Tiwary came to limelight while representing the Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians in the last edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Mumbai Indians will take on South Africas Highveld Lions in the CLT20 opener on September 10 at New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.         
	Tiwary, who made his first-class debut in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy, had scored two half centuries in Indias U-19 tri-series victory over South Africa and Bangladesh in 2008. He was also a member of the squad that won the U-19 World Cup, in Malaysia, in 2008.

  - Laxman joins team in Bangalore       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a practice session in Bangalore, on Thursday                                 
	Calcutta/Bangalore: VVS Laxman, who led India to a thrilling victory against Australia, in Mohali, despite a sore back, has joined the Indian team in Bangalore.         
	According to sources, the right-handed batsman is feeling much better ahead of the second Test, from Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, trailing 0-1 in the series, Australia batsman Mike Hussey Thursday said the visitors are determined to come out with flying colours in the second and final tie.         
	Incidentally, the second Test against India would be Australias last five-day game before this years Ashes but Hussey said their priority now is to win the next match and level the series.         
	Every Test match is big. Yes, it is the last Test before the Ashes but we are not thinking about it this stage. We are 0-1 down in the series and we have to win this match and level the series, Hussey told reporters.         
	That is the focus at this moment...To play good, disciplined Test cricket for long periods of time. If we play with the same intensity that we did in Mohali, we have a good chance of levelling the series, he added.         
	He, however, is disappointed to have lost the Mohali Test from a winning position. It was a Test match which we could have won. We had our chances, but we could not do the job and get over the line. After match, the dressing room was very quiet, Hussey said.         
	From a positive point of view, we did a lot of things right. We are playing against the No.1 team in the world with a relatively young team. We will try to maintain that consistency here, he said.

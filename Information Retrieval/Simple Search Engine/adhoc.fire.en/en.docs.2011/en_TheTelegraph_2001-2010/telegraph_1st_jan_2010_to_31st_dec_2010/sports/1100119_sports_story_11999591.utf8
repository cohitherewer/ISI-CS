	Melbourne: With one former womens No. 1 making an early exit and the current one not playing until Tuesday, it was just as well that Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin came back to give the Australian Open some first-day luster on a rainy, dreary day at Melbourne Park.         
	Former top-ranked Maria Sharapova was a surprise 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-4 loser Monday to fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko. US Open champion Clijsters, also a former No. 1 and making a return to the Australian Open in her sixth tournament back from retirement, easily won her first-round match 6-0, 6-4 over Canadian qualifier Valerie Tetreault.         
	Another former No. 1 also on the comeback trail, seven-time Grand Slam singles winner Justine Henin, advanced with a 6-4, 6-3 win over fellow Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. Henin lost to Clijsters in the Brisbane International final 10 days ago in her return to the tour.         
	Second-seeded Rafael Nadal, the defending mens champion, beat Australias Peter Luczak 7-6 (0), 6-1, 6-4.         
	Steady rain first delayed the start of play on outside courts, then forced several suspensions and more than a dozen postponements.         
	Officials finally called off play at 10 p.m. on outside courts when the rain returned, forcing the matches to be concluded Tuesday.         
	It was Sharapovas earliest exit from a Grand Slam since the 2003 French Open, and comes after she lost in the second round at last years US Open.         
	Fifth-seeded Russian Elena Dementieva set up a mouth-watering second-round clash with Henin after dispatching compatriot Vera Dushevina 6-2, 6-1 on Monday.         
	In first-round mens matches, US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro beat American Michael Russell 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 and No. 5 Andy Murray defeated South Africas Kevin Anderson 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.         
	Seventh-seeded Andy Roddick sat through a needless rain suspension before beating Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.         
	Indias Sania Mirza will also have to wait till Tuesday to start her Australian Open campaign as rains forced postponement of her first round match. She was scheduled to play the third match at the court number six against French 27th seed Aravane Rezai at Melbourne Park here.

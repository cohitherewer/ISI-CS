The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crunch match for India today
                                                                                                                       7                                      Crunch match for India today
                      
	Harare: With their chances of making the final hanging by a thread, a beleaguered India will have to win and win it big when they take on Sri Lanka in a do-or-die match of the ongoing tri-series here Saturday.         
	Smarting from the ignominy of being beaten twice by Zimbabwe in the tournament  their first back-to-back defeats against the minnows  Suresh Raina and his teammates have their back against the wall with the prospect of an exit looming large.         
	Given the scenario, India, who currently have just four points from just one win, have to beat the Lankans on the morrow with a bonus point and hope that the outcome of Mondays Zimbabwe-Sri Lanka match also goes their way.         
	A win and a bonus point will take Indias tally to nine points, level with Zimbabwe. Raina and his men would then hope that Zimbabwe spring another surprise and upstage the Lankans, who have five points, in the final league encounter.         
	But all mathematical calculations hinge on an Indian win Saturday and they can take heart from the fact that they beat Tillekaratne Dilshans men the first time around.         
	That win came on the back of some fantastic batting by Rohit Sharma, who struck a hundred, and Virat Kohli. The two rescued India from a wobbly start and guided them home.         
	But except for the two and to some extent Raina, Indias batting has not been too impressive.         
	The Zimbabweans thoroughly exposed their batting frailties and though the Lankans also have a relatively inexperienced squad, they would look to exploit the known chink in Indias armour.         
	The openers have been a letdown and Raina had no hesitation admitting that the failure of Murali Vijay and Dinesh Karthik has hurt the side.         
	Rohit Sharma hit back-to-back centuries but it is unfair to expect him to bail out the side every time.         
	Lot would depend on Kohli and Raina as well, while Yusuf Pathan will also have to contribute, more so when the chips are down.         
	Indias bowling have been largely toothless and none from the attack has made much of an impact. Umesh Yadav and Ashok Dinda have been inconsistent and though they have wickets to show, their economy rates are nothing to talk about.         
	The Lankans have played just two matches so far and while they were clinical against Zimbabwe, they just couldnt accelerate at the right time against India.         
	But the team which comprises some new faces and some comeback men can still prove to be a quite a handful for India.         
	Teams         
	India (from): Dinesh Karthik, Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Yusuf Pathan, Amit Mishra, Ashok Dinda, Pragyan Ojha, Umesh Yadav, R Ashwin, Naman Ojha, Pankaj Singh, R Vinay Kumar

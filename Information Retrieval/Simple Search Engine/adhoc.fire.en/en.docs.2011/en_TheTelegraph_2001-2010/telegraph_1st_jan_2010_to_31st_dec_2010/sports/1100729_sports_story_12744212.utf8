    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  For the record holder, T20 for two more years is a possibility...             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Muralidharan      
	Colombo: The one and only Muttiah Muralidharan spoke to The Telegraph, at the Taj Samudra, on Wednesday afternoon.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Almost a week after your last Test, do you regret having quit that form?         
	A No... Id made the decision and really enjoyed my last Test... Things ended well, most important being that Sri Lanka won the Test (in Galle).         
	What if you hadnt got that last wicket, your 800th?         
	As I said then, 800 is only a number...         
	Did you wake up feeling any different on your first day as a former Test cricketer?         
	It was the same, its not that I was thinking about having become a former Test player.         
	Nobody believes that your Test record can be broken...         
	But records are meant to be broken... When Fred Trueman became the first to take 300 Test wickets, everybody said his record would stand... Look at what has happened, the record stands at 800... So, somebody may come along and do one better than me.         
	Have you, at any time, missed not being on the park at the SSC?         
	(Pauses) No... I did my bit for 18 years... Of course, Im following the Test there and its nice to know that, as were speaking, the upper hand is with Sri Lanka.         
	Has life changed in the past week?         
	Life keeps changing, doesnt it?         
	With Test cricket out of the way, how will you be keeping yourself busy?         
	Right now, my priority is to enjoy life as a former Test cricketer... Id like to give more time to the family, particularly my wife (Madhimalar) and son (Naren). I have a duty towards them.         
	What about your involvement with cricket?         
	I think Ill be able to play T20 for another two years... As for the ODIs, lets see... Perhaps, till the 2011 World Cup... Im not sure about the 50-over game.         
	Any plans to either launch or be associated with a spin academy?         
	Havent thought about it... Its too early to be thinking of too many things... Ill give the academy a thought once Im through with all forms of cricket.         
	What has cricket taught you the most?         
	(A trifle emotionally) Cricket has taught me everything... How to handle pressure, how to respect others, how to behave in public, how to handle the ups and downs which become a big part of a sportsmans career.         
	Did the controversies make you stronger?         
	Absolutely... The support I got from everybody (in 1995-96 and in 1998-99) made me stronger, too.         
	Have you forgiven John Howard, a former Prime Minister of Australia, for calling you a chucker (in 2004)?         
	I have... Life, to me, is all about forgiving and forgetting... In any case, our present-day President (Mahinda Rajapaksa), who was then the Prime Minister, had given a suitable reply.         
	Any plans to follow Arjuna Ranatunga and Sanath Jayasuriya into Parliament...         
	No, no... Im happy being who I am... Politics isnt for me.         
	Being a Tamil, were you under pressure during the many years of the civil war in Sri Lanka?         
	Didnt feel any pressure... I have very good Sinhalese friends and Ive stayed in a Sinhalese locality... I did my job (for Sri Lanka)... People didnt see me as this or that... Tamils in the north and the east faced problems.         
	Your No.1 moment?         
	Winning the 1996 World Cup... That I was in the XI will always remain very special.         
	Sourav Ganguly has placed you ahead of Shane Warne. Your reaction?         
	(Smiles) Its a compliment and Im thankful to Sourav.         
	Your rating of Sourav, who quit two years ago?         
	He was one of the finest players of spin, a good batsman... At times, I found it hard to get him... On other occasions, I succeeded.         
	Whats your take on the changes cricket has seen in the past 18 years?         
	As with other things, cricket has been evolving... As a sport, its better today, giving more opportunities to show ones talent. Now, at the international level, you have three forms, which is good... A balance needs to be struck, though.         
	The last one... How is Naren, whod been hospitalised here?         
	Hes much better... He got discharged yesterday and is back home.

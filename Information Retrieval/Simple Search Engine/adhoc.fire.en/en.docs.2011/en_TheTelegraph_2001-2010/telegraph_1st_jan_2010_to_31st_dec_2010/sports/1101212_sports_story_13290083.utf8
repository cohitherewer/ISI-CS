The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HI brings Pargat on board
                                                                                                                       7                                      HI brings Pargat on board
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In a surprise move, Hockey India (HI) on Saturday appointed former India captain Pargat Singh as the chairman of the development committee.         
	A bitter critic of HI, Pargat had been on the warpath against the national federation for the past one year and even contested, though unsuccessfully, for the post of president in the HI elections. The former defender was widely believed to be backed by the union sports ministry in its attempt to break the Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) stranglehold in the HI.         
	According to HI sources, the decision to appoint Pargat, which has been taken by its governing council, is also an effort by the HI to mend fences with the sports ministry.         
	Previously, there was no chairman of the development committee. The post has been created to accommodate Pargat, said a source.         
	The resignation of Vidya Stokes as the HI president was also a move to appease the ministry and send a message that the federation was ready to tow the government guidelines, sources claimed.         
	Pargat, according to HI secretary general Narendra Batra, will head a seven-member committee. Batra said Pargat was chosen for the job considering his vast experience and knowledge of sport.         
	Pargat, when asked, said: Earlier, I was offered the post of associate vice president but I refused. Now, I have taken up this job because I will be able to contribute to the game with my technical knowledge.

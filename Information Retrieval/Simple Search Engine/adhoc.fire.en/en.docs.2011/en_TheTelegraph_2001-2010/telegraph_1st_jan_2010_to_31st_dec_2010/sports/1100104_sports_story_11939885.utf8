The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HI elections a scam: Badal
                                                                                                                       7                                      HI elections a scam: Badal
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Hockey India (HI) elections scheduled on January 29 had a political twist on Sunday when Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal described the entire process a huge scam.         
	Badal, who is also the president of the newly formed Hockey Punjab (HP) and reportedly eyeing the top post in the HI, said the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and its president Suresh Kalmadi were trying to stop Punjab from being a part of the HI elections.         
	Addressing a press conference along with former union sports minister and president of the Punjab Olympic Association (POA) Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and former India captain and HP secretary Pargat Singh, Badal said Punjab were denied HI affiliation despite holding the state body elections as per the guidelines.         
	Its shocking that they have denied us affiliation. There is something fishy in the IOA, which has debarred not only Punjab but also major hockey playing states like Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kerala, Badal said.

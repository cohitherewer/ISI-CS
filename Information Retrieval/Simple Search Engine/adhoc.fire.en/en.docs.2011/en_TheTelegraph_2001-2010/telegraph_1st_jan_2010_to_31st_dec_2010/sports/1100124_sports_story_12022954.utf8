The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not taking Bangladesh lightly, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Not taking Bangladesh lightly, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has, on the eve of the second Test in nearby Mirpur, refused to take Bangladesh lightly. Dhonis observation was in sharp contrast to Virender Sehwags, who was the stand-in captain for the first Test.         
	Asked at a news conference whether the hosts were capable of taking 20 wickets, Dhoni said: They are expected to take 20 wickets You should not take any side lightly.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The wicket in Mirpur         
	It could be a different wicket tomorrow before the game starts. Right now there is a lot of moisture. You can see its quite hot and humid, and so you have to wait and see what it looks like before the start. In the one-dayers, there was a bit of help for spinners and if they can bowl in the right areas they can really push the batsmen to make a mistake. I think it would be a good track for the spinners.         
	If he was surprised by Bangladeshs performance in Chittagong         
	After the fourth day there was only one way the match could have gone. Frankly speaking, there was only one result possible. I am not exaggerating anyone who follows cricket will know what result was possible. But Bangladesh have done well. They bowled a good line, the fast bowlers have put in a good effort. But as an international side you are supposed to do well. I think they have done reasonably well in the last Test.         
	Whether Bangladesh are capable of taking 20 wickets         
	Well thats why they are playing Test matches They are expected to take 20 wickets and you should not take any side lightly because its about 10 balls that you have to bowl in the right areas. It doesnt matter who the bowler is. If he is bowling in the good areas and the batsman commits a mistake anything can happen. The red ball helps the bowlers. So there is no reason why a side cant take 20 wickets... Its about creating pressure.         
	The Virender Sehwag-Gautam Gambhir opening partnership and its importance         
	The opening partnership is very important. Its significance increases when we are playing in the subcontinent. Gautam and Sehwag complement each other. They rotate the strike well and in Test matches singles are very important. If a bowler is bowling a good line then the left and right combination can make it slightly difficult for him.         
	On how the pair complement each other and where he places them in world cricket         
	When Sehwag gets going, the pressure is off Gautam and he can play his natural game. Both are really great. They can be compared to the greatest People may argue about that, but at the end of the day, they are doing really well for India. They have completely different styles of play. Gautam waits for the ball to come to his zone while Sehwag, right from the start, tries to put pressure on the bowlers.         
	Gambhirs chance to equal Don Bradmans record (hundreds in six consecutive Tests)         
	Gautam is a very good batsman. He is doing very well for us match after match he is coming up with good scores. We are just hoping he comes up with a good score in the next two innings and gets a ton. That would be a proud moment for not only him, but every member in the side.         
	The Indian bowling in the first Test         
	I think they, too, bowled reasonably well. The wicket was best to bowl on the first day for the fast bowlers and there was a bit of turn throughout the match. The wicket got slower and slower as the game progressed. It was very important to bowl with the right pace. Zaheer Khan was at his best, he bowled long spells. Ishant (Sharma) looked to get back into form. Unfortunately, Sreesanth got injured. Amit Mishra also bowled well. Overall, it was a good bowling performance.         
	Pressure from the youngsters         
	Thats the best part of a good side. When there is pressure on individuals due to the bench strength, it brings out the best in a player. Its really good that players are pushing each other to get a slot in the middle-order in the longer format. So its good. More the competition the better it is for both the bowling and batting departments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Virat runs away with show
                                                                                                                       7                                        Virat runs away with show
    - Yuvraj Singh impresses with all-round performance             UMANAND JAISWAL            Gautam Gambhir is congratulated by Yuvraj Singh and Virat Kohli, as Suresh Raina and Ashish Nehra look on, after Indias emphatic 40-run win over New Zealand, in the first ODI, in Guwahati, on Sunday. (PTI)                                 
	Guwahati: India launched their campaign in the five-match one-day International (ODI) series, against New Zealand, with a 40-run win at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, on Sunday. The architects of the Indian triumph were the talented Virat Kohli, who hit his second ODI century on the trot, and an under-pressure Yuvraj Singh, who delivered a solid all-round show.         
	But more than individual brilliance, the match will be remembered for the team effort with everyone contributing in some way or the other in the absence of the seniors.         
	However, the same cannot be said about New Zealand, who have now lost their fifth successive match after a disastrous 0-4 series humiliation at the hands of Bangladesh.         
	Indias innings was built around Kohlis impressive century, his fifth overall. A cautious Kohli went about his job in a composed manner, compiling his fifty off 63 balls. But he shifted gears after that and by the time he finished his innings, the runs were more than the number of balls he faced  105 off 101.         
	Kohli, however, fell to left-arm medium pacer Andy McKay in an attempt to accelerate. His was a rather soft dismissal, similar to that of Yuvraj Singhs and stand-in captain Gautam Gambhirs, who fell before him.         
	Kohli was also instrumental in a 88-run third-wicket partnership with Yuvraj. Yuvrajs 42-run innings came to an end when he edged one to keeper Gareth Hopkins off Daryll Tuffey.         
	While Kohli paced his innings quite brilliantly, Murali Vijay, Gambhir and Yuvraj failed to capitalise on their good starts.         
	And the lower-order collapse did not help Indias total as the last six wickets fell for a mere 26 runs. From a comfortable 256 for five, the Indians folded at 276 with an over to go.         
	While Yusuf Pathan contributed 29 runs to the teams cause, debutant Wriddhiman Saha disappointed as he fell for 4.         
	For the Black Caps, McKay grabbed four wickets while Kyle Mills picked up three. New Zealands bowling was also hit hard by the absence of regular captain Daniel Vettori, who sat out the match with a stiffness in his lower back.         
	The chase, in fading light, was always going to be tough for the visitors, more so because of the absence of Brendon McCullum who, too, is suffering from a back problem.         
	Ross Taylor, who was donning the captains cap, fought in vain with a defiant 66 as the others did not provide him with able support.         
	He hit three fours and three sixes but holed out to Munaf Patel at mid-wicket, trying to launch spinner R. Ashwin out of the ground.         
	Apart from Taylor, opener Martin Guptill contributed 30 off 37 balls.         
	However, late cameos by Mills (32) and Nathan McCullum (35) gave the visitors some hope. They stitched a 77-run partnership for the ninth wicket, which ended when Gambhir took a tough catch on the run to end McCullums innings. Mills, too, fell soon.         
	Sreesanth, Ashwin and Yuvraj finished with three wickets each to help Gambhir secure a win in his first ODI as captain.

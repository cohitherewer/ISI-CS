The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were nervous: Deco
                                                                                                                       7                                      We were nervous: Deco
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Portugal midfielder Deco said the draw with Ivory Coast was a disappointing result for them but put the halting display down to an attack of nerves.         
	Portugal began well but appeared to run out of ideas as the match progressed and would be more than happy with the point earned as they look to advance from the group of death.         
	Of course, were disappointed. We needed this win and we had chances to win. Its our first game, we were nervous, we were anxious. We knew it was an important game, but we need to focus on the next one now, Portugal midfielder Deco said.         
	Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, meanwhile, saw much that was pleasing in the way his boys played. The Elephants largely outplayed their higher-ranked opponents despite Didier Drogba only coming on as a late substitute.         
	It was a tight game, not many occasions to score, Eriksson said. I thought if any team was going to win, it was we. We created some more chances than they did. I am very, very happy with the performance.         
	If you think about discipline and organisation, I think we were organised for all 90 minutes, Eriksson added.

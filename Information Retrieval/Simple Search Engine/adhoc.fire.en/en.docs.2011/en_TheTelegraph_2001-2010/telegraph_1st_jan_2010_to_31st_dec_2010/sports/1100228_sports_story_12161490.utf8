The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Olympians slighted
                                                                                                                       7                                      Olympians slighted
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Gurbux Singh wants to enjoy what would hopefully be a great hockey World Cup but the former captain has no tickets to the event being held in New Delhi.         
	And, he is not the only one. Like Singh, other Olympians who wanted to watch the teams in action at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, find themselves without passes for the quadrennial meet.         
	Ask Hockey India (HI) and this neglect of the national heroes is put down to tight security and limited availability. A better explanation, perhaps, is the chaos and confusion that reigns in the nations hockey establishment.         
	No one knows whats happening, Singh said. I tried calling the organisers but none of them answered the phone. Im not feeling insulted but if one has to beg for tickets, then Ill be the last to do so.         
	Singh was finally offered a ticket by Zafar Iqbal, member of HIs selection committee, but only for Sundays clash against Pakistan.         
	However, till Saturday evening, the veteran player and administrator was unsure about being present for the match.

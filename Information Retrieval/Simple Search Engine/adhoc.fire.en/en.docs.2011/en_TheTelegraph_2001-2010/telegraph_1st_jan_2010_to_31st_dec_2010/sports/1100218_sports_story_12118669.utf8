	New Delhi: The I-League committee of the AIFF on Wednesday buckled under pressure from the IFA to indefinitely postpone the match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.         
	According to AIFF sources, the match, which was to be played on April 2, was postponed after the IFA secretary, Utpal Ganguli placed a request on behalf of East Bengal not to hold the match.         
	East Bengal were reluctant to play, sources informed. On April 6, East Bengal are scheduled to play an AFC Cup and their officials feel that a poor result against Mohun Bagan may jeopardise their chances, he added.

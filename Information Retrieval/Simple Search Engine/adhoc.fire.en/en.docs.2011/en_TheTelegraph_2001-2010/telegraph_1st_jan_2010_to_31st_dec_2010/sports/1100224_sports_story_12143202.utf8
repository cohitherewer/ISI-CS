	Sydney: David Warner blazed his way to the second-fastest half-century in the format as Australia raced to an eight wicket win over the West Indies in the second T20 International Tuesday.         
	The victory came with 50 balls to spare and saw Australia complete the summer undefeated as the hosts replied to Windies 138 for seven with 142 for the loss of two wickets in 11.4 overs.         
	According to Cricinfo, Warner raced to fifty from 18 deliveries, beating his own 19-ball effort from last season.

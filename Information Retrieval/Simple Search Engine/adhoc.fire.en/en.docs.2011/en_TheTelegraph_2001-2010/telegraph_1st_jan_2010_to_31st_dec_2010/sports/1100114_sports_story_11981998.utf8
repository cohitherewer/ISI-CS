The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena sails through
                                                                                                                       7                                        Serena sails through
                  Serena Williams                     
	Sydney: Serena Williams continued her smooth lead-up to next weeks Australian Open with a comfortable win at the Sydney International on Wednesday while Dinara Safina suffered a heavy loss five days before the first Grand Slam of 2010.         
	Playing her second match in 24 hours after a two-month recess, Williams could hardly have been more dominant as she crushed Russian Vera Dushevina 6-2, 6-2 in just over an hour at the Olympic tennis centre.         
	I definitely dont think I played my best, but thats comforting to know, the world No. 1 said.         
	Hopefully, I have a long way to go, which I think is always good.         
	While Williams was an unstoppable force, world No. 2 Safina slumped to a 6-2, 6-3 defeat by fellow Russian Elena Dementieva in a repeat of last years Sydney final.         
	The match was delayed by two hours because of heavy rain after which Dementieva immediately seized control, winning the first five games on the trot to register her fourth straight win over Safina.         
	Its always good to have the statistic, but I think every match is very different, especially against Dinara, Dementieva said.         
	Thats what we all are looking for here, to play against top players and get this match confidence.         
	Safina, runner-up to Williams in Melbourne last year, has had a wretched last few months, suffering a back complaint that forced her to miss her planned comeback tournament last week.         
	I dont think it was a bad match, just a bad start, Safina said. If I played the first set like the second set, it could have been a different result.         
	My game is there. I just have to practice a bit more before the Australian Open.         
	Williams opponent in Thursdays semi-finals is Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai, who beat Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-3, 6-0.         
	Dementieva faces Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who booked her spot with a 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 win over Slovakias Dominika Cibulkova, her third three-setter in as many days.         
	Australias Lleyton Hewitt, chasing his fifth title in Sydney, is the only seeded player through to the last eight in the mens draw after a day of surprise results.         
	Hewitt sealed his passage in emphatic fashion with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Italian Andreas Seppi to advance to a quarter-final meeting with Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus.         
	It was perfect today, Hewitt said. If he was going to win a point, he had to play a bloody good point to get past me.         
	Baghdatis upset Serbian sixth seed Viktor Troicki 7-5 6-3.         
	The second seed, Czech Tomas Berdych, and eighth-seeded Benjamin Becker of Germany also lost, while third seed Stanislas Wawrinka withdrew before his match against Frenchman Julien Benneteau with a neck problem.

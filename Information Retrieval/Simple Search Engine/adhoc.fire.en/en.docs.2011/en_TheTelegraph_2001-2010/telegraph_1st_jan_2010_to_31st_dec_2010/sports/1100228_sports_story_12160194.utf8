The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Playing it down, but fired up
                                                                                                                       7                                        Playing it down, but fired up
    - Hosts hope to rise to the challenge as the hockey World Cup begins today           JAYDEEP BASU                India captain Rajpal Singh and Pakistan counterpart Zeeshan Ashraf                                  
	New Delhi: Their halcyon days might well be behind them but emotions will still be running high when India and Pakistan renew their legendary rivalry in hockey on the opening day of the Hero Honda World Cup at a revamped Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Sunday.         
	Gone are the days when they were the undisputed rulers of world hockey. In the last World Cup, India clinched the 11th spot in a 12-team competition. Pakistan, four-time champions, did slightly better, finishing sixth to just about manage a Champions Trophy berth.         
	Although the Indian team have caused frequent disappointment to their ever-dwindling fans, the current edition of the World Cup, being held in India after 28 years, has raised hopes of a resurgence.         
	Fortunately, or unfortunately, the opener is a blockbuster: In hockey, it cannot get any bigger than an India-Pakistan clash, so Indias campaign could either get off to a roaring start or take a bad beating, inside their 70 minutes on the field in this tournament.         
	And, if the Indian team are aiming at mending broken hearts  there surely would be plenty of them in the capacity crowd  they wouldnt get a better chance than the match against the arch-rivals. India do face a tall order being placed as they are in a tough pool comprising teams like Australia, Spain and reigning European champions England.         
	Predictably, knowing well what impact victory or defeat in a match like this can have, the two teams are trying their best to convince fans that there are bigger battles after the big clash. While the Pakistan team management is playing the peace card to bring down passions, the Indians are at pains to describe the match as a normal encounter.         
	Indian coach Jose Brasa said: We will try to improve with every match; the other teams will do the same. Skipper Rajpal Singh even went to the extent of saying that it was good India would be meeting Pakistan first, so that the home team could fully focus on the rest of the matches.         
	It evokes strong passions among the spectators but our teams focus will be to play the best game possible. The pressure is there but we will try to concentrate on the tournament as a whole, he said.         
	Pakistan captain Zeeshan Ashraf said he was not looking at only Sundays opening encounter but the teams first three matches. The match against India is crucial and a win would certainly lift the team but actually the first three matches will let us know where we are heading. Our first aim is to reach the semi-finals, said the 34-year-old.         
	Emotions apart, Pakistan , at least on paper, are a shade better than India, but for the hosts, Sundays encounter would be the best chance to pip their rivals in front of a vocal home crowd. Only recently, India were routed by Pakistan 6-3 in the Champions Challenge and Brasas counterpart, Shahid Ali Khan said his team would come all guns blazing in the World Cup.         
	Our match schedule doesnt allow us much breathing space. Its pretty clear that we cannot afford a slow start. We have India in our first match and then its Spain and we have to win both games to keep ourselves on track for a place in the semis because things will get tougher for us against England and Australia, Khan said.         
	The Indians are clearly taking a different approach. Brasa has already described Sundays tie as yet another match which he was ready to lose if there was the World Cup at the end of it.         
	Notwithstanding the conscious effort by both sides to downplay the rivalry, Sundays match would induce nostalgia among the fans in the subcontinent who have seen India and Pakistan dazzle on the turf with the Asian brand of hockey before being marginalised by European might.         
	Sundays matches         
	Pool B: South Africa vs Spain (4.35pm), Australia vs England (6.35pm) and India vs Pakistan (8.35pm).

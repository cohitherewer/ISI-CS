The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capital loss for Knights as Warner runs riot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Capital loss for Knights as Warner runs riot
    - Daredevils batsman hits century as Sourav amp; Co. lose by 40 runs             JAYDEEP BASU                            
	New Delhi: The Delhi DareDevils strength lies in batting and it is often expected that either Virender Sehwag or Gautam Gambhir would do the needful.         
	But following the match at the Kotla on Monday, their opponents would do well to have a strategy for David Warner  the Australian serving notice in no uncertain terms as the hosts scored an easy 40-run victory over the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	At the Kotla, Warner was the undisputed hero for the hosts as the left-hander slammed a magnificent unbeaten 69-ball 107, only the second century in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) after Rajasthan Royals Yusuf Pathans 37-ball hundred against the Mumbai Indians.         
	The DareDevils, despite losing three wickets in the first three overs, reached 177 for four, thanks largely to Warners brilliant knock.         
	In reply, the Knights lost their way early in the innings and could manage only 137 for nine. Except for a brief effort by Chris Gayle (30), no other batsman could pose any threat to the DareDevils attack.         
	It was the Knights fourth defeat in seven matches. For the DareDevils, this was their second consecutive victory after three defeats on the trot.         
	In total, the hosts have now won four matches and are fourth in the standings.         
	Much was expected of skipper Sourav Ganguly (5), who was lustily cheered on by the sell-out crowd, when he came out to open with Gayle.         
	However, the Knights captain lasted only 10 deliveries before Dirk Nannes had his leg-stump uprooted.         
	It was only the beginning of a long procession as the Knights also lost the wickets of Mandeep Singh (0) and Manoj Tiwary (0) with just 21 runs on the board.         
	And since there was none like Warner in the Knights camp, the visitors looked a defeated lot long before the match could come to an end.         
	The dismissal of Gayle (30) in the ninth over broke the Knight Riders back. He was scalped by local lad Rajat Bhatia who had the West Indian caught at deep mid-wicket by Amit Mishra.         
	Earlier, coming out to open, Warner stayed till the end to take his team to a comfortable total along with Paul Collingwood (53 off 45 balls).         
	To the 38 for three in three overs, Warner and Collingwood added 128 runs for the fourth wicket before the Englishman was spectacularly caught by David Hussey at long-on in the last over.         
	Warner decided to go on the counter-offensive when Sourav looked like running away with the match after losing the toss to his Delhi counterpart, Gambhir.         
	He called Gayle to open the attack and that worked wonders as the West Indian off-break bowler had dangerman Virender Sehwag stumped in the very first over.         
	The DareDevils looked to be in dire straits as Gambhir (1), playing his first match in two weeks and deputy Dinesh Karthik (0) got out cheaply, leaving it for Warner to script a recovery.         
	On a good batting wicket, the Australian was too hot to handle. He hit nine fours and five sixes in his 69-ball innings and looked good enough to carry on for another 20 overs.         
	On 96, he was caught and bowled by Murali Kartik and was walking off before the third umpire ruled that the ball had not carried.         
	Collingwood should be complimented for deciding to play the second fiddle yet not failing to score when presented with a lose delivery.         
	 He has not had a chance of playing so far this season but grabbed the opportunity with both hands when the team management decided to field him in place of South African AB de Villiers.

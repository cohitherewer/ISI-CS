The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muralidharan to have a   grand farewell
                                                                                                                       7                                      Muralidharan to have a   grand farewell
                            
	Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has planned a grand farewell for Muttiah Muralidharan, who will play his last Test, against India, from Sunday, but will not prepare a tailor-made pitch to assist the spin wizard.         
	Muralidharan is just eight wickets shy of touching the magical 800-wicket mark and SLC officials say that he does not need a pitch suiting his style as he can strike on any pitch.         
	Curtains will fall on a dazzling international career which saw Muralidharan becoming the highest wicket-taker in Tests well as in the one-dayers.         
	The cricket authorities have invited all former Test skippers to witness the Test and has even formulated a special Muralidharan Farewell Committee to orgaanise the show.         
	We are planning to give him a good send-off and we will ensure that the event is memorable, SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga said.         
	SLC will organise a brief event before the commencement of the first Test and a grand felicitation at the end of the match.         
	According to officials, the 38-year-old bowler will be welcomed by the local bands from Galle when he will enter the stadium on the first day.         
	All former chairmen and secretaries of the Board have been invited to witness the farewell Test match and the Galle cricket ground is being spruced up for the occasion.           (PTI)

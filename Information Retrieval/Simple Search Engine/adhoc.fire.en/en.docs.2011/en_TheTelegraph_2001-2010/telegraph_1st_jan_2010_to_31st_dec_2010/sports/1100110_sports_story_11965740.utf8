The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis to join KKR camp today
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mendis to join KKR camp today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka spinner Ajantha Mendis will be joining the Kolkata Knight Riders ongoing pre-season preparatory camp from Sunday. Mendis, thus, will be the lone foreigner in the camp, which comprises of domestic players. Mendis was not included in the Sri Lanka squad for the ongoing tri-series in Bangladesh.         
	Ajantha Mendis will be joining the camp from tomorrow. Cheteshwar Pujara will also be in city by Saturday night and will be attending the camp from Sunday, said a KKR official. Former left-arm spinner and India discard Murali Karthik joined the camp Saturday.         
	Wasim Akram was once again the cynosure of the proceedings as he was busy offering suggestions and correcting flaws of players at the Eden. But the Pakistan great, who dons the role of a consultant with the Knights, chipped in with some batting tips, besides his usual bowling advises, as well.         
	Among the beneficiary was former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar, who said that batting tips from Akram were equally important.         
	He explains things to a batsman from a bowlers point of view. Thats a different way of looking at things. It is of course of great help. Besides, the person who boasts of a 257 not out as his highest score in Test cricket, certainly knows a thing or two about batting. But obviously, its the bowlers who are benefiting the most, Gavaskar said.         
	Moreover, the fact that he hails from the sub-continent, makes him even more valuable for us. We are looking forward to more sessions with him, he added.         
	Meanwhile, the Knights will be playing a practice match among themselves on the morrow. We will be having a match among ourselves in simulated match situations. There will more such matches during the camp, informed a KKR official.

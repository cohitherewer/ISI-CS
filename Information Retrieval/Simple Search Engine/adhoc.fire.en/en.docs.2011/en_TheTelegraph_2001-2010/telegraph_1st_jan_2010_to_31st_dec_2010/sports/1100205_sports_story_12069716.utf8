The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mark Boucher makes light of Afridis bite
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mark Boucher makes light of Afridis bite
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mark Boucher during a practice session in Nagpur, on Thursday. (PTI)                            
	Nagpur: Shahid Afridis bizarre biting-the-ball act in Perth, on Sunday, continues to be the topic of discussion (and amusement for some) in cricketing circles.         
	Not that everybody mentions Pakistans senior-most pro by name, but its quite clear who and what exactly is being alluded to.         
	And, so, nobody was left in any doubt when world record-holder Mark Boucher (with tongue close to his cheek) said: If our guys cant get the reverse swing in India, they might have to bite a few balls!         
	That was in response to a question on the Dale Steyns having to quickly adjust to the SG ball, which is different to the Kookaburra, in conditions where conventional swing itself could actually be at a premium.         
	Being pros, the South Africans have been practising with the SG balls, but Steyn and his fellow-speedsters are unlikely to quickly feel comfortable.         
	Asked by The Telegraph what made him tick even 13 years after his Test debut, Boucher replied: Staying fit, being committed and not believing in practising for the sake of doing so... In my view, perfect practice makes perfect, not that practice makes perfect...         
	Well, the 33-year-old keeper has close to 500 Test dismissals to show for his approach. Add the over 400 victims in ODIs and you then get the true worth of Mark Verdon Boucher.         
	The guys a legend.

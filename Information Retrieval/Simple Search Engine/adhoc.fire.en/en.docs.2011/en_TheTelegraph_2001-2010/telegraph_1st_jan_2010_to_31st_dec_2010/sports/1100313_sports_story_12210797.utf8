	Calcutta: East Bengal and Mahindra United are in contrasting situations as they square up for an important 16th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	While Mahindra have started the second leg with a bang, registering one of the most important wins of the I-League when they defeated defending champions Churchill Brothers in their own den. They followed it up with another 2-1 win over Air-India in the Mumbai derby. With 28 points from 15 games, the Red Devils from Mumbai are very much in contention to win the coveted title although 11 rounds are still to be played.         
	On the other hand, East Bengal, who are currently placed seventh in the table with 20 points from 15 games, lost the first two encounters of the return leg. A 1-2 defeat at home against Pune FC and a solitary-goal defeat at the hands of ILeague debutants Lajong FC.         
	Saturdays encounter will be a very important one for Phillippe de Ridder and his boys. Having lost three matches on the trot (this includes the 1-4 drubbing at the hands of Al-Ittihad), the red-and-gold brigade will like to log full points against the Mumbai outfit in order to get their I-League campaign back on track.         
	Much will depend on how well their two seasoned strikers  Bhaichung Bhutia and Yusif Yakubu  perform on the day.         
	The home team will certainly heave a sigh of relief as there will be no Subair Murithala Ali in the opposition ranks. Murithala, who is currently the top scorer with 12 goals is out with a double booking. Instead it will be India U-23 captain Sushil Kumar who will partner Mohammed Rafi upfront. The main man for Mahindra will certainly be Steven Dias whose incisive crosses can spell danger.

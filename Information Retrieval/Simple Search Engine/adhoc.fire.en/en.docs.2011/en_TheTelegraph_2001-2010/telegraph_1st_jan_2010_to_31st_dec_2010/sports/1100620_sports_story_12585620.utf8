The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Phil is at tied 2nd 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Phil is at tied 2nd

	Pebble Beach: Phil Mickelson shot 5-under-par 66 at Pebble Beach to climb within two shots of the lead at the halfway point of the US Open and give him a chance a chance to finally win something more than silver.         
	It wasnt enough to catch Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, who set the early pace Friday with a 3-under 68 to take a two-shot lead into the weekend. All that mattered to Mickelson, however, was getting back to even par.         
	He did one better.         
	With five birdies in a seven-hole stretch early in his round, Mickelson shot a tournament-best 66 and joined a shrinking group of five players who have beaten par over two days at Pebble Beach.         
	McDowell was at 3-under 139, and he made even more friends with a bogey on the final hole that assured 60-year-old Tom Watson of two more rounds in what likely will be his final US Open.         
	Mickelson was joined at 1-under 141 by two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els (68), 18-year-old Ryo Ishikawa (71) and Dustin Johnson (70), who has won the last two times in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and looks right at home in much firmer conditions.         
	Meanwhile, Indias Arjun Atwal missed the cut after carding a disastrous four-over 75 for the second successive day here.         
	The Orlando-based pro signed off with a total of eight-over 150.         
	It was an ominous start to the proceedings as Atwal stumbled to a bogey on the first. Another bogey followed on the third hole as Atwal made the turn two-over.           (AGENCIES)

	Bridgetown: Among the seven Persaud brothers, five of whom arrived from New York on Thursday, its 6-1 in Team Indias favour!         
	Only Krishen supports the West Indies, even when the Chris Gayles play India.         
	The rest  Vishnu, Ravi, Narine, Dev, Kumar and Mahindra  are huge fans of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co.         
	In the Caribbean, our roots are in Guyana, but our ancestors came from a village in UP, back in India. They were brought as indentured labour, in the 1830s, the brothers spokesman, Narine, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday, shortly before Indias first Super Eight match, against Australia, he said: Five of us have come here to cheer India... Vishnu has stayed back in New York, while Ravi is looking after the business in Guyana... This is one trip we had to make and we hope its going to be worth it...         
	The brothers will watch Sundays match, versus the West Indies, too.         
	According to Narine, the brothers hero-worship Sachin Tendulkar and are most disappointed that hes not available for T20 Internationals.         
	Theres also disappointment that Virender Sehwag couldnt make it because of an injury. After Sachin, today, hes the best for us, Narine added.         
	Dhoni and his men have, in fact, drawn hundreds from the US (the flight from New York, for example, is around five hours), with most booking tickets for the Super Eight matches at the charming Kensington Oval and for the May 16 final at the same venue.         
	We were let down in the (2007) World Cup... Its time to make amends, Narine signed off, heading for the Persaud brothers enclosure.         
	Some of the brothers are into business, while others are professionals in fields like banking.

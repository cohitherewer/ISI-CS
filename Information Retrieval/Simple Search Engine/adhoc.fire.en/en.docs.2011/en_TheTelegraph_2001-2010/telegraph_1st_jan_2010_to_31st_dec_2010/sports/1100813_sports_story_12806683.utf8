The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB to seek BCCI help
                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB to seek BCCI help
                      
	Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board will seek the help of the Indian cricket board and other countries to organise a one-day exhibition match in England to raise funds for the flood victims.         
	The PCB said Thursday it was working with the ECB to host the match between the Pakistan XI and an International XI during the Pakistan teams ongoing tour to England.         
	[Contacted by The Telegraph late on Thursday, a senior BCCI official said that no request had been received till now. A comment would only be made if and when the PCB gets in touch with the BCCI.]         
	This is the ideal opportunity for us to play our role in raising funds for the millions of people who have been displaced by the floods. We want to play our role in their rehabilitation, an official of the board said.         
	He said the PCB had already started contacting the different boards including the Indian board to make available some of their players for the exhibition match.         
	A statement of the PCB said that the match would be played between the Pakistan XI and an International XI on a date yet to be finalised.         
	Some 2000 people have been killed and millions displaced by the floods that have ravaged many parts of Pakistan and are still continuing to cause havoc leading to the government to appeal to the international community for aid.

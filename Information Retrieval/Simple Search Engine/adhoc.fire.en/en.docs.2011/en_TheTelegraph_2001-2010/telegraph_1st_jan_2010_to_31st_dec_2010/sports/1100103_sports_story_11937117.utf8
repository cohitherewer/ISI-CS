The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson heaps praise on Grayson 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ferguson heaps praise on Grayson 
            James Ducker   The Times, London            Ferguson                           
	Alex Ferguson believes that Leeds United could be back in the Barclays Premier League inside two years after applauding the job Simon Grayson has done revitalising one of the fallen giants of English football.         
	Manchester United face Leeds in the FA Cup third round at Old Trafford Sunday, the first meeting between the teams for almost six years, but Ferguson does not believe it will be long before the clubs are renewing their rivalry in the top flight.         
	Leeds are eight points clear at the top of League One and Ferguson believes that back-to-back promotions are within the capabilities of Grayson, who has impressed after only a year in charge at Elland Road.         
	They look to be a certainty for the Championship and the motivation from the manager means they have a great chance of being in the Premier League in the next couple of years, quot; the United manager said. Simon Grayson has done a fantastic job.         
	Leeds were relegated from the Premier League in 2004, after the club imploded financially, and then dropped into the third tier three years later, but Ferguson believes the atmosphere Sunday will be just as fierce as in previous years.         
	You dont have to spell out what Leeds have meant to Manchester United, he said. It is a fantastic, feisty occasion. It will be a brilliant atmosphere.         
	Ferguson has insisted that he will play a strong team against Leeds, despite United facing Manchester City in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final on Wednesday, when he is expected to keep faith with his young players.         
	The United manager continues to tinker with his team, however, with Sunday marking the hundredth consecutive match since Ferguson fielded an unchanged side,         
	We have two legs against City and you dont discount the ferocity of that but there will not be many changes on Sunday [from the team that defeated Wigan Athletic 5-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday], Ferguson said. Against City I will stick by my principle of playing young players.         
	United last won the FA Cup in 2004 and Ferguson hopes that his team will have the luck that he believes has deserted them in more recent years. The expectation at this club is that you try to win everything, he said.         
	You dont but you try and if you pick up one trophy a season, you have to be happy with that because a lot of clubs try to get the glory for themselves.         
	We have targets in the league and European Cup but you would not discount the FA Cup. Last season we were knocked out of the semi-final on penalty kicks [by Everton].         
	In 2007, we lost the final in the last couple of minutes to Chelsea and before that [in 2005] we lost to Arsenal in the final on penalties. We were unlucky then and you need luck in the Cup.         
	It should be called the Luck Cup because every time we have won it, we have had bits of luck. The team that has the luck usually gets it.           THE TIMES, LONDON

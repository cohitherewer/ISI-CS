The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettel hoping for similar result in China
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettel hoping for similar result in China
                      
	Sepang: Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel heads to a happy hunting ground in China looking every bit a future world champion after a dominating display at the Malaysian Grand Prix.         
	Vettel cruised at Sepang after blitzing past pole-sitting teammate Mark Webber and the second-placed Mercedes of Nico Rosberg before the first turn in Sundays race, never looking back in recording his sixth career win.         
	With Vettels main rivals at McLaren and Ferrari unable to challenge him after misjudging the Malaysian rain in qualifying, the German showed Australian teammate Webber who was boss.         
	The 25 points he earned for the victory moved him third in the drivers standings, two points behind leader Felipe Massa of Ferrari and level with the Brazilians teammate Fernando Alonso.         
	With the Chinese Grand Prix in two weeks time there is a strong chance the German will take the lead in the drivers championship, although the 22-year-old is taking nothing for granted.         
	Last year is last year, this year is this year, said Vettel, who earned his first win for the team in China last year. Hopefully we will have the same result in China, he said.         
	 Every race is a new challenge. Into the first race (in Bahrain) I think we were pretty quick. Ferrari was very quick and in Melbourne all of a sudden we were kind of back.

	Montreal: McLarens Lewis Hamilton timed his final run to perfection to snatch pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix on Saturday and shatter Red Bulls run of supremacy.         
	With barely seconds to spare and hardly any fuel left in his cars tank, the Briton roared around the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in one minute 15.105 seconds to end Red Bulls hopes of an eighth pole in a row.

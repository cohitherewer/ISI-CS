The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Ming may come good
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Ming may come good 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: The fields in Wednesdays seven-event card are big and very competitive, too. It makes the winner-spotting exercise that much difficult. Mings superior class is, however, bound to tell in the feature-event, the 1,200m Bol Publication Cup. In his last outing, Sanjay Kolses trained horse had gone down without a fight, indicating that the six-year-old needed the run. The in-form apprentice, Shezad Khan, partners the horse.           
	The challenge to Ming is expected to come from trainer Bharath Singhs Credit Squeeze who, however, has been heavily penalised for his recent runaway victory. Burst Of Speed is the other one who may make things difficult for Ming.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

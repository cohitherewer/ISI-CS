The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina, too, may go to SA early
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raina, too, may go to SA early
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Theres talk that coach Gary Kirsten will request the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to put Suresh Raina, too, on the list of those heading to South Africa early.         
	Raina hasnt got runs in any form against New Zealand and Kirsten appears to be worried. The selectors had no plans to rest him in the last three ODIs, but thats likely to change as the coach is expected to make a Raina-specific request, a top source told The Telegraph late on Wednesday.         
	For the record, Raina had scores of 3, 0, 20 and 3 in the three-Test series. Then, in the Guwahati ODI, he managed 13. The left-hander wasnt required to bat in Jaipur.         
	Kirsten has reason to be concerned, what with the South Africa quicks waiting to unleash a barrage of short-pitched deliveries. Raina, clearly, needs to acclimatise.         
	The request to the BCCI, one learns, is going to be made before the Big Five (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat) meet in Jaipur, at 9.00 am on Thursday, to pick the squad for the remaining ODIs.         
	If Raina goes out of the equation, then theres a good chance of Rohit Sharma making a comeback. Ajinkya Rahane seems to be the dark horse.         
	As of now, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, vice-captain Virender Sehwag, senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S.Laxman, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Cheteshwar Pujara will leave for South Africa between December 6 and 8.         
	They are going to be accompanied by Kirsten and, so, he wont be around for the last set of ODIs. Bowling consultant Eric Simons will be the acting coach. That he could be elevated (temporarily) was, in fact, first reported in these columns.         
	Rookie quicks Jaydev Unadkat and Umesh Yadav may also be part of that contingent.         
	The three-Test series begins on December 16. The five ODIs are going to be played later. That series will be preceded by a solitary T20 International.

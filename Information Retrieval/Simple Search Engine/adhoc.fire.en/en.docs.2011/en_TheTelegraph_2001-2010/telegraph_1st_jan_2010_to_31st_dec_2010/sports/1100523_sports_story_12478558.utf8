            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Union sport ministrys attempt to fix the tenures of officials of national sports federations (NSFs) suffered a setback on Saturday when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) invoked the threat of sanctions if the governments meddling in the affairs of sports bodies did not stop.         
	In a letter to the sports ministry, a copy of which was released by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), the IOC has asked the Indian government to resolve the matter amicably.         
	We would like to remind you, once more, that in the event where the directives issued by the ministry of youth affairs and sports would be imposed on the Olympic Movement in India (even for future elections), we would be forced to report this case to the next IOC executive board meeting (in June) according to the rules of the Olympic Charter, said the letter issued jointly on Friday by the IOC and OCA.         
	We have taken note of the unanimous position taken recently by the IOA and the National Sports Federations in India against the directives issued by the ministry of youth affairs and sports on May 1, 2010, the letter added.         
	The IOC stand is yet another embarrassment for the sports ministry. On Friday, the Delhi high court ruled as illegal, the suspension on the K.P.S. Gill-led Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) and termed illegal the bodys derecognition by the sports ministry.

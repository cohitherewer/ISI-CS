The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Guillermo wins Thailand Open
                                                                                                                       7                                      Guillermo wins Thailand Open
                      
	Bangkok: Guillermo Garcia-Lopez overcame a determined Jarkko Nieminen 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 to win the Thailand Open on Sunday and clinch the second title of his career.         
	The unheralded Spaniard showed the same spark and resilence he used, to conquer world No.1 Rafael Nadal in the semi-final a day earlier, to triumph over the Finn in a tense and thrilling battle of two unseeded players.         
	Garcia-Lopez made his break in the seventh game of the first set, chasing after a seemingly irretrievable drop shot and responding with a better one of his own to stun Nieminen. He looked impressive throughout and came out fighting in the second set, utilising his fierce backhand and relentlessly whacking the ball into all corners of the court to test the world No.53 and level the score.         
	The deciding set was a thriller and went down to the wire, with Nieminen refusing to quit at 5-4 down and saving a string of match points when Garcia-Lopez had one hand on the trophy.

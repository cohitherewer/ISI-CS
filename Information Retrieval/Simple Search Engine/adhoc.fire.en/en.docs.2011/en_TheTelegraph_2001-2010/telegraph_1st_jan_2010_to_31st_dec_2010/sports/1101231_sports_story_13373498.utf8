The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahil owes it to Arjun 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rahil owes it to Arjun 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Rahil Gangjee                           
	Calcutta: For Rahil Gangjee, 2010 has been quite a year. And he readily agrees. Why not? He secured a card for the 2011 US Nationwide Tour after six gruelling rounds and thats a remarkable achievement.         
	Now, in town, he is preparing for the season ahead with some sessions at the Royal. It (the Q-School) was really tough, travelling day in and day out, playing golf and living out of a suitcase, Rahil told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Now that I have qualified I have to take care of some important things like getting a car, getting my visa and finding a flat, the golfer, who will be based in Atlanta during the entire duration of Nationwide Tour, said. Those things I have to do very fast, as the season starts in late February, he said. The 32-year-old will make his first stop at Panama and says he is confident of putting up a good show. I will give my best shot.         
	To play in the 2012 US PGA Tour Rahil will have to make a top 25 finish in the Order of Merit. There is another way. If I swin three tournaments, I straightaway go to the US PGA. But one thing both will be tough. A top-25 or winning three titles, the 2004 China Open winner said.         
	Playing in Nationwide, which will run till October, means the Calcutta pro wont be seen in the Asian Tour. Yeah, I think so. But I will be definitely play in the Indian Open.         
	The conversation obviously veered towards Arjun Atwals role in shaping his career. I owe a lot to Arjun. He has been an inspiration for me. And it was because of him that I tried my luck at the Q-school. You see, he has been after me for the last four years to come to the US. But somehow, I could not. There were financial problems. And also there is this psychological barrier you have to break. After all, playing in the US is real tough.         
	You know the final round was in Orlando. And it was very kind of Arjun to let me stay at his place. He was in Calcutta at that time and I was using his car also, Rahil said.         
	So, how does he see this sudden spurt in golf in India? Its a good sign. Arjun (Atwal), Jeev (Milkha Singh) and Jyoti (Randhawa) started the thing in our country. They showed with hard work we can achieve anything. Now, the onus is on the next generation to carry it forward.         
	And other than Rahil, who are the players who will carry it forward? Anirban Lahiri, Himmat Rai and Gaganjeet Bhullar. These three are doing really well. Future really looks very bright for Indian golf, Rahil signed off.

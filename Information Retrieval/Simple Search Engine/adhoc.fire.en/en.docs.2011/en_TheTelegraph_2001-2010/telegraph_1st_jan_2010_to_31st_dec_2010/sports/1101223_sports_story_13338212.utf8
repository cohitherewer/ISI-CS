The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Khosla holds top seed 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Khosla holds top seed 
                      
	Groningen (The Netherlands): Talented youngster Shiven Khosla held top seeded Grandmaster Vladimir Baklan of Ukraine to a creditable draw, in the first round of Groningen International Open chess tournament here.         
	Playing white on the top board, it was a chance-less effort by Shiven who played solidly right through to deny the top seed a first round victory.         
	On a day that saw handful of upsets, Grandmaster and former world junior champion Abhijeet Gupta survived a scare at the hands of Fide Master Toms Kantans of Latvia.         
	Two Indian International Masters in the fray had an easy outing in the opener with Sahaj Grover outplaying Nick Bijlsma of Holland and Ashwin proving too good for local hopeful Julian Van Overdam.         
	Vahe Baghdasaryan of Armenia caused a major flutter defeating Grandmaster and fourth seed Mark Bluvshtein of Canada. The Armenian was in his element right through the game and stunned the Canadian with black pieces to open his account in style.

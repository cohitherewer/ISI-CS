	Sestriere (Italy): Juventus midfielder Claudio Marchisio is set to be the playmaker in Italys World Cup team.         
	I really like him in that position because of all the midfielders hes the one who moves the most without the ball, coach Marcello Lippi said Sunday. He inserts himself and accompanies the action and finds the open spaces. Plus, he helps with coverage in midfield.         
	During a 60-minute training match against fifth-division club Russi, Marchisio started in the playmaker role in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Vincenzo Iaquinta on the right wing, Antonio Di Natale on the left and Alberto Gilardino as the centre forward.         
	Gianluigi Buffon was in goal, Christian Maggio lined up at right back, Leonardo Bonucci and Fabio Cannavaro were the centre backs, Gianluca Zambrotta was left back and Gennaro Gattuso and Andrea Pirlo played in central midfield.         
	In the second half, Mauro Camoranesi replaced Di Natale and took up his usual spot on the right wing, with Iaquinta shifting to the left. Italy won 8-0 with three goals from Di Natale, two each from Gilardino and Iaquinta and one from Zambrotta.         
	Once Giorgio Chiellini recovers from a calf injury, he will likely regain his starting spot at either centre or left back, and Daniele De Rossi is almost certain to replace Gattuso once he returns from a minor injury.         
	In a second training match, Lippi used his reserves in a 2-0 win over Settimo Torinese, another fifth-division club, getting goals from Giampaolo Pazzini and Simone Pepe.         
	Lippi needs to cut five players from his 28-man squad before Tuesdays deadline for the final 23-man list, but he didnt drop any hints on the identity of those likely to drop out.         
	Just have some patience and on Tuesday evening youll know everything, the coach said at a news conference. Italy face Mexico in a friendly in Brussels on Thursday, then travels to Geneva to play Switzerland on Saturday.         
	The Azzurri depart for South Africa on June 8 and open their World Cup campaign against Paraguay on June 14. Their other opponents in Group F are New Zealand and Slovakia.         
	Meanwhile, Fiorentina boss Cesare Prandelli agreed a four-year deal on Sunday to become Italy coach after the World Cup, ending a saga that had threatened to cast a shadow over the teams defence of their title.         
	Lippi had never publicly said he was leaving after the June 11-July 11 tournament and conflicting signals from the World Cup winner and Italian soccer federation president Giancarlo Abete prompted an array of rumours.

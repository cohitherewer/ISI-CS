The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury scare for Saha
                                                                                                                       7                                      Injury scare for Saha
  - McCullum may play vs Delhi DareDevils
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders Wriddhiman Saha has sustained an injury on his left thumb while keeping against the Kings XI Punjab on Sunday. Its still not sure whether Wriddhiman will recover in time for their match against the Delhi DareDevils on Wednesday.         
	The Bengal stumper had his left thumb heavily bandaged on Monday evening when he came to attend a promotional at the team hotel.         
	I hurt my left thumb while keeping on Sunday. One delivery bounced in front before I could collect in the process, I hurt my left thumb. There is pain and swelling. However its not a fracture and X-ray wasnt needed, Wriddhiman said.         
	Asked whether he would be able to play on Wednesday, he put up a brave front. I have played through similar kind of pain earlier. Theres pain but that doesnt mean that I have ruled out the possibility of playing. The condition of my thumb will be assessed tomorrow and accordingly a call will be taken, he said.         
	Wriddhiman, so far, has had a quite tournament scoring only 53 runs in nine matches with four dismissals (two stumpings and two catches).         
	If Wriddhiman doesnt recover from his injury in time, Brendon McCullum will be donning the big gloves as there is no second Indian wicket-keeper in the squad (Haladhar Das of Orissa, who was kept as cover for Wriddhiman, was released once McCullum arrived).         
	With Chris Gayle, Angelo Mathews and Shane Bond almost certain to retain their places in the playing XI, McCullum may replace David Hussey as their fourth foreign player.         
	According to team sources, even if Wriddhiman is able to play, McCullum may get a look in which will give the team additional firepower.         
	During Mondays optional session, all eyes were on Ishant Sharma and McCullum. Even India colts pacer Jaydev Unadkat, who got a good thrashing on Sunday, was seen sweating it out at the nets. Unadkat, who looked totally out of place, is unlikely to get another chance in the tournament.         
	However, bowling coach Wasim Akram was not present during the afternoon practice session. It was coach Dav Whatmore and cricket manager Jaideep Mukherjee who co-ordinated the session.         
	Our endeavour is to win the matches but unfortunately we have lost a few. We now need to string a few wins in the remaining matches, Whatmore said at the promotional event in the evening.         
	The Delhi DareDevils squad arrived late in the evening without their captain Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag. It was learnt that the duo will arrive on Tuesday morning as practice has been scheduled for the evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Whatever the job, Gary is to be trusted
                                                                                                                       7                                      Whatever the job, Gary is to be trusted
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Gary Kirsten    
	Calcutta: Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the national selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) arent sworn enemies, but they arent exactly best buddies, either.         
	Yet, if things havent reached a stage of confrontation, except once, to an extent only (in late 2008), then its thanks largely to coach Gary Kirsten.         
	The captain and coach are co-opted members of the selection committee.         
	Very often, the captain and coach cant be present during the meetings... When that happens, almost invariably, its Kirsten who conveys the captains views to Srikkanth (the chief selector)... Hes the via medium of communication, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	The source added: Dhoni finds Kirsten completely trustworthy... The coach has helped maintain civility, even though there have been instances when Dhoni has actually felt very frustrated at selection committee meetings...         
	According to the source, there was a time when Dhoni was even contemplating requesting the Board president, Shashank Manohar, to permanently excuse him from attending the meetings.         
	That bit, however, couldnt be confirmed from the Board.         
	Getting back to Kirsten, obviously, hes been performing a rather sensitive role to perfection. Typically, in his quiet not-for-the-cameras manner.         
	Kirsten, who has helped take India to No.1 in Test cricket and No.2 in ODIs (we were, briefly, at the top in the 50-over game, too), is on contract till the 2011 World Cup.         
	As already reported, Cricket South Africa, which has hired and fired coaches in plenty after the Bob Woolmer era ended in mid-1999, intends to grab Kirsten.         
	Kirsten, 42, served South Africa with distinction during his playing days  1993-2004, making 101 appearances in Tests (7,289 runs) and 185 in ODIs (6,798 runs).         
	Many in Kirstens homeland are convinced he can make a difference in a different role as well.

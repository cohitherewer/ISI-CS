The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karims boys hold bungling Bagan 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Karims boys hold bungling Bagan 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto after missing a penalty on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Coaches may come and coaches may go, but for Mohun Bagan, one thing remains the same: their pathetic performance match after match.         
	On a hot and humid Saturday evening at the Salt Lake Stadium, it was Salgaocars turn to show how bad Bagan are at the moment. The young and energetic Salgaocar outfit, coached by Karim Bencharifa, held the green and maroon brigade to a 1-1 draw in the I-League encounter.         
	Edeh Chidi put the home team ahead with a 62nd minute header but Mandjou Keita latched onto a delightful Rocus Lamare through to punish a lax Bagan defence with his 76-minute equaliser.         
	If Bagan looked pathetic under the glare of the stadium lights, their man for all season, Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, was equally bad on the day. He was slow to react to the deliveries from the flanks, looked tired and uninterested and, to top it all, missed a penalty six minutes from close. With the scores tied at 1-1, Barreto converting from the spot could have meant three points for Bagan.         
	Man of the match and Salgaocar goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey correctly anticipated and dived to his right to thwart Barretos lackadaisical attempt. It was the Brazilians fourth missed penalty of the season and newly-appointed coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said at the post-match news conference that next time Barreto should give someone else a chance.         
	Things are not going well for the man who, till the other day, could do no wrong for Bagan. The choicest of expletives hurled at him from the stands shows that the fans are no longer ready to bear his indolence. Its time Barreto introspects and makes a respectful exit from the field.         
	Saturdays result is all the more humiliating for Bagan because it came against a team coached by one who had been in the Bagan hot seat till the other day.         
	Bencharifa on Saturday surely scored a point over Bagan. He packed his midfield with six men and put one man  Keita  upfront. That probably surprised Bagan who were expecting a more pragmatic 4-4-2 formation from Bencharifa.         
	Still, Bagan could have won this match but for one Chaubey, who had a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of outing. If he allowed Chidi a free-header off a Marcos corner inside the six-yard box, he also made at least three crucial saves. If he brought down Chidi to concede a late penalty, he saved the shot from the spot as well!         
	As Bencharifa said later: Just awesome, this match. He (Chaubey) is a senior player and knows his responsibilities.         
	The Barretos now have 26 points from 19 matches, while Salgaocar have 22 from 20. For Bagan, 2009-10 is turning out to be another season of big hype and false hope.

	S. Padmanabhans ward Palazzios Sun had no peers in the 14-horse field, lined up for the 1,200m Vandrevala Foundation Sprinters Cup, in Mumbai on Saturday. The 8-1 shot powered his way to the lead from the start to score in the hands of jockey Martin Dwyer. Equally, impressive was trainer Zadmal Singhs Maseeha who won the Stayers Cup.

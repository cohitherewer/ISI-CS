            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The management of CFL Premier Division debutants Southern Samity has decided that I.M. Vijayans future with the club will depend on the teams performance against Mohammedan Sporting on Thursday. If Southern fail to log home a point, Vijayan will be getting the boot on Thursday itself.         
	We have given him a good team. We expect a point on Thursday failing which Subhas Bhowmick would be appointed technical advisor. We cant rely singularly on Vijayan as he has failed to deliver till now. We have a lot of members. We are answerable to them, a senior official said.

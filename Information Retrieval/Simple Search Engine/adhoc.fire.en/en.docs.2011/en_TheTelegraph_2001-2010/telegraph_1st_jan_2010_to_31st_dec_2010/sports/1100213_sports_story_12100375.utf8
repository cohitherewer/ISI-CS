The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | VVS gears up

  - Sreesanth doesnt go flat out at nets       A STAFF REPORTER            Harbhajan                                 
	Calcutta: There was one thing in common during the start of the practice sessions of both India and South Africa.         
	When the Proteas entered the arena, skipper Graeme Smith and spinner Paul Harris walked straight up to the wicket. They stood there for around 15 minutes trying to gauge the nature of pitch, which has been the centre of all discussion during the past few days.         
	Ditto when the Indians entered the field. Having a look at the wicket was what topped the agenda of skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	As promised by curator Prabir Mukherjee, a portion of the grass that was there on the wicket was mowed during the day.         
	Still it bears a greenish tinge, which will definitely not be to the liking of the Indian team. Especially, with someone responding to the name of Dale Steyn in the opposition ranks.         
	Later in the day, there were rumours that Harbhajan Singh had requested CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya for a turning track, which the latter denied emphatically.         
	I was at the ground during the installation of the electronic scoreboard. Harbhajan came and wished me. It was a courtesy chat for about 10 minutes.         
	Its absolutely baseless for some people to spread rumours that Harbhajan asked any favours regarding the pitch. Isnt it quite stupid that I will talk about this in front of hundreds of mediapersons on the field! Dalmiya said when asked about his meeting with Harbhajan.         
	During the two-and-half hour session of the Indians practice, the centre of attraction was definitely VVS Laxman.         
	If Laxman looked fit as a fiddle, same cant be said about Sreesanth who is coming back from a hamstring injury. The Kerala speedster didnt go flat out at nets.         
	Laxman, who missed the last two Test matches (Dhaka and Nagpur) due to a split webbing, looked absolutely fit and raring to go. He was busy taking slip catches for close to half an hour. He also looked comfortable while facing both pacers and spinners at the nets.

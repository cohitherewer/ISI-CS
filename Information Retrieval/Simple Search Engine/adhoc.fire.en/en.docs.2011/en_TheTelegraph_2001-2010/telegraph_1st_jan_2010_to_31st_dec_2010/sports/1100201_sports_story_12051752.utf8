  - Guys like Murray have made me a better player                       
	Melbourne: Roger Federers emphatic Australian Open victory over Andy Murray on Sunday was the perfect riposte to those who have questioned his continued hunger for Grand Slam success.         
	The 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 win shattered British dreams of a first mens Grand Slam champion in 74 years and dashed the notion that the new husband and father might temper his pursuit of glory after breaking Pete Samprass Grand Slam record.         
	I always knew I had it in my hand. The question is (did) I have it in my mind and in my legs, Federer told reporters after extending his record to 16 Grand Slams, two more than Sampras and a whopping 10 more than nearest current challenger Rafael Nadal.         
	Thats something I had to work extremely hard at. Now I feel like obviously Im being pushed a great deal by the new generation coming up.         
	I think thats also thanks to guys like Murray. Theyve made me a better player, because I think this has been one of my finest performances, you know, in a long time, or maybe forever.         
	A year after shedding bitter tears in the wake of his five-set loss to Nadal for the title in 2009, the imperious win left his opponent choking back sobs, having missed five set points in an epic third-set tiebreaker.         
	The raw emotion that cut Murrays presentation speech short was all too familiar to Federer, who spent months battling to find lost confidence and form last year.         
	You know, in a way it was hard to watch, but at the same time I like seeing players who care for the game, said Federer. Its nice to see. So you wish only the best for him.         
	The next one is not gonna get any easier (for Murray). But his game is so good that Im convinced he will win one.         
	The latest Grand Slam success has not fuelled any new ambitions for Federer, who said simply he hoped his twin girls might join his wife Mirka in the players box next year.         
	My game is not as taxing as other players games. I also think I have a very relaxed mind when it comes to the game of tennis. But off the court, its a matter of relaxing and enjoying it, you know, seeing friends and families. Theres more important things than tennis after all.         
	I think thats something Ive always had a clear vision of how my life is. I think thats also helped me to go through better and tougher phases, because I know this is an incredible trip Im on.         
	Well see where it ends, you know. I hope not anytime soon.           (REUTERS)

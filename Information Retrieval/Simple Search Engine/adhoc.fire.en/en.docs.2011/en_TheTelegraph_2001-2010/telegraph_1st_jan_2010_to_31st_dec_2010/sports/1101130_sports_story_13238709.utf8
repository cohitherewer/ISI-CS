            A STAFF REPORTER            Sangakkara                                 
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkaras impressive 150 against the West Indies, at the R. Premadasa Stadium, in Colombo, has helped him dethrone Sachin Tendulkar from the top spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen.         
	The 33-year-olds 24th Test century, which came off 216 balls and included 12 fours and one six, lifting the Sri Lankan back to the top of the rankings and forcing Tendulkar into second place.         
	South Africas AB de Villiers, the current ICC ODI Player of the Year, and Englands Jonathan Trott, entered the top ten of the Test batsmens rankings for the first time.         
	De Villiers hit a record-breaking unbeaten 287, against Pakistan, in Abu Dhabi, to move up eight places to the fifth spot while Trotts 29 and 135 not out against Australia, in the first Ashes Test, in Brisbane, has seen the 29-year-old right-handed batsman rise to the eighth position.         
	In the rankings for Test bowlers, Indias Zaheer Khan has risen to number three in the world, his highest ranking to date after taking four for 90, against New Zealand, in the second Test, in Hyderabad.         
	Australias hattrick hero Peter Siddle and Englands Steven Finn have both climbed the rankings at the conclusion of the first Ashes Test. Siddle has risen to 14th after claiming six for 144 in the first Test, at the Gabba, while ICC Young Player of the Year, Finn, has broken into the top 20 in 19th place after his six-wicket-haul.         
	There is no change in the rankings for Test all-rounders with South Africas Jacques Kallis still leading the field.

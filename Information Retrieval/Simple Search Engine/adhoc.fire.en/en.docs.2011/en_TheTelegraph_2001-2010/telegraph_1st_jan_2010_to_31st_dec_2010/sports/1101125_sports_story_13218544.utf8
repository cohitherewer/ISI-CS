	London: Tomas Berdych won his first match at the ATP World Tour Finals on Wednesday and left Andy Roddick with an 0-2 record by beating the American 7-5, 6-3. The sixth-ranked Czech converted his first break point in the 11th game of the first set, only minutes after saving two set points from Roddick.         
	In the second set, Roddick was annoyed by the advertising lights at the feet of the line judges, which flashed red sometimes while play was going on. Shortly after complaining, Roddick was broken for the second time, giving Berdych a 3-2 lead.         
	Roddick sent a ball high into the rafters in anger, and then broke his racket on his foot, drawing a code violation from the chair umpire.         
	Berdych, who is now 1-1 at the round-robin tournament, held serve twice after the incident and then broke Roddick again in the final game.         
	Berdych is making his debut at the season-ending tournament for the top eight players in the world. He lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets in his first match and next faces top-ranked Rafael Nadal.         
	On Tuesday, Roger Federer stretched his record to 2-0 by easily beating Andy Murray 6-4, 6-2 in Group B, while Robin Soderling defeated David Ferrer 7-5, 7-5. All four can still advance after Thursdays final round-robin matches.         
	In doubles, Wesley Moodie of South Africa and Dick Norman of Belgium beat Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Oliver Marach of Austria 6-1, 6-3. (agencies)

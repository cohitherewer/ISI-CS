The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav: CLT20 will help youngsters
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav: CLT20 will help youngsters
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sourav Ganguly in Mumbai, on Friday                           
	Mumbai: Sourav Ganguly on Friday said the young batsmen who held out a lot of promise in the Indian Premier League would get a chance to test and prove themselves in tougher conditions during the Champions League T20 tournament in South Africa next month.         
	Youngsters like Manish Pandey will get to bat in tough conditions, which will definitely help them and take Indian cricket forward, said the former India captain, who will be on the commentary panel for the T20 event to be played from September 10 to 26.         
	Besides the Royal Challengers Bangalore, for whom Pandey plays, the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings are the other two teams from India that have qualified for the Champions League.         
	Sourav said that with the tournament coinciding with the start of the South African season, facing up to quality pace bowlers on the fresh and juicy pitches would be a challenge for the Indian batsmen.         
	The pitches will have an impact... The technicalities and planning have to be different because they (the pitches) wont be flat as in India... Smaller totals in the region of 130-140 would be the norm, Sourav said.         
	The players would also get to play against the best teams, which is not always the case in the IPL. Guys like Shikhar Dhawan (of MI) would be up against the pace of Shaun Tait (of Victoria Bushrangers from Australia).         
	Sourav said while the two South African teams  Highveld Lions and Warriors  will enjoy the home advantage, the chances of other teams doing well cannot be ruled out.         
	Local teams will know the conditions well. The Australian teams too are used to such conditions. Victoria are a very good T20 team. Bangalore too will have a chance with players like (Ross) Taylor, (Jacques) Kallis, and (Dale) Steyn, he said.         
	Im keeping my fingers crossed (as anything could happen) in this format. There are teams like Guyana, which has produced some of the greats of West Indies cricket like (Carl) Hooper, Ramnaresh (Sarwan) and (Shivnarine) Chanderpaul, he added.         
	Amitabh Bachchan, who has been roped in as brand ambassador for CLT20, was also present on the occasion.         
	T20 cricket is just exciting. The time, the constraint, the fact that each player has to perform from the very first ball ... Im honoured that Ive been a part of this now. I wish all the three Indian teams well. I hope that Sachin (Tendulkar), (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and (Anil) Kumble do well, Bachchan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi: Trying to keep the morale high
                                                                                                                       7                                        Afridi: Trying to keep the morale high
                  Shahid Afridi in Taunton, on Wednesday                     
	Taunton: Pakistan ODI and Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi said he was looking forward to getting back to cricket despite the challenge of leading a team engulfed in a spot-fixing scandal. Pakistan are due to play Somerset, here, on Thursday in their first game since several members of the side were implicated in a betting scam.         
	Afridi, speaking to reporters at Somersets County Ground on Wednesday, said: We are definitely looking forward to getting back to cricket. We did a very good practice session Tuesday.         
	Myself and the coach (Waqar Younis) are trying to keep morale high. Its always very difficult in these conditions against a good team but they are all really focussed.         
	The News of the World alleged on Sunday that bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, as well as Test captain Salman Butt, were involved in a plan to deliberately bowl no-balls in the fourth Test against England last week as part of a scheme devised by a fixer it had contacted in a sting operation.         
	Afridi didnt play in that match, having resigned the Test captaincy after Pakistans 150-run loss in the first of two Tests against Australia at Lords, in July.         
	But the leg-spinning all-rounder remained captain of Pakistans ODI and Twenty20 teams.         
	He has now returned for the limited overs leg of the tour, which sees Pakistan play two Twenty20 internationals against England  the reigning world champions in that format  in Cardiff on Sunday and Tuesday, before the teams contest a five-match one-day series.         
	Afridi insisted his players would be able to put the furore to one side and concentrate on the task at hand when they faced Somerset.         
	What has happened has gone, he said. We are here to play good cricket. Its a big challenge for me personally, playing in English conditions is always difficult.         
	We are all looking forward to it. It has been really difficult but we can forget everything, get out, play cricket and entertain the people.                 (Agencies)

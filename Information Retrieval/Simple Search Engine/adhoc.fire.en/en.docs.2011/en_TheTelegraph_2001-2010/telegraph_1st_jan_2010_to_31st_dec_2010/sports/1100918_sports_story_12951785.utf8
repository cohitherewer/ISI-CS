The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shukla set to take Modis post
                                                                                                                       7                                        Shukla set to take Modis post
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Rajeev Shukla                           
	Calcutta: Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Shukla, who heads the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association, is set to be back as a vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), this time from Central.         
	The BCCI has five vice-presidents, one representing each zone.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources in the BCCI, Shukla (a member of the Congress party), will replace Lalit Kumar Modi, the suspended chairman and commissioner of the Indian Premier League.         
	Modi, in fact, is staring at an expulsion and worse.         
	During Jagmohan Dalmiyas era, Shukla had once been a vice-president from East, wearing the National Cricket Club colours. He had another term, after being nominated by Assam, when Union minister Sharad Pawar was at the helm.         
	An administrator from Central occupying Easts seat was odd, yes, but even Modi had started off by being vice-president from North, even though he then headed Rajasthan, which is an affiliate from Central.         
	Thankfully, such arrangements of convenience have stopped.         
	Now, of course, the focus is on September 29, when elections are going to be held for all posts, including those of the vice-presidents, during the BCCIs AGM in Mumbai.         
	Indications are that Shukla, who has often served as a bridge between the BCCI and the powers-that-be, in New Delhi, will be elected unopposed.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that Narayanswamy Srinivasan can continue as the BCCI secretary even after becoming the president-elect.         
	As things stand, its assumed that hes going to carry on in his current position, for another year, and succeed president Shashank Manohar next September.         
	Like the other office-bearers, both Manohar and Srinivasan took charge in 2008 and are eligible to seek re-election for one more year.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Third Nigerian tests positive
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Folashade Abuganj                           
	New Delhi: The doping menace continued to haunt the Commonwealth Games, even after its completion, as Nigerian medal winner Folashade Abugan became the fourth athlete to fail the dope test, on Friday.         
	A winner of two silver medals in the womens 400m race and the 4x400m relay, Folashade has been stripped of medals after she waived the right to have her B sample analysed.         
	According to a statement from the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), Folashades A sample was found to demonstrate consistency with an exogenous origin of endogenous steroids. The delta values indicate an application of testosterone prohormone, which is prohibited under the current Wada prohibited list S1 anabolic agents.         
	Folashade, thus, becomes the third Nigerian to fail a dope test in the Delhi Games, after 110m hurdler Samuel Okon and Osayomi Oludamola, who claimed gold in the womens 100m.         
	Indias 20km walker Rani Yadav was the only non-Nigerian athlete to flunk the test. The Uttar Pradesh girl, who appeared before a hearing panel, has asked for the result of her B sample to be tested.         
	The silver medal for the womans 400 metres will now be awarded to Aliann Tabitha Pompey of Guyana, with the bronze medal going to Christine Amertil of the Bahamas.         
	Besides this, Nigerias silver medal in womens 4x400metre relay, of which Folashade was a part, will now be awarded to England, and the bronze will go to Canada.

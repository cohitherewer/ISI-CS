                                                                                                                       7                                      In the right process: Kirsten
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gary Kirsten is looking forward to the Asia Cup with optimism and not reading much into the reverses during the tri-series in Zimbabwe.         
	I am happy with our effort in the two T20 games and I am looking forward to the Asia Cup That will be another opportunity for us. The Zimbabwe series convinced me that we are in the right process, Kirsten said after Indias training session in Dambulla on Tuesday.         
	Elaborating, Kirsten said: Its a new beginning for the World Cup and the series helped us to identify the areas to work on fielding and fitness are the primary areas of focus.         
	 Most importantly, players have realised that they have to work on key areas to be more competitive. The last few months also helped us to realise the need to explore more options in fast bowling and we are moving on the right track, he added.

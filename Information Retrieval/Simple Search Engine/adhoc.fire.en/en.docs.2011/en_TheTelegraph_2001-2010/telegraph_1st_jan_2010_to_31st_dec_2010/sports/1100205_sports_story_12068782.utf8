	New Delhi: The next one year could be the most crucial period for the progress of Indian football, national coach Bob Houghton said on Thursday.         
	Addressing a press conference on the eve of the national teams departure for a two-week training camp in Dubai, Houghton said the team would go through a series of training camps and play several practice matches to prepare for the Asian Cup to be played on Doha in January 2011.         
	Houghton, under whom India won three tournaments in the past three years, said he would attach more importance to the Asian Cup final rounds than focusing on the World Cup qualifiers in October.         
	The World Cup is surely huge but there could only be a maximum of four matches, said the British coach. In the Asia Cup we have at least three matches in the group league and if we manage to qualify for the second round, then we get to play against some of the best teams in the continent.         
	The preparations, Houghton said, would have to be top class for the Asian Cup. In Dubai, we play two matches against local club teams. We have five international friendlies lined up in September though the names of the opponents are yet to be finalised, said Houghton. In December, a month before the Asian Cup, the Indian team would travel to either UAE or Oman for another preparatory stint.         
	In between in July-August, Bhaichung Bhutia and his boys would be based in Lisbon. According to Houghton, he will expand his squad to 30 boys for six months between June and December.         
	The coach, however, admitted that he would be travelling to Dubai with more than half a dozen injured players, the latest to join the list being Indias Nehru Cup hero goalkeeper Subrata Paul. The Pune FC goalkeeper, who suffered a shoulder injury on Wednesday, would be out of action for a week.         
	On NS Manjus injury, Houghton said the defender should have been fielded much before the Salgaocar game in the I-League. He got injured around six months back. I dont know what rehabilitation programme he had gone through but he should have played long ago, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag impress in opening tie
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag impress in opening tie
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: When the mornings bright, theres every reason to hope for a brighter day. And Chirag United, who missed the glory of annexing the Calcutta Football League crown by a whisker last year, look even better equipped to challenge the dominance of the Big Two this season.         
	While they didnt exactly sparkle during their 2-0 victory over Railway FC in a CFL Premier Division tie, at the Barasat Stadium, on Monday, the promise of a better future was surely there.         
	If the Junior Elija-Branco Cardozo combine look sharp, beware of the edge when Joshimar gets a chance to flaunt his goal-scoring skills.         
	Branco, in fact, was quite enterprising on the day chasing balls and setting up passes. And he did the most important job on the field too  scored a goal. As early as in the 11th minute, Chika Wali connected well a Gouranga Biswas corner only to find his header thwarted by the crosspiece. Branco was spot on to nod in the rebound to give Chirag the lead.         
	The former Mohun Bagan player, who still rues not getting enough chances in his previous club, was instrumental in the second goal as well. Brancos centre in the 33rd minute was misjudged by Railway FC goalkeeper Soumen Mondal. Junior, lurking nearby, cashed in on the lapse to head in a smart goal.         
	Chirag could have made it 3-0 in the dying minutes of the match had Jerry Zirsanga not messed up a sitter from point blank range after Junior had set him up.         
	For the Railwaymen, it was Palash Karmakar who impressed. While a long-ranger from Palash was perilously close to the goal, one of his free-kicks swerved sharply before Chirag keeper Somnath Khara could tip it over.         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Somnath Khara, Sergey Tokov (Bapi Saha, 27th), Arnab Mondal, Chika Wali, Noushad K, Gouranga Biswas (Jerry Zirsanga, 69th), Lalkamal Bhowmick (Asif K, 58th), Nascimento Silveira, Sheikh Sabir Ali, Branco Cardozo, Junior Elija.         
	Railway FC: Soumen Mondal, Nilangshu Mitra, Sundar Mandi, Avijit Dutta, Swarnabha Barua, Biplab Naskar, Mrinmay Samanta (Amar Hela, 77th), Palash Karmakar, Sankha Roy Chowdhury, Tarak Nath (Mithun Dey, 68th), Sanjeeb Mishra (Subhranil Dutta, 88th.)         
	Referee: Ajit Dutta.

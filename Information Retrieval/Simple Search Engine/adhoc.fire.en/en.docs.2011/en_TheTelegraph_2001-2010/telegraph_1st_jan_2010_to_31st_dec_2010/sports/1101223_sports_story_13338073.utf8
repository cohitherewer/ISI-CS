	Calcutta: By his own admission, Tolgay Ozebe is not doing anything special. He is just doing his job. The job of scoring goals.         
	I am not a goal machine. I dont like that tag. That puts extra pressure. I am just doing my job and helping the team in the process. As long as I can do that I will be satisfied, he said on Wednesday, after East Bengal beat Salgaocar in an I-League match .         
	This match was important for us. Two teams on top of the table were crossing swords. I am happy that my goal turned out be the deciding one, the Australian striker said. Its nice to see them happy. After all we play for them and they are our source of inspiration, he added.         
	Coach Trevor James Morgan said his team was under pressure in the first half. They were trying too many things. Sometimes in home matches the pressure of expectations gets onto the players.         
	At half-time I told them to keep things simple and easy. They listened to what I said and we emerged winners, the Englishman told a crowded and noisy news conference.         
	Morgan said only East Bengal can beat East Bengal. We have played against quite a few top quality teams. And I can tell you only we can beat ourselves.         
	At this moment we are playing exceptionally well. But we have to maintain the tempo and, for that, we have work harder. Its a marathon league. We have to keep on working hard, he said.         
	Morgan said his boys were raising the bar with every match. There is too much expectation from us. But the boys are enjoying their game and as long as they do that nobody can stop us.         
	Salgaocar coach Karim Bencharifa said the better team on the day won. Ours is a very young team. If we finish the I-League in the mid table I will be satisfied. If we finish in the top-three I will be happy and if we win the title I will be over the moon, he said.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA) will honour Indian maestro Sachin Tendulkar, at the historic Standard Bank International Pro20 match at the Moses Mabhida stadium, in Durban, on January 9. The match will also be a farewell tribute to South African speedster Makhaya Ntini, who retires from international cricket after an illustrious career.         
	The commemorative match, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of Indians in South Africa, will see the two teams battle it out for the inaugural Krish Mackerdhuj Trophy.         
	Speaking at a media launch at the iconic stadium in Durban, on Thursday, CSA chief executive officer Gerald Majola said: This match will be a singular commemoration of the close relationship between South Africa and India in cricket, cultural and commercial links going back over decades.         
	CSA will include a special tribute at this match to Indian batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar for his ongoing and outstanding contribution to advancement of cricket world-wide. Sachin is the only remaining playing member of the Indian team that played the first match against South Africa after our unity and now he is here again to celebrate with us this historic match at Mabhida Stadium.         
	Makhaya and Sachin represent all that is best in this great game of cricket, and we are honoured to bring this tribute to both of them at this anniversary of the roots that bind South Africa and India.         
	Majola also announced that CSA will honour the first ever South African team to tour India back in 1991.

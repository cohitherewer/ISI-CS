The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods top spot is   under threat
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods top spot is   under threat
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Woods                                 
	Tiger Woods and Lee Westwood go head-to-head with the world No 1 spot at stake when the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational starts in Akron, Ohio, on Thursday.         
	Woods, who has won at Firestone on his last four trips, is under threat from both Westwood and Phil Mickelson at the top of the world rankings.         
	Woods and Westwood were playing partners in the first two rounds of the Open last year, with Westwood outscoring the American by seven and going on to finish third while Woods missed the cut.         
	They tee off at 1.50pm local time just ahead of Padraig Harrington and US Open champion Graeme McDowell, who were partners on the opening two days of the Irish Open last week.         
	Mickelson plays with McDowells fellow Northern Irishman, Rory McIlroy, the 21 year-old who pushed him into second place with a dazzling finish to the Quail Hollow Championship in May.         
	Mickelson could reach the No. 1 spot for the first time with a top-four finish providing Woods is well down the field, but if he wins the tournament there is nothing Woods can do to prevent the end of his latest five-year reign.         
	Westwood, runner-up in the Masters and Open this season, has to finish first or second just to have a chance of overtaking the two Americans.         
	Meanwhile, there was barely a mention of Woods at Firestone Country Club on Tuesday where eight players, including triple major winner Ernie Els McDowell, held their pre-tournament news conferences.         
	Two (59s) in the last three weeks, and before that (there were) only three in the lifetime of the PGA Tour, South African Els said.         
	Its starting to look like the Nationwide Tour, he added with a broad grin, referring to the US feeder circuit.         
	Australian Stuart Appleby fired an 11-under-par 59 to win the Greenbrier Classic on Sunday just three weeks after American Paul Goydos had posted the same score in the opening round of the John Deere Classic.         
	Prior to that, there had been only three previous 59s recorded on the PGA Tour with Al Geiberger doing so in 1977, Chip Beck in 1991 and David Duval in 1999.         
	While Els pointed out that soft course conditions had been a significant factor for the record-equalling scores by Goydos and Appleby, he was generous with his praise.         
	I dont care if you play it on a pitch-and-putt course, to shoot that kind of a number is a milestone in anybodys career, and youve got to give them credit, he said.

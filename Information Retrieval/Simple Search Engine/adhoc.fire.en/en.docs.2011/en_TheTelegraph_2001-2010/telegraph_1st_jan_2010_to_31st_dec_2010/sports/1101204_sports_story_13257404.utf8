The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mike: Early wickets will be the key

	Adelaide: Mike Hussey says early wickets Saturday will be crucial if Australia is to have a chance of getting back into the second Ashes Test against England.         
	After winning the toss and batting first, Australia were 2-3 Friday before Hussey hit 93 to take his sides score over 200. He then fell to Graeme Swann in the third session, prompting a collapse to 245 all out.         
	Hussey admitted to being shocked when Simon Katich, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke all fell in the first three overs sending him to the middle, and suggested that their final total was not too bad considering their start.         
	I was rushing to get my gear ready, it was all happening very quickly, Hussey said. I couldnt really believe it to be honest. Before I blinked I was out in the middle.         
	I was actually looking forward to having a nice relax for the first couple of hours and watching the first session.         
	Hussey is taking heart from the way England recovered after being dismissed for 260 on the first day of the first Test at Gabba to dominate with the bat later in the match, and says Australia can do the same.         
	We know tomorrows a big day in this Test match, but we can take a lot of heart from England, who were bowled out for 260 in the first Test up in Brisbane and came back very strongly, he said.         
	Hussey said there is variable bounce in the wicket and the potential for reverse swing on the second day.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                        East Zone bite the dust
                  Wriddhiman Saha hit 58                     
	Vadodara: North Zone registered a comprehensive eight-wicket victory against East Zone in the first semi-final of the Deodhar Trophy here on Sunday.         
	The combined efforts of left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma and opener Shikhar Dhawan ensured Norths handsome win.         
	After asking Debashish Mohanty-led side to bat first, the North bowlers, led by Bipul, bundled out East for 210 in 48.2 overs.         
	While Bipul claimed five for 36 from his 10 overs, Joginder Sharma and Jaskaran Singh pocketed two each. Rajat Bhatia claimed the other wicket.         
	For East, it wasnt a bright start as the in-form Bengal batsman Sreevats Goswami was dismissed for a duck in the second over of the day.         
	It was mainly due to Paresh Patel, who top-scored with 65, and Bengal wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, who slammed a quickfire 58, that the East score crossed the 200-run mark.         
	Orissas Haladhar Das, with 23, was the next best scorer.         
	At one point of time, East were reeling at 133 for eight with Wriddhiman and skipper Debashish (16) at the crease.         
	The pair, especially Wriddhiman batted sensibly. They added valuable 57 runs for the ninth wicket. The runs were also scored at a decent pace as they played around 11.5 overs together. When Debashish was finally dismissed caught at extra-cover off the bowling of Joginder, the East score had reached 190.         
	However Wriddhiman found an able ally in statemate Ranadeb Bose. The duo added 20 runs for the last wicket. It also gave Wriddhiman, an opportunity to complete his sixth List A half-century. He hit nine boundaries in his 51-ball knock especially hitting a lot of fours through cover and extr-cover region.         
	In reply, North never seemed to be any trouble and reached the target in 37.5 overs. Shikhar Dhawan with an unbeaten 85 and Virst Kohli with 66 were the architects of the West chase.         
	Dhawans 95-ball innings comprised of seven boundaries while Kohli, who took just 54 balls for his innings, had 11 hits to the fence.         
	Mandeep Singh (32 not out) was the other contributor with the bat.         
	Bengal speedster Ashok Dinda claimed both wickets giving away 53 runs in his 10 overs.         
	Central Zone take on West Zone in the second semi-final, at the same venue, on Monday.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights approach has changed, says Fleming
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights approach has changed, says Fleming
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming said his boys need to be more accurate in pressure situations, which they lacked against Deccan Chargers.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If Kolkata Knight Riders approach has changed         
	Yeah. There seems to be a different approach. The competition is so tight that little things make a difference. Form, change of attitude, change of the shirt colour! That might be the winning formula.         
	Shane Bond         
	I hope he is not a factor on Monday. He is experienced and we have seen that experienced players are always very important. Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Chaminda Vaas ... Bond falls in that category. He is very excited about being here. He is a very good buy.         
	On the match against the Chargers         
	We were disappointed. We got to improve in some areas. We have to create pressure on KKR. Its a big game for us now. I feel we need to be more accurate with our bowling. We didnt hit the right areas. Our batting has been at its best during the last couple of years. However, on Sunday, we fell short. These are the key areas we need to focus on.         
	Positives from the last match         
	I believe our fielding was outstanding.         
	Not having a strike bowler up front         
	We may not have a bowler who bowls at 155-160 kmph but that doesnt mean we dont have a strike bowler. Muttiah Muralidharan is one of the greatest spinners in the world and a strike bowler. We are more than comfortable with the arrangements.         
	If Murali Vijay is good enough to open in T20s         
	He has done well in the longer version and there is no reason why he cannot transform that into Twenty20. He has enough strokes and is a talented player.         
	Players like Manpreet Gony, Joginder Sharma who have faded out post IPL I         
	Well, IPL is just for two months. Therefore the players are gelling well and striving hard to excel. However once they get back playing for their state teams or national teams they need to maintain the same level of intensity. The IPL gives a lot of exposure to young players and it is challenge for them to maintain that level of consistency.         
	Experience versus youth in T20s         
	Experienced players have no fear because they already have a career behind them. T20 is all about courage, playing without inhibitions. Its about going there and expressing yourself.         
	Two more teams in IPL IV         
	The competition can grow. The officials are surely aware of the fact that duration of the tournament doesnt increase. One needs to look at the Saturation point. Then it will be a good thing.

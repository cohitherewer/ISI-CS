            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In a clash of the bottom two teams of the I-League, Mohun Bagan will face JCT in a fifth round match, in Ludhiana, on Thursday.         
	Both the teams have failed to register a win after playing four matches and are languishing at the bottom of the table.         
	While Bagan have garnered two points, courtesy two draws and two loses, the Punjab team have managed just a point.         
	Bagans woeful run this season had led the club officials to change the coach  bringing in Subhas Bhowmick in place of Stanley Rozario.         
	Under Bhowmick Bagan came up with a better show as they managed to hold Dempo in the last much.         
	On paper, the green and maroon brigade are a much stronger side and so it wouldnt be wrong to hope that they will be able to log in full points from Thursdays match.

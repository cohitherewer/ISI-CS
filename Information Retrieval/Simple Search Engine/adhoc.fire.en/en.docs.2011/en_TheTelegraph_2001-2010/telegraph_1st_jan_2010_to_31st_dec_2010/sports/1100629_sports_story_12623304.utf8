The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifa stays mum as refs face fire

            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: It was a disastrous day for Fifa in the World Cup on Sunday. Major refereeing errors in back-to-back pre-quarter final matches raised a storm given its persistent refusal to introduce goalline technology, but the world body continued to stonewall any discussion on the sensitive issue.         
	On Monday, when Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot met newspersons at Soccer City, he was bombarded with questions on the two crucial decisions involving the matches between Germany and England and Argentina and Mexico.         
	Maingot, however, despite much provocation, managed to stick to his standard not-in-a-position-to-speak stand on the subject.         
	Fifa does not comment on referees decisions, was all he had to say throughout the conference.         
	When it comes to refereeing decisions, we dont comment on those.         
	Maingot even went to the extent of saying that Carlos Tevezs first goal in the Argentina-Mexico match should not have been displayed on the giant screen for security reasons.         
	The clamour for goalline technology has suddenly intensified after Englands Frank Lampard was denied a legitimate equaliser against Germany.         
	Later on Sunday, Mexico found themselves let down by the referee when Tevez was allowed to score against them from an offside position.         
	The problem is that Fifa president Sepp Blatter has made his opposition clear against the introduction of video technology.         
	In March, in a meeting of the Football Association Board (FAB), which decides the rules of the game, Blatter dismissed all proposals to introduce changes.         
	Blatters detractors say that his outright rejection of video technology may cost him his job in the next elections.         
	Those for the use of technology think that, contrary to the view that video replays disrupt the natural flow of the game, it can deliver conclusive evidence in less than half-a-second during the course of the match.         
	Fifa is likely to be on the back foot after Sundays incidents as there have been too many refereeing mistakes in the ongoing World Cup and also in the lead-up to the event.         
	Indeed, Thierry Henrys handball against Ireland in the qualifiers is a prime example of how certain wrong decisions can have grave consequences.         
	The funny part is that Fifa, as a public relations measure, has been arranging regular interactions between referees and the media but the men in black have been strictly barred from commenting on any decision taken on the pitch.         
	Fifa, however, has a history of removing erring officials from the panel of supervisors.         
	The referees versions of the two controversial goals were not available on Sunday.         
	Mexico coach Javier Aguirre, however, claimed that the referee for the match, Roberto Rosetti was upset with his assistant, Stefano Ayroldi, for missing the Tevez offside.         
	Rosetti was upset when he came into the tunnel at half-time, said Aguirre.         
	He was upset with the assistant referee. They accepted they were wrong but they couldnt do anything...

                                                                                                                       7                                        Harbhajan 350 not out!
  - Under-pressure offie responds with a devastating spell       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Harbhajan Singh after one of his three dismissals on Sunday. Picture by Gautam Bose                                 
	Calcutta: Just when some with big influence within the Board were actually wondering whether Harbhajan Singh had lost it totally, Test crickets second-most successful off-spinner (350 dismissals) responded with a bag of wickets, at the Eden, on Sunday afternoon.         
	Harbhajans second spell, after tea, accounted for all three of his victims  the most prized, of course, being Jacques Kallis. It reduced South Africa to their knees and, within eight deliveries, Harbhajan probably silenced the doubting Thomases.         
	Kallis fell on the slog-sweep, while Ashwell Prince (who cant get runs at any number) and Jean-Paul Duminy couldnt get bat to ball.         
	Harbhajan, in fact, was on a hat-trick at the very ground where he created history, against Australia, nine years ago.         
	The in-superb-form Hashim Amla should also have been a Harbhajan wicket, but V.V.S. Laxman dropped a sitter.         
	Harbhajan, who used the bounce to his advantage and didnt overdo anything, justified the respect given to him by his captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on the eve of the Test.         
	Speaking on Saturday, Dhoni said: The bowlers have off days... It can happen to anyone, but your best (spinner) remains the best... Everyone knows whos the best...         
	Coach Gary Kirsten, who faced Harbhajan during the time he turned out for South Africa, was as emphatic in praising his lead spinner.         
	Harbhajan bowled very well in Nagpur (actually Jamtha) as well... One should try and look at the way hes bowling, rather than look at the end result... He bowled very well (in the first Test), but the South Africans also played him very well... His rhythm has got better and we do know hes a strike bowler...         
	Surely, a huge confidence booster that.         
	Honest in admitting that there definitely is pressure at the highest level, Harbhajan appeared pretty relaxed in the lead up to the face-off at the Eden.         
	Indeed, when asked by The Telegraph if the attack on him by certain quarters was a source of bother, Harbhajan replied: Woh apna kaam kar rahe hain, Ill do mine.         
	He did, on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US rally as rain plays truant
                                                                                                                       7                                      US rally as rain plays truant
                      
	Newport: The United States came from behind to seize control in Fridays unfinished fourball matches after the 38th Ryder Cup was severely disrupted by torrential rain.         
	Play was suspended for more than seven hours at a waterlogged Celtic Manor before the Americans ended a frustrating day for the players and fans, leading in two of the four encounters and down in one.         
	They were all square in the third match out, where Ian Poulter holed an 18-foot birdie putt for Europe at the par-three 10th before play ended for the day in the gathering gloom.         
	Organisers of the biennial team competition have already amended the format in a bid to make up for lost time.         
	A revamped second session on Saturday will feature six foursomes involving all 12 players while a new extended third session will comprise two foursomes and four fourball encounters.         
	At the end of the opening day Americans Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar were two up on Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell after 11 holes.         
	In the bottom match, US rookies Jeff Overton and Bubba Watson were one up on Luke Donald and Padraig Harrington after eight holes.         
	World No. 1 Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker led British duo Poulter and Ross Fisher one up after nine holes before Poulters birdie at the 10th squared the match.         
	Europe were in control in the top encounter where world No. 1 Lee Westwood and US PGA champion Martin Kaymer were one up on Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson after 12 holes.         
	Meanwhile, in a bid to make up for lost time, officials have reorganised the format by squeezing four pairs sessions into three.         
	Under the new format the second session is to comprise six foursomes matches and the third will contain two foursomes and four fourballs. There will no longer be a fourth pairs session and the 12 singles will go ahead as normal.         
	This means none of the 24 players can be left out of the remaining pairs matches and that there is still a total of 28 overall points on offer to Europe and the U.S. holders.         
	European Tour chief executive George Grady told a news conference on Friday the organisers wanted to try to avoid finishing the biennial team event on Monday.         
	The captains were very cooperative. We did everything we could to keep the singles sacrosanct, he said.         
	Grady added the players were happy with the new format. None of them enjoy sitting out and they didnt need much convincing, he said.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to rectify errors: Gilchrist
                                                                                                                       7                                      Want to rectify errors: Gilchrist
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist feels his boys are ready to bounce back after back-to-back defeats against the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians.         
	I dont see our match against the Kolkata Knight Riders as a revenge match. Rather, I would term it as a match where we should rectify the mistakes we made in the previous matches. Like us, KKR have also been a bit inconsistent. They have had some good performances and some forgettable ones. So we can expect a good fight tomorrow (Thursday), the Chargers captain said at a media conference on the eve of the match.         
	Gilchrist maintained that T20 is a format where even the weakest of teams can get the better of a much stronger team. Yesterday (Tuesday), the team at the bottom of the heap was nearly upsetting the top team. Thats the beauty of the game, the Australian said.         
	After having a look at the Eden strip for the last two days, the former Australia wicket-keeper batsman feels it will be a dry one and a bit flat. However, he is yet to decide the playing XI.         
	A common perception is that the Chargers batting is heavily dependent on him as whenever the he has failed, the top-order has also failed. The captain begs to differ.         
	Yeah, we have been a little bit inconsistent but its not the case that our batting is only dependent on me. Its just that no one is getting a big score. Some are getting 50s but they need to carry on. Its no secret that irrespective of the format, you need to preserve wickets. Various teams have various theories about the approach in T20 games. Some feel one needs to attack during Powerplays. Some believe in attacking at the death. But theres no set formula like the one we had during the 1996 World Cup when Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwithrana attacked in the first 15 overs in every match, Gilchrist remarked.         
	About Eden, the captain and his teammate VVS Laxman have contrasting memories. That Test match in 2001 will always have a special place in my memory. For VVS, it was a very special match. I asked VVS about his memories about this ground, he said that Eden Gardens and Sydney are two of his favourite grounds, Gilchrist said.         
	He rated the Mumbai Indians as the most balanced side.         
	They have a very good batting line-up. When someone like Harbhajan Singh comes at eight or nine and scores close to 50 in no time, you got to give it to them. Royal Challengers Bangalore are another balanced side. I believe apart from Kings XI Punjab, who are at the bottom, the other teams are still in a position to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	Gilchrist also respects Sachin Tendulkars decision of not playing in T20 internationals. He knows whats best for him. Probably he wants to preserve himself for other formats and thats absolutely fine.         
	While signing off, he wished a happy married life for tennis star Sania Mirza and former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik. I read about their marriage in the papers. If you are in love, you should go for it. I wish them a happy married life, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clube victory goes in vain
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clube victory goes in vain
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Sporting Clube de Goa rsquo;s Anthony D rsquo;Souza after scoring the winner against Chirag United. A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: Sporting Clube de Goa beat Chirag United 1-0 in their concluding I-League encounter at Howrah Municipal Stadium, but that wasnt enough to avert relegation. Because in Mumbai, hosts Mumbai FC beat Mohun Bagan 2-0.         
	Clube finished their I-League engagements with 27 points from 26 matches. Substitute Anthony DSouza slotted home a Adil Khans low cross. Clube could have got a few more had Chirag custodian Sandip Nandy not averted danger on a couple of occasions.         
	Once he snatched the ball from Joseph Perreiras feet when the left winger was about to score. On another occasion, in the second half, he fisted away a powerful drive from Freiman Peixoto.         
	Clube coach Viswas Gaonkar felt the relegation did not give a true reflection of what the team was capable of.         
	The first leg, where we got only five points from 13 matches, became our undoing, Gaonkar said.         
	Clube top boss Peter Vaz informed that they will appeal to the AIFF to consider keeping them in the top tier as Mahindra United have already disbanded their team.         
	Since AIFF wants to make it a 16-team affair, we will appeal that they should allow us and Lajong FC in the top tier. That will not disturb the composition of teams. HAL, ONGC, who have been promoted along with AIFF U-19 teams can then join us to make it a 16-team league, he said.

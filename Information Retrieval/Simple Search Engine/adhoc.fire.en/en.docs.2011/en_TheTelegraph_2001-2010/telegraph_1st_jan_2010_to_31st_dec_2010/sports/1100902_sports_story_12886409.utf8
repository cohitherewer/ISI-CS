The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania falls to Anastasia

	New York: Sania Mirza was dismissed by Russias Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round of the US Open, on Wednesday.         
	The 20th seed easily dispatched Sania 6-2, 6-4 in 81 minutes, on court No. 13.         
	With this defeat, Indias challenge in the singles events came to an end as Somdev Dev Varman had earlier lost out in the first round, on the opening day of the Slam.         
	Unseeded Ana Ivanovic of Serbia advanced to the third round with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over 21st-seeded Zheng Jie of China.         
	Ivanovic, the former world No. 1 who now stands at No. 40, needed 56 minutes to defeat Zheng at Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Ivanovic won the 2008 French Open, but has never been past the fourth round at Flushing Meadows.         
	In another match, Victoria Azarenka collapsed and fell to the ground while chasing down a routine forehand and had to be taken off the court in a wheelchair, half an hour into her match on another steamy day.         
	The 10th-seeded Belarusian was trailing Gisela Dulko 5-1 in the first set on the Grandstand court, where the temperature had reached 90 degrees with 42 per cent humidity by 11:30 a.m.         
	Tournament officials gave no immediate update on her condition. About an hour after the match was called, her agent said Azarenka was being transported to the hospital. Dulko said Azarenka was conscious and responding when she walked over to make sure everything was OK.         
	Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal made a smooth start to his bid to capture the one Grand Slam that has eluded him when he wore down Russias Teymuraz Gabashvili 7-6, 7-6, 6-3 in the first round of the US Open on Tuesday.         
	Dressed menacingly in an all black outfit, Nadal had to dig deep to see off the stubborn Gabashvili after three hours of intense shot-making from both men at Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Neither player dropped serve in the opening two sets but Nadals superior big-match experience came through when it mattered and he won both tiebreakers before Gabashvili finally cracked in the third set.         
	I prefer to play one hour and 10 minutes, Nadal said. Everybody wants to win easier. (When) you play against (lower-ranked) players they dont have much to lose, so they play aggressive. I had a difficult match, but I think I did play well.         
	Nadals straight sets win capped another dramatic day when most of the results went according to the script but not before some brutal contests for three former finalists on a sweltering hot day at Flushing Meadows.         
	On a mixed day for India, defending champions and third seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy crashed out but Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi entered the mens doubles second round.         
	Paes and Dlouhy were the first of the two pairs to take the court and were in for disappointment as the Czech-Slovakian combination of Martin Damm and Filip Polasek rallied to beat them 6-7(7), 6-3, 6-4.         
	However, Bopanna and Qureshi ensured that the Indians had something to cheer about when the 16th seeded duo defeated Americans Brian Battistone and Ryler DeHeart 6-3, 7-6 (7). They will now play against the winners of the match between the unseeded teams of Americans Sekou Bangoura and Nathan Pasha and Michael Kohlmann (Germany) and Jarkko Nieminen (Finland).         
	Novak Djokovic dispelled his reputation as a quitter after battling through five gruelling sets. World No. 3 Djokovic looked to be heading for an early exit when he fell two sets to one and a service break behind fellow Serb Viktor Troicki but somehow summoned up the strength to fight back and win 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3.         
	His incredible performance came on a day when organisers invoked the tournaments rarely used extreme weather policy and fans fled the stands to seek refuge in the shade from the blazing sun.         
	For most of his match, Djokovic was soaked in sweat and gasping for air and playing an opponent showing no signs of weariness.         
	It was only in the fifth set, when the sun began to set and Troicki started to wilt, that relief finally came.         
	It was like, I dont know, sleeping with my girlfriend I guess kind of feeling, Djokovic told the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Djokovic made the US Open final in 2007 then won the Australian Open the following year but has been heavily criticised for retiring from matches at each of the four Grand Slams, including his defense of the Australian Open.         
	Ive been in those situations before, played a lot of long matches in very difficult conditions, feeling very exhausted, he told a news conference. You kind of start panicking a little bit when you dont feel great physically.         
	Under the tournaments extreme heat policy, players are allowed to request a 10-minute break between the second and third sets if the mercury exceeds 30.1 degrees Celsius before the start of the match.         
	Maria Sharapova, the 2006 US Open champion, was also given a tough workout from Australias Jarmila Groth in their match, played at dusk when the weather had cooled, before prevailing 4-6, 6-3, 6-1.         
	Sharapovas compatriot and Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva had a much easier time against Slovakias Zuzana Kucova on the Louis Armstrong stadium, winning 6-2, 6-1.         
	After two days of few surprises, eight seeded players made early exits in the severe conditions. The biggest casualty in the mens draw was Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, seeded 16th, while the highest womens seed to fall was Chinas Li Na, seeded eighth.         
	The exception was Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki, last years runner-up and the top seed this time in the absence of world No. 1 Serena Williams. Wozniacki has been in devastating form in the past month, winning three tournaments to give herself the chance of a $1 million cash bonus, and made a flying start to her US Open campaign.         
	Her match did not begin until just before midnight local time because of the earlier backlog but she made up for lost time by thumping American wildcard Chelsey Gullickson 6-1, 6-1 in just 61 minutes.

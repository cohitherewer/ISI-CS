The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India top order holds sway in the middle
                                                                                                                       7                                        India top order holds sway in the middle
  - Second test 
  -  Centurions Tendulkar, Dravid in record stand
                  Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in Dhaka on Monday                     
	Dhaka: Sachin Tendulkar struck his 45th Test century and Rahul Dravid his 29th as India Monday toyed with the Bangladesh attack, tightening their grip over the second and final Test.         
	The Indian top order fired fine but the second days highlight was the 222-run third wicket stand between Tendulkar (143) and Dravid (111), who retired hurt after a Shahadat Hossain bouncer hit him on the ear guard.         
	India were 459 for five  226 runs ahead of the hosts  at stumps after Harbhajan Singhs (13) dismissal in the 103rd over of the innings. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was batting at 22.         
	The 103-run opening stand between Gautam Gambhir (68) and Virender Sehwag (56) was the perfect platform for the visitors to push for a big total and the Dravid-Tendulkar partnership  a record 17th century stand  ensured that the pressure on Bangladesh only intensified.         
	Tendulkar was helped by Raqibul Hasan, who twice dropped him, first off Rubel Hossain on 27 and then off Shahadat on 50.         
	Dravid too had his share of good luck. Batting on 28, he was caught in the slips off Rubel but as it turned out, it was a no-ball.         
	Then, when on nine, Dravid was adjudged not out by the third umpire after a Gambhir drive hit the stumps with him out of the crease and bowler Shahadat suggesting the ball had brushed his finger.         
	Tendulkars fluent 182-ball knock was studded with 13 fours and a six while Dravid hit 12 fours during his 188-ball knock. Dravid and Tendulkar Monday eclipsed the 16 century-plus partnership record shared by the Matthew Hayden-Ricky Ponting and Gordon Greenidge-Desmond Haynes pairs.         
	In the top half of the line-up, it was only Murali Vijay that missed out on a half-century, falling for 30.         
	The day also saw Gambhir equalling West Indian legend Vivian Richardss record of 11 fifty-plus knocks in consecutive Tests.         
	Having dominated right from the word go, India would now look to post a big first innings score. The plan was evident in the way the batsmen went about their job.         
	India scored at a brisk pace, amassing 390 runs from 89.5 overs faced.         
	Earlier, twin half-centuries by Sehwag and Gambhir had India off to a flying start.         
	Resuming on his overnight 41, Sehwag reached the half-century mark in the third over of the day with a boundary off Shahadat who had the batsman caught behind four overs later.         
	Sehwag needed 61 balls for his 56, which he made with the help of seven fours.         
	Gambhir, had resumed on 26, and caught up with his senior partner with a flurry of fours, including two off consecutive balls by Shahadat, and reached his 11th fifty in 60 balls.

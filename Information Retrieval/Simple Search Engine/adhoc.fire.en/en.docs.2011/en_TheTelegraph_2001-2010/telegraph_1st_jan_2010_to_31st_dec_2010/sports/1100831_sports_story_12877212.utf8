                                                                                                                       7                                      EB upbeat ahead of first match 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: One European failed last season; will another get success this time? The millions of East Bengal fans will hope the answer to this question is in affirmative.         
	And before the subjective I-League questions crop up, the objective ones of the CFL confront the red and gold brigade on Tuesday when they take on Mohammedan AC.         
	Englishman Trevor Morgan will hope the team fare better under his guidance than they did under Belgian Phillippe de Ridders last year.         
	Reisangmi Vashum and Penn Orji will be the midfield managers. However, with new recruit Ekene Ikenwa down with a stomach upset and Robin Singh yet to gain fitness, Morgan may have to go with Budhiram Tudu and Bikash Narjery upfront.         
	Speaking about his team, the former Hull City development coach said: The boys have been training hard for the past one month and Im happy with the progress so far. Whats most important is that they arent under any sort of pressure. We have to get Penn into positions from which he can do maximum damage.

    - India to take on arch-rivals Pakistan today                   Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Dambulla                           
	Dambulla: It will be a battle of attrition when arch rivals India and Pakistan resume their high-voltage cricketing rivalry after eight months in an Asia Cup match here Saturday.         
	The battle lines have been drawn for what is regarded as one of the most sought-after matches in world cricket.         
	Though the wicket is not ideal for an ODI, it should produce an electrifying contest as Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Shahid Afridis men fight for supremacy at the Rangiri Dambulla International stadium.         
	The last time the teams met across the square, Pakistan had the measure of India in the Champions Trophy in South Africa last September and Dhonis legion would be aching for revenge.         
	Pakistan are known to be dangerously volatile when put in a do-or-die situation, as is the situation now after they lost their first match to Sri Lanka.         
	A determined and aggressive Afridi could spoil Indias party if he cuts loose in the middle, as he did against the Lankans.         
	The Akmal brothers, Umar and Kamran, are immensely capable of turning the match on its head when the chips are down. Salman Butt and Shoaib Malik also have the reputation to destroy any attack on their day.         
	But man to man, India have a superior batting unit. Unlike Pakistan, India have a deep batting line-up, with Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan capable of cameos.         
	But it will be interesting to see how Virender Sehwag responds to the Pakistan challenge. On return from a shoulder injury, he made 11 against Bangladesh, struggling to move back and across the stumps during his 14-ball tenure at the square.         
	Both teams have a reasonably good bowling line-up. If Shoaib Akthar, who hobbled out with a strained left knee after a practice session, finds the rhythm which he is famous for, it would be an intense contest in the middle. The wicket may not assist his pace, but he can certainly extract bounce to trouble Gambhir, Raina and Rohit.         
	When it comes to 50 overs cricket, we have more options against the short ball. We dont have to play at each ball. We can either leave it or jab for a single. It is up to the individuals to cope up with it, said Dhoni.         
	Talking about the Shoaib factor, the Indian captain said, It will be a good contest. Akthar can be affective as he can bowl quick. But we will see how the boys cope against him.         
	On the Indian bowling front, there is a cloud over Ahsish Nehras fitness, but the team is yet to take a call on his availability. Nehra is not 100 per cent fit. We will take a call tomorrow (Saturday), said Dhoni.         
	In Nehras absence, Zaheer Khan would have to shoulder the responsibility of the Indian attack which has been far from impressive in the recent past. But Zaheer did look sharp and mean during Indias six-wicket win over Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vladimir is not sure of being a Weiss man
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vladimir is not sure of being a Weiss man
                      
	Pretoria: Slovakia midfielder Vladimir Weiss does not expect any favours from his uncompromising father for what could be the biggest game of his career in Mondays World Cup last 16 tie with the Netherlands.         
	His father and namesake is the Slovakia coach who dropped his son from the team that stunned holders Italy 3-2 in their highly-impressive final group game to qualify for the knockout stages against the odds.         
	Asked if he would be selected for the second round match, a glum Weiss junior said: I dont know, managers usually dont change a winning team but well see.         
	The team got changed a little bit (against Italy), everybody played 100 percent, there wasnt anybody making mistakes in the game, he told reporters after a sun-kissed training session before jetting to Durban for the match.         
	Zdeno Strba is suspended having been booked against Italy so there is one spot free in the team, while Juraj Kucka is a slight doubt having picked up a knock that has stopped him training for two days.         
	We know one player cant play. We are all going to hope, Weiss added before explaining how much the mood had changed in the camp after a draw with New Zealand and defeat by Paraguay in their first two outings.         
	Before the game against Italy everyone was very negative, one game can change a lot, he added.         
	Marek Hamsik, captain of the World Cup debutants, was excellent in a free attacking role against Italy and hopes to again cause damage against the Dutch favourites.         
	Every team has weak points but the Netherlands won every game in the group so it will be difficult, he said, his famous Mohican hairdo looking spikier than usual.         
	We have to play like we did against Italy, without pressure or fear.         
	The Netherlands play well, they dont give you the ball. We have to play our game and look at ourselves.           (AGENCIES)

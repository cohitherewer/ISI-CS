  - IWF suspends Ramesh Malhotra after Malleswari allegation             Karnam Malleswari                           
	New Delhi: The Indian Weightlifting Federation on Saturday suspended Sports Authority of India (SAI) coach Ramesh Malhotra after Sydney Olympic bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari alleged sexual harassment by him on junior lifters.         
	Malhotra, who was recommended by the IWF for the prestigious Dronacharya Award for the last two years, has been relieved of his duties at the Bangalore SAI Centre with immediate effect.         
	We have suspended Malhotra with immediate effect and has relieved him of his coaching job with Commonwealth core group weightlifters at the Bangalore SAI Centre, IWF secretary Sahdev Yadav said.         
	Malleswari had alleged that a SAI coach, who has also been recommended for Dronacharya award, has been sexually harassing junior lifters for more than a decade now.         
	Yadav said a three-member committee, comprising IWF vice-president Kumbasi Subramanya, veteran coach Pal Singh Sandhu and IWF joint secretary Madan Lal Salvi, will submit a report within seven days after probing the matter.         
	He said the allegations levelled by Malleswari, also an IWF vice-president, were not related to the present executive committee which took over in December last year.         
	The allegations might have been related to incidents happened earlier.         
	We took charge only in December last year and we dont have any complaint, including lifters, about sexual harassment by any coach or officials, Yadav said.         
	But we dont want to ignore anything so we have decided to suspend Malhotra and constitute a three-member committee to look into the allegations, added Yadav, who was the treasurer in the earlier executive committee.         
	The federation also denied that Malleswari raised the sexual harassment issue during the executive committee meeting held in Udaipur in February before the National Senior Championships.         
	No grievance or objection from any executive committee member had been received in the executive committee meeting (in Udaipur), it said.         
	The committee though is unlikely to call Malleswari to present her case before the committee.         
	It is up to the committee to decide. But the committee will look into past records whether there have been complaints of sexual harassment made by anybody, including players, against coaches or officials, Yadav said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi is under big pressure 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yuvi is under big pressure 
  - Rookie Pujara has support       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                    Yuvraj Singh (top) and Cheteshwar Pujara                            
	Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh, who is just days away from completing 10 years as an India cricketer, is under acute pressure to keep his place in the Test squad.         
	Ignored in the last Test, at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo early last month, when Suresh Raina was preferred, Yuvraj now has rookie Cheteshwar Pujara snapping at his heels.         
	Till late on Sunday, there was no guarantee that the 28-year-old Yuvraj would feature in the XV for the first Test against Australia, in Mohali, from October 1.         
	The squad is going to be picked in Chennai on Monday afternoon, with all five selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) expected to be in attendance.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, the quintet appears split over Yuvraj.         
	Look, there are two schools of thought... Advocates of one believe that ignoring Yuvraj would kill his confidence and add to his pressures in the build-up to the 2011 World Cup... Hes an absolute must for that tournament...         
	The other school is of the opinion that when Yuvraj cant make the XI, why make him sit in the reserves? It would, then, be better to pick somebody younger  like Pujara (22), the well-placed source said.         
	Pujara has been excelling for India A.         
	Its not clear exactly how much of a role captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who is in South Africa, and coach Gary Kirsten (whereabouts not known to most selectors), are going to play in the Yuvraj versus Pujara issue.         
	Not much, perhaps.         
	A surprise isnt expected and whats confirmed is that spearhead Zaheer Khan will make a comeback, after having missed the tour of Sri Lanka owing to an injury.         
	Indications are that a second keeper wont be named. If theres a change, then Wriddhiman Saha should be there.         
	Significantly, that Srikkanth and Co. arent looking beyond Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha confirms the dearth of spinners. The pressure is really going to be on Harbhajan Singh, the senior-most around.               
	LIKELY SQUAD         
	Batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Virender Sehwag (vice-capt.), Yuvraj Singh/Cheteshwar Pujara, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay, Suresh Raina.         
	Wicket-keeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.).         
	Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha.         
	New-ball bowlers: Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	Note: As of late on Sunday...

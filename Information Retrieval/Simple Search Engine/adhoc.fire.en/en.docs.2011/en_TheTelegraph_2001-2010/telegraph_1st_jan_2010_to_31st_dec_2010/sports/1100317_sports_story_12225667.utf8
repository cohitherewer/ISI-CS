The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Last four overs did us in: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      Last four overs did us in: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain Sourav Ganguly admitted at the post-match media conference that the game slipped away during the last four overs of the Chennai Super Kings innings despite keeping things tight in the initial part of the innings.         
	But Sourav feels that Shane Bond shouldnt be judged on the basis of just one match and should be given time to settle down.         
	The KKR captain also feels that the top-order needs to bat sensibly in the matches to come as the batsmen are playing too many shots.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If defeat after two victories gives a sense of dj vu         
	Not really. This format is such where one wont win each and every game. But one has to come back hard after a defeat.         
	Turning point of the match         
	We gave away more than 60 runs in the last four overs and I reckon that tilted the match in their favour. We really bowled well and kept things tight till the 15th over, but they played well at the death.         
	Whether he was disappointed with the batting         
	I guess we played too many shots in the end, which cost us dearly. I hope that we will bat a bit more sensibly at the top of the order in the future.         
	On Bonds performance         
	He did bowl well, apart from the last few deliveries. He has just come. So we do need to give him some time to settle down. Our bowlers have done well in the last two matches and even in this match, save the last few overs. There is no reason why we cant come back hard. Even Ishant bowled well.         
	Missing out on a fifth bowler         
	I dont think we missed a fifth bowler. We have Laxmi Ratan Shukla who is a fifth bowler.         
	Brad Hodge being underbowled         
	Yeah, I guess, I could have used him for a couple of more overs.         
	Would he have batted had he won the toss?         
	No way. I would have still fielded. The Eden Gardens wicket may be on the slower side but thats how it has been over the years. The ball will also do a bit in the evening but one has got to adjust to the conditions.         
	His message to the boys after the loss         
	Every day is a new day. So we have to come back with a positive frame of mind.

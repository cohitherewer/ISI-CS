  -  Steve Waugh says he is passionate about charity work             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Steve Waugh                                 
	Calcutta: The iconic Steve Waugh, in Mumbai to support a Sport for Good Foundation project, in his capacity as a Laureus ambassador, spoke to The Telegraph over the phone on Tuesday morning.         
	Steve, now 44, has been lending his name to charitable causes in India for a dozen years. It all began with Udayan, in Barrackpore, with an interview of his published in these columns during the March 1998 India-Australia Test being the catalyst.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Whats your role in the Sport for Good Foundations Magic Bus project?         
	A Im in Mumbai as a Laureus Academy member Im hoping to spread awareness, idea being to make a difference in the lives of as many as possible... Ive already been to the Foundations projects in South Africa, Sri Lanka, the UK and in Australia... Later today, Im supposed to play with some of the disadvantaged children from a particular area.         
	[Steve did, in the Port area, making the day memorable for so many.]         
	How different is this from the other charity work youve been associated with?         
	This is for a Foundation which doesnt have my name... As you know, Ive started the Steve Waugh Foundation in India. One is in place in Australia, too... Magic Bus is an inspirational project. I do have first-hand experience of the challenges that many of the disadvantaged young actually face in India.         
	When is your next visit to Calcutta and Udayan?         
	Not on this trip, probably in the next few months.         
	What draws you to charity work?         
	It has become a passion... Its fantastic to do some good work and try and make a positive impact... When Im home, I put in 30-40 hours of voluntary work, every week, for my Foundation there... We do everything, including research. Im pretty hands-on, you know.         
	The feel-good factor comes into play...         
	Well, its about changing the lives of people... Trying to make a positive impact...Gives me a lot of satisfaction, gives me enjoyment.         
	Where else are you going on this visit?         
	Ive been to New Delhi and will be making a business trip to Pune... After that, its going to be Singapore and back to Australia.         
	To talk of the IPL... What are your impressions of the first 10 days?         
	Havent seen all the matches, but its getting bigger and bigger... The crowds have fallen in love with the IPL and most of the teams now have a better game plan. Better structures in place, too. Indeed, they have a better idea of how to go about things.         
	Your take on the money being invested in the IPL...         
	Ive been amazed... Flabbergasted at the winning bids for the two teams from next year... Im not really privy to the businesses of the successful bidders (Sahara and the Rendezvous Sports World Ltd), but they obviously see the IPL as good business.         
	[One of the Rendezvous partners, Mukesh Patel, has candidly said: Im just a businessman and have absolutely no idea about the game of cricket. Its just business for me.]         
	Shouldnt the IPL actively associate itself with a charitable cause?         
	Im amazed it hasnt already done so... Theres definitely a social responsibility to fulfil. (After a pause) In fact, I intend speaking to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (which is promoting the IPL) about supporting the Foundation Ive started in India.         
	Being somewhat of a traditionalist, would you have enjoyed T20?         
	(Laughs) It would have been a fantastic experience, yes.         
	Have you played any T20 cricket at all?         
	A couple of charity games, thats it... Most of the T20 has been in my backyard, with my son, Austin!         
	What do you think is special about the IPL and T20 cricket?         
	People want excitement, they want entertainment... They want to belong... The franchise-driven IPL gives them a sense of belonging and T20, because of its nature, provides entertainment and excitement.         
	 Test cricket...         
	It will remain the ultimate test of a players skills, his fitness, temperament... Playing Test cricket will, for me, remain an honour. The ultimate honour.         
	What about the 50-over ODIs?         
	Needs to be spruced up in the middle overs... Spectators do want it to be snappier... Ultimately, the money it generates and the crowds it attracts is going to determine its future.         
	As of now, which teams do you expect to make the final of IPL III?         
	Bangalore and Mumbai look to be the most organised teams... Today, Id go for them.         
	Given your emotional connect with Calcutta, any words of advice for the Knight Riders?         
	Look, its not for me to say what needs to be done or what ought not to be done by the franchise... Sourav (Ganguly) and (Dav) Whatmore are in the leadership roles... One is the captain, the other coach... They have got to come up with something. But, yes, there are issues with the Knights batting.         
	The final one... Some words on Sachin Tendulkar...         
	Sachins been amazing... Hes got all the passion and is enjoying his cricket. Hes (still) doing well and, when he does well, India celebrates.

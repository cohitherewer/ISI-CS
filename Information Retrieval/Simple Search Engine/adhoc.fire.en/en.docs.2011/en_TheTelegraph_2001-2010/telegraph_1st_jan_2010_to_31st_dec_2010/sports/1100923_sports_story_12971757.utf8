	London: Englands world champion triple jumper Phillips Idowu became the latest star to pull out of the scandal-marred Commonwealth Games due to security reasons, saying his family is more important than a medal.         
	The pull out of Idowu came hours after his compatriots  Olympic 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu and 2006 Melbourne Games gold medallist 1500m runner Lisa Dobriskey  decided to withdraw from the Games due to injuries.         
	The build-up to the Games has been marred by complaints over unhygienic conditions at the athletes Village while a footbridge near the main venue collapsed on Tuesday, injuring 27 people. Before that, in a firing incident, two foreign tourists were injured on Sunday.         
	The 31-year-old Idowu, who won gold in 2006 Melbourne Games, said in his Twitter page that he was withdrawing from the mega-event as he cannot risk his life because he has two children to take care of.         
	Seeing all the reports today about bridges collapsing and almost 23 people being hurt, floods and uninhabitable living conditions while getting my daughter ready for school this morning, put me off.         
	I cant afford to risk my safety in the slightest. Sorry people, but I have children to think about. My safety is more important to them than a medal, he tweeted.         
	I understand people will be disappointed that I will not be competing. I am disappointed. These games mean a lot to me. Its the champs in which I won my first medal. And four years ago won my first gold, which kicked off the success I have in my career to date, said Idowu.         
	Ohuruogu suffered a cramp during a training session last weekend and she does not want to take risk as she has not fully recovered from her quad injury she suffered in June.         
	I am disappointed to miss the Commonwealth Games after working so hard to get fit since my quad injury in June. However, with the 2012 Olympic Games on the horizon, the last thing an athlete wants to do is risk a re-injury to the same muscle, the 26-year-old said.         
	It was very important for me to be cautious in dealing with my previous injury, and although training was progressing well, intense competition over three days may prove to be more harmful than good and may compromise the long-term functioning of the muscle.         
	With three rounds in the 400m in Delhi, I would need to be close to my best to win the gold. I had already picked up my team kit and was getting ready to go to the preparation camp in Doha. Instead, I will have a short break now and resume winter training in October to get ready for the 2011 season, she said.         
	Dobriskey, on the other hand, has been advised to rest and focus on training for next year after an injury-hit season.         
	I was really looking forward to competing and Id worked so hard to get back into shape. Im really disappointed but I just ran out of time. I want to wish all the best to the athletes out in Delhi, Dobriskey said. (PTI)

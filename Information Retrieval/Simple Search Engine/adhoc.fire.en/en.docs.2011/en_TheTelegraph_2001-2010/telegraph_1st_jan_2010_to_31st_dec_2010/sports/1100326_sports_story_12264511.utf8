	New Delhi: Sunil Chetri will sign a contract with United States Major League Soccer (MLS) side Kansas City Wizards on Friday, the MLS club said.         
	Indian forward Sunil Chetri has agreed in principle to a deal with Major League Soccer, pending medical and P-1 Visa approval, KC Wizards manager Peter Vermes said in a release issued for the Indian media.         
	One thing we really like about Sunil is that hes a crafty player. Technically hes very sharp, and hes a guy that has good attacking tendencies, he added.         
	A teleconference with the Indian media is being organised on Friday by the Bangalore office of Cerner Corporation, a medical software company headquartered at North Kansas City whose boss Neal Patterson is the owner of KC Wizards.         
	Chetri will become the third Indian player to ply trade in a professional league abroad after Mohamed Salim and current national captain Bhaichung Bhutia.         
	Salim played for Scottish side Celtic in pre-independence days of India, while Bhaichung was with English Championship side Bury FC in the second division from 1999-2002.         
	The 25-year-old from Delhi will become the first Indian to play in MLS. He will also be the first Asian to play for the Kansas City Wizards. (PTI)

  - Former skippers unbeaten 70 paves way for 6-wkt win vs Pakistan             Kevin Pietersen in a belligerent mood against Pakistan, in Bridgetown, on Thursday. (Reuters)                           
	Bridgetown: Kevin Pietersen smashed an unbeaten 70 off only 52 balls to guide England to a comfortable six-wicket victory against Pakistan in a Super Eights match of the World Twenty20 on Thursday. Chasing 148 for victory, Paul Collingwoods men won with three balls to spare.         
	After two rain-affected contests in Guyana, it was Englands first victory without weather intevnetion and a vital one too, coming as it did against the reigning champions.         
	Opting to bowl first, England were helped by some shoddy Pakistan fielding. Saeed Ajmal was the guilty party dropping the English openers thrice. Twice he dropped Craig Kieswetter at mid-on.         
	If that wasnt enough, other opener Michael Lumb got a life when the offie dropped him at mid-off. All the let-offs were inside the PowerPlay overs. The first reprieve, off the sixth ball of the innings, was the most culpable, as Kieswetter drove Razzaq into Ajmals midriff, only for the ball to bobble free as he attempted a shy at the non-strikers end.         
	The England openers scored of 44 in 5.4 overs. Kieswetters first boundary, in the third over, came courtesy of a chipped drive off Mohammad Aamer.         
	Lumbs let-off came when England were trying to push the run-rate as 19 runs had been bashed off Mohammad Asifs second over. Lumb clipped a four through fine leg when Ajmal failed to gather a drive off a low full-toss from Aamers very next delivery.         
	Ajmal did make amends for his misses when he induced Lumb to come down the pitch and got him stumped for 25 off only 13 deliveries.         
	Kieswetter fell three overs later for 25 from 27, but not before he had bludgeoned Mohammad Hafeez for a massive six that took a chunk out of the Garry Sobers pavilion at midwicket. It was the safer hands of Umar Akmal that ended his stay, as he held on to a mistimed lofted shot.         
	Pietersen got a reprieve as Razzaq missed a sharp caught and bowled chance. KP then creamed Ajmal to long-off where Aamer leapt with one hand but could only parry the chance over the rope for six.         
	Pietersen, whose form has been hit-and-miss of late, didnt need a third invitation to cash in, and Shahid Afridi was whipped back over his head for a second six, to bring up a 37-ball half-century.         
	In the same over, Paul Collingwood  who had played second fiddle in a 60-run stand for the third wicket  picked out Umar on the long-off boundary to depart for 15 from 16 balls. With 23 runs required from 24 balls, there was no late collapse on the cards.         
	For once, Eoin Morgan failed to apply the finishing touch as Ajmal slipped an arm-ball through his defences, but Pietersen stood firm to deliver a vital victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No solution to anthem issue
                                                                                                                       7                                      No solution to anthem issue
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The controversy regarding the cutting short of the national anthem on Friday, at the 3rd Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship (Central Zone), made the organisers to come up with an explanation and a probable solution, on Saturday.         
	However, if it the rule was weird earlier, it remained so even after the explanation.         
	Tournament director Ramana Rao said at a media conference that they were just following the International Volleyball Federation (IVF) protocol.         
	The IVF has allocated 31 minutes per team for pre-match formalities. That includes warm-up and the playing of the national anthem as well. This protocol is followed everywhere, including the Olympics and World Championships, he said.         
	Asked if there was a solution to the problem, Rao said: Now that this question has come up, we will be requesting the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to come up with a shorter version of our national anthem, like many countries do, for such sporting events.         
	However, that option is almost impossible since there is no musical interlude in the Indian national anthem.         
	The case is not same for Pakistan. Speaking on the issue, Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas said: We dont face a problem since we manage to sing our entire anthem within the given time. The musical interludes have been adjusted accordingly.         
	The other two sides, Iran and Kazakhstan, whose anthem too runs beyond the 45-second mark were, however, not bothered by the issue.         
	Strangely India coach Deshraj also was playing down the issue. Asked if he thought it was an insult to cut the national anthem short, he said: Thats the rule. We have to follow it and we have no problem with that.

  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  - Bowled better than I did versus Australia, says offie         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            A bowler has to be his own captain: Bhajji   Harbhajan Singh with the MoS trophy, on Tuesday      
	Nagpur: Offie Harbhajan Singh, MoS against New Zealand, spoke to The Telegraph at the Pride Hotel here on Tuesday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Youre the first specialist bowler to score at least 300 runs and take 10 wickets in a three-Test series...         
	A (Grins) Pata chal gaya tha... Got to know about it.         
	So, do you now see yourself as an all-rounder or are you still a specialist bowler?         
	My primary job is that of a bowler... But, yes, its a fact that I scored two hundreds in the just-ended series, batting at No.8... Both hundreds (Motera and Hyderabad) came at an important time and I contributed to the teams cause. People could call me an all-rounder, but my main job is that of a bowler.         
	Are you happy with the way you bowled?         
	Yes... Of course, one can always improve, but I bowled better than I did versus Australia, in the last Test series... Having said that, the effort didnt show in the wickets column... I wouldve been far happier had I finished with 15 instead of 10.         
	This is your first MoS award where batting (315 runs) played a big part...         
	Im a team man and Im happy that I contributed.         
	Is this award also dedicated to your late father (Sardar Sardev Singh)?         
	Absolutely... That wont ever change.         
	South Africa at home is going to be an entirely different proposition. As the senior-most bowler in the squad, what will you have to do?         
	Dont think Ill have to bowl differently... Obviously, some changes will have to be made, depending on the conditions... The bounce should be helpful.         
	Our chances...         
	Well have to play a lot better than we did against New Zealand, thats for sure.         
	Just how comfortable are you with the captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni?         
	Very comfortable... Fortunately, Ive had a good comfort level with all my captains... At the end of the day, though, a bowler needs to be his own captain. If he doesnt know what hes going to bowl, how can he ask for a particular field?         
	Youve been having pain in your left shin... Is there a specific treatment for that?         
	Rest...         
	What do you intend doing between now and, say, December 6, when the advance party leaves for South Africa?         
	Take a complete break and probably stay at home (Jalandhar).         
	Lastly... The teams given coach Gary Kirsten, who turned 43 on Tuesday, the perfect birthday gift...         
	(Grins) Any win is a gift... This was a near-perfect one, isnt it?

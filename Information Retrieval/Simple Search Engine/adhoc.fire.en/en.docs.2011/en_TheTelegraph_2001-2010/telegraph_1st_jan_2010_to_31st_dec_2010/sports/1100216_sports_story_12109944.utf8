                                                                                                                       7                                      Board pulls up Manoj Tiwary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has sent an e-mail to Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary on Monday threatening to ban him from playing domestic cricket for poor conduct on and off-the-field and instructed him to pay for the damages of properties of Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) as he smashed a window pane during the Jharkhand match last Friday.         
	The mail, a copy of which has also been forwarded to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) joint secretary Arun Mitra, has been sent by BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty and states that this was the second time in the last six months that Manojs on and off-field-behaviour has come under scanner.         
	Earlier, he was accused of poor conduct during a Bengal vs Orissa match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Dhanbad, in October last year.         
	Manoj has played for India and is a talented cricketer. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable More so, if it is repeated within a period of six months. We have sent this letter so that he understands the gravity of his mistake and never ever repeats such a thing in future, Shetty told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	Meanwhile, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla was fined 20 per cent of his match fees while the other players in the Bengal team were docked 10 per cent of their match fees for slow over rate against Assam.

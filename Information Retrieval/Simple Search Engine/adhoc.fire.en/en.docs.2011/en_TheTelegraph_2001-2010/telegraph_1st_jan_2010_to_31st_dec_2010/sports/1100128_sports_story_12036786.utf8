The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid and Laxman   may be fit
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dravid and Laxman   may be fit
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Rahul Dravid amp; V.V.S. Laxman                                 
	Calcutta: Its not official, but the national selectors appear to have got an indication that both Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman would be available for the two-Test series against South Africa.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat) will be meeting in Mumbai, on Thursday, to choose XV for the Tests in Nagpur and in Calcutta.         
	There would be a big hole in the Team India line-up if even one of the senior pros isnt fit for what promises to be a memorable series, starting February 6, between the top two teams.         
	Laxman got injured first, while fielding on the fourth day of the Chittagong Test; Dravid ducked into a Shahadat Hossain bouncer on Day II of the Test in Dhaka, which finished with a 10-wicket win for India.         
	Dravid, in fact, had to be hospitalised as the blow fractured a jaw bone. He left for home on Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the series was emphatically won 2-0.         
	[On reaching Bangalore, via Mumbai, Dravid said: Well see how it goes over the next couple of days... Ill be consulting doctors and the physios.]         
	Theres been no formal communication from the Board, but it seems the selectors have been given to understand that both Dravid and Laxman are going to be available... Theyve probably begun planning keeping that in mind, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli may come into the picture if one of the seniors cant be picked.         
	Yuvraj Singh and Sreesanth, though, are unlikely to be fit for the Tests. Yuvraj has torn a cartilage on his left wrist. As for Sreesanth, hes recovering from a hamstring injury.         
	The squad in Bangladesh had XVI players and the one who doesnt really come into the reckoning is all-rounder Dinesh Karthik.         
	Subramaniam Badrinath (Tamil Nadu) is likely to take Yuvrajs place, while Karnatakas right-arm quick, Abhimanyu Mithun, is being talked about as most suited to replace Sreesanth.         
	Badrinath has featured in Test squads before, but the 20-year-old Mithun, who was outstanding in the recent Ranji final against Mumbai, is an absolute rookie.         
	Playing in his first season of first-class cricket, Mithun took nine wickets (six in the second innings) in the final. That brought Karnataka right back in the match. Eventually, Mumbai won by as few as six runs.         
	Meanwhile, Bengals wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha is expected to make the Board Presidents XI, which is to face South Africa in a two-day match, in Nagpur, preceding the Test series.         
	LIKELY XV FOR THE TEST SERIES         
	(Assuming Dravid, Laxman are fit)         
	Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay; Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Subramaniam Badrinath; Mahendra Singh Dhoni; Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Sudeep Tyagi, Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	Note: Squad as of Wednesday evening.

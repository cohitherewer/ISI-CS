The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid and Rice vote   for India
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dravid and Rice vote   for India
                            
	Cape Town: Senior India batsman Rahul Dravid has warned South Africa that they could be making a big mistake if they prepare green-top pitches for the Test series starting next week as his side also possess no less a potent pace battery than the home side.         
	Dravid, who was among the second batch of Indians who landed at coach Gary Kirstens academy for pre-tour preparations, said his sides seam bowlers also have the ability to make the most of ideal fast-bowling conditions.         
	It will be a very competitive series, but I believe if our seam bowlers  Zaheer (Khan), Ishant (Sharma) and Sreesanth  can remain fit throughout the series, we will do very well, said Dravid, at the Claremont Club Academy, here.         
	South Africa are an excellent team, especially in the South African conditions  and we will have to play excellent cricket to beat them, Dravid said.         
	Almost echoing Dravid, former South Africa captain Clive Rice rated the India bowling attack higher than Proteas and predicted that the home bowlers would struggle to take 20 wickets against a batting line-up, which boasts of the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.         
	They can take several wickets between them, but it is too much to ask that they should take out India twice in a Test, said Rice.         
	The Indians have a well-balanced team, with their spinners and fast bowlers, who can combine excellently and are a threat on any pitch, Rice said.         
	Contrary to the belief of many who feels that fast bowlers would play a big role in the outcome of the Test series, Rice said the spinners would make the difference.

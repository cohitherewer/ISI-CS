	Subic Bay (Philippines): Former world junior champion Abhijeet Gupta beat compatriot G. N. Gopal and jumped into joint lead after the seventh round of the Asian Continental Chess Championship here.         
	The Chinese trio of Ni Hua, Ding Liren and LI Chao emerged as the new joint leaders along with Abhijeet. While all the leaders have 5.5 points apiece, a pack of four players, including second seed Krishnan Sasikiran, are also in contention for top honours with just two rounds to come.Sasikiran defeated Nguyen Thanh Son of Vietnam in his seventh round game.         
	With the top five places reserved for the next World Cup, P. Harikrishna, national champion B. Adhiban, S. P. Sethuraman, D. Harika and Tejas Bakre are in contention for a top finish but for that all of them will have to win the next two rounds.         
	Abhijeet was a class act with white. Gopal came up with an early opening surprise, going for the main line Slav instead of his trusted Grunfeld and followed an earlier game played by Abhijeet against Parimarjan Negi.         
	 Tania Sachdev was held to a draw by Irine Sukander Kharisma of Indonesia while S. Meenakshi and Kiran Manisha Mohanty also played a draw between them. (PTI)

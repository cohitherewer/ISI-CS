The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand held, Carlsen takes lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand held, Carlsen takes lead
                      
	Nanjing: World champion Viswanathan Anand was held to a draw by Wang Yue of China in the first round of Nanjing Pearl Spring Chess tournament, here, Wednesday.         
	Magnus Carlsen of Norway crashed through the defences of Frenchman Etienne Bacrot in style, to become an early leader in this double round robin tournament, after the other game between Bulgarian Veselin Topalov and Azerbaijani Vugar Gashimov also ended in a draw.         
	Carlsen leads the table with one point after the first round and Anand, Wang Yue, Gashimov and Topalov are close behind with half point in their kitty. With nine rounds still remaining in this euros 25,00,000 prize money tournament, Bacrot stands last in the six-players field.         
	Anand did not get many chances against Wang Yue, even though his position remained slightly preferable in the middle game, arising out of a Slav defence game.         
	Playing white, the Indian was up against the Fianchetto variation that has some similarities to the Grunfeld defence and Wang Yue was able to muster enough counter play to keep Anands forces at bay.         
	Anand got an optically better position but all that changed in quick time, after Wang Yue deployed his forces correctly on the queen side.         
	In the end, the game was drawn through repetition after 32 moves, with neither player willing to risk. (PTI)

  - Pacers George, Hazlewood surprise picks; Haddin unfit         A STAFF REPORTER            Philip Hughes                                 
	Calcutta: Australias regular wicketkeeper Brad Haddin will miss the two-Test series against India due to an elbow injury and Tim Paine will be doing duty behind the stumps as Cricket Australia named a 15-member squad on Thursday.         
	Rookie pacers Peter George and Josh Hazlewood were the surprise picks, while fit-again Philip Hughes and Nathan Hauritz made a return to the Ricky Ponting-led squad.         
	The trio take the place of fast bowler Clint McKay, middle-order batsman Usman Khawaja and left-arm spinner Steve Keefe, who were part of Australias squad for the two Tests against Pakistan in July.         
	While the excitement builds for the forthcoming Ashes, the immediate focus for this squad is the Test series against India, Australias national selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.         
	India is ranked No. 1 in Test cricket and there is no harder assignment in Test cricket at the moment than playing India on their home soil. The Australian squad is really looking forward to the challenge, he said.         
	Opener Hughes, who missed the series against England in June due to a dislocated shoulder, returns to the squad.         
	The squad we have selected sees the return from injury of Phillip Hughes and includes a very good mix of experience and new young talent with Steven Smith, Hughes and two young fast bowlers in Peter George and Josh Hazlewood, Hilditch said.         
	George and Hazlewood will be part of the new-look Aussie pace attack which will be spearheaded by Mitchell Johnson and Doug Bollinger.         
	Hazlewood rose to prominence during the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, and became the youngest cricketer to represent Australia when he played an ODI against England in June. The India tour will give him a chance to win a Test cap before he turns 20, in January.         
	While the 23-year-old George is yet to make his international debut in any form of the game, the 19-year-old Hazlewood has a one-dayer against England to his credit in June. Nathan Hauritz and Steven Smith are the two spinners in the team.         
	All these exciting young players have the potential to make a big impact in international cricket for many years and were confident they will all equip themselves well if the opportunity presents itself on this tour, Hilditch said.         
	Meanwhile, Australian physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said Haddin might be available for the three-match one-day series after the two Tests against India.         
	Brad Haddin is making good progress with rehabilitation of his elbow tendon injury. He is due to commence restricted batting in the next few weeks but will not be available to play in the Test component.         
	He is on track to be available for club cricket and for New South Wales with the possibility of being available for selection in the India or Sri Lanka one-day International series, Kountouris said.         
	As the first one-day International of the tour is not scheduled until October 17, the selection panel will monitor the fitness of injured players before taking a call.         
	The first Test will be played from October 1 in Mohali, while the second match is scheduled October 9 to 13 in Bangalore.

	Madrid: Barcelona produced another magical display of attacking football to sweep aside Real Sociedad 5-0 and return to the La Liga summit.         
	Following Real Madrids 3-1 victory over Real Zaragoza, the onus was on Barcelona to maintain their two-point advantage and they took the game to their opponents from the start, on Sunday.         
	With just eight minutes gone David Villa gave them the lead by converting a Pedro Rodriguez cross and from there it only got worse for Sociedad.         
	Barca added to their total when a fine passing movement culminated with an Andres Iniesta goal from a tight angle.         
	Lionel Messi, at his tantalising best, then hit a brace and there was still time for substitute Bojan Krkic to hit a fifth, a minute from the end.         
	We are not aware of what these players are going to do. This normally may happen once or twice but it is happening all the time at the moment and we are privileged to be able to work with them, said coach Pep Guardiola.         
	Real gave a more workmanlike performance to overturn bottom club Zaragoza.         
	With several players missing through injury and suspension, Real survived a wasted chance for the home sides Angel Lafita, before taking the lead when Mesut Ozil cut in from the right and beat the keeper.         
	Either side of the break Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel Di Maria scored to give Real a commanding advantage but Zaragoza never gave in. Gabi Fernandez pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Nicolas Bertolo had been felled by Ricardo Carvalho.         
	Espanyol were unable to capitalise on thirdplace Villarreals 10 defeat by Getafe as a spectacular free kick from substitute David Lopez gave Athletic Bilbao a 2-1 victory.         
	Athletic have only lost twice at home this season  to Barcelona and Atletico Madrid  but were in trouble after Pablo Osvaldo gave high  flying Espanyol a deserved lead.         
	Mallorca were hoping to bounce back after a disappointing 3-0 defeat by Getafe last week but they were beaten 1-0 by Racing Santander with Oscar Serrano scoring in the final minute.         
	Sporting Gijon and Levante came out with honours even in their relegation battle which ended 1-1 with Felipe Caicedos opener for Levante cancelled out by a Sebastian Eguren goal.         
	On Saturday, a brace by Sergio Aguero led Atletico Madrid to a 2-0 victory over Deportivo La Coruna.         
	Lowly Almeria produced an inspired performance to beat Sevilla 3-1 and pile the pressure on the troubled Andalusian side.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain hope Cup will ease malaise
                                                                                                                       7                                        Spain hope Cup will ease malaise
            Raphael Minder            Spaniards are hoping Vicente del Bosque (centre) and his boys will bring home the Cup                           
	Ever since ancient Rome, emperors and kings have relied on bread and games to keep their people content. Nowadays, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the prime minister of Spain, is having a hard time satisfying the publics economic demands as he struggles to reduce a mountain of debt and unemployment that has soared to 20 percent. So he is putting his hopes in the World Cup that begins in South Africa Friday, where Spain are one of the two favourites to win.         
	Spain has never won the World Cup before. But with essentially the same team that cruised to victory in the European Championships two years ago and a nearly undefeated record since, the football-loving Spanish will be deeply disappointed if they come home with anything less than the trophy.         
	There is a lot of eagerness to get out of this crisis and the government would want to emphasise anything that is good news, so a good World Cup is certainly important, said Jordi Sevilla, one of Zapateros former ministers.         
	Politics and sports have long been linked, particularly in tightly controlled societies where dictators have used football and success in the Olympics to strengthen their grip on power.         
	Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain for four decades, turned Real Madrid into his regimes official football team, benefiting from their success both domestically and abroad during a long spell of Spanish diplomatic isolationism.         
	In 1962, when Spain hosted the European Championships and won their first international title, defeating the Soviet Union in the final was also hailed as a victory over Communism.         
	When Zapatero recently announced that he would present a controversial plan to overhaul labour rules on June 16, the headlines of some national newspapers focused on the fact that Zapateros presentation of economic overhauls would coincide with Spains opening World Cup match against Switzerland.         
	Football has probably been used by politicians here more than in most other countries to cover other problems and I think politicians are continuing to do that, said Sandalio Gmez, the director in Madrid of the Centre for Sport Business Management at IESE, a leading business school. The government will use this World Cup to get some breathing room in this very difficult situation.         
	And given how passionate Spaniards are about the game, it could well succeed. However bad the economy, he said, football remains above this crisis.         
	On recent form, Spains co-favourite status for the World Cup alongside Brazil is hard to dispute. Fifa recently pushed Spain to No.2 behind Brazil in their world rankings, but that has not diminished the expectations here. Since winning the European Championship in 2008, the only glitch on Spains resume has been a defeat against the United States in last years Confederations Cup in South Africa, a tournament that was essentially a litmus test for the World Cup.         
	In March, in their most recent match against another European heavyweights, Spain managed their first away win against France since 1968 in style, scoring twice in the opening 45 minutes before turning the second half into a walk in the park. Given all their success, Spains national coach, Vicente del Bosque, has tried hard to deflate World Cup expectations.         
	Everybody in Spain thinks that anything except winning the World Cup is a failure, Del Bosque said. I think thats nonsense and a form of extremism but, in the times we live in, it seems that extremism sells.         
	Del Bosque has also faced a challenge in getting his players ready for the event. In recent weeks, many of them have been focused more on events off the pitch, including deciding whether to pack their bags for another city.         
	Spain also have a long history of underperforming at World Cups, including shocking defeats against inexperienced teams like Northern Ireland and Nigeria. Still, this Spanish squad has so much talent that any of their substitutes would probably waltz into the starting line-up of Switzerland, Chile and Honduras  the three nations in Spains World Cup group. Certainly nobody here could imagine an early return from South Africa, an optimism that is translating into strong sales of World Cup-related paraphernalia.         
	Juan Antonio Gonzlez Lorca, a bar owner and former marketing director of Atletico Madrid, one of Spains leading clubs, noted that many employees would receive a bonus payment of an additional monthly wage later in June, under the terms of Spains collective bargaining agreements.         
	A World Cup is the best present that a government could get in a time of crisis, he said. There will be no additional household savings this month, and that extra money will surely go on a football shirt for a kid or just having a good time outside the house.

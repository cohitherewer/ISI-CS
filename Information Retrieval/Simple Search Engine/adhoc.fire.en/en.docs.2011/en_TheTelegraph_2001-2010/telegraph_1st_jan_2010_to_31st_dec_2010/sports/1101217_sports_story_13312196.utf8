The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England fast and furious in Perth

	Perth: It is not a case of take it or leave it at the Waca. It is a case of leave it then take it: leave the new ball then take the urn.         
	If, for the first hour of the second day, Englands opening pair of Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook continue to leave the ball as well as they have done so far, only something on the lines of deus ex machine can stop England taking an unbreakable grip on this game  and the Ashes.         
	Australias batsmen should be better at leaving the ball in Perth, but their minds are confused and only Michael Hussey showed them how.         
	Englands preparation, yet again, has been admirable: they have discovered the formula of making the utmost of what they have. Thanks to this fundamental incompetence of Australias batsmen, the opening hour was almost as dramatic as in Adelaide.         
	The difference was that Strauss sent Australia in this time: If he had any doubts about bowling first on a relatively well-grassed pitch, then a glance at Pontings teamsheet just before the toss would have allayed them.         
	If all were to go wrong, and England had to bat out for a draw, they would have no specialist spinner to face in their fourth innings on a pitch that looks as though it will hold together.         
	Bang, bang, bang: Australias top-order was blown away by disciplined bowling and their own poor batting. Michael Clarke won the palm for poor shot-selection; Phil Hughes for poor shot-execution, bowled as he was between bat and pad; while Ponting has had no luck in this series.         
	Or maybe it is that England raise their game even higher when Ponting comes in, knowing they must not let him get away and play one last great innings.         
	England have started to hunt as a pack in the field. They brought down Ponting for single figures in both innings at Adelaide, and now it was a leaping righthanded blinder by Paul Collingwood at third slip.         
	Englands allround efforts in the field have been superbly marshalled by Matt Prior. Not to concede a bye at the Waca is a feat in itself. Prior has grown in stature  sideways: He can cover as much ground to his left or right as any England keeper there has been. Of English keepers, only Keith Piper, who kept to Allan Donald at Edgbaston when the ball swung after pitching, has surely had a wider span.         
	Truth be told, England fielded  but did not bowl  brilliantly.         
	Chris Tremlett did, compensating every inch for the absence of Stuart Broad and enjoying some of the fortune which Broad had stored up; James Anderson began a bit rustily after his flight home, and inaccurately, but improved from spell to spell until he finished on 199 Test wickets; and Steve Finn was wayward at times. But Australias batting was too poor to punish Englands bowling flaws.         
	Before lunch the pitch had life, but not enough to justify four wickets down: the fourth was that of Shane Watson who was yorked by Finn.         
	The Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) continues to evolve: if a player appeals immediately, the umpires decision is almost certainly wrong. Watson appealed in the games first over, immediately; then later, after hesitation and discussion with his partner, to no avail.         
	Brad Haddin made a fighting 53 off 80 balls, Mitchell Johnson 62 off 93, Peter Siddle 35 off 59. Irritating runs for England, except that they also confirmed the trueness of the pitch and the extent of the failure of Australias top order.

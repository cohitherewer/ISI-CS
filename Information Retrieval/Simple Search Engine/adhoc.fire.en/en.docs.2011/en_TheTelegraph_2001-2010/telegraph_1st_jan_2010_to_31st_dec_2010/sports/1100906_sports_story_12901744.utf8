The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its a battle against time, says Hooper
                                                                                                                       7                                      Its a battle against time, says Hooper
                      
	New Delhi: Indias failure to ensure that all the Commonwealth Games venues and the athletes village comply with safety provision norms could jeopardise the organisation of the event, according to Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) CEO Mike Hooper, who said the organisers have allowed things to go down to the wire.         
	Acknowledging that lot of work still needs to be done, Hooper said that they are yet to receive confirmation from the Organising Committee (OC) that the village, or any of the venues, are structurally safe and sound. The failure to do so could place some events in danger. Athletes from 71 nations will arrive from September 16 to residen in the Games village and start training.         
	Things are surely going to go down to the wire. Its a battle against time. If the OC failed to provide the safety certifications on time, if we cant get the documentation of the Games village and the venues on time, then a particular event or so may be in trouble, Hooper said. Whether its about venue safety at Jawaharlal Nehru stadium or any other stadium, clearly we are all aware of the CVC (Central Vigilance Commission) report last month and implications of that report suggests sub-standard materials and fabricated case results. Thats a matter of concern to us.         
	Despite many promises made by the government agencies to deliver the documentation to validate and verify all the buildings standards have been met, fire safety certificates have been issued, we (CGF) still have not been able to get them, and that still remains a cause of great concern to us, Hooper said. They (the players) cant occupy the Games village unless the building certification is not there. They cant go to the venue unless venues certification is not there, he added.

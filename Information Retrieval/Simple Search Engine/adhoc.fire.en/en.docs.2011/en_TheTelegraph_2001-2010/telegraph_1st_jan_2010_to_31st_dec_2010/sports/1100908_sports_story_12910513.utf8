	Johannesburg: The Champions League Twenty20, starting here on Friday, will give cricket fans around the world an opportunity to shift their focus on the game from the murky spot-fixing scandal involving the Pakistan players, feel international cricketers.         
	Australian pacer Shaun Tait said the scam was a slur on the game and CLT20 will bring a breath of fresh air for the fans.         
	It is a good time for this tournament to happen because cricket will be moving forward. People will at last get to see a competitive tournament rather than look at the rubbish going on in England, Tait said, on Tuesday.         
	The tournament is happening in the perfect time because it will shift the focus back on cricket, added Tait, who will be playing for South Australian Redbacks side in the CLT20.         
	Cricket plunged into a crisis after an expose by a British tabloid showed three Pakistan players  Test captain Salman Butt and pace duo of Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer  were allegedly involved in spot-fixing during the Lords Test, against England.         
	The tainted trio were suspended by the International Cricket Council and an investigation by Scotland Yard currently under progress.         
	Big-hitting West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard was also of the view that CLT20 brings an opportunity to regain spectators faith in the game.         
	I dont want to speak on the topic because I am not involved in it and, so far in my career, nothing like this has happened. The most we (cricketers) can do at this moment is play competitive, hard and fair cricket whenever we get on to the field, be it the CLT20 or any other International matches, said Pollard, who will be representing the Mumbai Indians in the tournament.         
	South African middle-order batsman JP Duminy, however, expressed sympathy for the promising Aamer, but added that when it comes to match-fixing, he always prefers to remain extra vigilant.         
	It is a pity that such serious and big allegations have come into cricket. But personally, I always try to keep myself miles away from all these things. For a cricketer, its about saying the right things at the right time and remaining extra careful, the left-hander said.         
	I feel for Aamer It is a pity to be in this position, especially in this young age. I hope he comes out clean and enjoys a long career, added Duminy, who will also turn out for the Mumbai Indians.         
	Meanwhile, Tait is excited about playing in the CLT20, in south Africa. Ive never had a chance to bowl in South Africa, said Tait, who had to return home to Australia with a back injury sustained in net practice during the 2005-06 Australian tour of South Africa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee, Nehra to miss opener
                                                                                                                       7                                        Lee, Nehra to miss opener

	Mohali: The Kings XI Punjab face an uphill task in their tournament opener against the Delhi DareDevils with most of their first-choice players suffering from injury as the franchise kick off their campaign in the third edition of the Indian Premier League here Saturday.         
	The biggest blow on match eve was Australian pacer Brett Lees flying back home to receive treatment for the elbow injury from which he is yet to recover. Lee has been ruled out of the event for the first 10 days due to the injury. He will miss at least four matches.         
	The DareDevils have injury worries of their own and it turns out that the Delhi franchise will miss the services of pace spearhead Ashish Nehra in Saturdays match.         
	DareDevils coach Eric Simons admitted that the absence of the left-arm pacer might disturb their bowling calculations.         
	Losing Ashish is going to be difficult for us as he held the perfect balance in our bowling attack. He was definitely the biggest player we had, Simons said at a news conference. Simons also said that it would be difficult to predict at this moment when Nehra would be available.         
	New Kings XI captain Kumar Sangakkara, who replaced Yuvraj Singh, thus has his task cut out which would be to see the team through against a dangerous Delhi side that boasts of the likes of captain Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, and T20 specialist David Warner.         
	Yuvraj has been nursing a wrist injury picked up during Indias tour of Bangladesh and his participation in the opener looks uncertain.         
	Shaun Marsh, too, looks unlikely for the starter and, in his absence, Sangakkara might open the innings with young Punjab batsman Karan Goel.         
	The Indian trio of Irfan Pathan, Piyush Chawla and Romesh Powar would be looking to come good down the order with their pinch hitting apart from aiming to restrict the DareDevils from scoring heavily.         
	In Lees absence, new recruit Yusuf Abdulla would likely share the new ball with Sreesanth and Pathan.         
	Punjab have signed up four domestic players  medium-pacers Love Ablish and Shalabh Srivastava, batsman Manvinder Bisla and all-rounder Reetinder Sodhi.         
	The DareDevils, on the other hand, would be looking to get rid of the chokers tag after failing to get past the semis in the previous two editions.         
	In Nehras absence, Dirk Nannes will have to lead the attack. Nannes does have the ability to trouble batsmen, especially on a bouncy Mohali track.           (PTI)

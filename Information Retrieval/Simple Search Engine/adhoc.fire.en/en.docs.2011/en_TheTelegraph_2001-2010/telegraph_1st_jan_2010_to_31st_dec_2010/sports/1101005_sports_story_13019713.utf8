	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), at its working committee meeting on Monday, fixed the remuneration to be paid to various state selectors from this season. It was decided that the senior selectors would be paid Rs 1 lakh per season, while the junior selectors would get Rs 75,000 and women selectors Rs 20,000, respectively.         
	In another decision, the working committee members retained the previous selection committees. Sambaran Banerjee was retained as the chairman of senior committee, Barun Burman as chairman of junior committee and Mithu Mukherjee as chairman of women selectors.         
	Meanwhile, it was learnt that CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey has been made observer for the second India-Australia Test in Bangalore .         
	Dey will also meet BCCI secretary and president-elect N. Srinivasan on Tuesday to discuss the grant for reconstruction of the Eden Gardens for the 2011 World Cup.         
	The BCCI can grant a maximum of Rs 50 crore to state associations for revamping stadiums hosting World Cup matches. The amount is usually half of the total expenditure incurred. Expenditure for revamping the Eden Gardens could be more than the estimated budget of Rs 75 to Rs 80 crore, said CAB sources.

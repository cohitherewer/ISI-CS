            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: World No. 4 Andy Murray humbled Roger Federer in a one hour 25 minutes contest in the final of the Shanghai Masters, on Sunday.         
	The 23-year-old Scot was in impeccable form throughout 6-3, 6-2 victory, breaking the third seeds serve four times to dismantle the 16 time Grand Slam champion and claim his second Masters title of the season.         
	However, Pete Sampras, winner of 14 Grand Slams, was of the view that Murray, in spite of his impressive win on Sunday, invariably fails to get past a Federer or a Rafael Nadal in the Slams. He was also of the opinion that Murrays road to glory was made easier by a casual attitude from Federer.         
	The following is what Sampras had to say:         
	What a brilliant performance from Andy Murray, though its important to point out that Federer never really got going His attitude and form wasnt far from that of my local pub team in the nearby park every other Sunday. Well done Andy, you can only play your best and that you did.         
	When history is written, people will look at all sorts of statistics Murrays impressive head to head against Federer, the number of Masters titles Murray has You can go on and on and it makes good reading indeed.         
	The most important statistics, which few with a mind for the game will look at, is far from most of these above. Its a statistics most would rather not mention as its reality dampens their rating of the British No. 1, but only this statistics will define Andy Murrays career.         
	Roger Federer in Slams does not drop sets to Murray, let alone lose to him. Rafael Nadal, when fit, does not lose or drop sets to Murray. (Ive included Murrays victories at the US open amp; Australia Open in all these)         
	The road to a Slam in this era has to go through these two cul-de-sacs few have conquered and Im afraid a polished version of Tim Henman such as Murray will not do so. Well done nevertheless Andy, you are a shining hope for our tennis on these isles.

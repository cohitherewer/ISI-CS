The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now, gag order from the coach 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Now, gag order from the coach 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Woorkeri Venkat Raman hasnt changed a bit in the last nine years. Thats what some of the senior Bengal players, who played during the 2001-02 season when he was the coach, feel.         
	A strict disciplinarian, Raman, on the very first day of his second innings as Bengal coach, was quick to impose gag order on players. And rightly so. His message was straight: first perform and then talk  something that the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has been longing to do.         
	Even senior players like Laxmi Ratan Shukla requested the scribes not to ask questions. The coach has strictly told us that we shouldnt speak to the media. Please understand, Shukla said.         
	Raman himself, too, didnt want to speak to the media. Asked about the difficulty in managing 39 players, he said, with a wry smile: Dont try that with me boss. I used to be a good chess player during my younger days.         
	Ramanbhai hasnt changed at all. The same work ethic, discipline and a great sense of humour. He is a professional to the core, a senior bowler, who also played under him during 2001-02 season, said.

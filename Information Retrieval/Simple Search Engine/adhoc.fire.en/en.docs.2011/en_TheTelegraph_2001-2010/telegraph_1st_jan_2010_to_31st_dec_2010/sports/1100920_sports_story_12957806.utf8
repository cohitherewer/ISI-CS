                                                                                                                       7                                        Berbatov does it for United
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Florent Malouda (right) and Michael Essien celebrate Chelseas win over Blackpool, in London, on Sunday. (Reuters)                           
	Dimitar Berbatov scored a stunning hattrick as Manchester United claimed victory in a pulsating clash with Liverpool at Old Trafford. Liverpool had clawed back from 2-0 down with two strikes from Steven Gerrard to seemingly seal a hard-fought draw against United.         
	But Berbatov completed a memorable personal performance with a header six minutes from time that secured victory.         
	With Rio Ferdinand ruled out of the game after falling ill overnight, United started with a centre-half pairing of Nemanja Vidic and Jonny Evans.         
	But Liverpool were so poor in the first-half that Ferdinand could probably have climbed off his sickbed to play and not been unduly troubled. Liverpools unambitious approach allowed United to dominate possession and heap pressure on the visitors, but they took time to get their own game together, with their dominance rarely translated into goal scoring opportunities.         
	The first chance of the game fell to Nani on 16 minutes, but the Portuguese winger had a shot blocked and then directed the rebound wide after being teed up by Wayne Rooney inside the six yard box. Nani was central to Uniteds attacking efforts. Alex Ferguson had clearly pinpointed Liverpool left-back Paul Konchesky as a weak-link and Nanis pace and trickery caused the former England defender problems.         
	Nani was booked on 36 minutes, though, after a late challenge on Konchesky, seemingly in retribution for a clash between the pair two minutes earlier that resulted with the United rolling around on pitch, clutching his face.         
	Just as half-time loomed, United deservedly broke the deadlock when Berbatov netted his fifth goal of the season with a header from Ryan Giggss corner.         
	Berbatov escaped the attentions of marker Fernando Torres before directing his header past Pepe Reina and Konchesky, who failed with a desperate bid to stop the ball with his hand.         
	The Bulgarian looked to have won the game for United on 59 minutes when he doubled their lead with an over-head kick from Nanis cross.         
	But rather than cave in, Liverpool fought back and they were handed a route back into the game when referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty on 63 minutes following Evanss late challenge on Torres. Evans contested the decision, but it was a clear penalty and Gerrard calmly sent the ball past Edwin van der Sar to make it 2-1.         
	Having been outplayed throughout, Liverpool now had a lifeline and a clumsy foul by John Shea on Torres just outside the penalty area gifted the visitors another chance.         
	Shea was lucky not be receive a red card, with him acting as the last defender when he felled Torres, but Gerrard meted out his own punishment by sending his 20-yard free-kick into the net to make it 2-2. Ferguson looked forlorn and angry on the United bench, but the game was to have another twist and Berbatov supplied it when he made it 3-2 with a bullet header from Sheas cross on 84 minutes.         
	Its a magical day, special for me of course because I scored a hattrick and we won against our rivals Liverpool, Berbatov said. Everything was really happening for me.         
	United threw away a two-goal lead in the second half when Steven Gerrard scored two goals in six minutes for Liverpool, but Berbatovs third in the 84th minute sealed the three points.         
	Leaders Chelsea extended their perfect start to the season by routing Blackpool 4-0 on Sunday.         
	Chelsea took just two minutes go in front against Blackpool. After Salomon Kalous tap-in, Florent Malouda scored twice and Didier Drogba netted with a deflected strike.         
	Chelsea have a four-point lead at the top of the standings over Arsenal and Manchester United, while Manchester City are fourth after beating Wigan 2-0.         
	The opener had a great deal of fortune about it as City goalkeeper Joe Harts deep kick struck Mohammed Diame and Carlos Tevez pounced on his backward-header before lofting the ball over the advancing home goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi.         
	In the 70th, Maynor Figueroa failed to head clear allowing Tevez to cross across the face of goal for Yaya Toure to fire in his first City goal.

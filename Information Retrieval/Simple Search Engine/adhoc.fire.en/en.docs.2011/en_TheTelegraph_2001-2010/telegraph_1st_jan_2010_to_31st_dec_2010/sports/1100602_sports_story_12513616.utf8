The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI will not send teams to the Asian Games
                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI will not send teams to the Asian Games
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The Indian fans who would have liked to see Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men singing the national anthem on the victory podium at the upcoming Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, will be disappointed as the BCCI has decided against taking part in the quadrennial extravaganza.         
	Both our mens and womens teams would not be participating in the Asian Games. We have already communicated our decision (to the Indian Olympic Association), BCCIs chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said.         
	When asked for the reason to not send the team, Shetty said it was due to international commitments. The 16th edition of the Asian Games, to be held from November 12 to 27, would see cricket making its debut. However, the Indian team would be hosting New Zealand in three Tests and five one-day Internationals in November.         
	The question of putting commercial interests above national pride has cropped up again.         
	The BCCIs reluctance to send cricket teams to multi-discipline events was evident in the 1998 Commonwealth Games where they sent a second-string squad to Kuala Lumpur, while the majority of the frontline cricketers played Pakistan in Toronto in a best-of-five ODI rubber. Countries which are expected to send cricket teams for the Games include Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	The Olympic Council of Asia secretary general Randhir Singh on Tuesday lashed out at the BCCI for the decision to not sending their teams.         
	Im very, very disappointed because we were really keen to have cricket in multi-discipline events, Randhir said.         
	The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) worked really hard to get cricket included in the Asian Games but BCCIs decision is very disappointing, said the OCA top official, who is also the Indian Olympic Association general secretary.         
	This is not the first time that BCCI backed out from a multi-discipline event, Randhir said.         
	Organisers of the Delhi Commonwealth Games were also keen to have Twenty20 cricket but the BCCI was not.         
	The BCCI insisted it did not want to promote Twenty20 while Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Chairman Suresh Kalmadi said the format could be changed but the BCCI needed to make up their mind if they really wanted cricket in the Games.         
	We are not insisting on whether it should be Twenty20 or 50 overs. It is for the ICC (crickets world governing body) and the BCCI to decide, Kalmadi had said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brasa did a good job: Charlesworth

            OUR SPECIAL CORRSPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The 0-8 thrashing against Australia in the Commonwealth Games hockey final is likely to hasten the exit of Indias chief coach Jose Brasa. Sources in the Hockey India (HI) on Thursday suggested that Brasa would surely be shown the door, after the Asian Games.         
	What happened in the final is a shock, said a HI official. We didnt really expect to win the final, but the margin of defeat was humiliating.         
	However, the president of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) Leandro Negre, currently in the capital, is believed to have advised the HI to retain the coach.         
	Brasa, on the other hand, said he was not aware that Negre had asked the HI to retain him after the Asian Games. I have seen Negre at the ground, but I am yet to talk to him, he told The Telegraph.         
	The Spaniard, however, received support from Australia coach Ric Charlesworth, who said the margin of victory for his team did not reflect the actual level of competition.         
	I think Brasa has done a good job, said the Aussie legend. I can see a difference in the Indian team. They are now playing a good game, added Charlesworth.         
	The problem here is SAI and the bureaucracy. I faced it during my short tenure in India, said the Aussie coach. I am sure Brasa is also having problems with them. It would be best to privatise hockey in India, he added. .

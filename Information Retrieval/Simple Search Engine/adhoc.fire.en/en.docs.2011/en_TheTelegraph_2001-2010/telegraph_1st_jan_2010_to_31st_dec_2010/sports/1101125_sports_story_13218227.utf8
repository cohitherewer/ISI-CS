	Calcutta: Trailing Calcutta Football League Premier Division leaders East Bengal by just three points, Mohun Bagan coach Stanley Rozario Wednesday said they are well-prepared to defeat the arch-rivals in Fridays derby and defend the premier division title.         
	It will be a do-or-die match. We are ready. The boys are confident and Im sure it will be our day on November 26.         
	It will be the CFL decider - whoever wins on that day will virtually win the title, Rozario said.         
	Mohun Bagan have lost to East Bengal in the finals of both the Federation Cup and Platinum Jubilee Cup in their last two encounters, but Rozario felt poor refereeing did them in.         
	Poor referee decision denied two goals in the Federation Cup. While in the Platinum Jubilee Cup final, we lost out in the tie-breaker which can be anybodys game. We were not under any pressure, he added.         
	Mohun Bagan struck a three-year-deal with Saradha Group on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke breaks silence
                                                                                                                       7                                        Clarke breaks silence
                  Michael Clarke                     
	Wellington: Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke, speaking publicly for the first time since abruptly quitting the ongoing tour of New Zealand and the subsequent break-up with fiancee Lara Bingle, Wednesday hoped the episode will not distract him from the upcoming Test series.         
	Clarke, who cited personal reasons for abruptly quitting the ODI series and flew back to Sydney to meet Bingle, has defended his decision and said he had also received some timely advice from Shane Warne.         
	I have spoken to Warney. Ive spoken to a lot of my friends and my family. Hes been a wonderful friend of mine for a long time and he was excited to see me back in New Zealand and wished me all the best for Fridays Test match, Clarke said, at a press conference at the Westpac Stadium here.         
	I first made the decision to go home but then to come back to New Zealand, knowing there was a big Test match starting on Friday. I knew Id be capable to get up for that.         
	Preparation has been very important to me throughout my whole career and its no different now. Yesterday (Tuesday) it was important to get back to the nets and have a good bat, see that red ball, he said.         
	Clarke also said that it was very important at that point to go back home and deal with the relationship issues.         
	Being back in the team environment will no doubt be a welcome change for Clarke, who over the past week and a half has woken to see photographers and TV cameras trained in on his Sydney apartment, waiting for any glimpse of him or Bingle. Clarke said he never expected there would be so much interest in his personal life but accepted it was an inevitable part of being a high-profile sportsman.         
	Its part of what we do... Being a professional athlete, its not just about what you do on the field, its what you do off the field as well, Clarke said.         
	We have to accept that and for me it was important to do what I had to do in my personal life and its important for me now to be back with my teammates and make sure Im concentrating on playing a Test match for Australia, Clarke said.         
	(Going home) was obviously something that I thought was very important and needed to be done and I did that. My teammates were fantastic and very supportive. Cricket Australia, the ACA, all my friends and family have been wonderful. Thats obviously why Im back here now, trying to get out there on Friday and perform in Australia, he added.         
	Clarke also admitted that he was expecting some personal sledging when he enters the ground for the first match commencing from Friday here.         
	Im sure Ill get a little bit of stick (from the crowd), but I dont mind that. No matter where you go around the world, every country wants their team to win and do well, so well wait and see what happens on Friday. But I dont think that will affect me too much.         
	Ive copped a fair bit of sledging in my time, whether it be about stuff on the field or off the field. Well just have to wait and see (if the players sledge). But I have the utmost respect for the New Zealand guys and Im sure theyre the same. So well play it by ear, but Im sure it wont affect me, Clarke added.

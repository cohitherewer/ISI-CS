The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK has eye on goal, Frost on lips
                                                                                                                       7                                        SRK has eye on goal, Frost on lips
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Lalit Modi was present for KKRs first home match                           
	Calcutta: Inspired by Robert Frosts Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, Shah Rukh Khan scripted Miles to go... Promises to keep as the Kolkata Knight Riders motto for the IPLs third season, which got under way last Friday.         
	And, so, the post-win celebrations even internally have been low-key as the principal owner is looking at every victory as a means to an end and not an end in itself.         
	After two poor seasons, one can appreciate why such an approach.         
	No cake was cut in the dressing room... In fact, Shah Rukh spent only a few minutes, said things generally and shook hands with a few... Hes not getting carried away and wouldnt like the team to get carried away either, a well-placed source told The Telegraph, on Sunday evening.         
	Speaking after the Knights seven-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore, the source added: The tournament has just begun and Shah Rukh would like this momentum (driven by two victories in as many matches) to first be taken forward... A dozen league matches remain.         
	The IPLs chairman and commissioner, Lalit Modi, was at the Eden to watch the Knights first home match of the season. Surrounded by bodyguards, he left suitably impressed.         
	Its always nice when bottom-placed teams do well... The Knight Riders finished last in 2009 and, now, have started with wins in successive matches... Good for them and good for the IPL, as bigger crowds will come, Modi remarked.         
	He added: The results over the past couple of days have shown that all teams (in the IPL) are competitive... Thats what wed like...         
	Not too long ago, being a Jagmohan Dalmiya-baiter, Modi wouldve stayed away from any match here. Times, though, have changed.

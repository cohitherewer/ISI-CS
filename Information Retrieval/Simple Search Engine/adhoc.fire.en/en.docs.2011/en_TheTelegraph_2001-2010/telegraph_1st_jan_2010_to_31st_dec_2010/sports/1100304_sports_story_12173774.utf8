            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Their 6-0 victory over Canada notwithstanding, German coach Markus Weise is not too happy with the newly-laid pitch at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, the venue for the World Cup.         
	The stadium, formerly known as the Imperial Amphitheatre and then as the National Stadium, has been redesigned for the World Cup and is also a venue for the Commonwealth Games later this year.         
	It was definitely a smooth and satisfying win but I am not too happy with the way the pitch has been behaving during the course of play, said the German coach as his side look to become the only side to win three back to back world titles.         
	The new turfs have some problem, not only in India but all over the world, said Weise.         
	The pitch is bouncy and the ball is difficult to control. Playing a match on this turf is not the best experience.         
	Asked how then were his team able to strike three goals from penalty corners, Weise said they had to adopt a different tactic to get the goals: We had to push the ball harder on the ground to keep the balance.         
	Germany captain Maximillian Muller echoed his coachs view, saying his team needed more practice on this turf. It was definitely bouncy and uneven in both the matches. To play on this turf is not an easy task, he said.         
	Dutch drag-flicker Taeke Taekema, who scored a hattrick against Argentina the other day, too, had similar a complaint.         
	The pitch is a little bumpy at times, especially when it is dry and not watered. In practice matches also we faced a few problems but luckily we managed to overcome them, the topscorer in the 2006 World Cup said.         
	Argentina skipper Martin Lucas Rey agrees: The pitch was bouncy. We had a lot of problems. Once I pushed the ball but the stopper couldnt stop it as it suddenly bounced in front of him.

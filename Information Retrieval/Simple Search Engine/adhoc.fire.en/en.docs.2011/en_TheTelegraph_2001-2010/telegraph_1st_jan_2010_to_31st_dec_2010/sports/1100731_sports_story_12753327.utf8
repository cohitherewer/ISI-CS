The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rankings boost for India
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rankings boost for India
    - Even if Lanka win final Test, Dhoni and Co. wont be displaced           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Kumar Sangakkara , Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                  
	Colombo: Oh, really... Weve dropped to No.5... But how?         
	That was Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkaras bewildered reaction when The Telegraph showed him an email, from the International Cricket Council (ICC), stating that India would remain No.1 even if it lost the third and final Test.         
	Quickly regaining composure, Sangakkara said: Well, if thats so... I wouldnt say this is going to affect our planning... Winning the series remains our objective.         
	Never a great fan of the ICCs rankings, Sangakkara is likely to become more critical.         
	Till Friday afternoon, it was assumed that while even a draw, at the P.Sara Stadium, next week, would help India keep the top position, Sri Lanka had to win to jump from No.4 to the summit. That changed in the evening, after the ICCs annual update.         
	Talk of timing...         
	With the second Test for the Micromax Cup set for a draw on the fourth day itself, the focus on Day V had to be on the final Test, beginning Tuesday.         
	The attention is still on the P.Sara Stadium, but the rankings bit, at least, is now a non issue.         
	What isnt is just who will bat at No.6 for India. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni shed no light, confirming that it would only be clear at 9.30 am on Tuesday. At the toss, that is.         
	Just wait and watch, he advised, grinning.         
	A problem has arisen after Suresh Rainas superb 120 on debut, at the SSC. He got his opportunity as Yuvraj Singh fell ill. The latter, however, has recovered and fielded on Friday.         
	This may well be Dhonis toughest call since taking over the Test captaincy 20 months ago.         
	Dhoni, of course, had much praise for Raina. Hes a real positive cricketer, very active and aggressive on the field... That gets reflected in his batting... Hes played quite a bit against this attack and, so, knew the bowlers strengths and weaknesses...         
	Rainas intensity was great and he deserved a hundred on debut... Hopefully, touch wood, hell continue to do well...         
	With the series alive, Dhoni managed to quip: For any captain, losing the toss is the biggest crime he can commit!         
	He called incorrectly both in Galle, where Sri Lanka won by 10 wickets, and here.         
	The second Test, which saw almost 1,500 runs and a little more than a handful of wickets on a yawn-attracting surface, ended shortly before the start of the scheduled last hour, when MoM Sangakkara effected his second declaration (this being symbolic) of the match.         
	Earlier, Indias first innings, which began in the final session on Day II, stretched till almost lunch on the concluding day. Time enough to register the highest total away from home  707.         
	Day V, though, was an absolute farce and the ICC should look at options to ensure nobody goes through the motions for hours on end.         
	It was a relief when Sangakkara decided enough was enough.         
	Look, 99.9 per cent of the time you wont get a result on such wickets... This was a placid track, with nothing in it for anyone, Dhoni remarked.         
	Sangakkara, for his part, appeared to rue the fact that Sri Lanka didnt actually bat till around 750, instead of having declared the first innings at 642 for four.         
	Its debatable how much of a difference even that wouldve made.         
	One of the first things which Sangakkara, vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene and chief selector Aravinda de Silva did, after the draw, was to have a chat with Lasith Malinga.         
	The trios body language suggested that they were desperate to have the slinger back in the XI. An understandable want that.         
	Meanwhile, manager Ranjib Biswal insisted that Sachin Tendulkar was fine, after word got around that the champion bat had a groin injury.         
	Footnote: With Dhoni longing for ghar ka khana, the first lady of Indian cricket, Sakshi, rustled up a few dishes in the Taj Samudra kitchen on Friday evening. Given her background, she wouldnt have felt uncomfortable wearing the apron.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selectors must look for all-rounders: Gavaskar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Selectors must look for all-rounders: Gavaskar
    - Now, we cant get a Kapil Dev, who is a once-in-a-century cricketer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sunil Gavaskar poses with a replica of the 1983 World Cup and a bat signed by members of the winning side, in his office in Mumbai, on Wednesday. The day marked the 25th anniversary of Indias other most significant ODI triumph  the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. That success came under Gavaskars captaincy. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Mumbai: Till a well-wisher reminded Sunil Gavaskar that March 10 was actually a day for double celebrations, hed forgotten that Indias historic Test win in Port of Spain, back in 1971, had been on the very day as the World Championship of Cricket (WCC) success 14 years later, in 1985.         
	Somebody wished me happy anniversaries... I asked why and he said that the win in the West Indies had also been on March 10, Gavaskar told The Telegraph on Wednesday, chuckling.         
	While Gavaskar had been a debutant in Port of Spain, under Ajit Wadekars leadership, he was himself the captain when India lifted the WCC, thrashing Pakistan by eight wickets in the final at the MCG.         
	The WCC success, in fact, came within two years of the World Cup win. Those successes remain the biggest for India in ODIs.         
	May seem odd, but thats the reality.         
	With the 2011 World Cup less than a year away, was there something for the present-day selectors, then, to learn?         
	Gavaskar replied: Yes, look for players who could be all-rounders... The all-rounders, after all, made the difference both in 1983 and in 1985... Were looking at all-rounders for the No.7 and No.8 positions...         
	Now, we cant get a Kapil Dev, who is a once-in-a-century cricketer, but it would help if we got guys with the determination and attitude of a Ravi Shastri, Mohinder Amarnath, Madanlal or a Roger Binny... We need to have more of their type...         
	Shastri, who was adjudged the Champion of Champions on conclusion of the WCC, maintained: Look, six-seven players need to be contributing all the time... If players dont get injured in the lead up to the World Cup, then we do have a good nucleus... India, I feel, will start as a frontrunner... Dont forget were one of the hosts and that definitely has advantages...         
	However, Shastri accepted that it was tough to replicate the 1983 and 1985 wins. The pressure, indeed, is huge... Its tough...         
	Its all for the men, then, not the boys.

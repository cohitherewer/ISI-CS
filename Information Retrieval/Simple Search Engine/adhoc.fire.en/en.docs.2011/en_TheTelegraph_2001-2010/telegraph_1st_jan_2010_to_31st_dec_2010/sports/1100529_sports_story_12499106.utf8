	Lajong FC failed to avoid relegation as they went down 1-3 to Salgaocar in the last round of the I-League at the Duler ground in Mapusa on Friday. Lajong, who needed an outright win to avoid relegation, were down by a goal in the first period as Salgaocar scored through Milagres Gonsalves in the 32nd minute.         
	Salgaocar increased the lead through Ekene Ikenwa in the 82nd minute. Ekene then sealed Lajongs fate when he scored his second in the opening minute of injury time. Lajong, however, got the consolation when Anil Gurung scored in the last minute of the added time.         
	Lajong, thus, ended their campaign in the last spot with 26 points and are demoted to the second division along with Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	In Mumbai, hosts Mumbai FC (MFC) retained their berth after Abhishek Yadav struck twice to help them beat Mohun Bagan 2-0. Yadav scored the first goal from a spot kick after Ishfaq Ahmed brought down Subhas Chakraborty in the 11th minute. He doubled the lead in the 24th minute, driving home a rebound.         
	In Margao, Churchill Brothers thrashed Air India 5-1 to finish second.         
	Okolie Odafe and Felix scored a brace each, while Jaison Valles scored one. For the visitors, ND Opara reduced the margin. Odafe, with 22 goals, once again finished as the highest scorer.

                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI meeting put off
                      
	Mumbai: Amid fast-moving developments in the controversy surrounding the Kochi IPL franchise, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Sunday decided to put off its working committee meeting which was scheduled on April 24.         
	Confirming the postponement, the BCCI sources indicated that the IPL governing council meeting is expected to be convened before the working committee meeting to discuss threadbare all the issues on hand, including the much-talked-about Kochi franchisee bought by a consortium Rendezvous Sports World Limited.         
	According to indications, the IPL governing council meeting will take place only after the conclusion of the 45-day tournament on April 25.         
	The IPL governing council meeting is expected to be a stormy one in which the powers of the high-flying chairman Lalit Modi could be curtailed in the wake of his public spat with union minister Shashi Tharoor over the Kochi franchise ownership.         
	Meanwhile, the Income Tax authorities have issued summons to the BCCI to furnish complete details of all eight original Indian Premier League franchisees, who were successful bidders for the city-based teams in January 2008, on April 23. Day before yesterday they had asked for details only about the two new franchises  their shareholding patterns, addresses, player auction and bidding process etc. Now they want us to furnish all the details about the eight other franchises too, BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said Sunday.         
	Apparently, the Income Tax authorities are investigating the entire structure of the IPL since its inception in 2008. Shetty said IPL chairman Modi or CEO Sundar Raman would be representing the Board during the summons on April 23.

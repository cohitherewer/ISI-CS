The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru misses World T20, again
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru misses World T20, again
  - Murali Vijay to be the replacement; Gambhir is Dhonis deputy       A STAFF REPORTER            Virender Sehwag                                 
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag will miss the ICC World Twenty20 for the second consecutive time with a shoulder injury. Murali Vijay will replace Sehwag in the 15-man West Indies-bound squad. The tournament begins April 30.         
	The Delhi opener had missed the tournament in England last year too. He had travelled with the squad to England after playing the Indian Premier League in South Africa, but strangely didnt play any matches. India were eliminated after failing to win any games in the second round.         
	There was confusion over his availability with no clear communication from the team management over the nature of his injury. The circumstances seem to be following the same path this time around as well.         
	After completing all his engagements with the Delhi DareDevils, he announced his pull out from the World Twenty20 on Tuesday. The BCCI statement did not mention how or when Sehwag sustained the injury.         
	Sehwag has sustained a shoulder injury, and has been advised rest for three-four weeks. He has, therefore, been ruled out of the ICC World T20 2010. The ICCs technical committee has permitted a replacement for him. The all-India senior selection committee has accordingly picked Murali Vijay. Gautam Gambhir will be the vice-captain of the team, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said.         
	Sehwag played in all 14 league matches for the Delhi DareDevils, scoring 356 runs at an average of 25.42, his last appearance being on Sunday. Its assumed that the injury occurred during the DareDevils IPL III campaign.         
	Several questions, however, remain unanswered. Did the IPL take a toll on Sehwags fitness? Was he carrying the injury and aggravated it by playing in the IPL?         
	The BCCI mandarins are possibly too occupied with the recent happenings in the Lalit Modi episode to look into it.         
	Sehwags replacement, Vijay, has been in aggressive form for the Chennai Super Kings, scoring 417 runs in 13 matches, including a century, at an average of 37.90.         
	India, the 2007 champions, open their campaign with a match against qualifiers Afghanistan in St Lucia on May 1 before taking on South Africa, the following day, at the same venue.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Paes absence not a worry:   Organisers
                            
	New Delhi: Leander Paess fans may be disappointed not to see him in action at the Chennai Open as he preferred Brisbane International over Indias only ATP event, but the organisers said they have learnt to live without Indias most celebrated player.         
	The Chennai Open, starting Monday, is now Indias only ATP Tour event and it is the third time in four years that Paes has decided to skip the event. The officials of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA), which organises the event, are not expressing their disappointment openly and are relying on a strong singles field to pull crowds to the courts.         
	Speculations are rife that appearance money could be a factor in Paes giving a miss to the $450,000 doubles event in Chennai.         
	As far as we are concerned, we have learnt to live without Leander. In 2009 he lost in the first round. In 2007 he did not come and did not turn up for 2008 event as well. So we have learnt to live without him, C.B.N Reddy, the TNTA secretary said Saturday.         
	Paes, winner of 10 Grand Slam titles, has said that he wants to play in the Brisbane event to get used to the Australian conditions to give himself a better chance to win the Australian Open mens doubles, the only title missing from his Major tally.(PTI)

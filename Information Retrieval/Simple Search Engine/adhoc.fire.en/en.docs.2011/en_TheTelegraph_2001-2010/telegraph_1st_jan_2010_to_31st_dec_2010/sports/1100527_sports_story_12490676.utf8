The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis turns down PCB offer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Younis turns down PCB offer
                      
	Karachi: Former captain Younis Khan is in no mood to step down from his fight against the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the indefinite ban imposed on him and has turned down a PCB offer to go for a compromise settlement.         
	Sources close to the legal advisors of the Board and Younis said that the PCB had through its legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi floated an offer that if Younis withdraws his appeal and didnt contest the ban, they would remove this and close the chapter by just fining him.         
	But Younis who has left for England has told his lawyer Ahmed Qayyum that he should see that the Boards appeal judge Justice (retd) Irfan Qadir gives a full verdict on the appeal lodged by the former captain against his ban, a source said.         
	Sources also said that Younis was not ready to accept any wrongdoing on his part even if the PCB was indicating he could be back playing for Pakistan soon under the compromise formula.         
	The Board basically wants to close the chapter and has made a settlement offer to Younis Khans lawyer, the source said.         
	The Board on the recommendation of its inquiry committee that looked into the teams poor performance in Australia early this year banned Younis for an indefinite period from playing for Pakistan.

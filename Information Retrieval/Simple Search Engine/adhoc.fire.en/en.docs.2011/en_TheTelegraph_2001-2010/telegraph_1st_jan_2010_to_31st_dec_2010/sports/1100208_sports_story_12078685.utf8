	Lahore: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam Sunday termed Shahid Afridis ball tampering incident as unfortunate and said it was one of the worst days in world cricket.         
	It was a most unfortunate incident and it damaged the image of Pakistan, Intikhab told the media. It was a black day for cricket.         
	However, Alam backed Afridis claim that ball tampering is a universal thing. Ball tampering takes place everywhere and it is done in many countries but the way Afridi did it is not acceptable at all, he said.         
	Meanwhile, an evaluation committee has demanded Alam and captain Mohammad Yousuf explain the teams dismal performance on their tour of Australia. The six-man committee is headed by former captain Wasim Bari, who is the PCBs chief operating officer, and includes another former captain, Wasim Akram.           (PTI)

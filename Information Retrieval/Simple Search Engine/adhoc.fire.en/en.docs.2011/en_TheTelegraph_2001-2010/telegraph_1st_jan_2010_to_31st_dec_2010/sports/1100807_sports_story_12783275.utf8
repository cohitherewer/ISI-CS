The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gay beats Bolt in Stockholm
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gay beats Bolt in Stockholm
                      
	Stockholm: Tyson Gay beat Usain Bolt in the 100 metres at the DN Galan meet in 9.84 seconds on Friday. Bolt was second in 9.97.         
	The American always looked in complete control against the world record-holder Bolt, who was straining to keep up with Gay by the end of the highly anticipated race.         
	A sellout crowd in the Olympic Stadium was silent before the race between the two fastest men of all time. And the tension increased even further after two false starts.         
	The sprinters both looked like they left plenty in reserve when they cruised through the heats, and so it proved when it came to the final.         
	Richard Thompson of Trinidad finished third in 10.10.         
	Asafa Powell of Jamaica pulled out of the race on Wednesday with a back injury, denying fans the chance to see the first race between the worlds three fastest men since Bolt stormed to a world record of 9.58 last August at the World Championships in Berlin.

	Calcutta: India, on Sunday, were fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during their defeat to Sri Lanka in the final of the tri-nation series at Dambulla, an ICC media release said.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni was fined 40 per cent of his match fee while rest of the players were docked 20 per cent of their match fees. Match referee Alan Hurst ruled India to be two overs short of their target at the end of the tri-series final when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side fail to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount. The penalty was accepted without contest.

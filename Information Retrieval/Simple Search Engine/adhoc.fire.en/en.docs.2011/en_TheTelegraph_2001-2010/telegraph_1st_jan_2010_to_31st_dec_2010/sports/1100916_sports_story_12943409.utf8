            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton said he was not perturbed by Indias slide in Fifa rankings.         
	I know India have been reduced to 160, but what can I do? asked the British coach. It happened because we did not play enough matches. We did go up the rankings because of wins in the Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009, but after that we did not play enough matches, Houghton added.         
	The coach said that he was happy that India could beat Namibia, a team ranked much higher than the hosts.         
	We have just beaten a team which is 116 in the Fifa rankings. What do you make of it? Its the system that creates the rankings. I am not too bothered about it, said the coach.         
	About Wednesdays match, Houghton said he was happy with his teams showing.         
	They played with dedication and discipline. My biggest worry is Bhaichungs (Bhutia) injury. We will know about his injury only after the MRI scan.         
	We have improved in passing and fitness. We are a much better organised team now, Houghton said adding that next month India will play Vietnam and Yemen in Pune.

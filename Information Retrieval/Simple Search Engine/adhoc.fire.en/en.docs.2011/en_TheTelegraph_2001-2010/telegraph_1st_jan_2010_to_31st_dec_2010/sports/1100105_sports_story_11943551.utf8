	Chennai: Chennai Open said goodbye to its emotional favourite on the opening night Monday when two-time champion Carlos Moya bowed out of the $450,000 ATP Tour event.         
	Even as the fans lustily cheered Moya on, the former world No.1 failed to reproduce his old form, going down 3-6, 6-7 (2-7) to Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia in a first round clash on Centre Court.         
	It was a sad day for the innumerable Moya fans at the Nungambakkam stadium as the Spaniards attempt to revive his career after a 10-month injury lay-off was foiled by an opponent ranked 38th in the world.         
	Despite the early defeat, Moya, currently ranked 446th, made it clear that he was in no mood to bid adieu to the game. Sixteen years on the road, I still feel like a tennis player and think like a tennis player, he said.         
	Moya would be back on his favourite Chennai surface Thursday for the doubles, alongside Yuki Bhambri. I have never been a doubles specialist but who knows I cant say I am like Yukis father but certainly old enough to be his brother, said the 33-year-old.         
	On Yuki, the Spaniard said: He was the best in junior tennis but this is a different world altogether.         
	Although it was Moya who had all the support in the stands, Tipsarevic nonetheless praised the crowd.         
	I did not receive their support, but I liked the way they behaved during the match. I never expected the crowd to back me, the Serb said. After all, I was pitted against a former world No.1 who has a huge following here.         
	Asked to comment on Moyas game, Tipsarevic said: It is only the start of the season. He needs to adapt a little to match play He just needs some more tournaments to be match fit.         
	After a one-sided first set, which Tipsarevic took by breaking Moya in the sixth game, the contest gained some edge as the second went to the tie-breaker.         
	Earlier, Croatian Marin Cilic started his title defence on a confident note when he made short work of Russian Igor Kunitsyn.         
	Ranked 14th in the world, the tall and athletic Cilic was at his fluent best and needed only 73 minutes to defeat his 104th-ranked rival 6-2, 6-4.         
	I was coming from an off-season break and it was a pretty good match. My ball hitting was good. He didnt have any break points on my serve. That shows I was on top throughout, Cilic said after the match.         
	Later in the evening, Somdev Dev Varman and Sanam Singh advanced to the second round of doubles with a stunning 6-2, 7-5 victory over fourth seeds Rik de Voest and Scott Lipsky.         
	On Tuesday, Swedish world No.8 and top seed Robin Soderling plays American Robby Ginepri in the first round.         
	Soderling comes into the tournament with his confidence high after beating world No.1 Roger Federer for the first time in his 13th attempt, although it came at an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week.         
	If I continue playing the way I have been for the last six months I think I have a good chance here, Soderling said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Azhar: What matters is that we are   No. 1 now
                                                                                                                       7                                        Azhar: What matters is that we are   No. 1 now
            A STAFF REPORTER            Azharuddin in the city on Saturday.   A Telegraph picture                                       
	Calcutta: Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin feels that as long as India are the top-ranked Test nation in the International Cricket Council rankings, there is no need to pay heed to what the likes of Ian Chappell say.         
	We are still No.1, isnt it? So why do we need to think about how long we are going to stay at the top. The boys should enjoy their game and give their best. When the time comes, we can think about it, said Azhar.         
	Azhar, who was in the city to inaugurate a cricket coaching clinic under the aegis Mohammedan Sporting Club, also feels that a good working relationship between skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten has been key to Indias consistent performance during the last couple of seasons.         
	May be the elegant Hyderabadi could relate to the chemistry he shared with Ajit Wadekar during the early and mid 90s when India won a lot of matches at home under his captaincy.         
	They (Dhoni and Kirsten) are working well in tandem, which has really helped the team to do well in all sorts of conditions, he said.         
	He also feels that the advent of the Indian Premier League (IPL) has given a lot of youngsters an opportunity to come into prominence pretty early.         
	Earlier, a player would come into national reckoning only after three to four seasons. Now, with IPL, if a player has talent, he can shoot into limelight in a couple of seasons, stated the man who has had some memorable innings at Eden Gardens.         
	Does he think that quick money in the IPL might induce youngsters to lose motivation? It depends on how you look at it. In our times, we didnt have the IPL, so we had to concentrate on Tests and ODI matches. Now you have another format. But talent is what matters at the end of the day.         
	When asked to comment about the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias choice of Eric Simons as the bowling coach ahead of Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald, he remained non-committal.         
	I dont know whats the criteria of selecting a bowling coach. Lets see how it goes. Its a different proposition when you make big names like Donald or Pollock the bowling coach; like the Kolkata Knight Riders had Wasim Akram as their bowling consultant, he said.         
	On a different note, he expressed solidarity with Abhinav Bindra who had threatened to quit after the National Rifles Association of India omitted his name from the Indian squad for the Commonwealth shooting Championship.         
	Its unfortunate that something like this happened. Someone of Abhinavs stature deserves every help required from the administration. After all, he is our only individual Olympic gold medallist, he concluded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chappell rejects Pak offer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chappell rejects Pak offer
                      
	Melbourne: Former India coach Greg Chappell has turned down an offer to coach Pakistans embattled cricket team, saying he does not intend to coach at the international level anymore.         
	Chappell, who had a tumultuous stint in India before being sacked following the teams disastrous World Cup campaign in 2007, is currently the head coach at Australias Centre of Excellence and chairman of the national youth selection panel.         
	The former Australia captain said he was approached by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to replace the under-fire Intikhab Alam, who is expected to be shown the door after the teams disastrous tour Down Under, during which they were whitewashed in all three formats of the game.         
	Wasim Bari (chief operating officer, PCB) rang me yesterday (Tuesday). I was honoured and flattered by the approach but I have declined the invitation, Chappell told a cricket website. I have no ambition to coach at the international level again and I am committed to my role with CA as head coach at the Centre of Excellence, and chairman of our national youth selection panel.         
	Alam will not travel to Dubai with the Pakistan team for a couple of Twenty20 matches later this month. (PTI)

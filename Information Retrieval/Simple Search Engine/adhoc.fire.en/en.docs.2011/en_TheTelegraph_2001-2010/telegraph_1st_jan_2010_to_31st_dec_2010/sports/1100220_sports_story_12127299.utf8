	Tucson: Indian pro Jeev Milkha Singh continued his dream run in the $8.5 million Accenture Match Play Championship, ousting two-time PGA Tour winner Matt Kuchar to breeze into the third round here.         
	Jeev, who had upstaged three-time Major winner Padraig Harrington in his opening round, tamed Kuchar to set up a third round showdown with Englishman and eight-time European Tour winner Ian Poulter, who edged out Adam Scott 2 and 1.         
	The Indian played immaculate golf with the fifth hole bogey being the lone blot in his otherwise impeccable card.         
	Jeev did not have a great start as Kuchar won the opening hole with a par. But the Indian was soon in his elements and he two-putted from 67 feet to birdie the par-five eighth hole which put him one up and the gap increased with Kuchar dropping a shot on the next.         
	Jeev went three-up after the 13th hole birdie but his American opponent responded with back-to-back birdies on the 14th and 15th holes to inject some fresh drama.         
	Jeevs short game, however, stood him in good stead and Kuchar could not bridge that gap.         
	I ground it out and I think thats what match play is all about. You cannot lose patience and you have to hole those short putts which is what I did, an elated Jeev later said.         
	It was real hard work. I think it was a fantastic match. It started off not too good on the first, but came back pretty good. Matt came back strong and birdied 14, 15, and I made some good up-and-downs on 16 and 17 and the last was an exciting one, said the Indian.         
	The face-off with Poulter would be an opportunity for Jeev to avenge his last years defeat at the Englishmans hand.         
	Second seed Lee Westwood, meanwhile, was among the losers on a day of upsets.         
	Third-seeded American Jim Furyk, Germanys Martin Kaymer (4) and Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy (5) were also eliminated, following the first round defeat of top seed Steve Stricker at Dove Mountain.         
	That left sixth-seeded Briton Paul Casey the highest ranked player through to the final 16.         
	Westwood fell 2 amp;1 against 31st-seeded American Nick Watney, while defending champion Geoff Ogilvy of Australia was bundled out 2 amp;1 by Colombias Camilo Villegas.         
	Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Japans Ryo Ishikawa were among the few big names to advance. Retief Goosen knocked out fellow South African Ernie Els at the 20th hole.         
	I would say (hole) 14 was a turning point, Watney said. He holed a bunker shot out for eagle on the 13th and I was able to birdie the next hole. That really kind of gained my momentum back.         
	Garcia worked hard to beat Dane Anders Hansen 2 amp;1.         
	Its a funny tournament this match play, because some years you come here you feel like youre playing unbelievable and you get beaten in the first and second round, Garcia said.

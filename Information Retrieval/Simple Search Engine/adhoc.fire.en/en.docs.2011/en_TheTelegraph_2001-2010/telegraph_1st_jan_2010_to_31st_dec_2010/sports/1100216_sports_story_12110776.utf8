The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to open sports science centre: Paes
                                                                                                                       7                                        Want to open sports science centre: Paes
            A STAFF REPORTER            Leander Paes at the BTA complex on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Leander Paes has always mentioned time and again how emotional it is to come back to his roots. A die-hard Calcuttan at heart, the 11-time Grand Slam champion is planning to set-up a sports science centre in the city in the near future.         
	I have always felt that I have a duty towards the aspiring talents in the city. I should be in a position to help them in whatever way I can. I am planning to open a chain of sports science centres across the country. However, I want the first one to be opened in Calcutta. I have been in talks with state government and am looking for suitable plot of land, Leander said at a felicitation ceremony at the Bengal Tennis Association on Monday.         
	In presence of Olympians Chuni Goswami and his father Vece Paes, Leander was presented with a cheque of Rs 2.5 lakh.         
	When asked about Indian tennis, Leander felt that Somdev Dev Varman and Yuki Bhambri would be the two players who would keep the Indian flag flying in the Davis Cup and the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour.         
	I am a great supporter of Somdev. He has done exceedingly well in the last couple of years. He has done well in Chennai where he has registered some great victories. Then, its because of him that we are in the World Group. The manner in which he won the reverse singles coming back from being two sets down was fabulous. On the otherhand, Yuki has been a junior World No. 1. Trust me, its not easy being a No.1 in any field. I have spoken to Nick Bollettieri and he had only good things to say about Yuki, Leander said.         
	He admitted that the Davis Cup against Russia would be a very tough match but he and his mates were ready to put their best foot forward. We should try and remain positive and there is no reason why we cant pull off a few upsets, he said.         
	Although Roger Federer has dominated the singles field for the better part of the last seven years, players like Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and now Juan Martin del Potro have also made a considerable mark. Why then mens doubles have been dominated by the same names, such as Bryan brothers, Daniel Nestor, Nenad Zimonjic, Leander, Mahesh Bhupathi and Martin Damm, for the last decade?         
	The Australian Open mixed doubles winner replied: In singles, its difficult to maintain the momentum year after year. That is why Roger Federers achievements are unparalleled in the current era. But in doubles, its more about skill and technique. Its game where you need a lot of strategy. Thats why only a select few pairs dominate doubles.         
	Leander will be off to Dubai and then head for Miami as he starts off with the claycourt season. He will prepare to defend his French Open doubles title he won with Lukas Dlouhy at Roland Garros.

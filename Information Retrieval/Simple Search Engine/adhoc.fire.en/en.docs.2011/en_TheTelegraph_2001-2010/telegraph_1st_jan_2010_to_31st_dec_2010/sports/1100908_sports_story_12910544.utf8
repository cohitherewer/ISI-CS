                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      BTC gets a breather

	Bangalore: The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, ordered to maintain status quo till the completion of hearing on the Bangalore Turf Clubs (BTCs) appeal against the Karnataka high courts order. The high court had fixed September 22 as the date on which BTC had to shut all its activities in the present premises and move out.          
	The Supreme Court partly heard the submissions of the counsels of all parties concerned before putting off the hearing to a future date and ordering status quo in the matter.           
	Earlier, the Supreme Court had posted September 7 for final orders and had asked all concerned to file additional information that they wished to bring to the courts notice. However, the advocate general of Karnataka had not filed his counter to the issues raised by the BTC counsels. Accordingly, the Karnataka government counsel has been given two weeks time to file the affidavit in the court and make his submission. The BTC counsels will also be given that much time to file the counter on submission made by the counsel on behalf of Karnataka government.           
	Since it may take a long time before the same bench constitutes for the next hearing, the legal experts opined that the BTC can heave a sigh of relief for now and start preparations for the winter season. The five-month-plus season is likely to start from the first week of November.          
	Senior counsel Soli Sorabji and K.K. Venugopal made a detailed submission to the court and also gave the chronology of events leading to BTC getting the land from the then Maharaja of Mysore as a grant.           
	The news was a big relief for the local racegoers, as well as BTCs employees  permanent and temporary  who had performed a night-long puja.

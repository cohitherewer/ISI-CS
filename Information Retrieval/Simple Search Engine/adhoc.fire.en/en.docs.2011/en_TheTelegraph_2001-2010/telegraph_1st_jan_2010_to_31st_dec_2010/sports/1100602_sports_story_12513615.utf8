                                                                                                                       7                                        Pujara upbeat at departure
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Pujara in Mumbai, on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Cheteshwar Pujara, captain of the India A team that Tuesday embarked on a 38-day tour of England was confident his side would not get off to a poor start like the second string India seniors team did in their first match against the hosts in the Zimbabwe tri-series.         
	The Suresh Raina-led Indian team went down to lowly Zimbabwe in the tournament opener before bouncing back to beat Sri Lanka in their second outing.         
	Pujara said that such defeats should not be seen in isolation.         
	Anything can happen. They (Rainas side) won the second game, thats cricket, Pujara said hours before the teams departure.         
	The 22-year-old from Rajkot said he did not think it a burden to lead the side who are to play a three-day game (vs Yorkshire), two four-day fixtures (against West Indies A) and a tri-series (with England Lions and West Indies A).         
	I am leading an Indian team for the first time but I have some experience as captain in junior cricket. Its an opportunity not only for me but also for all players. Whoever performs can get a chance to play for India, he said.         
	Its going to be challenging. We are not used to the conditions but thats why we are going. It (the experience) will be helpful when you get into the Indian team, he said.

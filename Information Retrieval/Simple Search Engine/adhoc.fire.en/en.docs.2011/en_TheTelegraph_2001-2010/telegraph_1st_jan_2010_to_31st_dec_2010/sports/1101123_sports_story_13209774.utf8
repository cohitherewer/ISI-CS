The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ready for our first Slam in nine years: Mahesh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ready for our first Slam in nine years: Mahesh
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahesh Bhupathi has confirmed the news of his reunion with Leander Paes during the Australian Open in January next year.         
	So the Indian Express rolls again at the Aussie Open next year. We are ready for our first Slam in nine years, Bhupathi said.         
	It has also been learnt that neither player has committed to the other for whole of 2011 season. As of now, this is an ad hoc arrangement that would last until they find their respective partners.         
	However, it will be interesting to see if they would play in the season opening Chennai Open.         
	The singles entries for the ATP Tour event are to be announced on Thursday, when the organisers might be able to throw some light on the chances of the duo playing at home.         
	Interestingly, neither of them has won the Australian Open.

            [+uc('Peter Dixon   THE TIMES, LONDON')+]            Tiger Woods                           
	Pebble Beach: We are in earthquake country here, but the last time the US Open was played at Pebble Beach it was Tiger Woods who was sending shock waves around the world.         
	This week Woods is back at the scene of his most stunning triumph  described in 2000 as the greatest performance in the history of golf  and hoping to recapture just a little of his previous magic as he attempts to rehabilitate a game that by his own extraordinary standards has gone south.         
	It was almost like old times Tuesday as the world No. 1 held court once more. The questions he faced were almost exclusively based around his golf coming into the week and offered him the chance to attempt the odd self-deprecating joke  So, you think Im fat  and to flash a once-familiar smile. The subsequent response almost bordered on the sycophantic.         
	Woods was asked one question about his private life and the status of his marriage and he simply batted it away with a dismissive, Thats none of your business, before returning to the familiar ground of birdies, bogeys and the conditions on the greens. He certainly talked a good game.         
	As far as my game is concerned, Im very excited about how it has progressed, he said. The more times Ive been able to practise and play, it has started to solidify. Im actually really excited (to be back at Pebble Beach).         
	He returned after five months out of the game at the Masters, where he finished fourth, missed the cut at his next event and withdrew from The Players Championship with a neck injury.         
	But after playing all four rounds at the Memorial tournament, won by Justin Rose, he is convinced he has turned the corner. Is it bluster? We shall soon find out. Major championships, more than any other, are designed to find you out.

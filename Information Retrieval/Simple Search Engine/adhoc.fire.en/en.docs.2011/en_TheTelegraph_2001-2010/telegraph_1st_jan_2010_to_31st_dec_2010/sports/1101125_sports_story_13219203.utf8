	Colombo: Captain Kumar Sangakkara hit his 24th Test century Wednesday and shared 170 runs with Thilan Samaraweera to propel Sri Lanka to 294 for five before rain ended the second days play of the second Test against the West Indies.         
	Samaraweera made 80 including eight boundaries and a six to help rescue Sri Lanka after they were reduced to 34 for three on the opening day.         
	He was out shortly after lunch Wednesday, caught by Shane Shillingford off seamer Dwayne Bravo.         
	Sangakkara was 135 not out in 252 balls with 16 boundaries and a six. Prasanna Jayawardene was alongside him on 12.         
	Angelo Mathews was caught behind to seamer Dwayne Bravo for 25.         
	Rain interrupted play minutes before the scheduled tea break, and the players were unable to come back out for the final session for a second day.         
	Only 90 overs of play has been possible, half of the mandatory minimum overs for two days.         
	West Indies seamer Kemar Roach returned best bowling figures of three for 66 while captain Darren Sammy and Bravo picked up a wicket each.         
	The two sides drew the first of the three-match series in Galle last week.           (AGENCIES)

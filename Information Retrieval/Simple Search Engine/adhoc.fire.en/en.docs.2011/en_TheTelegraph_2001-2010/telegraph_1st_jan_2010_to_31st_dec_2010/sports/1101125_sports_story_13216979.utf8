	London: Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic hit the target for AC Milan yet again, on Tuesday, as the former winners took their place in the last 16 of the Champions League along with an inspired Olympique Marseille.         
	The pair qualified with a game to spare by taking runners-up spots in their groups after Milan won 2-0 at Auxerre and Marseille thrashed Spartak Moscow 3-0 to reach the knockout stages for the first time since they won the trophy in 1993.         
	Arsenals hopes of joining them were put on hold after the North Londoners, needing only a point to qualify, suffered a late collapse and lost 2-0 to Braga in Portugal.         
	Holders Inter Milan can secure a place in the knockout phase at home to Twente Enschede on Wednesday with former champions Manchester United and Barcelona also set to progress.         
	AC Milan had Ibrahimovic to thank once more as they beat Auxerre to go through from Group G, with the in-form Swede opening the scoring with his fourth goal in five group games.         
	The Italian side secured runners-up spot behind rampant Real Madrid, the nine-times European Cup winners who triumphed 4-0 at Ajax Amsterdam thanks to a brace from Cristiano Ronaldo and goals from Karim Benzema and Alvaro Arbeloa.         
	Real finished with nine men after Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos picked up a second booking for time wasting late on. Marseilles win in Moscow assured them of second place in Group F behind Chelsea, now the only team with a 100 percent record in this seasons competition after beating Slovakias MSK Zilina 2-1 with a young-looking side at Stamford Bridge.         
	Spartak had failed to beat French opponents in Moscow in five previous attempts in the Champions League and their hopes of success in the sixth had already faded before they lost Brazilian striker Welliton to a red card in the 64th.         
	While the Russians caved in, Zilina gave Carlo Ancelottis depleted Chelsea side an early scare. The visitors, with just one goal in their previous four group matches and with 15 against, took the lead after 19 minutes through Babatounde Bello and kept the London side waiting until Daniel Sturridge equalised in the 51st. Florent Malouda made it 2-1 four minutes from time.           (REUTERS)

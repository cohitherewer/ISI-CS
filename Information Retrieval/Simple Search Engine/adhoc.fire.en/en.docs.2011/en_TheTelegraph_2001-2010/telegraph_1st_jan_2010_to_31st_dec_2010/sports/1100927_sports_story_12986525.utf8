	Chandigarh: The Australian pace trio of Ben Hilfenhaus (three for 28), Mitchell Johnson (one for 20) and rookie Peter George (two for 15) bowled to a disciplined line and length to reduce Board Presidents XI to 143 for six at stumps, on the second day of their three-day warm-up tie, at the Sector-16 Stadium here on Sunday.         
	The Australians piled up 505, courtesy a brilliant century from Marcus North. North punished all the Board Presidents XI bowlers as he scored 124 in only 128 deliveries before retiring. His innings was studded with 19 boundaries and two sixes.         
	When the home team batsmen came out to bat, the Australian pacers put up a better performance than their Indian counterparts. Suddenly the track that was termed lifeless by Board Presidents XI captain Gautam Gambhir looked like having a lot of pace and bounce.         
	By the 15th over, Board Presidents XI were reduced to 53 for five. Piyush Chawla (64 batting) and wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha (14) somewhat stemmed the rot with a 37-run sixth wicket partnership. Then Chawla along with Sreesanth (6 batting) added 53 runs for the unbroken seventh wicket stand. Chawla hit nine fours and two sixes in his 73-ball knock.         
	Skipper Gambhir would have liked to get some serious batting practice before the first Test but was out scoring only eight when he edged a short ball from Hilfenhaus to wicketkeeper Tim Paine after scoring only eight.         
	Mumbai batsman Ajinkya Rahane was dismissed for nought when he was caught by Shane Watson off Hilfenhaus bowling. Gambhirs Delhi teammate Shikhar Dhawan hit three boundaries in his knock of 17 before he edged a George delivery to Paine behind stumps.         
	Saurashtra youngster Cheteshwar Pujara (9), who has made it to the national squad for the Test series, was cleaned up Johnson as he couldnt handle the pace. Pujaras 42-minute stay at the wicket was sheer struggle as he faced 28-deliveries during this period.         
	Saurabh Tiwary scored 15 before he became Georges second victim, handing Paine his third catch of the innings.         
	Then Wriddhiman and Chawla steadied the ship for some time before Wriddhiman edged one to Paine off Hilfenhaus with the scoreboard reading 90 for six. Then Chawla hit a few lusty blows off spinners Nathan Hauritz and Steven Smith to take the score to 143 for six.         
	Earlier, resuming at 319 for one, Indian bowlers including Sreesanth and Pragyan Ojha bowled well, with skipper Ricky Ponting (42) falling to the left-arm spinner early without any addition to his overnight score.         
	Ponting was beaten by a quicker deliver from Ojha and he tasted success in the same over when he dismissed Pontings deputy, Michael Clarke (44).           (PTI)

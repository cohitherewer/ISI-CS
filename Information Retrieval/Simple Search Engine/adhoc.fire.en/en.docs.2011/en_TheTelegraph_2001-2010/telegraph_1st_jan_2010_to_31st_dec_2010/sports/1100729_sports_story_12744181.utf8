The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mizoram advance
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mizoram advance
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kerala were among the favourites in the 64 th edition of the Santosh Trophy.         
	However, Mizoram did just enough to dampen the occasion for Kerala as they edged past 1-0, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday, to move into the quarter final league.         
	Mizoram were well represented in the stands with a substantial number of supporters turned up to boost their teams chances.         
	But Mizoram, who possess quite a few talented players in their rank, did not really dazzle on the pitch.         
	 They did all the spadework only to squander them at the goalmouth. Very few of the moves were threatening enough to result in a goal.         
	Neither Beingaichho Beikhokhei nor P.C. Lalhlimthara could do enough to reach the business end. Most of the times it was their short heights that became their disadvantage.         
	And it was an individual brilliance, rather than team play, that clinched Mizoram the winner..         
	East Bengal striker Beikhokhei played a nice one-two with Lalhlimthara before cutting in from the right side. He then dodged past two defenders and beat goalkeeper Sarath K. with a well-placed right-footer at the far post.         
	Mizoram play their first quarter final league match against Tamil Nadu on Friday and play Bengal on August 2.

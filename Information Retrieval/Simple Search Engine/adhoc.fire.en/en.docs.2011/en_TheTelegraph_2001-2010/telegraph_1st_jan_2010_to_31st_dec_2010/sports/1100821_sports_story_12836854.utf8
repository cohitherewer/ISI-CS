            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The All India Tennis Association (AITA) has finally decided to pull up its socks and act on the elite players demand that their dues be settled ahead of the Delhi Commonwealth Games in October.         
	The four elite players (Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna, Somdev Dev Varman and Sania Mirza) have expressed their concern regarding the lack of financial assistance from the government for their CWG preparations which sportspersons from other disciplines have received, Anil Khanna, secretary general of AITA, said on Friday.         
	It is true that while the junior players have benefited tremendously from the CWG preparation programme, the elite players have either not received or have received minimal financial assistance.         
	Khanna said there was no question of any player not playing in the CWG. The government has decided to take a practical view as has been suggested by the AITA.

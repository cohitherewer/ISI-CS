The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No decision on IPL IV format 
                                                                                                                       7                                      No decision on IPL IV format 
        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            Ravi Shastri and Sunil Gavaskar arrive for the IPL meeting, in Mumbai, on Friday. (PTI)      
	Mumbai: The IPL governing council, which met here on Friday, failed to resolve the vexed issue of the format for its fourth edition next year.         
	No decision was taken, interim IPL chairman Chirayu Amin told reporters after the council meeting at the Wankhede stadium.         
	The format for the 2011 season of the T20 league has been under review following the addition of two more franchises, Pune and Kochi, to the fold earlier this year.         
	The IPL 3 had scheduled 60 matches, including the semi-finals and final, played over a period of 45 days but with only eight teams in the fray, playing on home and away basis.         
	With 10 teams, the existing format would see the number of matches go up to more than 90. The tournament span likely to expand not more than a week or two, the burn-out factor was a major worry for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Besides, the issue was accentuated by the fact that the tournament would be held in the sweltering heat of April-May-June and immediately after the World Cup.         
	The BCCI had appointed three former India captains, Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, who are also on the council, to interact with the franchises and come back with a recommendation on the new format among other issues.         
	One proposal was to split the 10 teams into two groups and make them play in a league-cum-knockout basis that would bring the matches down to 64. But that has not found favour with the franchises whose main source of revenue is television rights money which is directly proportional to the number of matches.         
	A BCCI source said the format of the tournament wasnt on the agenda at all and Fridays meeting was only concerned with the accounts related issues of the IPL.         
	Pataudi did not attend the meeting due to illness while Arun Jaitley also was absent as he was attending the Parliament in New Delhi.         
	Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel won the Indian cricket teams home series sponsorship rights for all the three formats of the game for the period from September 1 this year to March 31, 2013, for a staggering Rs 3.33 crore per game.         
	Bharti Airtel has won the series sponsorship rights for the period of 2010-2013 with a bid amount of 3.33 crore per Test/ODI/T20 International, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement after a meeting of the BCCI marketing committee here.

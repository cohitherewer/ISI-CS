            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Andrew Dodt in Gurgaon on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Gurgaon: Overnight leader Rahil Gangjee stumbled at the final hurdle to finish disappointing tied 14th in the $2.1 million Avantha Masters at the DLF Golf and Country Club on Sunday.         
	On a day of fluctuating fortunes when the Calcutta pro messed it up by losing four shots over his last five holes to finish at nine-under 279, Andrew Dodt claimed the title by a stroke. The Australian posted a final round of 68 to with a winning total of 14-under.         
	Gangjee, who lost the plot towards the end, was widely expected to end his six-year title drought especially after he emerged the sole leader with a 10th hole birdie.         
	As the home crowd roared in anticipation, Gangjee parred the next three holes to stay in the lead even though he Richard Finch joined him at the top at 13-under.         
	Gangjees, who was having a great run in the tournament with a 51-hole bogey free run from the first day, fumbled in the 14th hole and could never recover.         
	He simply fell apart and went into a tailspin with four bogeys in last five holes, including three-in-a- row on last three.         
	Later, a disappointed Gangjee refused to speak to the media despite requests from the manager and was seen being consoled by another Calcutta-based golfer Arjun Atwal.         
	Among other Indians in fray, Jyoti Randhawa (280) signed off with a modest two-under 70 for the tied 18th place, five shots ahead of 38th placed Arjun Atwal, who went one-over 73. Domestic stalwart Ashok Kumar (287) came tied 52nd after carding 70.         
	I think Ive got to get my driving sorted out after this week, Randhawa said.         
	There was a couple of ifs and buts and I hope to get my mind right. It has been a while since I played really good so this is a good week to build on that. I had a decent finish so Im looking forward to building on it. This has been a great tournament, with great sponsor and great golf course.         
	Its going to be here for another three more years and its good for golf in India. Its a world-class event and what more can I say, said Randhawa.         
	Starting the day with seven men on the top of leaderboard, it was the 24-year-old Dodt who eventually prevailed by breaking out of the pack with a closing birdie on the par-five-18th for his career breakthrough on the Asian Tour.         
	To win a professional golf tournament is absolutely huge. Ive come close a few times and to actually pull it off is a dream come true, said Dodt.

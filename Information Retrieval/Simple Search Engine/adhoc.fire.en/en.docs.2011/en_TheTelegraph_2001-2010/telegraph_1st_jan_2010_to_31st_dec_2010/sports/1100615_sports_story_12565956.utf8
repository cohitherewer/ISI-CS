The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lacklustre Denmark punished
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lacklustre Denmark punished
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: In the end, the Orange fans returned home a satisfied lot from the Soccer City stadium on Monday. The Netherlands did not produce the same form and flair they displayed in the qualifiers but were still good enough to notch up a 2-0 victory over Denmark in their Group E match.         
	Even more than the victory what would have been satisfying for the Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk was the form of Wesley Sneijder, his most important player in the absence of the injured Arjen Robben. Sneijder displayed roaring pace, making inroads through the Denmark defence whenever he had the ball.         
	No wonder Van Marwijk wore a huge smile after the match. A win is always satisfactory, especially when it comes in the first match of the World Cup. Yes, I am very happy with Sneijders form. Once Robben returns from injury, we should be able to go up the ladder in the tournament.         
	The Netherlands have come to the World Cup finals undefeated but are heavily handicapped by the absence of Robben. Still, they are the fourth-ranked team in the world and one of the favourites to top the group which also has Japan and Cameroon.         
	It was a battle of strategy for both coaches in their opening match. That Van Marwijk emerged triumphant was simply due to having more talent in his possession. He asked Rafael van der Vaart to play more on the left wing and it proved to be the decisive factor.         
	Denmark coach Morten Olsen, on the other hand, kept his faith in striker Nicklas Bendtner despite the Arsenal striker facing injury problems. He also included Simon Poulsen and Thomas Enevoldsen in the starting line up but the surprise move didnt produce the necessary results.         
	To say that the Danes failed in their attempt to contain the Dutch would be unfair. In the first half, they were able to close the gaps that the Dutch are famous for exploiting, leading to a goalless first 45 session when Olsens men could create few chances. Daniel Agger, the Danish central defender had a good game and successfully frustrated the Dutch till they went ahead through an own goal early in the second half.         
	However, Robin van Persie almost broke the deadlock in the dying seconds of the first half. A lucky rebound fell to him inside the area and he went past Agger only to slot wide from close.         
	Denmark, however, had the two best chances of the first session. Bendtner was provided a long ball by Dennis Rommedhal but his header was poor and off the mark. Bendtner then set up Thomas Kahlenberg but goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg was alert under the bar.         
	Denmark were definitely unlucky to have conceded the first goal in the 46th minute. Van Persies cross into the area would have surely been cleared by other defenders but the ball found the net when it was headed in by Simon Poulsen off the back of Agger. It was a big blow to the Danes who were looking to snatch a point from the two-time finalists.         
	The lead was widened by striker Dirk Kuyt in the 85th minute when he tapped in a rebound off the post from close range.

	Melbourne: Former Australia Prime Minister John Howard Wednesday hit out at the Afro-Asian members of the International Cricket Council for not disclosing the reason why they rejected his candidature for the ICC vice-presidents post.         
	Those whove indicated they dont support it have not given a reason. Even in private discussions, theyre very reluctant to give a particular reason. Its certainly an unusual situation because I havent been told, nor have the representatives of Cricket Australia been told, why this attitude at this stage should be as it is, he said.         
	My nomination went forward with the full support of both Australia and New Zealand and Im disappointed at the outcome. I wanted to do this job, I felt I could do it well and I would have devoted my full time to it, Howard was quoted as saying.         
	Howard said if his candidature was rejected because of his past link with politics, it would set a bad precedent. Thats not been said although its been widely speculated. If it was in some way based on past political positions, well thats a very bad precedent to be establishing, he said.         
	I wear the criticism as a badge of honour. I dont apologise in any way for the criticism I offered of the Mugabe regime. If it was in some way based on past political positions, well thats a very bad precedent to be establishing for the ICC, he said.         
	Im out of politics. I dont have any political agenda internationally other than of course promoting good relations between Australia and our long-term friends, many of which are cricket-playing nations in both Asia and Africa.

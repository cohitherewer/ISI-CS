The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy with the bowlers show, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Happy with the bowlers show, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted at the news conference, after stumps Saturday, that he would have been happy had India bagged two more wickets on Day I. But, at the same time, he defended his bowlers saying the wicket hadnt been of much support to them.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	The wicket         
	It is on the slower side. There was some turn, especially for (Amit) Mishra. But it was certainly not ripping off the track. It will be important to maintain a disciplined line. However, they batted quite well It was an excellent first day track to bat on. Overall, I would have been happier if we could have taken two more wickets.         
	The decision to play Wriddhiman Saha as a specialist batsman         
	After Rohit (Sharma) got injured, we had to weigh our options for the best possible solution. I think it is better to back a youngster who is 100 per cent fit than risk a 60-70 per cent fit V.V.S. Laxman. Thats why we went for Saha.         
	The spinners performance         
	Both (Jacques) Kallis and (Hashim) Amla play spinners well Our bowlers beat them on quite a few occasions, but were not lucky to get an edge. The pitch is not a square turner, so Im happy with the bowlers performance.         
	Whether India had been a bit defensive         
	Kallis went after Harbhajan (Singh) in a particular over and there wasnt much for the spinners to do. We tried to unsettle them by having fielders in catching positions and tried a few innovations But we just couldnt get through. You do need a semi-defensive approach in such a scenario to stop the boundaries.         
	On the use of the part-timers         
	Virender Sehwag did bowl a few overs today and he may have to bowl a few more tomorrow. Unfortunately, there is no other part-time bowler in the XI. We will see how the first session goes. And, yes, the pressure will be on the bowlers tomorrow.         
	On the approach on Sunday         
	Every session will be crucial tomorrow. The important thing will be to contain them         
	Did you even for once think of handing the wicket-keeping gloves to Wriddhiman Saha to play specialist bat yourself         
	No not really.

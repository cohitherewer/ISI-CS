The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No change in anti-Modi mood in BCCI
                                                                                                                       7                                        No change in anti-Modi mood in BCCI
  - Move afoot for a consensus within Indian Premier Leagues governing council       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Lalit Modi                                 
	Calcutta: The mood within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is to act strongly against Lalit Modi, but the most influential are still burning the midnight oil.         
	Apparently, that has much to do with president Shashank Manohars desire for procedures to be followed and his wish that the Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner be given a chance to explain his position before the governing council.         
	Modis tweeting on Team Kochi, it may be noted, has sparked the biggest controversy in Indian cricket after the match-fixing scandal in the summer of 2000.         
	Look, as of now, everything points to going about this whole thing systematically... All options, including getting Modi to step down, are open, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday evening, the source added: Some have talked about creating the post of a co-chairman, but even if that comes about, it wont go to the BCCI president...         
	That, one learns, is because Manohar cant be a joint No.1 in a sub-committee of the organisation he himself heads.         
	In Niranjan Shah, the IPL already has a vice-chairman, but he has been totally dwarfed by Modi.         
	According to another well-placed source, a consensus is being encouraged within the IPLs governing council. That, on the face of it, can only have everything to do with Modis ouster.         
	The governing council includes politicians from three parties  Rajeev Shukla (Congress), Arun Jaitley (BJP) and Farooq Abdullah (NC)  and, it wont surprise if, for a change, all three actually come together.         
	Two of the three, it seems, want Modi out.         
	Union minister Shashi Tharoors fate, it appears, may have a strong bearing on Modis future as the IPL supremo.         
	Modi had no business going on Twitter, but if Tharoor is sacked or made to resign, then Modi is bound to regain ground within the BCCI Dont forget that he continues to insist that he did no wrong by questioning Kochis shareholding pattern, the second source pointed out.         
	Equally, external pressure on the BCCI could grow, sealing Modis fate altogether.         
	Its not confirmed, but the governing council is expected to meet after the IPL III final on April 25. Before that, of course, is the BCCIs working committee meeting, which is seen as significant.         
	Modi holds a constitutional position and, so, has to be removed either at the BCCIs AGM or at a special emergent meeting.

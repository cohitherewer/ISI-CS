	New Delhi: In a virtual U-turn, Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi said Wednesday that he was not interested in taking part in the Indian Premier League, and said apologies could not compensate for the way the Pak cricketers were humiliated by the snub at the auction.         
	A day after a website had quoted Afridi as saying he was open to play in the Twenty20 event in future, the star cricketer said: Im not at all interested in taking part in the IPL. The issue of Pakistani cricketers should have been sorted out before the auction, Afridi said over phone from Adelaide.         
	I have forgotten what happened in the IPL auction in Mumbai, but everybody in Pakistan is very disappointed and angry. So good luck to Modi and his IPL.         
	Mere apology cant compensate for our humiliation, Afridi said.Afridi added that Shah Rukh Khan and P. Chidambarams statements have proved that Pak cricketers were insulted.         
	The statements of Shah Rukh Khan and Chidambaram have confirmed that the Pakistani cricketers were not treated properly in the auction, he said. I am not talking about myself only, but I think, all were left insulted after the incident (PTI)

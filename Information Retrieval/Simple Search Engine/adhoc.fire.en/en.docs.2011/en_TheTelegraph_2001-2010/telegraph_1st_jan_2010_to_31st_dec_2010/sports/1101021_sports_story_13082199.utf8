	London: Cristiano Ronaldo delivered the knockout blow for Real Madrid in their aristocratic battle with AC Milan on Tuesday, as Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich maintained their own perfect Champions League starts.         
	While Arsenal provided a breathtaking collective display in a 5-1 win over Shakhtar Donetsk, nine-time European champions Real had the individual brilliance of the worlds most expensive player to thank for their 2-0 win at the Bernabeu, as briefly reported in Wednesdays CM edition.         
	Ronaldo poked a free-kick straight through the wall and set up Mesut Oezil to score a heavily deflected second less than a minute later as Real saw off the seven-time winners with a devastating one-two combination.         
	Real and Milan make the record of Bayern Munich, the four-time winners, look relatively modest and there was a lot less style about their 3-2 home win over CFR Cluj in Group E, which saw them come from behind to take the lead with two own-goals before Mario Gomez gave them breathing space.         
	Arsenal, who beat Braga 6-0 in their opening fixture in Group H, rarely struggle for panache at their own stadium and they were altogether too much for Shakhtar in London.         
	Alex Song, Samir Nasri, Cesc Fabregas, Jack Wilshere and Marouane Chamakh picked off the goals, with former Arsenal player Eduardo da Silva getting a late consolation for the visitors and a heartwarming ovation for himself.         
	There was another goalscoring return of a sort as Chelsea won 2-0 at Spartak Moscow in Group F.         
	Yuri Zhirkov, who spent five seasons with Spartaks bitter Moscow rivals CSKA, set Chelsea on their way with his first goal for the club before Nicolas Anelka doubled the lead.         
	Beneath the perfect quartet, Ajax Amsterdam maintained their hopes in Real Madrids group by winning 2-1 at home to Auxerre, a result that took them level with Milan on four points.         
	Goals from Brazilian strikers Lima and Matheus gave Braga their first points with a 2-0 win over Partizan Belgrade that leaves the Serbs bottom of Group H. Basel sprang a surprise in Group E by winning 3-1 away to Roma after two defeats, while Olympique Marseille kept their Group F hopes alive as they laboured to a 1-0 home win against Slovakians Zilina.

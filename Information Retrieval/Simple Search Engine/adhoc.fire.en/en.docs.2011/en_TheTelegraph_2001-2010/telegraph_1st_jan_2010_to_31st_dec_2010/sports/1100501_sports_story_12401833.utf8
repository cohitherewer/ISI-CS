	Rome: Fernando Verdasco extended his impressive form on clay with a gruelling 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-4 win over Novak Djokovic in the Rome Masters quarter finals on Friday.      
	The first set alone lasted nearly 1 1/2 hours and the sixth-seeded Verdasco closed out the match with an ace down the middle after 3 hours, 18 minutes of long baseline rallies under a glaring sun at the Foro Italico.      
	In the doubles, Third seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy moved to the quarter finals after getting a walk-over from Croat Ivan Ljubicic and Michael Llodra of France in the second round. Llodra and Ljubicic opted out of the contest after the Croat suffered a side strain.      
	They will fight it out with the seventh seeded pair of Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Oliver Marach of Austria for a place in the semi-finals.      
	When you face someone who always makes you play one more shot on every point its not easy to play a quick match, Djokovic said. So I knew it was going to be a long match today. The match could have gone either way. It was decided by one or two points.      
	Verdasco has reached the final of his last two events  losing to Rafael Nadal at the Monte Carlo Masters and winning last weeks Barcelona Open. In the semi-finals, Verdasco will face David Ferrer, who cruised past Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 6-1.      
	Roger Federer and Swiss Davis Cup teammate Yves Allegro were eliminated from the doubles tournament by American pair John Isner and Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-4.      
	Djokovic committed 46 unforced errors to Verdascos 40. My backhand wasnt at the level I wanted it to be at today, and I struggled a little with my serve, but Im happy more or less with the way I played, Djokovic said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Hope to do better than Test series: Clarke
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kochi: In the face of sharp criticism after a 0-2 Test series loss against India, stand-in Australian skipper Michael Clarke faces a huge challenge to lift the teams morale in a three-match ODI series, starting here on Sunday.         
	Speaking at a media conference, Clarke dwelled on his poor form in the Test series, and, backed Ricky Ponting as the best candidate to lead the team.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If the team has had adequate preparation         
	I think all the boys are sick of going to the gym. We havent done much to be honest. But we are keen to go out there tomorrow and play the first ODI. Its good for the body to heal with no cricket for the last couple of days, but we are very keen to play tomorrow (Sunday).         
	On Doug Bollingers fitness         
	I am not sure if he (Bollinger) will be fit to play tomorrow. Well have to wait and see. He hasnt bowled since straining his abdomen. So, we just have to wait and see how he pulls up after a bit of bowling.         
	If Australia will field two spinners on Sunday         
	Nathan Hauritzs form has been very good in the last 12 months. He has been a good one-day bowler for a long time. Young Steven Smith is a good all-rounder. I havent been to the ground, so I have to look at the conditions and maybe, who knows, both of them might be playing.         
	Any psychological pressure         
	You always have expectations within yourself to perform as well as you can. And my expectations are definitely to do better than the Test series. But, obviously, one-day cricket is a different format and my recent form in ODIs has been pretty good. I will try and score some runs for Australia and, hopefully, win the first ODI tomorrow.         
	On which team might have an advantage, in case of a truncated game         
	I think the whole series, no matter how many overs we play, will be closely fought.         
	Whether this tour will be of any help before the upcoming Ashes         
	Definitely I think it has helped. Its disappointing that we didnt get the result, but we had the opportunity to play against the No. 1 Test team in the world in very tough conditions.         
	On what the team has learnt specifically from the series         
	The conditions are different than what we are accustomed to in Australia. We have again seen one of the greatest players of all times perform in Sachin Tendulkar. I think Nathan Hauritz has learnt a lot about the difference of bowling in Indian conditions compared to Australia.         
	His reaction to Ian Chappells comments that Clarke has been the biggest disappointment on the tour         
	Thank You, Mr Chappell (laughs). I think my performance throughout the Test series has been very disappointing. So, hopefully, I can score some runs in the ODIs and we can go home winning the one-day series.         
	Views on Ricky Pontings statement that he (Ponting) is the best man to lead Australia at the moment         
	I think Ricky Ponting is certainly the right man to lead Australia. Ricky has been a wonderful player for a long period of time in all forms of the game. I think hes a wonderful captain.

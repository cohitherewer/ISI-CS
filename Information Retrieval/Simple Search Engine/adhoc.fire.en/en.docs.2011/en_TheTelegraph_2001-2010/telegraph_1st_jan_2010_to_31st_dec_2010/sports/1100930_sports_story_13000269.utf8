            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Anil Kumble took fresh guard on Wednesday when he was appointed the chairman of the National Cricket Academy by the BCCI.         
	Kumble is an excellent cricketer. He has the knowledge of the game and is Bangalore-based. So he can look after the academy very well, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said on the decision taken at the annual general meeting.         
	Kumble is part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore and it remains to be seen whether he will continue to play in the IPL, either with Bangalore or any other franchise.         
	Manohar believed that irrespective of what happens in the months to come, Indias highest-wicket taker with 619 Test scalps was the ideal man to head the NCA.         
	The Board has purchased about 50 acres of land in Bangalore where the Board is developing its academy. According to all of us, Kumble is the best choice for that post, he said.         
	He does not work for 365 days for the Bangalore franchise, neither will he work for 365 days for the NCA. We have a director in Sandeep Patil to look after cricket.         
	Besides Patil, Ajay Shirke (vice-chairman), Rakesh Parikh, Sunil Dev, Group Capt. DD Deshpande, T C Mathew and Chirarajna Paul are the other members on the NCA Board.         
	In another development, former captain Dilip Vengsarkar would head the newly-formed Cricket Development Committee. Vengsarkar, of course, is not new to working with the BCCI, having been chairman of senior selection committee from 2006 to 2008.         
	Incidentally, it was during Vengsarkars tenure as chief selector when Kumble was made the India captain.

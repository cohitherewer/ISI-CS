  - Proteas Pacer says effort at nets bore fruit in the match
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Dale Steyn in Nagpur on Monday. (Reuters)                           
	Nagpur: Dale Steyns performance on the third day of the first Test would be any fast bowlers dream in Indian conditions. At the post-match news conference, he credited the coach and their homework as the factors that aided the superlative show.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The secret behind South Africas superb show         
	The post-lunch session, till tea, didnt exactly go our way. During the tea break our coach Corrie van Zyl sat with us asked us to lift our spirits and make things happen. Also, the change of ball helped. The harder ball started to reverse swing. We did get one or two lucky wickets and the rest followed.         
	What did Corrie say         
	He didnt say anything strong He just made us realise that we needed to pull our socks up and work according to the plans. He told us that to win this Test we needed to take wickets and to forget the failure in the session before tea. It was a short motivational speech aimed at lifting our spirits nothing special We always have such interactions. These little speeches do help.         
	If he had spoken to Allan Donald ahead of the India tour         
	To be honest I didnt speak to Allan Donald I didnt speak to anyone. However, theres a nice tradition in our team Information is passed on from those who have the experience. Whether they are in the team or not, you get information and learn a lot. Its up to the players to perform on the field.         
	On reverse swing being a factor         
	I had said before the tour that reverse swing will be key in this series. With pitches in these conditions not assisting the fast bowlers, one has to rely on the movement in the air. And a yorker, at 145kmph, remains a yorker no matter where you bowl  in Johannesburg or in Nagpur. One has to rely on individual skills in these conditions. The ball moves off the seam only till its new. Im happy that things, till now, have gone quite well for us.         
	His preparations         
	It was nice to see that the work at nets bore fruit in the match. We worked on a couple things and that worked.         
	The most prized scalp of the day         
	I think Sachin (Tendulkar) and Murali (Vijay)s wickets in the first innings were the most satisfactory. They were different deliveries  one came in while the other moved out. I set them up for that. The fact that the whole thing was planned makes the dismissals that much sweeter. I didnt mind Sachin driving me for a boundary. If you pitch the ball up you do risk a boundary. But in doing so, he will provide you with a chance to get him. If you get it in the right areas and with some assistance from the wicket, you can do it. Thats a risk I took and got the result.         
	The decision to enforce follow-on         
	It was a collective decision. We discussed whether the bowlers would be able to put in that much effort in the 20-odd overs after a hard days work. Im happy that our decision was right and we picked up a couple of wickets. We achieved our goal.

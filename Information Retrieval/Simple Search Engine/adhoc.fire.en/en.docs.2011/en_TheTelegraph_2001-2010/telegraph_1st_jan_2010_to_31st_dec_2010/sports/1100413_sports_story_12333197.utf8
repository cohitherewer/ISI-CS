The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Family values in focus at Augusta

	Phil Mickelsons victory at the Masters repudiated the hype over Tiger Woodss return after his scandal-induced absence from golf.         
	Woods had cheated on his wife; Mickelson won for his wife, Amy, who has breast cancer and was in the gallery for the first time this season to watch her husband. Moments after a television camera spotted Amy Mickelson beyond the ropes of the 18th green, her husband birdied the 18th hole to win, and his joy turned to tears.         
	A commentator echoed his There it is, a win for the ages declaration for Woods at the 1997 Masters when he said of Mickelson, Thats a win for the family.         
	It sounded scripted yet sounded right. Earlier, the on-course reporter ad-libbed an even better comment when he noted that the pink ribbon Mickelson wore on his cap was for his beautiful wife, Amy, and his beautiful mom, who also received a diagnosis of breast cancer last year.         
	The television network, which covers golf, always has a challenge balancing its coverage of Mickelson and Woods when they are both in contention. Mickelson appeals to a networks heart, Woods to its brains.         
	Before their tee times Sunday, Woods and Mickelson were shown side by side at the practice range; similar treatment was not given to Westwood, who entered the day with a one-stroke lead.         
	This year, the temptation was to focus heavily on Woods. After he confessed to infidelities and became a national joke, his return from rehabilitation was the big story of the tournament. But on Sunday, Woods alternately struggled and charged, finishing at 11 under par.         
	During Woodss early run of three bogeys in five holes, the on-course reporter sounded too much like a fan. Its only the fourth hole, he said. No one can fix himself on the golf course like him. Soon after, he added: He has 14 holes left. Hes six behind.         
	Perhaps the passion the reporter felt for Woods overwhelmed the reality that coming back to play after a self-imposed five-month sabbatical is not a simple task. By the 14th hole, the television network had pretty much given up on Woods. The network showed nearly all the rest of his shots on tape, even his eagle at No. 15.         
	The networks crew questioned several of Mickelsons shots, especially when he seemed to break free of the reins that Nick Faldo, the lead analyst, says he needs, to temper his sometimes reckless side. After Mickelsons incredible recovery shot on the 13th hole, Faldo called it the greatest shot of his life.         
	Yet moments later, Faldo sounded almost aggrieved when Mickelson missed his eagle putt. No way! Faldo said.         
	When Mickelson settled for a birdie on the 15th, one commentator was still not a believer. You can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, he said, as Phil well knows.         
	When all doubt was gone and Mickelson had won his newest green jacket, someone offered a more genuine thought than his initial declaration.         
	Weve seen dedicated efforts before, he said. This will rank up among the best youll ever see.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thierry says goodbye to Les Bleus
                                                                                                                       7                                      Thierry says goodbye to Les Bleus
                      
	New York: Thierry Henry said Thursday he is retiring from the French national team. The 32-year-old forward announced his decision before a news conference to discuss his signing with Major League Soccers New York Red Bulls.         
	Henry said he will not emulate Englands David Beckham and commute between the U.S. and Europe.         
	I always want to be here 100 percent and fully committed to this cause and the organisation, Henry said.         
	Henry had a French record 51 goals in 123 international appearances. He made his debut Oct. 11, 1997, scoring in injury time of a 2-1 win over South Africa. His finale was June 22 against Bafana Bafana, when he was introduced as a 55th minute substitute in a 2-1 defeat that condemned France to a first-round exit from the World Cup. That was my last game, against South Africa, he said.         
	Ironically, it was also my first game in the national team against South Africa.         
	Henry said he had made up his mind to retire before the World Cup.         
	I couldnt announce it before because thats the not type of thing you announce before a World Cup, he said.         
	The French players went on strike and refused to train before their final match of the World Cup after striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home for verbally abusing coach Raymond Domenech, who was replaced after the tournament by Laurent Blanc.         
	We still have a good team, Henry said. Still, Henry doesnt think this years World Cup was the lowest point in his career. The 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea has that distinction.         
	We didnt even score one goal and we were the reigning world champions, he said. And we bounced back, and we went to the final of the World Cup in 2006. Obviously we didnt win it. It still hurts.         
	Domenech didnt start Henry at the tournament, using him twice as a substitute. I will always respect and accept that. It wasnt easy at the time, but I dont regret anything, Henry said. I think for the French team and French football its time to move on and make sure that they can be again successful.         
	By moving to New York, Henry realises he could draw the ire of a large Irish community.         
	Last November, Henry handled the ball twice with his left hand before poking it to William Gallas for an extra-time goal against Ireland in a playoff that put France into the World Cup.         
	After the game, I did apologise and I was saying this to the guys on the pitch, to the Irish guys, Henry said.         
	With the Red Bulls, Henry will go back to playing as a central forward rather than on the left, where he had played with Barcelona. He said he played with a knee injury for much of the first half of last season, making it only fair that he lost playing time to Pedro Rodriguez and Bojan Krkic.         
	He thinks he has a lot to contribute to MLS. Maybe Im not like the 20-year-old who used to run past anybody, but its all about awareness, he said. (Agencies)

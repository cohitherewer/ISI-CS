	Calcutta/Vadodara: India would look to stamp their superiority and clinch the five-match series against New Zealand with a third straight victory in the third one-dayer, in Vadodara, on Saturday.         
	New Zealand, no doubt, will find the going tough against an Indian attack bolstered by the return of pace spearhead Zaheer Khan.         
	A series triumph at the Reliance Stadium will not only be a morale booster for India ahead of the forthcoming tour of South Africa, but will also keep help the team retain the second spot in the ICC rankings behind leaders Australia.         
	That the team finds itself in this happy situation despite the absence of key players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh, is an indication of the teams resilience and bench strength.         
	Skipper Gautam Gambhir and in-form batsman Virat Kohli are certainties in the team, but the absence of the leading lights has allowed a few others like Murali Vijay, Yusuf Pathan and Ravichandran Ashwin to try and perform, and they have done with varied degrees of success.         
	Zaheer is back for Saturdays encounter, which New Zealand must win to keep the series alive, to help him regain rhythm following a spell of rest and recuperation from injury.         
	The Indian batting has clicked in stunning fashion in the first two matches, and the bright aspect for the hosts is that it had achieved success both when setting and chasing targets. The 40-run victory in the Guwahati ODI, riding Kohlis masterly hundred backed up by some good bowling, came after setting a target.         
	The thumping eight-wicket win in Jaipur was after a successful run chase with captain Gambhir providing the major spark with a superb 138 not out and Kohli providing his Delhi colleague with excellent support by striking a half century.         
	These two batsmen and left-hander Yuvraj Singh have been the fulcrum so far.         
	With Suresh Raina rested for the last three ODIs, a window of opportunity has opened up for young Jharkhand batsman Saurabh Tiwary. The youngster would be keen to make most of the chance. Rohit Sharma has been added to the team only for the last two encounters in Bangalore and Chennai.         
	The Indian bowling has so far restricted the New Zealand batting line-up that has been without the explosive Brendon McCullum. The opener is expected to return and the team is eagerly looking forward to the do-or-die match.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan, Saurabh Tiwary, Wriddiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra/Munaf Patel         
	New Zealand (likely): Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, Grant Elliott / James Franklin, Daniel Vettori, Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Andy McKay         
	Umpires: Richard Kettleborough and Shavir Tarapore.         
	Match starts: 9:00 am

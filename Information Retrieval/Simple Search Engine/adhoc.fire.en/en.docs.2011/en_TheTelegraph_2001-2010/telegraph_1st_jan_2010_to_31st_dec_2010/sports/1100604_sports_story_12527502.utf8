	The curious case of Kim  
	Johannesburg: A striker for North Koreas team will not be allowed to be used as an outfield player at the World Cup because he was listed as a goalkeeper on the official 23-member squad list, Fifa said Thursday. Kim Myong Won, who plays as a forward for club team Amrokgang, was listed as a goalkeeper in the final squad submitted to Fifa by North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun. The three players listed as goalkeepers can only play as goalkeepers during the Fifa World Cup and cannot play outfield, Fifa said. Kim Myong Won will not be allowed to play as an outfield player if he has been put on the list as a goalkeeper.  
	Queer pitch  
	Johannesburg: South Africas cricketing cathedral the Wanderers will host Portugals final World Cup warm-up against former colony Mozambique next week. The oval venue in Johannesburg, used to the thud of willow on leather, has been pressed into service as all World Cup venues are closed ahead of next weeks tournament start and other stadiums in the area are unavailable.  
	Mandela motivation  
	Johannesburg: Nelson Mandela met the Bafana Bafana on Thursday, wearing the captains No. 4 shirt, to help inspire the team in the World Cup. Mandela, who turns 92 next month, is increasingly frail and rarely makes public appearances. His stature, however, is widely seen to have helped sway the 2004 vote to award the Cup to the country, and Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Wednesday his presence at the opening match on June 11 would be a highlight of the tournament.

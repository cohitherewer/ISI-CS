	Mumbai: Holders Mumbai earned another shot at the title on the basis of first-innings lead over Delhi after their semi-final match ended in a draw Wednesday.         
	The huge 289-run lead that the 38-time champions took Tuesday was enough to put Mumbai into the five-day final against Karnataka.         
	Karnataka, winners a modest six-times as compared to their more illustrious title rivals, too made the finals by virtue of first-innings lead. The final will begin January 11 in Mysore.         
	This is the 43rd time Mumbai have made the final.         
	The hosts Wednesday were bundled out for 187 in their second essay with Delhi spinners Vikas Mishra (6/49) and Aditya Jain (4/43) accounting for all the wickets.         
	Chasing 477 to win, Delhi scored 160 for four with left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan compiling 40 runs.

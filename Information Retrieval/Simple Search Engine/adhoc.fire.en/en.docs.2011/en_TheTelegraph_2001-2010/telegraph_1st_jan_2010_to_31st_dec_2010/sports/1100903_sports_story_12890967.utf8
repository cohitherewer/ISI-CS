The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran should take charge: Kapil
                                                                                                                       7                                        Imran should take charge: Kapil
  - Anyone found guilty ... should be handed an exemplary punishment         A STAFF REPORTER            Kapil Dev in the city, on Thursday. ATelegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Former India captain Kapil Dev, on Thursday, urged Imran Khan to come forward and save Pakistan cricket from the crisis arising out of the spot-fixing scandal.         
	Whatever has happened is not good for cricket... Therefore I would urge Imran to come forward and take the responsibility of leading Pakistan cricket in the right direction. Imran has got a clean image.         
	At this hour of crisis, it is only Imran who can save Pakistan cricket, Kapil said at the Netaji Indoor Stadium during the inauguration of the Chess for Youth Championship, organised by Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy.         
	Pakistan Test skipper Salman Butt and pacers Mohammad Asif and Mohammed Aamer are facing a Scotland Yard investigation over their alleged involvement in a spot-fixing scandal exposed by a British tabloid sting operation.         
	However, Kapil feels that banning the Pakistan national team is not a solution. Its International Cricket Councils call to decide on the course of action. But I feel it would be too harsh to ban the Pakistan team.         
	At the same time, I do feel that if anyone is found guilty of indulging in any malpractice, he should be handed out an exemplary punishment which will be an example for future generations, the legendary allrounder added.         
	The captain of the 1983-World Cup winning squad also felt it would be unfair to blame the entire cricket community for the wrongdoings of a select few.         
	There are only two to three per cent who are actually involved in these sort of things. And I strongly believe that when 95 to 98 per cent people are honest and positive, a few people cant tarnish the reputation of the game.         
	Kapil also appealed to the youngsters to say no to the menace of betting. Say no to betting. Dont bet on cricket matches.         
	Kapil said that other sports should also be given importance.         
	Cricket is not the only sport in Indian. Lets think about other sporting disciplines also and take them to the level of cricket. Media should come forward and support every sport in the country, he said.

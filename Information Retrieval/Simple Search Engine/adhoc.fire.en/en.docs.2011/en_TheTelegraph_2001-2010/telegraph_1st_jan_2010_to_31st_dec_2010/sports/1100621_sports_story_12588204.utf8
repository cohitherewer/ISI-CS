The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Title goes to Saina
                                                                                                                       7                                      Title goes to Saina
                      
	Singapore: Saina Nehwal put behind a nervy start to clinch the second Super Series title of her career by winning the Singapore Open with a straight-game triumph over qualifier Tzu Ying Tai in the finals here on Sunday.         
	Top seed Saina took just 33 minutes to beat Chinese Taipeis Tai 21-18, 21-15 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium here. The world No. 6, who was the lone Indian left if fray after others crashed out by the semi-final stage, had bagged her maiden Super Series title in June last year when she claimed the top honours at the Indonesian Open.         
	I never expected to reach the finals as there were two good Chinese players in the draw but I believed in myself and got the result I wanted, the jubilant 20-year-old said from Hyderabad.         
	The in-form Saina came here after winning the India Open Grand Prix Gold title only last week.         
	The Indian Open gave me the confidence to play well here, she said           (PTI)

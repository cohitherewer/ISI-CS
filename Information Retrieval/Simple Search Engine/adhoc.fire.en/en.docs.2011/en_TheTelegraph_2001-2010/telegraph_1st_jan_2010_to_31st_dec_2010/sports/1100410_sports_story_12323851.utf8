                                                                                                                       7                                      EB win after 64 days
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals 14-match and 64-day winless streak finally ended on Friday. It was, in fact, a thumping return to winning ways as they thrashed Kalighat MS 6-1 in a CFL Premier division match at the Howrah Stadium.         
	While Sanju Pradhan hit a hat-trick to brighten the red and gold brigades day, teammates Subhas Singh, Budiram Tudu and Malswamkima scored once each. Kalighats Suvankar Das reduced the margin. Budiram gave East Bengal the lead in the 31st minute. Subhankar restored parity in the 42nd minute.         
	In the second half, however, Phillippe de Ridders men ran havoc as they pumped in five past the hapless Kalighat. Sanju, who came in as a replacement for Riston Rodrigues, struck in the 55th and the 62nd minutes, and in the 73rd minute, he converted a penalty to complete his hat-trick.

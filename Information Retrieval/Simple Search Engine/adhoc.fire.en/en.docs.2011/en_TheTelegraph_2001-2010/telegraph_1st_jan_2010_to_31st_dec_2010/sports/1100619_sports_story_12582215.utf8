The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Half-fit Bendtner ready to start
                                                                                                                       7                                      Half-fit Bendtner ready to start
                      
	Johannesburg: Denmark are hampered by injuries ahead of their World Cup match against Cameroon, with strikers Nicklas Bendtner and Jon Dahl Tomasson struggling to be ready.         
	Both teams lost their opening games and will be looking for three points on Saturday to boost hopes of challenging the Netherlands and Japan for a ticket to the second round.         
	Bendtner says he is ready to start against Cameroon, but admits he is not 100 per cent fit after being sidelined for months with a groin injury.         
	Coach Morten Olsen took a gamble when he fielded the Arsenal striker for 60 minutes in Denmarks 2-0 loss to the Netherlands. The Danish Football Association said Bendtner wasnt harmed by playing that match. But hes been training separately from the rest of the players this week at the team camp in Knysna, suggesting he is not in optimal shape.         
	Fit or not, Olsen is likely to rely on Bendtner to spearhead the Danish attack because he doesnt have many alternatives, with Dahl-Tomasson in doubt.         
	Likely Team         
	Denmark (4-5-1): 1-Thomas Sorensen, 4-Daniel Agger, 3-Simon Kjaer, 6-Lars Jacobsen, 15-Simon Poulsen, 2-Christian Poulsen, 10-Martin Jorgensen, 12-Thomas Kahlenberg, 19-Dennis Rommedahl, 20-Thomas Enevoldsen, 11-Nicklas Bendtner         
	Referee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)

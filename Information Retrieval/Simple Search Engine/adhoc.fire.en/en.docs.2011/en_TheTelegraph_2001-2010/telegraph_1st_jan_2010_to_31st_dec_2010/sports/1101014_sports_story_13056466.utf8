  - Decision to promote Pujara was collective, says Team India coach       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Bangalore: Gary Kirsten, Team Indias successful coach, spoke to The Telegraph at the Royal Gardenia, on Wednesday evening.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	First thoughts after the victory at the Chinnaswamy         
	Im delighted... Happy for the boys.         
	Whether this is his most satisfying series win as coach         
	Its at the top with a couple of others... Beating Australia 2-0 in the last Test series, in 2008-09, and defeating New Zealand 1-0 in New Zealand early last year... Id pick three.         
	Mood going into the final day         
	I was confident, for the momentum was with us... Wed already taken seven wickets and Australias lead (at stumps on Tuesday) was under 200... Of course, I knew we had to start the chase well.         
	Defining moment on the last day         
	The (Murali) Vijay and (Cheteshwar) Pujara partnership, for the second wicket... They put on 72 at a quick pace... Later, it helped that two experienced batsmen  Sachin (Tendulkar) and Rahul (Dravid)  were at the wicket.         
	On who suggested that Pujara be promoted to No.3         
	Look, some ideas had been floating around... Anybody is free to make a suggestion, but that must add value to our plans and to our strategy... The move worked but, equally, Pujara couldve got out quickly... The decision was collective.         
	Senior-most pro Sachins stunning performance         
	Sachins amazing... His hunger is still high and its obvious that hes enjoying the game... Hes such a team man... So happy when the team succeeds... I mean, hes been around for 21 years, but was so excited on getting back to the dressing room this afternoon.         
	Lastly, his take on the upcoming ODIs         
	Some of the boys have been rested and, so, it will be a challenging (three-match) series... Players are, in a way, being rotated... Its an opportunity for some of the younger ones to press for World Cup berths. Clearly, its a big chance for them.

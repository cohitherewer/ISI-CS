            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After drawing flak from all and sundry, the organisers of the Commonwealth Games received support from unexpected quarters on Thursday when three Olympic champions said the Delhi Games would be a resounding success.         
	All three athletes  Sebastian Coe, Sir Steve Redgrave and Kelly Holmes  are a part of British Prime Minister David Camerons delegation to India. The trio went around some of the stadiums constructed for the Commonwealth Games and said India could even bid for the Olympics a few years later.         
	Coe said Indians should back the organisers despite the Games battling with numerous pullouts and infrastructural issues.         
	I am sure Delhi would be ready for the Games in time. People should be excited and proud because this is a great opportunity to showcase the country.         
	Some top athletes are not coming but many household names began their careers at Commonwealth Games and I am sure Delhi will be watching stars of tomorrow, said Coe, who also happens to be the chairman of the 2012 London Olympics organising committee.         
	Redgrave, who had bagged five consecutive rowing gold medals in Olympics from 1984 to 2000, said, If India can host the Commonwealth Games successfully, which I am sure they will, then they will also be ready to host the Olympics.         
	Holmes, who bagged two gold medals in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, advised the Indian media to write positive stories as the part of the build-up for Commonwealth Games.         
	Seventy one nations will be participating and 80,000 people will be coming to India. Billions would be watching the Games on television. What message are you delivering to world with negative stories, asked Holmes.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Al-Ittihad players during a practice session, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The heated debate on the eve of East Bengals AFC Cup Group D match against Al-Ittihad of Syria, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday, has been generated less by the excitement surrounding the match and more by the soaring temperature.         
	Phillippe de Ridder, East Bengals Belgian coach, was forthright in expressing his displeasure at the 3pm start. Try playing a 3pm match among yourselves Youll know that good football is not possible in that heat, he told mediapersons at a news conference on Tuesday.         
	But his captain, Syed Rahim Nabi, made an interesting point saying the heat might work to the hosts advantage.         
	Theres certainly a difference between an I-League match and an international match. Were motivated as were representing the country. Heat may be a problem for them, we have to take advantage of that, Nabi said.         
	The truth is, after back-to-back losses in the I-League  against Pune FC and Lajong FC  and the ignominy of playing a part in turning the soccer pitch into a wrestling arena during a CFL match (against Mohammedan Sporting), good football is the need of the hour for the red and gold brigade.         
	Apart from the sultry conditions and the dip in form, the Federation Cup champions have nothing much to worry about as the home team have the luxury of having the full squad, barring Saumik Dey, at their disposal.         
	With Bhaichung Bhutia and Yusif Yakubu available upfront, East Bengal would look for an end to their woes. Similarly, Alvito DCunha, Mehtab Hossain and Abel Hammond, the midfield mainstays, should have enough resource to mobilise the moves.         
	The defence relies heavily on Ghanaian Uga Okpara, whose dominating presence at the heart of the back four has bailed out East Bengal time and again. He is brilliant in defence He has a cool head and plays a crucial role in the co-ordination at the back, said Nabi.         
	If De Ridders wards have been faltering of late, Al-Ittihad have fared no better. The Syrian club have lost their last three league matches back home. Ene Edet Otobong of Cameroon, a striker, is the only foreign recruit for the team. The visitors would like to capitalise on their better physique than the home team.         
	De Ridders philosophy ahead of the clash is simple: Such international matches are good as they give you an indication as to where you stand at the international level.         
	It remains to be seen what turns out to be the taste of the reality check on the morrow  sweet or sour.  
	East Bengal against foreign teams  
	East Bengal have played 155 matches against foreign outfits in various competitions, winning 73 and losing 59. This is their fourth appearance in the AFC Cup.

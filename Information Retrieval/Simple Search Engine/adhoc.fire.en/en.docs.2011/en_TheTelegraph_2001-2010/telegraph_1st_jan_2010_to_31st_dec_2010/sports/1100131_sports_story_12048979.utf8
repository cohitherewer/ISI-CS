The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terry clings to captaincy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Terry clings to captaincy
            Henry Winter                      
	John Terry is clinging to the England armband, but only just. Following the latest unsavoury disclosure about Terrys private life, the Football Association (FA) is split over whether he should continue. The countdown has begun on Terrys time as captain.         
	If Terry is forced to resign, as seems likely, the armband would pass to either Wayne Rooney, the most popular player in the dressing room, or Rio Ferdinand, the present vice-captain. Steven Gerrard is too inhibited an individual to be captain while Frank Lampard, though popular, could find it difficult to succeed his club mate.         
	I like Terry, the one natural leader in the England dressing room, a player so passionately committed to the cause of St George that he willingly endures jabs just to get his stiff back through games, but this really is an embarrassment too far. Its time for him to stand down.         
	Unless he somehow pulls off his greatest ever piece of defending, then it would be little surprise if England were led out by Rooney for their first World Cup game against the US on June 12. He could even be gone by the March friendly with Egypt. This weekend will be a brutal one.

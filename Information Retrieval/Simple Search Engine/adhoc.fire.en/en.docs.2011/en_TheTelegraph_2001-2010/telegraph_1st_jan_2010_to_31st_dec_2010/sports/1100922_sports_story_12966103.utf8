The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Samuels pulls out
                                                                                                                       7                                      Samuels pulls out
                      
	Sydney: Australias world champion discus thrower Dani Samuels, Tuesday, pulled out of the Commonwealth Games, citing health and security concerns.         
	The 22-year-old decided to opt out of the event following a gun attack on two tourists near Jama Masjid in Delhi, on Sunday, and the recent outbreak of dengue fever in the capital.         
	Dani is extremely distressed about it all, Samuels manager Hayden Knowles said.         
	The situation in Delhi has been bothering her for some time. But the events over the weekend made it real. She had prepared her whole season around winning this thing, she even knocked back some Diamond League meets because it affected her training.         
	She called me last night and then met with her coach and she couldnt even bring herself to train because she felt so bad.         
	Her decision to pull out was a shock to us, but in a way it wasnt that much of a shock because we knew something was wrong. She was hiding it and then it all got too much for her. She was in tears, when she told us, the coach added.         
	Samuels became the first Australian to pull out over security fears. (PTI)

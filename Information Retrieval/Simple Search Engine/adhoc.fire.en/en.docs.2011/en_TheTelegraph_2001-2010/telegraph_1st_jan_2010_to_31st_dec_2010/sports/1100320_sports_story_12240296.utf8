The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selectors are cool
                                                                                                                       7                                        Selectors are cool
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Dhoni (above) and Gambhir                             
	Ahmedabad: The national selectors are, as of now, not worried about injuries to key players Mahendra Singh Dhoni (also the India captain) and Gautam Gambhir.         
	Theres no reason to get alarmed about Dhoni... Fortunately, he didnt break his (right) arm... Gambhir has a hamstring injury, which shouldnt keep him out for long, one of the five selectors told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	While Dhoni (captaining the Chennai Super Kings) got hit by the Kolkata Knight Riders Shane Bond, on Tuesday, Gambhir, the Delhi DareDevils captain, injured himself a day later, in the match against the Mumbai Indians.         
	Ashish Nehra, too, has a fitness issue. The selectors, though, arent clear about the nature of his injury.         
	The selectors will begin to worry if one of the big names is ruled out for long  the World T20 squad, after all, has to be picked next Friday.         
	Meanwhile, Saurabh Tiwarys handsome run in the ongoing IPL wont be rewarded in the very near future as the Jharkhand batsman, turning out for the Mumbai Indians, doesnt feature among the 30 India probables.         
	The squad must be chosen from within that pool.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Gerard Pique gets   a piece of history
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Johannesburg: Gerard Pique is a man who can keep trouble at bay quite efficiently, that was for the Arjen Robbens to discover on Sunday. That he can also pose unusual problems in the ecstasy of victory is what the ground staff at Soccer City found out after the match.         
	The Spanish defender had a demand that was difficult to meet. He wanted the piece of the net where Andreas Iniestas shot had slammed in to signal Spains triumph in the World Cup.         
	Please cut me a small piece of the net, I want to preserve it at my home forever, pleaded Pique.         
	When the embarrassed staff told him that wasnt possible, Pique spoke to the higher authorities and finally managed to convince one of them to get him what he wanted. The Barcelona footballer was given the assurance that a piece of the net would be sent him soon.         
	The Spanish dressing room, according to an eyewitness, resembled a dance floor after the team returned with the trophy that was lifted by skipper Iker Casillas.         
	The players put the music system on full blast and started dancing, the eyewitness said. Some of the technical staff were also dragged onto the floor, although coach Vicente del Bosque stayed away from it.         
	Many celebrities turned up at the Spanish dressing room to congratulate the team for their victory but the biggest star to drop in was tennis world No.1 Rafa Nadal.         
	The Spaniard couldnt control his tears when he was allowed to touch the World Cup trophy itself. I was waiting for this day since my childhood, an emotional Nadal told Casillas.         
	Three former World Cup-winning captains  Brazils Cafu, Lothar Matthaeus of Germany and Italys Fabio Cannavaro  congratulated the Spanish squad.         
	Former Cameroon star Roger Milla, too, was there to witness Spain win their maiden World Cup title. The first thing that most of the Soanish squad did once they had returned to the dressing room was call their family back home. The coach, however, remained calm and preferred to go for the official press conference before joining the rest of the team.         
	It was, understandably, deathly silence in the Dutch dressing room. The team remained behind closed doors for a while after the prize distribution, and, then, quickly left for their hotel. Arjen Robben was the first to come out and he got into the team bus without talking to anyone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murithala to miss match
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murithala to miss match
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United would miss their prolific striker Murithala Ali when they take on city rivals Mumbai FC (MFC) in a 12th round I-League football clash, here on Thursday.         
	Murithala is out with two yellow cards to his name as David Booths men, smarting under the 2-1 defeat to Mohun Bagan last week, seek to overcome their first ever loss of the season and regain the top spot in the standings.         
	The tie against Mumbai FC would also bring a mix of emotions to Booth as he had guided the former in their maiden season in the I League last year and two season prior to that.         
	In fact, it is for his role with them that Booth was voted as the Best Coach by the Football Players Association of India (FPAI).

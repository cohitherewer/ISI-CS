The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 18 wickets! A king-size collapse at Kingsmead
                                                                                                                       7                                      18 wickets! A king-size collapse at Kingsmead
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      Blockbuster - India vs SA                      
	Durban: For a while, with India on 56 for four in their second innings, it appeared as if 1996 would be repeated and the drama-filled Test here, at Kingsmead, be over in three days.         
	However, with V.V.S. Laxman and Cheteshwar Pujara playing out the final 76 minutes of Day II, that possibility has all but been consigned to the Indian Ocean which isnt far from the wonderful facility.         
	At the close, on Monday, India were 166 ahead with six wickets intact. Given that South Africa may have the best batting conditions, while chasing, the Test is rather evenly balanced.         
	Should conditions then become overcast for a length of time, it will be advantage India.         
	The sanity of the last 76 minutes was in absolute contrast to the mayhem earlier in the day, when 18 wickets fell. Believe it or not, Laxmans 38 in the first innings remains the highest score.         
	Indias first innings folded up rather quickly, but the revelation came in the next few hours: South Africa, 1-0 up in the three-match series, were bowled out for 131 (inclusive of 15 sundries)!         
	The hosts, in fact, survived for less than 38 overs and their innings lasted no more than 192 minutes.         
	Harbhajan Singh, the most experienced bowler in the line-up, and Zaheer Khan, making a sterling comeback, took four and three wickets, respectively.         
	The visitors were lucky that Jacques Kallis, whose credentials are respected across the sport, was run out as a non-striker. Overall, it was smart bowling and brilliant catching, with Rahul Dravid bringing off a stunner.         
	Even if it wasnt Dravids 200th, the catch is going to be remembered for many seasons to come.         
	For India, there have been few better days overseas in the bowling and fielding departments. The one blemish, of course, being the 12 no-balls.         
	Dont know how 18 wickets fell... Theres nothing wrong with the wicket, you just need to play better cricket... When you get wickets, you dont complain about the wicket, Harbhajan remarked.         
	Theres still a lot of cricket left and if we bat well, then we can have a lead of 300... That will give us a good chance of winning... Batting looked simple when Hashim (Amla, South Africas top-scorer with 33) was there...         
	Tomorrow (Tuesday) is D-Day for us... Hopefully, Laxman and Pujara bat a long time and get big runs... Pujara has shown character and is a gutsy player. Hes got hundreds in domestic cricket and I hope hell get them at this level too, Harbhajan added.         
	As for his and Zaheers bowling, Harbhajan said: I had to be careful with my length... Zaheer plays a major role and also helps the bowlers at the other end get wickets...         
	In a chat with The Telegraph , Harbhajan accepted that hed never imagined India would be batting twice in a day.         
	Asked if there would now be more pressure on him, in South Africas second innings, Harbhajan grinned: Arre, theres always pressure... When has it been less? Hamesha rehta hai...         
	AB de Villiers felt that, ideally, South Africa wouldnt like to chase more than 260.         
	Quite a lot of wickets fell... We batted extremely poorly, with soft dismissals... But they bowled well too... Ideally, wed be happy chasing 240-260, but would go for it even if was over 300...         
	We arent surprised that India have bounced back (after Centurion)... Its expected from the No.1 team... Its going to be a big day, tomorrow, and the side which puts its hand up will carry the day... The Kingsmead wicket is one where youre never really in as theres always something in it for the bowlers, De Villiers maintained.         
	De Villiers didnt forget to compliment Laxman: Were very wary of him... Weve seen him play big knocks under pressure and well have to get our game plan right... Laxman also manages the player at the other end well... He may be the dangerman...         
	While its a chance for Laxman to add a feather in his envy-inviting cap, its an opportunity for Pujara to make a mark so early in his India career.

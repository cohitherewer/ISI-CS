                                                                                                                       7                                        Deal struck to end strike
    - Players promised immediate payment of Rs 1 crore after sponsor releases funds             A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES    
	Calcutta/ Pune: The biggest crisis to have hit Indian hockey stood resolved Wednesday after a compromise deal between Hockey India (HI) and the striking players saw the latter being promised an immediate disbursement of Rs 1 crore.         
	The players will now rejoin the World Cup preparatory camp on Thursday.         
	The Rs 1 crore fund was made possible by sponsor Sahara India, who offered to release the money to help bring about a quick end to the standoff.         
	The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi brokered the deal, which envisages a long-term plan to meet the players financial demands as they agreed to rejoin the camp that was boycotted over the payments dispute.         
	Kalmadi, who flew in Wednesday morning for negotiations, said that a settlement had been reached but did not clearly specify how all the demands would be met.         
	Hockey has been our national game. It can never be a national shame. It will be our national pride. The players all feel that they want to bring up Indian hockey. I assured them full support, Kalmadi told a news conference.         
	Kalmadi, who is also the chairman of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, said the Rs 1 crore given by the sponsor would be disbursed among the players within a week and that all other issues would be settled in due course.         
	The players, who till Tuesday were insisting upon a written assurance from HI that all their demands would be met, decided to withdraw the strike after a verbal assurance from Kalmadi.         
	There was a sense of relief in the hockey fraternity with former players and administrators welcoming the development which will now allow the players to focus on the February 28-March 13 World Cup in Delhi.         
	That the crisis would be resolved Wednesday had become quite apparent in the morning itself when Sahara India decided to release Rs 1 crore exclusively for the striking players.         
	In the genuine interest of the national hockey players, Sahara India has decided to pay immediately Rs 1 crore in suspense account to Hockey India, only for distribution to the players so that they can peacefully and happily practice and play for the country, the sponsor said in a statement.         
	Kalmadi also said that a players welfare development fund would be created and that former India captain Dhanraj Pillay, who played a key role in resolving the crisis, had been put in charge.         
	He also made it clear that no player would be targeted in future for having boycotted the camp.         
	No player will be targeted... I will also tell the next HI president to agree to the players demands, he said.         
	Kalmadi revealed that various state governments like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh had promised financial support for the players with some corporate houses also assuring monetary help.         
	In view of all this we have also decided to form a committee to look into the finances. This committee will be chaired by HI president and will include representatives from the IOA and players like Zafar Iqbal, Ajit Pal Singh, M.P. Ganesh and Pillay, he said.         
	The players, for their part, vowed to do their best at the World Cup. We are relived today. We are happy that everything has been settled and now we can concentrate on our preparations for the World Cup, goalkeeper Adrian DSouza said.         
	Sports minister M.S. Gill, too, welcomed the decision to rejoin camp.         
	The players, too, were present at the news conference and when asked what had happened to their demand for a written assurance, Deepak Thakur said: Kalmadi is present here as the IOA president and we have no reason to disbelieve him.

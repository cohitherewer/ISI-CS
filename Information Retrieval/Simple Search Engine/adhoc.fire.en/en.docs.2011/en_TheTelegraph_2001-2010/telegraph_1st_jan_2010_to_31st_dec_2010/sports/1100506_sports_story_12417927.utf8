The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain helped: Collingwood 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rain helped: Collingwood 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	England captain Paul Collingwood had cause to be grateful for rain as his side advanced to the ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight stage after a no-result to their Group D shoot-out with Ireland on Tuesday night.         
	England could only reach 120 for eight on a difficult pitch, after being put in to bat at the Guyana National Stadium.         
	Collingwood had questioned the Duckworth-Lewis method in its current form as a means to determine rain-affected matches having lost to the West Indies but Irelands reply was halted twice as they reached 14 for one from 3.3 overs and when the 5pm local time cut-off arrived, with five overs of their innings yet to be completed, a no-result was declared.         
	That meant England progressed alongside group winners the West Indies on a superior run rate having hit 191 for five against the hosts, while Ireland had been bowled out by them for 68.         
	I guess the rains come around at a time thats got us through to the next stage, Collingwood said.         
	It didnt help us against the Windies but versus today (Tuesday) I guess its helped us a little bit.         
	Collingwood said he had been satisfied with the target his side had set Ireland.         
	We were pretty confident once we got up to 120. I think it was a 130 wicket and youd have been really happy with that; 140 and youd have been really confident of protecting that score.         
	It could have got quite close. There was certainly a bit of turn out there and it was seaming around as well and a lot different to the wicket we played on the other day.         
	Collingwood also praised Dublin-born England batsman Eoin Morgan who top-scored against his native country with 45 from 37, a day after hitting 55 from 35 against the West Indies.         
	Hes a very versatile player. Hes got the power, he can play all the shots, he added.

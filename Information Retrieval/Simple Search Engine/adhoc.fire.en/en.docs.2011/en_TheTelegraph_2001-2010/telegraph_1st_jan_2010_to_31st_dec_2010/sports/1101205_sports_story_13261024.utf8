            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Trainer Pesi Shroffs filly, Xisca, handed a solid drubbing to her male rivals while winning the Calcutta 2000 Guineas, the star attraction in Saturdays nine-event card. Jockey B. Prakash, who partnered the China Visit daughter to a shade over seven-length victory, had her settled in fourth while Hall Of Glory and Tintoretto made most of the running. Rounding for the home turn, the opposition was no match for Xisca when the filly changed gears and skated away from the field.RESULTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | By the brace of Berbatov 
                                                                                                                       7                                        By the brace of Berbatov 
          
	London: Dimitar Berbatovs double allowed Manchester United to stay unbeaten and keep a tight grip on the Premier League with a convincing 2-0 victory on Sunday over a depleted Sunderland.         
	The Bulgaria striker nodded Wayne Rooneys lofted cross into the net after five minutes and also hit the post during a first-half onslaught.         
	Berbatov took his tally for the season to 13  slightly fortuitously  when a 57th-minute strike deflected off Sunderland defender Anton Ferdinand past goalkeeper Craig Gordon.         
	It was a comfortable performance, United manager Alex Ferguson said. In the first half we were absolutely fantastic and it could have been any score.         
	Still to be beaten in the league after 17 games, United hold a two-point lead  with two games in hand  over crosstown rivals Manchester City, who won 3-1 at Newcastle.         
	We are coming into good form, Ferguson said after a third straight win. We were solid at the back which is a good sign for us.         
	Arsenal are five points behind United in third having played the same number of matches as the leaders, but the north London club host Chelsea on Monday night.         
	Sunderland manager Steve Bruces hopes of beating Ferguson  his former boss at United  at his 16th attempt were stymied by the absence of seven key players, including Danny Welbeck due to the terms of strikers loan agreement with United and suspended captain Lee Cattermole.         
	While Sunderland had lost only once in their last eight matches, the team was ripped apart by a speedy counterattack that saw United race into the lead.         
	Ryan Giggs released Wayne Rooney on the edge of the penalty area, and the England striker chipped the ball to Berbatov at the far post.         
	With Anton Ferdinand, lining up against brother Rio was in the United defence, presenting little resistance, Berbatov squeezed a downward header past Gordon at the far post.         
	From then, the visitors, who have beaten Chelsea and Manchester City already this season, were battered by a United side given the freedom to roam the Old Trafford turf largely unchallenged.         
	Two days after Ferguson said Edwin van der Sar is set to retire at the end of the season, the Dutch goalkeeper had a quiet first half. But he had to remain alert immediately after the break, with Asamoah Gyan volleying over from an acute angle.         
	Twelve minutes into the second half, though, the second goal finally arrived. Anderson slipped the ball through to Berbatov after the Brazil midfielders initial strike had rebounded back to him.         
	From the right of the penalty area, Berbatov casually unleashed a shot that Ferdinand, whose own-goal here last season gifted United a draw, inadvertently diverted the ball into the net.         
	At the St James Park, Carlos Tevez scored twice and set up the other goal in Manchester Citys 3-1 win at Newcastle, six days after he withdrew his transfer request following a fallout with the club.         
	Tevez played in midfielder Gareth Barry to score after only 72 seconds. He was then on the end of a cross by James Milner in the fifth minute to make it 2-0.         
	Andy Carroll pulled a goal back for Newcastle in the 72nd, but Tevez restored the two-goal margin in the 81st.(agencies)

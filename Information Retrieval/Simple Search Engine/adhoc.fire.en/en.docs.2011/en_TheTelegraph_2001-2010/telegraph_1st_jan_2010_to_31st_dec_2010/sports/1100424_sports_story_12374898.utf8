    - Bhaichung bhutia likely to start in CFL encounter           A STAFF REPORTER                                                Mohun Bagan (picture top) coach Biswajit Bhattacharya and players warm up before a practice session, while East Bengal coach (picture bottom) Phillippe de Ridder discusses a point with Bhaichung Bhutia as teammates watch, at their respective club grounds, on Friday, the eve of their CFL Derby clash.

	Calcutta: Another season may have gone haywire for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, but when it comes to the derby clash the stories of failures and drooping shoulders become inconsequential.         
	All the discussion as to why the I-League title has not come to this part of the country in the last six years is put on the backburner. And all the talk of how the Dempos and Mahindras have made rapid strides on the national scene fail to spur a debate.         
	After all, its the derby and the Big Two wont yield an inch without a fight. You may talk about the remains of a derby but actually, the derby remains something very special for both clubs.         
	So, on Saturday, the two are meeting for the first time in 2010  their third encounter of the season  in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium. From the CFL point of view, the stakes for Bagan are much higher as a win will take them closer to retaining the title, the only trophy they have a chance of brining home. Right now they are at the top of the table with 32 points from 12 matches.         
	As for East Bengal, this is the chance for them to give their fans something to cheer about since that surprising Federation Cup triumph.         
	As Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said after Fridays practice session: A Mohun Bagan versus East Bengal match is a match of prestige. Who stands where doesnt matter. Its a different ball game altogether.         
	For those who have a knack for history, Biswajit was the coach when East Bengal, under Phillippe de Ridder, won an I-League derby some four years back.         
	This time they have a better team and they are in form. We are definitely the underdogs, was De Ridders reaction when asked about that I-League match and its connections.         
	De Ridder has a point because Bagan have started showing some urgency over the past 10 days or so.         
	In Edeh Chidi and Jose Ramirez Barreto they have a deadly combination which the East Bengal defence will find difficult to handle.         
	Chidi has been one of the few consistent performers in the Bagan ranks. And, on match-eve, he promised he would score. It might not be possible for the Nigerian to score four goals like he did on October 25 last year but going by his confidence it seemed he would net at least a brace! I have a pocket full of goals, he said laughing.         
	Well thats not good news for a defence that has been leaking goals in every other match.         
	To make matters worse, the young yet dependable Nirmal Chetri has left for home, in Sikkim, as the news of his mothers death reached the town on Friday morning.         
	We also have a couple of doubtful starters. Subhas Singh is nursing an injured ankle while goalkeeper Abhra Mondal is down with fever.         
	Even though De Ridder refused to divulge whether he would give Bhaichung Bhutia a start on Saturday, given the predicament that East Bengal are at this moment, the India captain should be in the starting line-up.         
	He looked fit and fine during the practice session on Friday and there is no reason why the Belgian should go without him.         
	Bhutia was not part of that historic 3-5 loss to Bagan on October 25 last year and came in as a substitute when East Bengal showed Bagan the door in the Federation Cup semi-final.         
	That means that if he starts on Saturday, it will be his first since the much-publicised transfer from Bagan to the red and gold brigade.         
	And knowing his penchant for grabbing the headlines on the big stage, dont get surprised if he walks away with the accolades.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Real test begins in S. Africa
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh, the specialist off-spinner who authored back-to-back hundreds in the recent Test series against New Zealand, spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of India completing a year as the No.1 team in Test cricket.         
	Having turned 30 in July, Harbhajan has been Indias most experienced bowler for the past two years, specifically, after the retirement of Anil Kumble.         
	In 90 Tests, Harbhajan has 378 victims, including a hattrick. In the ODIs, he has 242 wickets (212 appearances).               
	The following are excerpts         
	One year of being the No.1 in Tests...         
	Feels good... When we became No.1, we didnt know till when wed stay there... Having held the position for a year is definitely cause for plenty of happiness.         
	Whether December 6 will remain a special date for him         
	Look, at times I dont remember even some of the birthdays in the family! So, theres a chance that I may forget its significance. This year, at least, I wont.         
	His take on the past 12 months         
	It has been a nice journey, but we havent played (Test cricket) outside the subcontinent...We drew with South Africa at home, last season, and then beat Australia and New Zealand this season... We also drew with Sri Lanka (in Sri Lanka) and, as you know, its a tough team in home conditions.         
	Reasons which have contributed to becoming  and staying No.1         
	Good cricket, thats for sure... Weve been consistent and weve been able to come through very tough situations... Weve shown resilience. Indeed, weve performed like top-bracket teams (in any sport).         
	The biggest challenge         
	Starts from the forthcoming three-Test series in South Africa... Test cricket is never easy, but our real test begins in Centurion (venue of the series-opener, from December 16)... Later, in 2011, well be touring England, then Australia... Theres nothing but very tough Test cricket ahead of us. The crowning glory will be if we win in South Africa, England and in Australia... That, then, is the No.1 challenge... We have the ability, its just a matter of everything falling in place on the field.         
	Upcoming Test series in South Africa         
	Weve never won one there, so theres much to work towards and much to look forward to... The wickets will be a factor.         
	His own expectations         
	Im not putting myself under unnecessary pressure... Ill be looking to contribute in what, hopefully, is going to be a winning cause.         
	State of his left shin         
	Its much better.         
	Finally, on being at home, in Jalandhar, during this short break         
	(Laughs) Bus aaram kar rahan hoon... Theres nothing like home food and Ive been enjoying whatever my mother has been preparing... Im not fussy, but Ive been making one request  that she make meethe chawal... Thats something I love...         
	Note: Harbhajan is scheduled to leave for South Africa with the second batch, on December 8.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Windies chase is cut short
                                                                                                                       7                                      Windies chase is cut short
                      
	Sydney: Ravi Rampaul and Dwayne Smith scythed through the Australian batting, taking, respectively, four and three wickets for the West Indies in the third ODI Friday to bundle out the hosts for 225 runs.         
	But rain literally poured cold water over their hopes for a first win in the five-match series when the skies opened up six balls into the chase with the openers yet to open account and the scoreboard reading six.         
	According to cricinfo, Rampaul and Smith were quick and had it not been for the resistance offered by Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey, who scored 46 and 44, respectively, the Australians would have found crossing the 200 mark difficult.

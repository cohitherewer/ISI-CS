            HURT LOCKER                      
	Battle of Berne         
	Brazil and Hungary, the two best teams in the world at the time, met in the quarter finals of the 1954 World Cup and boy was it a fight to the finish. The Mighty Magyars won 4-2, but the scoreline was overshadowed by the body count with one Hungarian and two Brazilians sent off. Years later the games English referee, Arthur Ellis, commented: I thought it was going to be the greatest game I ever saw. But it turned out to be a disgrace.                         Italy rsquo;s Giorgio Ferrini is removed from   the pitch by the police    
	Santiago skirmish         
	This first-round match between hosts Chile and Italy in 1962 was so high on violence that the law enforcers had to intervene. The police had to step on to the pitch to force Italian Giorgio Ferrini off after he was given his marching orders for a foul on Honorino Landa. Landa retaliated with a punch a few minutes later, but he was not sent off. In the violence that continued, Azzuri Humberto Maschios nose was broken and the two teams engaged in scuffles and spitting with the police intervening three more times. Chile won the match 2-0. Ken Aston, the English referee for the match went on to devise the yellow and red cards.                   Michael Ballack at the receiving end      
	Record beating         
	The co-holder for the World Cup record for the number of bookings, this 02 group stage tie saw the teams end with 10 men each after Carsten Ramelow was sent off for Germany and Cameroon had Patrick Suffo dismissed. The Germans won 2-0 but, at the final whistle, with 16 bookings and two sending-offs, it was a miracle that two teams still stood on the pitch.                   The madness fills the Netherlands rsquo;   John Heitinga with despair      
	Bloody Sunday         
	The Dutch and the Portuguese fought without rest on that bloody Sunday in this round of 16 match that equalled the Cup record for bookings and broke the one for red cards. Not that there was no love lost between the two, which makes the bloodshed all the more surprising. Ex-Barca teammates Deco and Gio Van Bronckhorst were seen chatting on the sidelines after being expelled.

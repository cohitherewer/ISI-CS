The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capello has to prove his worth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Capello has to prove his worth
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Cape Town: Stop all the clocks until 2012, cut off the telephone until the Euros. England can race all the way to Poland/Ukraine and Fabio Capellos credibility will remain tarnished by his disastrous adherence to 4-4-2 at the 2010 World Cup. England can progress deep into the tournament, chipping away at the old Eastern Bloc, and still Capello cannot escape censure for wasting a talent such as Steven Gerrard on the left. Welcome to the age of misgivings.         
	Only by releasing Gerrard into the centre, by giving up on David James, Jamie Carragher and Emile Heskey and by rejuvenating England with young blood like Joe Hart, Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson can Capello revive his reputation. Only by adopting more suitable tactics, notably a 4-2-3-1 system that shields the defence, can Capello regain the trust of the long-suffering England support.         
	Capello needs to improve his understanding of both the English professional and the English language. Hes incredibly lucky to have a second chance.         
	It is impossible to avoid the suspicion that Capello has survived because the Football Association failed to move quickly and call Roy Hodgson, because it is so strapped financially by Wembley that it could not afford the 6million to pay off the Italian, and because the credibility of Club England chairman Sir Dave Richards is tied up in the coach staying.         
	However shallow the reservoir  and Capello is not to blame for the FAs failure to develop sufficient quantity of quality  the Italian still had significant talent to draw on. To the frustration of all out here, and the millions peeking in horror from behind the sofa at home, Gerrard, Rooney, Lampard and Milner were all played out of their club positions and the price was paid against Germany. England made it easy for the Germans, said Diego Maradona, Friday.         
	These are old concerns, widely raised before the squad left for Rustenburg, and particularly highlighted when Mexico and Japan flooded through the gaps in Englands wide-open midfield during the warm-up games.         
	The players deserve criticism for underachieving, for selfishness, for not preparing themselves individually, but it would have helped if the manager had put them in a sensible order. Gerrard behind Rooney for a start.         
	The FA insisted that the decision to keep Capello was taken on footballing grounds alone, not financial, and nobody in the building, not even a football man like Sir Trevor Brooking, would be questioning the Italian on the World Cup.         
	Calls to fast-track foreigners such as Manuel Almunia and Mikel Arteta who qualify under residency rules must be resisted. The FA must look at its role in this sour summer, the seeds of which were sown long ago.         
	Capello must now prove he is the right man to pick up the pieces.

	Bridgetown: Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene played magnificently to score an unbeaten 98 off only 56 deliveries as his team scored a commendable 195 for three against West Indies in a Super Eights match here, on Friday.         
	Jayawardene along with skipper Kumar Sangakkara added 166 runs for the second wicket which paved way for the big total. Sangakkara was also equally impressive 49-ball 68 studded with five fours and three sixes.         
	Jayawardene hit an array of strokes including four huge sixes. His innings also included nine boundaries.         
	Opting to bat on a bouncy pitch, Lankans lost veteran Sanath Jayasuriya (6) who was holed out at short fine leg by Jerome Taylor of Kemar Roachs bowling.           (AGENCIES)

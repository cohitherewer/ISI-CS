	London: Swing bowler Mohammed Asifs spell of three wickets in seven balls tilted day one of the first Test in Pakistans favour as Australia collapsed to 229 for nine at Lords before bad light stopped play Tuesday.         
	Australia were in a promising position at 171 for two just before tea, but lost seven wickets for just 51 runs in 23 overs as Asif (three for 53) and new-ball partner Mohammed Aamer (three for 66) impressed in bowler-friendly, overcast conditions.         
	Simon Katich made a patient 80 but was one of Asifs victims in a crucial spell either side of tea. Michael Clarke (47) was trapped leg before to an in-swinger on the final ball of the second session before Katich and Marcus North (0) fell shortly after.         
	Asifs and Pakistans fortunes turned for the better after he was switched to the Pavilion End from the Nursery End, with Katich and Clarke having put on 120 for the third wicket.         
	Mike Hussey helped stretch Australias total with a gritty unbeaten 39 and Doug Bollinger (0) was the other not out batsman at the close of play.         
	Both teams gave Test debuts to two players.         
	Pakistan selected batsmen Umar Amin and Azhar Ali, while Australia picked leg-spinner Steven Smith and reserve wicketkeeper Tim Paine in the absence of the injured Brad Haddin.         
	The start of the match was delayed by 90 minutes because of a damp outfield. But when play did begin, left-armer Aamer caused opener Shane Watson (4) immediate problems with his ability to swing the ball both ways.                 
	Captain Ricky Ponting saw his disappointing record at Lords continue as he departed for 26 on a ground where he hasnt compiled a half-century in seven innings.         
	The last run of his knock did, though, see him pass West Indies batsman Brian Laras run tally in Tests of 11,953, elevating Ponting to second on the alltime list, behind Indias Sachin Tendulkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani, Sethi in quarters
                                                                                                                       7                                      Advani, Sethi in quarters
                      
	Pune: Defending champion Pankaj Advani and veteran Geet Sethi steamrolled their respective opponents to advance to the quarter finals of the time-format in the IBSF World Billiards Championship, on Wednesday.         
	Eight-time world champion Sethi beat Tao Hoon Jung of Korea 1950-249, as he scored two five-tons and three centuries in compiling the maximum points, during any three-hour match at the world championship.         
	Advani got the better of Aidan Murray of Ireland 1175-598, with a double ton and two centuries, at the PYC Hindu Gymkhana Club.         
	Dhruv Sitwala won one of the biggest match of the Group C, and defeated former world champion Peter Gilchrist of Singapore 1039-942, in a mind game that the Indian managed to keep within his reach.         
	Riding on a triple century break, Sitwala scored breaks of 331, 198, 162 and 146 in his third league match, where he had just 15 visits to the table.         
	Devendra Joshi also lost, but then his opponent was newly-crowned point-format champion Mike Russell, and the outcome was more than expected. The Englishman collated yet another seven-ton break when he produced 753 against Joshi, who was overwhelmed by the onslaught.         
	Ashok Shandilya again lived dangerously before winning against Myanmarese Na Thway Oo 641-613.         
	Meanwhile, Sethi won both his encounters, as the Indian cueists came from behind to edge past the Rest of the World (ROW) 3-2 to lift the Manisha Billiards Challenge Cup.         
	The friendly tie was played in the 100-up format, on the sidelines of the world championship.         
	Indian team comprised Geet, Pankaj Advani, Devendra Joshi and Ashok Shandilya, while ROW team was represented by Mike Russell (England), Peter Gilchrist (Singapore), Praput Chaithanasakun (Thailand) and Kyaw Oo (Myanmar).

	London: Liverpool enjoyed a leisurely 3-0 stroll past a lifeless West Ham United at Anfield on Monday, in what was ideal preparation before their marathon journey to Spain for this weeks Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid.         
	First-half goals by Yossi Benayoun and David Ngog gave the home side the initiative before an own goal on the hour from Hammers keeper Robert Green helped lift Liverpool into sixth place in the Premier League on 59 points.         
	They trail fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who have a game in hand and four matches left to play, by five points.         
	Realistically, though, Liverpools only hope of adding some cheer to a torrid season after early exits in the Champions League and FA Cup lie in Thursdays semi-final, first-leg match in the Spanish capital.         
	The ash spewed from a volcano in Iceland has closed down airspace in Europe for much of the last week and Liverpool must make their way to Madrid by more time-consuming means.         
	West Ham barely registered a shot and allowed Liverpool, particularly captain Steven Gerrard, to dictate the game at leisure.         
	Gerrard created Liverpools opener when his cross was guided goalwards by Benayoun on 19 minutes, the Israeli deflecting the ball home with his chest. (REUTERS)

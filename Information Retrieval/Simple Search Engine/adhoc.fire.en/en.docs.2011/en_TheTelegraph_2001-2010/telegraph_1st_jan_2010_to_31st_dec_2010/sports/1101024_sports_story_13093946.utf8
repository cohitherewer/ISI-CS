The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt: Onus on others   to prove allegation 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Butt: Onus on others   to prove allegation 
                  Salman Butt                           
	Karachi: Pakistans tainted Test captain Salman Butt said on Saturday that the International Cricket Councils provisional suspension on him has cost him a big slice of his career and that the damage could not be repaired even if the suspension is lifted.         
	He also said that he had no intention of withdrawing his appeal against the ICCs provisional suspension.         
	Mohammed Asif, who was also suspended by the ICC, withdrew his appeal, against the suspension, on Friday and clarified on Saturday that he did so because he received the related documents late from the ICC and did not have enough time to prepare his case. Mohammed Aamer is the other player who was suspended by the ICC for spot-fixing allegations.         
	I dont agree with the suspension because even if they remove it, what happens to the days I lost as an international cricketer and captain? Butt questioned.         
	I am innocent and I know I have done nothing wrong. I want to prove myself clear of these spot-fixing allegations. I am confident because the onus is now on those, who accused us of wrongdoing, to prove their allegation, he added.         
	The opening batsman said he was preparing in detail for the hearing later this month with his lawyers and would contest the suspension strongly.         
	After this suspension issue, I am also going to challenge these allegations of spot-fixing, he said.         
	Mohammed Aamers lawyer, too, said that the player would not be withdrawing his appeal. Our challenge is on and we are preparing for the hearings, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) sources confirmed that the ICC had agreed to bear the expenses for the travel and stay of the two players for their hearing in Dubai on a request sent to them by the respective lawyers.         
	The players have taken the plea that since the PCB is not supporting them at all and their fees have also been held up and contracts suspended, it is difficult for them to bear the legal and travelling costs to Dubai, one source said.         
	The PCB has said it would not be helping the players at all and they would have to contest the case themselves.           ( AGENCIES)

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Stephen Fleming in the city, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Tuesdays Kolkata Knight Riders versus Chennai Super Kings IPL clash is being seen by many as a face-off between the captains, Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, too.         
	One Indias most successful in Tests, the other currently at the helm of Team India.         
	Both Sourav and Dhoni are, of course, aggressive in approach and some of the captains could actually learn being positive from them.         
	The Super Kings coach, Stephen Fleming, one of the finest captains of his generation, agreed with the high profile battle within the war bit.         
	Yes, you may see it that way Its something to look forward to Ganguly and Dhoni are strong captains, but much will depend on how their players perform, Fleming told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday evening, Fleming added: Both Ganguly and Dhoni have the statistics on their side I had a number of battles with Ganguly, during the time I was New Zealands captain His getting back the position has definitely changed things for the Knight Riders It seems he wishes to prove something.         
	As for Dhoni, Fleming said: He loves taking on a challenge and likes to lead from the front Hes a good listener Im enjoying working with him In fact, he tests me, too         
	 Asked what would be his message for those new in the captains chair, Fleming replied, smiling: Be a good listener and look to lead from the front Thats important         
	Footnote: It was under Dhonis captaincy that Souravs ODI career ended (in 2007-08). It remains a sore point for the iconic Knight. So

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting woes worry India
                                                                                                                       7                                      Batting woes worry India
                      
	Dambulla: After being thoroughly outplayed by Sri Lanka in their previous game, Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led-India will face a gritty New Zealand in their final league encounter, on Wednesday, in their bid to qualify for the tri-series final.         
	However, the primary concern for the Indian team is the poor form of their top-order batsmen before their do-or-die match against Ross Taylors men.         
	Languishing at the bottom of the points table, India will hope that rain does not play spoilsport as Dhoni and Co. need an outright to progress to Saturdays final against Sri Lanka.         
	Going into the match, Dhoni would be a worried man as his much vaunted top-order line-up has struggled throughout the series. The proof of which was inept batting display against the Lankans, last Sunday, when they were shot out for a meagre 103.         
	Barring Virender Sehwag, all other Indian top-order batsmen have found the going tough on the tricky Dambulla wicket.         
	Dinesh Karthik, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have failed miserably in the earlier matches. To add to it, Dhoni himself has very little to show in the tournament.         
	But Yuvraj Singh showed glimpse of returning to form in the last match before getting a debatable decision. Yuvrajs form may just give Dhoni something to cheer about. The southpaws 38 was the only silver lining in their defeat to Lanka in the last match.         
	On the bowling front, the Indian attack has done a fine job so far, except for the last match where they had very little to defend. Seamers Ashish Nehra and Praveen Kumar have been impressive in the tournament while pace partner Ishant Sharma too is getting back into his groove.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Dinesh Karthik, Rohit Sharma/Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra, Ishant Sharma, Pragyan Ojha         
	New Zealand (from): Ross Taylor, Kyle Mills, Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Gareth Hopkins (wk), Nathan McCullum, Andy McKay, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Peter Ingram, Tim Southee, Scott Styris, Daryl Tuffey, BJ Watling, Kane Williamson.         
	Match starts: 2.30 pm (IST)           (AGENCIES)

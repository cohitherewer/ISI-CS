	London: Star athletes continue to pull out of Commonwealth Games with British diver Peter Waterfield becoming the latest one, citing health concerns. The 29-year-old 10metre platform specialist had won a gold in 2002 Manchester Games and a silver in the last edition in Melbourne.         
	Waterfield said his family comes first to him. I always knew that the living conditions would be basic, but I do not want to put myself at risk in Delhi, he said. (Agencies)

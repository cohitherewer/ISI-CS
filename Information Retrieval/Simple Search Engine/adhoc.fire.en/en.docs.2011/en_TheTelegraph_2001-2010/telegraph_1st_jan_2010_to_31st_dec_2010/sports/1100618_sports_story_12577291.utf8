            JAYDEEP BASU            Carlos Alberto Parreira                           
	Johannesburg: The biggest party in South Africa, that started on June 11, came to a crashing halt at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on Wednesday when the hosts suffered a 0-3 battering at the hands of Uruguay.         
	South Africa fans blew their vuvuzelas long and loud, hoping to bring luck to their team. But now that the home teams chances of progressing appear bleak, they are venting their anger on Bafana Bafanas Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Parreira.         
	Although the coach has defended himself by saying that Swiss referee Massimo Busaccas decision to expel South African goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune was what led to his teams defeat, the locals blame the coach for the disaster.         
	This Brazilian coach was paid two million rands, said an angry fan at Soccer City stadium. See what he has done for the team; why cant we get a local coach. The results couldnt be any worse.         
	With all the 32 finalists having at least played a group match each, it has to be said that the results of the African teams that havent been all that encouraging. Out of the six African teams in the fray, only Ghana have managed a win in their opening match. The problem, as some African soccer fans see it, is that five of the six teams are coached by foreigners. Algerias Rabah Saadane is the only African manager in this World Cup.         
	The feeling on the ground is that since the foreign coaches are mostly unfamiliar with the players, they have actually hampered the chances of the African teams. Cameroon are coached by Frenchman Paul Le Guen. At the helm of Ivory Coast is Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson who took England to two World Cups but never past the quarter finals.         
	Nigeria hired another Swede, Lars Lagerback, who coached his country in the 2006 World Cup but failed to make Sweden qualify this time. Neither Le Guen nor Ghanas Serbian coach Milovan Rajevac has any World Cup coaching experience.         
	A lot of people in Africa still have the mentality that the European knows more, said Thomas Mlambo, a well-known TV presenter, on a local television channel recently.         
	But that may no longer be an universally accepted view after Eriksson admitted that there were lots of talented African coaches who were not getting enough chances on bigger platforms.         
	A lot of African players leave and play in important leagues in Europe, said the Ivory Coast coach. Maybe its more difficult for the coaches to go there. I hope that will change in the future. I think it will.

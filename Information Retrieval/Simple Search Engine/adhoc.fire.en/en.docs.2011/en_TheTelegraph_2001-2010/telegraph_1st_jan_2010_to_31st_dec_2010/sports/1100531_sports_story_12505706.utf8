The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boycott comments spurred on Tamim
                                                                                                                       7                                      Boycott comments spurred on Tamim
                      
	London: Critical comments about the Bangladesh team from former England batsman Geoff Boycott helped spur Tamim Iqbal to a dazzling 103 from 100 balls on the fourth day of the first test at Lords on Sunday.         
	I was watching television last night when I saw him commenting that Bangladesh should not play Test cricket, Tamim stated. I felt very bad and could not sleep until 1 am. It made me determined to do something to show him in the field. They are the senior cricketers whom we respect. We expect them to respect us as well. We are a developing team and we really deserve some support from a person like Mr Boycott.         
	Boycott, now a media commentator, was a controversial figure during an England career from 1964 to 1982 and was dropped for slow scoring after his highest Test score of an unbeaten 246 against India in 1967. Tamim, who followed his team mate Shahadat Hossain on to the Lords Board of Honour, paid tribute to his captain Shakib al Hasan and coach Jamie Siddons for persuading him to play despite an injured left wrist.         
	I thought it would be better for me to have surgery now rather than playing the game but Shakib and Jamie kept inspiring me, he said. (Reuters)

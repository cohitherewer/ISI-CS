	New Delhi: Brazilian striker Edmar Fugueira struck twice to guide Pune Football Club to a fluent 2-0 win over Indian Air Force (IAF) in the Group B Durand Cup quarter final league match at the Ambedkar Stadium, here on Friday.         
	Calcuttas Chirag United are the other team in the three-team group. Only the top team will make the semi-finals.         
	Coached by Derek Pereira, the Pune club have a decent side with midfielders S.Venkatesh, K.Ajayan and Japanese recruit Arata Izumi doing well to control the game. They could not open the scoring before the 42nd minute.         
	Edmar scored the first goal when he intercepted the ball inside the box, stepped past a defender and shot home with a low drive.         
	His other goal came in the second session off a cross from Izumi.         
	Saturdays matches: Sporting Clube de Goa vs JCT (1pm); East Bengal vs Air India (3pm).

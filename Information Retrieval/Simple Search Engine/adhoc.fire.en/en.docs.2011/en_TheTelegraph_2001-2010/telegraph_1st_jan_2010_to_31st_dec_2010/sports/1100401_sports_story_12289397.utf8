The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas coach turns to IPL for strategy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Proteas coach turns to IPL for strategy
                      
	Johannesburg: Newly-appointed South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl is hooked to the Indian Premier League and feels that watching it he can pick up a few winning tricks for his wards ahead of the World Twenty20 in the West Indies.         
	I am watching as many IPL matches as possible, van Zyl told an African weekly magazine.         
	I have also called in the assistance of an outside company to look at our approach in a more scientific way, he added.         
	The company is headed by Gustav Obermeyer, who has previously been involved with both the South African and the Kenyan national sides.         
	They record every game and then create a database on each player to establish exactly how, where and when he makes runs and what sort of delivery we can expect at any stage of the game, Van Zyl said.         
	The idea is not just to recognise our own strengths and weaknesses, but also to know how our opponents will attempt to defeat us.         
	Vaz Zyl is aiming for consistency.         
	For me, one of the biggest goals for the team will be consistency, he said.         
	We spoke about it and its the one thing we must improve if the team is going to get to number one. Our consistency obviously needs to pick up and it is a concern.         
	He said the ability to handle pressure was one the most important factors in ensuring consistency.         
	The players have to make sure that when they are under pressure, they win the big moments, van Zyl said.           (PTI)

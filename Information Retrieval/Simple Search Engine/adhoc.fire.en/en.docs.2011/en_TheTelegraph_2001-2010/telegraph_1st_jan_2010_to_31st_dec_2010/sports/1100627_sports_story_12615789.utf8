            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Manohar                      
	Calcutta: Thursdays meeting between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials and the owners/nominees of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises may end up being a one-off exercise.         
	We arent obliged to have such meetings with the owners or their representatives, but it was called by the president (Shashank Manohar) in the interest of harmonious relations. However, if an attempt is made to aggressively influence the decision-making, then its quite likely that we wont sit across the table with them, a top BCCI official told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday morning, the official added: We believe that Lalit Modi (suspended chairman and commissioner of the IPL) is behind the move to appoint Vijay Mallya as the spokesman for eight of the franchises. Thats fine with us, but Mallya should not cross the line...         
	The IPL III finalists, Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians, havent joined the union.         
	Apparently, Manohar, whod called the meeting in Mumbai, intervened as soon as Mallya (owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore) used the word unacceptable while voicing misgivings on the player-retention issue.         
	The official said: Manohar made it clear that the IPL was the BCCIs property and crickets custodian in the country would alone determine how the T20 tournament is going to be run. Basically, that unacceptable didnt really matter, unless there were good grounds to call for a review.         
	Indeed, that the Mallyas must now learn to deal with Manohar (and Chirayu Amin, the IPLs interim chairman) was conveyed in no uncertain terms.         
	Mallya has, of course, gone on record to say that the IPL shouldnt be run like the Ranji Trophy and that the glamour quotient must be retained.         
	The BCCI has no issues with the glamour bit  after all, the Shah Rukh Khans and Priety Zintas are involved  but the post-match parties are definitely on the way out.         
	They cant, as of now, be packaged with what will be on offer on the field.

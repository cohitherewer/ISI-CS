                                                                                                                       7                                      Nadal out of Paris event
                      
	Paris: Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from next weeks Paris Masters due to a minor case of tendinitis in his left shoulder, the world No. 1 said on Friday.         
	The Spaniard, who has had serious problems with tendinitis in his knees over the past few years, said he sustained the injury practising his serve at home in Mallorca this week and needed to rest for six to seven days.         
	It is nothing to be worried about but the doctor told me I have to spend those days doing intensive treatment and functional rehabilitation with physiotherapy, the 24-year-old said in a statement.         
	Im very sorry for the tournament organisers, whove always treated me in a very special way, and especially sorry for all my fans in France and in Paris that I wont be able to be with them in one of my favourite cities in the world, he added.         
	Nadal, the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open champion, reached the semi-finals of the Paris event last year. However, he was booed when he pulled out injured during his quarter-final match in 2008.         
	Nadal said he would be in Paris on Monday to work with the media and meet some of his fans. He is due to play in the season-ending World Tour finals in London later this month.         
	Nadal has had an unprecedented year in which hes won three of the four majors in the year including a maiden US Open title thereby completing his career Grand Slam.         
	However, his style of play means that injuries and fatigue especially during the latter half of the season are never too far away. After his victory at the US Open, Nadal admitted to being tired and had taken a month off before returning to play a few tournaments in Asia.         
	In two of those three tournaments, he failed to reach the final and there were indications that Nadal was not 100% match fit.         
	His decision not to play at Paris notwithstanding, Nadal will look to participate at the World Tour Finals at London where hell be looking to win the year-end championships for the first time in his career.

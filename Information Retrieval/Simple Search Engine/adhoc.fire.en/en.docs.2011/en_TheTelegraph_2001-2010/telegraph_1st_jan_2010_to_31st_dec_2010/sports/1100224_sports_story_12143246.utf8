	Melbourne: Tired of battling one injury breakdown after another, Australian pacer Brett Lee is all set to announce his Test retirement Wednesday after being persuaded to do so by good friend Andrew Flintoff.         
	According to a report in an Australian daily, the 33-year-old Lee discussed the matter with Flintoff and the English all-rounder convinced him to give up the five-day format for a longer stint in one-dayers and Twenty20s.         
	A discussion with Andrew Flintoff has persuaded Brett Lee to retire from Test cricket, effective immediately. The Australian fast bowler will announce this week his decision not to attempt a comeback from another serious injury, the newspaper reported.

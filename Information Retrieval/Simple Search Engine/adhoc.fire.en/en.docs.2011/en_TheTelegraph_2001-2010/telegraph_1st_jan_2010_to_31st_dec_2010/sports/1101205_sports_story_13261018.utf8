                                                                                                                       7                                        Tolgay heads in full points
            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Tolgay Ozebe vies for the ball with ONGCs C. S. Saleel as Tapan Maity looks on, at the Salt Lake Stadium. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: East Bengals sprint early in the season might just turn out to be their bane in the marathon I-League. Having dazzled in the first part of the season, the red and gold brigades I-League opener against ONGC, at the Salt Lake Stadium bore definite signs of fatigue.         
	East Bengal did collect full points on Saturday as Tolgay Ozebes late goal gave them a 1-0 victory, but their display lacked the sheen, which made them almost unstoppable in the CFL and earned them the Federation Cup title.         
	Coming off a 1-3 defeat at the hands of Dempo in the Super Cup clash, one would have anticipated a cautious approach on East Bengals part against an unknown entity like ONGC. But coach Trevor Morgans decision to use Mehtab Hussain as a defensive midfielder was a bit baffling as that robbed the home teams midfield of its cohesiveness and aggression.         
	The onus of creating the penetrative moves thus fell entirely on Penn Orji. But precision and guile deserted the Nigerian and with the flanks falling silent, East Bengal were at a loss of plans. When missed passes rule a major part of the regulation time, all is not well with the team.         
	However, East Bengal did manage to create quite a few chances. In the 15 th minute, Saumik Deys low cross from the left-edge of the box found no takers. With no defenders in the vicinity, all that Tolgay and Robin Singh managed were shooting in the air.         
	Two minutes later, Tolgay played a clever one-two with Robin and caught the ONGC defenders unaware with a splendid run. But instead of a timely release of the ball which could have found Robin with only the keeper to beat, Tolgay delayed, long enough for the referee to adjudge it off-side.         
	Morgans team had to wait till the 84th minute to find the goal. Tolgay met a Naoba Singh cross from the right and the Australian strikers header struck the horizontal before going in.         
	Robin could have made it 2-0 in the dying minutes but shot wide with almost an empty net at his mercy. The big match hero was terribly off-colour.         
	ONGC didnt play badly either but the lack of individual brilliance let them down in crunch situations.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The BCCI on Wednesday decided to revoke the expulsion of its former president Jagmohan Dalmiya and also withdraw a civil suit filed against him in the Bombay High Court alleging financial malpractice.         
	Board president Shashank Manohar, speaking after the Annual General Meeting (AGM), explained the reasons behind the decision.         
	[Late Wednesday Lalit Modi tweeted: Congratulations to Mr Dalmiya for finally getting Bcci to withdraw their case.]               
	Following are excerpts         
	On the BCCIs decisions related to Dalmiya         
	The Board has decided to withdraw the civil suit filed against Mr. Dalmiya. And following an application by Dalmiya, the house decided to revoke the expulsion (slapped on the CAB president on December 16, 2006).         
	The reasons for dropping the charges against Dalmiya         
	We have not dropped any charges against him. Thats a state case (filed by the Economic Offence Wing, in March 2008 for allegedly embezzling funds from the 1996 World Cup account). We have only withdrawn the civil suit, which arose because of an entry in the record books. The matter is going on for the last three years and the Board is spending money, time and energy for that litigation. So, we sought opinions from two legal experts, retired Supreme Court judge Manoj Mukherjee and former attorney general Soli Sorabjee, and both of them opined that there is very little chance of the Board succeeding. Therefore, we decided to withdraw the suit.         
	The reasons for revoking his expulsion         
	Dalmiya filed an application to the Board for revocation of his expulsion. There is a provision under the Board constitution under clause 32 (6), that a person who has been expelled has the right to make an application for re-entry after three years. As it is Dalmiya has got an order (from the Calcutta high court) staying his expulsion.         
	If the BCCIs case against Dalmiya was wrong         
	I always said that the Board has no grievance against individuals, we dont have a ego problem. And when Dalmiya is sitting (in Board meetings) for three years, there is no point that we continue with his expulsion merely on paper. Therefore, we withdrew the expulsion.

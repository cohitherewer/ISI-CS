                  Murali Vijay in Chennai, on Wednesday                     
	Chennai: Murali Vijay struck a blistering 78 and Suresh Raina chipped in with a crucial unbeaten 44 as the Chennai Super Kings beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore by five wickets to keep alive their semi-final hopes in the Indian Premier League here Wednesday.         
	Opting to bat, the RCB rode on a 49-ball 52 from South African Jacques Kallis to post a competitive 161 for four, but the hosts overhauled the target with one over to spare at the floodlit M. A. Chidambaram Stadium.         
	Opener Vijay, who studded his innings with six sixes and four fours, gave Chennai the required momentum in the beginning, while Raina completed the task with an unbeaten 35-ball 44, which he made with the help of four fours and a six.         
	Chasing the 162-run target, Chennai were off to a good start with the openers Vijay and Matthew Hayden raising 61 before a Anil Kumble googly trapped the Australian in the seventh over.         
	Hayden could contribute only 12 before the hosts suffered their first loss, but it was Vijay who attacked the RCB bowlers from the very beginning leaving them clueless. Kevin Pietersen claimed Vijay just after the strategic break in the 11th over, but by then the right-hander had set the tone for his team.         
	Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (14) started well but failed to make it big and fell to South African speedster Dale Steyn.

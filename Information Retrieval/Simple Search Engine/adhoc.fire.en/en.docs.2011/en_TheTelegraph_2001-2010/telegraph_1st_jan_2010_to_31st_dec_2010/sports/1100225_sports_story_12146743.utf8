	Melbourne: Ricky Ponting ended up having a showdown with the likes of Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist as Australias current and former cricketers were split wide open on whether to participate in the Indian Premier League, during a security briefing by their players body.         
	According to a report in an Australian daily, Ponting and other Cricket Australia contracted cricketers are not too convinced about the security arrangements for the IPL but those who have retired are keen to go to India.         
	There is a split among the freelance former Test cricketers who want to attend and CA-contracted players who want everybody to work as one on the issue, a report in the newspaper said.           (PTI)

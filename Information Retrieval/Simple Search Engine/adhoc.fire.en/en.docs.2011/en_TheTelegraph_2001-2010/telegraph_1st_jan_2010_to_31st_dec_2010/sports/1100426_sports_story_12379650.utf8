The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United need to go for Jose
                                                                                                                       7                                      United need to go for Jose
            Patrick Barclay                      
	If Manchester United want Jose Mourinho, they had better make their move, or risk a loss to Real Madrid which is potentially even more significant than Cristiano Ronaldos move from Old Trafford to the Bernabeu last summer.         
	We cannot be sure that United do want Mourinho to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson, whose pledge to quit before his 70th birthday  in other words, at the end of next season  may yet prove accurate despite his denials on Friday.         
	But the Special One would be on any shortlist that David Gill, the clubs chief executive, might doodle.         
	How could it be otherwise? The scale of United leads them, like Real, to aspire to the best candidate for any position and the role of manager has become such an important one in Mourinhos time that he, the worlds most highly paid, gets as much from Inter Milan as Lionel Messi from Barcelona.         
	Having arrived in England as a European champion  with Porto in 2004  and beaten Ferguson to consecutive English titles, he maintains a habit of getting to where United want to be.         
	And Mourinho fancies the job. That is why he shakes his head at Manchester City, for all their resources. And he gets on extremely well with Ferguson, who is expected to stay at Old Trafford in a capacity generally described, with no sense of irony, as ambassadorial.         
	Were we to imagine Gills doodle in terms of boxes, all except two would be ticked. There are twin obligations on anyone who seeks to follow Sir Matt Busby, the founder of the modern United, and Ferguson has fulfilled them quite magnificently. One is to provide attacking football with flair and the other is to develop youth; Busbys Babes were poised to challenge the dominance of the great Real of the late 1950s when their plane crashed in Munich.         
	Many United supporters believe  and Gill is understood to share their reservations  that Mourinho is too much of a pragmatist to be anything other than a visiting bane at Old Trafford.Yet you might think why Real, whose artistry has been appreciated more than once by generous Manchester audiences, should covet Mourinho, but Real have spent a lot of money on players, Ronaldo included, and appear no longer to see Manuel Pellegrini as the man to make a winning machine of them.         
	As for youth development, Mourinho, indeed, has done little of that since his days as a schoolteacher in Setubal and lower-league coach. But when I spoke to him at Inters training ground six months ago he made an interesting point in this context, emphasising that he aspired to a return to England largely because the next phase of his career would be about the long term, about staying at a club for perhaps a decade  only in England can you do this  and building something.

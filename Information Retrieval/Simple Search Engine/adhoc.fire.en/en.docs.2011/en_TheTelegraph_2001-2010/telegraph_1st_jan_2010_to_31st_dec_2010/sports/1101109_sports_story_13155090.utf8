The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Missing Haider is in London
                                                                                                                       7                                        Missing Haider is in London
            OUR BUREAU AGENCIES            Zulqarnain Haider in London, on Monday. (AP)                           
	Calcutta/London: Zulqarnain Haider arrived in London, fleeing Pakistans team hotel in Dubai Monday morning, after being threatened through text messages.         
	Haider flew into Heathrow after he failed to show up for Pakistans final one-day International against South Africa.         
	Pakistan had won the fourth match of the series with a ball to spare on Friday, with Haider making 19 not out and hitting the winning runs.         
	Reports suggested he had received threatening messages after playing his part in that victory, with his brother Raza Haider saying: I spoke to Zulqarnain after the fourth ODI and he told me he had received some kind of threats after that game, but he gave no details.         
	A cryptic message on Haiders Facebook page Monday morning read: leaving Pakistan cricket because (he) got (a) bad message from one man to lose the last game.         
	The suggestion that Haider was got at by match-fixers follows a summer of scandals for Pakistan cricket.         
	Test captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer are all currently suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) following the News Of The Worlds August investigation into deliberate no balls.         
	Haiders absence was initially shrouded in mystery, with details slowly emerging before and during the South Africa innings, before the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) eventually issued the following statement:         
	This morning Pakistan wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider left the team hotel without informing any member of the Pakistan team management.         
	Zulqarnain was in possession of his passport at the time he left the hotel which he had taken from Pakistan team management the previous evening for personal use.         
	The PCB has informed Dubai police of the incident and has also brought it to the notice of ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit. All other concerned authorities were also taken into the loop.         
	The information shared with PCB by local authorities indicates that Haider has left the UAE for the United Kingdom.         
	PCB continues to monitor this situation and is in regular contact with concerned authorities in this regard.         
	A full inquiry will be held into the circumstances surrounding this incident and no further comments will be made until the facts are known.         
	Security has been provided to Haiders family in Lahore, with senior superintendent of police Rana Faisal confirming, we have deployed a dozen police officials at Haiders residence, so that they can be guarded properly if there is any threat.         
	Haiders other brother, Aqeel, told Geo TV that he had not had any contact with the player on Monday and was praying for him.         
	I spoke to him last night (Sunday), but he did not say anything about threats, he said.         
	I have not received any SMS or telephone call from him. He has not contacted with any of the family member as yet. We tried to contact him in the hotel too, but didnt succeed.         
	Umar Akmal was pressed into service as a makeshift wicketkeeper in Haiders absence .         
	Pakistan team manager Intikhab Alam said: I cant make much comment on this, but I can only confirm that Haider did not come with the team to the ground and we are looking for him, Alam told reporters.         
	On Sunday, Alam said that Haider and two other players had been fined for breaking curfew during the teams series against South Africa.         
	Alam said opener Shahzaib Hasan, spinner Abdul Rehman and Haider were fined 500 dirhams ($136) for staying out late in Abu Dhabi, where the series began last month.         
	Alam had also said Sunday that all three would be available to play Monday.         
	The ICC, however, has said that it was aware of Haiders disappearance.         
	Geo television in Pakistan reported that it received a text message from Haider in which he said he was leaving for England and that his family would be provided with security in Pakistan.         
	Meanwhile, Haiders abrupt decision to leave the team hotel in Dubai without informing anyone hours before final ODI, against South Africa, could have an adverse effect on his international cricket career.         
	His actions fall under the code of conduct and he will face an inquiry on return, said PCBs legal advisor, Tafazzul Rizvi.         
	Rizvi, however, felt that something was wrong somewhere that led to the wicketkeeper leaving the team hotel suddenly.         
	Zulqarnains actions are totally surprising and strange, Rizvi said.

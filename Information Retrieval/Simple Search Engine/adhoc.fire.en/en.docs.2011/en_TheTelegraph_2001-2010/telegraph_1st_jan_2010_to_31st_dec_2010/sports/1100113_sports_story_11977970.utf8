The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wankhede in legal wrangle
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wankhede in legal wrangle
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Wankhede stadium, which is scheduled to host the 2011 World Cup final, may not be ready in time for crickets flagship event.         
	The 35-year-old venue is caught in a legal wrangle with regard to its modernisation and might not have its south-eastern section completed in time for the World Cup which will be held from February 19 to April 2.         
	A Public Interest Litigation (PIL), filed in the Mumbai High Court and which comes up for hearing on Thursday, alleges that new construction in the stadium violates environmental and safety norms.         
	The stadium falls in the Coastal Regulation Zone. There are several areas where permission has not been given but construction is on and in full swing, said YP Singh, counsel for Amit Maru who has filed the PIL.         
	Among the many concerns are the lack of access to the fire-brigade to all parts of the venue as required under the National Building Code of India and a green-belt around the stadium.         
	Besides, the Western Railways had issued a no work order as the portion adjoining the east and south stands did not leave the minimum 30 metre vacant space from the tracks, Singh said.         
	The stadium authorities have not taken the necessary No Objection Certificate from the Railways. They have taken away the entire exit from the Railways, he said.         
	Apart from the legal hurdles, the venue was racing against time as the construction work had to be completed before the south-west monsoon arrives in May-June.         
	The south stand, work on which has been suspended pending the court verdict, could very well miss that deadline.         
	The ground and pitch preparation would have to be done, of course, after the monsoon which could last until September.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, Chief Administrative Officer of the BCCI and Tournament Director for the World Cup, maintained that the construction work was on schedule and the stadium would be ready in time.         
	The PIL relates to the 30 metre gap between the stadium and the railway tracks, and it is only (regard to) the east stand. Even there, we are not demolishing it, only strengthening it.         
	If anyone has talked of any issues with the south stand, I dont know. The rest of the work is on schedule, Shetty said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inter mission accomplished
                                                                                                                       7                                        Inter mission accomplished
    - Mourinho prepares to leave as Inter savour rare treble           RAPHAEL MINDER            Jubilant Inter Milan players with the Champions League trophy in Madrid, on Saturday                                 
	As the stadium loudspeakers announced the line-up for the Champions League final between Inter Milan and Bayern Munich, the name of Jose Mourinho, Inters Portuguese coach, drew a thunderous shout of approval from the section of fans in Inters black and blue.         
	For those fans, Saturday night was probably their last chance to celebrate the man they call Mou, who crowned another remarkable coaching season by leading Inter to a 2-0 victory at Real Madrids Santiago Bernabeu stadium, as briefly reported in Sundays Late City edition.         
	It was Inters first triumph in Europes most prestigious club soccer competition since winning consecutive titles in 1964 and 1965, and it came, after 45 years, in the kind of match that will almost certainly convince big-spending Real Madrid that Mourinho can help secure championships after this years trophy-less season.         
	Not only that, Inter completed an unprecedented treble for a Serie A club following their Italian league and Cup double.         
	Even before Inters victory, Real Madrid were rumoured to want Mourinho on their bench.         
	Mourinho, who also won the Champions League with Porto in 2004, seemed to agree that Madrid would probably be his next home.         
	If you dont coach Real Madrid then you always have a gap in your career, he said.         
	By the final whistle, Mourinhos tactical choices had certainly paid off.         
	Despite a big advantage in ball possession, Bayern never managed to pierce Inters defensive wall, marshalled by its two South American central defenders, the Brazilian Lucio and the Argentine Walter Samuel. As Bayern tried to push forward, they were left exposed to lethal counter-attacks, spearheaded by Inters Argentine forward Diego Milito, who scored both goals.         
	In the late 1990s, Mourinho was an assistant to Bayern Manager Louis Van Gaal at Barcelona. On Saturday, Van Gaal acknowledged the superiority of Mourinhos more defensive approach.         
	Im very happy for Mourinho that he won with this style of play, he said. Attacking is much more difficult than defending  and so many German teams that we face also opt for defending. But Inter do it a bit better.         
	Mourinho dismissed as provocation the suggestions that Inter managed to win only by playing defensively.         
	We have demonstrated our identity throughout this Champions League, he said. We deserved this title.         
	Militos performance was the climax of a season in which he justified his signing last summer from the smaller club Genoa. In recent weeks, Milito scored the decisive goals in Inters Italian Cup triumph over Roma and in the final match of the Serie A season, a victory that clinched the league title for Inter.         
	In the 35th minute Saturday, Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar sent a powerful kick upfield, which Milito headed to Wesley Sneijder. Sneijder, Inters Dutch playmaker, quickly returned the pass, and Milito sent a perfectly timed chip over Bayern goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt.         
	On the second goal, in the 70th minute, Milito collected the ball far from the Bayern goal and charged forward with no obvious support in sight. Choosing once more a direct path to goal, he ran at the last defender, Belgiums Daniel Van Buyten, bamboozled him with a beautiful dribble and put the ball in the net.         
	Bayern had their chances but rarely looked likely to translate the superior ball possession into goals. A perfect illustration of their sterile domination came in the final minute of the first half, when Bayern kept the ball close to the edge of the Inter penalty area without finding a way to penetrate the Italian fortress.         
	By the final whistle, Bayern had managed 21 shots to Inters 12. But only six were on target, compared with seven for Inter.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

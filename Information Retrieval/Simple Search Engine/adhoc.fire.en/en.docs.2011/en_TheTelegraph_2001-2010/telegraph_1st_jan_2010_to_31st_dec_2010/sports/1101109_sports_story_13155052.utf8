The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arthur lying, says Mali
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arthur lying, says Mali
                      
	Johannesburg: Former Cricket South Africa (CSA) president Ray Mali said ex-coach Mickey Arthurs claims that retiring pacer Makhaya Ntini used the race card after being dropped from the side are lies.         
	Arthur, who now coaches Western Australia in Perth, alleges in his book Taking the Mickey, to be released Monday, that he had been called to a breakfast meeting where the then cricket boss Mtutuzeli Nyoka had apologised to Ntini after the latter had complained that Arthur and captain Graeme Smith did not want black players in the side.         
	Mali, who is now looking after Athletics South Africa , refuted Arthurs claims and told a newspaper: Theres no such thing. Mickey is lying. Makhaya said no such thing. Makhaya did not play the race card.         
	Meanwhile, Arthur has denied suggesting a ODI against Pakistan in 2007 was fixed, saying his comments were taken out of context. (PTI)

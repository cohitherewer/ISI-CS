	I am really excited by the challenge of this new role  from a talent management point of view, this will be an exciting period for Australian cricket. I have enjoyed the COE Head Coach role as I was able to work with a talented group of coaches and support staff to assist and develop the next generation of Australian cricketers. The new role dovetails beautifully for me as they will be the immediate future of Australian cricket, he said.         
	He is expected to take up the new role as soon as the current COE program debriefing of state cricket associations is finished within the next month.         
	CA General Manager Michael Brown said he was delighted that a person with Chappells life-long depth of experience and expertise in elite cricket was able to take the new role.

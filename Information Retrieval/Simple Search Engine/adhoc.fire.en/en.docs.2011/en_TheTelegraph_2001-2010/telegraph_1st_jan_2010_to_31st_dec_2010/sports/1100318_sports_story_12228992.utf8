The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anils men have the upper hand
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anils men have the upper hand
                      
	Bangalore: The Royal Challengers Bangalore hold a clear edge over an injury-ravaged Rajasthan Royals when the two meet Thursday in the Indian Premier Leagues third season.         
	The home side had a rather poor start to their campaign with a seven-wicket loss at the hands of the Kolkata Knight Riders but Anil Kumble and his men showed tremendous resilience to bounce back versus the Kings XI Punjab in Tuesdays high-scoring humdinger.         
	Royals, champions in 2008, have lost both their matches so far and injuries to Graeme Smith and Dmitri Mascarenhas have further depleted the Shane Warne-led outfit.         
	The way the hosts chased down a 200-plus total against Kings XI Punjab spoke volumes of their batting might.         
	Veteran South African Jacques Kallis has been a pillar of strength for them, contributing with both bat and ball. The indefatigable all-rounder has been a tricky customer with the ball and his ability to pace his innings makes him an invaluable batsman.

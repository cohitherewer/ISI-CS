The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dipendu is the saviour
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dipendu is the saviour
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: The only change that was evident in Mohammedan Sportings CFL Premier Division match against Kalighat Club, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday, was the presence of their new coach Fuja Tope. The rest was pretty much the same.         
	Their performance in the 1-0 victory was not much different from their 0-5 drubbing at the hands of East Bengal earlier this month. Also same was their saviour, Dipendu Biswas, who once again scored the winning goal.         
	With their midfield appearing as dead as the Dodo, creative football was not on the cards. The first half didnt see either team making much inroads into the rival box. At times, when they did, the culmination was awful.         
	However, Fuja Topes one change, towards the end of the first half, made things a tad better. The introduction of Kartick Kisku, in place of Sandip Rai, brought some urgency in the proceedings.         
	And in the 48 th minute, Kisku earned his team a penalty when he was brought down inside the box by Sourav Sana. Dipendu stepped up to take the shot and finished it clinically.         
	But that was all.         
	Kalighats only proper attempt to score came in the 85 th minute Amitava Roys long-ranger had to be parried by a diving Manash Barua.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers make early inroads

            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Sreesanth celebrates with Harbhajan Singh, in Nagpur, on Saturday. (PTI)                            
	Nagpur: Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle was ready to spin the coin, when Daniel Vettori was startled by yells of hang on from some of his teammates.         
	The New Zealand captain turned back to see Brendon McCullum being attended to by the physio. The double centurion in the Hyderabad Test was clutching his back in pain after landing awkwardly in an attempt to take a catch during training.         
	He rushed to the sidelines, keeping Madugalle waiting, to check on the openers fitness. Minutes later, Vettori returned signalling no change in the line-up. Hardly had he imagined then that McCullums absence at the top of the order would derail the side. The visitors were hoping that the injury would take 24 hours to heal and he would be fine before the start of the second day. But a batting collapse prompted the opener to come in at No.8 on Saturday itself.         
	If the mine explosion back home, where several people were reported missing, had left the players disturbed, McCullums injury upset their plans. The end result: New Zealand were struggling at 148 for seven at close on the opening day of the final Test of the Airtel series.         
	Due credit, however, should also be given to the Indian bowlers, especially Sreesanth (9-4-20-2) who started the slide, for an inspirational performance just when doubts were being raised about their penetration qualities and wicket-taking abilities.         
	New Zealand wasted the advantage of winning the toss after the first session was lost because of a wet outfield. At 82 for six, they were staring down the barrel, but Jesse Ryder and McCullum stitched together 42 for the seventh wicket to restore some stability and respectability.         
	The visitors were ready to have McCullum bat in the middle order but didnt expect half of the top-order to join him in the pavilion by the 17th over. Sreesanth utilised the bounce and got the ball to move and Ishant Sharma joined the party a little later but some of the New Zealand batsmen should also share the blame for poor shot selection.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders players absence from the opening slot meant that the new ball pair of Sreesanth and Ishant were not tested with his attacking flair. Martin Guptill opened with Tim McIntosh and New Zealand were in disarray as early as the seventh over.         
	Working up good pace with an upright seam and hitting the perfect line and length, Sreesanth first accounted for Guptill, who was forced to hand his bat out to one that pitched on the off stump and moved away. McIntosh was castled by a beauty in Sreesanths next over.         
	The batsman was left clueless as the ball moved in after pitching outside the off stump and found the gap between his bat and pad. Ishant, playing for the first time since his batting heroics against Australia in Mohali, showed signs of lack of match practice but seemed to be inspired by Sreesanth. A change of ends also seemed to have done the trick.         
	Ross Taylor was undone by the movement off an Ishant delivery that jagged in. A lot hinged on Vettori but his attempt to break free with an aggressive approach led to disaster. An ungainly pull had got him a single in the previous over but as Ishant lured him with another, he dragged it on to his stumps.         
	Kane Williamson and Gareth Hopkins didnt last long and then Ryder and McCullum joined hands. Both batsmen started limping midway through their innings but none could afford a runner because both had injuries coming into the match. Ryder had aggravated a calf muscle injury when sweeping Pragyan Ojha, while the decision to play McCullum will continue to be debated.         
	Thirty two runs of their partnership came off boundaries with the batsmen struggling to run the singles. McCullum survived a confident caught behind appeal off Sreesanth but Ryder looked in control during the 183-minute stay for his 59. The lefthander fell to a low sharp catch by Suresh Raina, eight overs before bad light intervened.         
	New Zealand will be hoping McCullum, unbeaten on 34, can carry his form to pull them out of the woods. The Indians, however, are determined not to let them off the hook.

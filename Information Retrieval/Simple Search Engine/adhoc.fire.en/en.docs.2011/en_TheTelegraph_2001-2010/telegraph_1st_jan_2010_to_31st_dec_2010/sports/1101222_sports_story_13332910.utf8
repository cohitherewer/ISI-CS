The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rewinding the highs and lows from the fast track
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rewinding the highs and lows from the fast track
    - Mark Webbers grit and guts won him plenty of fans           [+uc('Tom Cary   The Daily Telegraph')+]            World champion Sebastian Vettel                                 
	This has been an eventful year for Formula One. After a start that had not really lived up to the hype, 2010 exploded into life, with events that will remain etched in the minds of sportspersons and fans alike.               
	Here are some of the key points of 2010                 
	 Best race: Turkish Grand Prix         
	Sebastian Vettels shunt into Mark Webber as he attempted to take first place from his teammate triggered accusations of favouritism from the Australian, sparking a feud, which was to colour Red Bulls season.         
	Over at McLaren, Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton flirted with disaster themselves as they fought to profit from Red Bulls implosion.         
	The pair just about avoided a collision and a major fallout of their own.         
	Best driver: Sebastian Vettel         
	Honourable mentions to Robert Kubica, who hardly put a foot wrong in his Renault; to Ferraris Fernando Alonso for his stunning form from mid-season; and to Mark Webber for giving us so many juicy stories and generally defying expectations.         
	But the winner has to be Sebastian Vettel. Ten poles, five wins, youngest ever world champion.         
	The 23 year-old bounced back from being described as the crash kid to show nerves of steel when it mattered most.         
	 Runner-up: Mark Webber         
	Fernando Alonso missed out on a third world crown through no fault of his own  the Spaniard had his Ferrari team to blame for an appalling pit-stop strategy at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.         
	However, Alonso blotted his copybook with his angry gesture at Vitaly Petrov the driver whose Renault car the Spaniard proved impossible to pass and should have been docked points after the Hockenheim debacle.         
	So this award goes instead to Mark Webber whose brand of grit and guts won him plenty of new fans in 2010.         
	 Worst incident: Webbers crash         
	Mark Webbers crash at Valencia, which saw the Australian flip upside down at close to 200mph after coming into contact with Heikki Kovalainens Lotus, was horrific.         
	Thankfully, Webber walked away unscathed and showed what he was made of by winning in style at Silverstone. Not bad for a No. 2 driver. Another major concern was the lack of overtaking unless the heavens opened or there was a huge disparity between the cars.         
	 Unsung hero: Nico Rosberg         
	Red Bulls design genius, Adrian Newey, is certainly mild-mannered but perhaps its not right to describe him as an unsung hero; Newey has rightly been feted at the various end-of-season F1 awards. Instead this gong should go to one of the less celebrated drivers.         
	Kamui Kobayashi provided fireworks in his Sauber, Robert Kubica was metronomic in his Renault but Nico Rosberg came out on top for completely upstaging seven-time champion Michael Schumacher on his return to F1 after a three-year absence.         
	 Worst argument: Ferrari         
	Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello had a good old-fashioned ding dong after the German defended position a tad too aggressively in Hungary, nearly putting the Brazilian into the pit wall; Mark Webber and Red Bull were at loggerheads all season.         
	The winner had to be the team-orders row, which erupted after Ferrari told Felipe Massa to allow Fernando Alonso through at Hockenheim. Ferrari were accused of bringing the sport into disrepute. They responded by accusing their detractors of hypocrisy.         
	 Lesson: Beware karma         
	After Jenson Buttons car was held up by men brandishing machine guns in Sao Paulo, Bernie Ecclestone suggested it might be because the 2009 world champion was a bit slow and dim.         
	I think they look for victims who are not too bright. All the people who have been robbed seem to be people outside the top 10 of the grid, Ecclestone said.         
	One month later the 80 year-old was taken to hospital in London after an attack by muggers who made off with a reported 200,000 worth of jewellery. Also check your (love) hotel reservation carefully in Mokpo, Korea.         
	 Disappointment: Soulless venues         
	Bernie Ecclestones never-ending expansion to the Middle and Far East shows no signs of abating. And while, on the one hand, the money being pumped into the sport by these venues is good news,as it pushes Formula One into new and exciting regions, on the other hand, it means you are leaving behind your traditional fans and circuits such as Spa which can no longer afford the race fees.         
	Korea was a slog, Chinas track was completely soulless and Valencias was just plain boring.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

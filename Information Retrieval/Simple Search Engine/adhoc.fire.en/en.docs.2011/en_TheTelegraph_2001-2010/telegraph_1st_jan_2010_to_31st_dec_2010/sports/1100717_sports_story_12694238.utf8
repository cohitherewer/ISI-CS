	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings newly-appointed coach Syed Nayeemuddin, has decided to watch Santosh Trophy matches in order to spot talented players.         
	Nayeemuddins name as club coach was formally announced by the club president and Union Minister of State for Tourism Sultan Ahmed, at a press conference, here on Friday.         
	I have been handed over a tentative list by the club officials. I will also watch the Santosh Trophy matches and spot talented players. We will start our practice once we finalise the whole squad, Nayeemuddin, told the reporters.         
	Asked about his strict training regimen, which, in the past, had created controversy more often than not, Nayeemuddin maintained that there was no short cut to success. I am still a strict disciplinarian and I wont change my style, he said.         
	Ahmed also announced Emta Group of Companies as the teams sponsor. The company will invest Rs 5 crore over a three-year period.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its Tigers make-or-break Open
                                                                                                                       7                                      Its Tigers make-or-break Open
            Mark Reason                                  Tiger woods      
	Two things in this sporting life used to be certain. Germany qualify for the football World Cup final and Tiger Woods wins the Open at St Andrews. The man-machine has won by a total of 13 shots over the previous two Opens played on his favourite course. Woods loves the Old Course like a good-time waffle waitress.         
	Now the man-machine is making odd rattling noises. A couple of months ago Jack Nicklaus suggested that Woods needed to win a major this year if he were to break the Golden Bears record of 18 majors. But it is no longer a sure thing.         
	Pebble Beach and St Andrews are two of Woods favourite golf courses, places where he stunned the world in his youth. If he cannot rediscover his genius in the sandhills of so much past glory, maybe he will never get it back. It may just be that St Andrews 2010 comes to be seen as Woods make-or-break major.         
	The first time that Woods the pro played St Andrews was a religious experience. An American radio commentator was whispering in the dunes: I dont know how to tell you this folks. The Power. But Tiger has just driven the ball 382 yards. And the Glory.         
	Woods left his footprints on the Old Course for eternity. He won by eight shots. Tiger was a mystic and his father prophesied to the people that he would change the world, like Gandhi. Now Woods is another broken china Buddha, another dad struggling to see his kids at the weekend.         
	None of your business he barked, when asked if his personal life was intruding on his professional. Then a couple of weeks later he was flying back from Ireland to take advantage of a brief access period to his kids. In happier days he used to go fishing and golfing in the week before the Open at St Andrews.         
	In 2005 Woods seemed to have it all. He had broken his major drought by winning that years Masters. He was returning to the golf course where he had splintered the world in 2000. He was nine months married to Elin, who stood side by side with his mum on the steps of the clubhouse and applauded his stroll to victory.         
	Maybe it all became too much for one man to handle. Maybe Woods deliberately went about destroying his myth. Maybe he wanted to be caught. Whatever the truth, he is not returning to the kingdom as golfs undisputed ruler.         
	After failing to break par in any round at last weeks AT amp;T  the first time since 1999 in four rounds of a non major  Woods said: I drove it great, just putted terrible. There lies the glitch in the machine. In his wonder years Woods putted like the greatest sportsman of all time. Over the past two years the certainty on the greens began to fray as Woods private life came apart. He cannot separate the two.         
	Woods said about the Open this year: Its open, thats the beauty of it. He is even talking a different language. He could never have said that in 2005. He would never have admitted to the possibility of anyone else winning.         
	But this is the open Open. Even Phil Mickelson thinks that he has a chance and Phil is usually as much use on a dusty links as a sea bream. Padraig Harrington has two Open titles and has twice won the Dunhill Links round St Andrews. Geoff Ogilvy finished fifth in 2005. Graeme McDowell, the US Open champion, has lost the Dunhill in a play-off and finished 11th five years ago.         
	The world has a chance again. In 2005 there were only three Americans in the top 15 and it is not too fanciful to think that we might have the first British winner of a St Andrews Open since Nick Faldo 20 years ago. There are more than 20 Englishmen in the field, for a start.         
	They also all now have the considerable advantage of the course experience that the Dunhill Links has given them. Lee Westwood and Simon Dyson are previous winners of the Dunhill and Justin Rose and Luke Donald have both come close.         
	Westwood is certainly long enough to win and Rose has found some distance, because experience tells us that St Andrews is a bombers course. Mickelson thinks so and says he will be swinging extra hard. Past winners such as Woods, John Daly, Seve Ballesteros and Jack Nicklaus endorse the point.         
	That brings us to Rory McIlroy. The kid really believes he can win this week. He has never failed to break 70 round St Andrews and loves the course like he once idolised Woods.

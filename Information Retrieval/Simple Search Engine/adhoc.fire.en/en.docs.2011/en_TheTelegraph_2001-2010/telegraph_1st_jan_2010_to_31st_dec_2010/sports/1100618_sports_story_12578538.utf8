The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Early lead for Kjeldsen
                                                                                                                       7                                      Early lead for Kjeldsen
                      
	Pebble Beach: Soren Kjeldsen of Denmark has taken the early lead at the US Open, starting his round with three birdies over the first six holes at Pebble Beach to go to 3-under par.         
	Kjeldsen, a three-time winner on the European Tour, was one shot ahead of Toru Taniguchi and Edoardo Molinari.         
	Major winners Jim Furyk, Mike Weir and Padraig Harrington were in a group of six at one under, as the first wave of players started making their way towards the turn in the opening round.         
	Early morning cloud cover started to burn off, making it look like the forecast would hold true. If it does, it could make Pebble Beach brittle, which is why course workers were busy spraying water on the greens early in the morning in an attempt to keep things from drying out too much.         
	Mickelson, in search of the second leg of the 2010 Grand Slam, got an early taste of what hard greens can do to a guy at Pebble, then gave his own primer about the kind of things he can do to get out of those jams.

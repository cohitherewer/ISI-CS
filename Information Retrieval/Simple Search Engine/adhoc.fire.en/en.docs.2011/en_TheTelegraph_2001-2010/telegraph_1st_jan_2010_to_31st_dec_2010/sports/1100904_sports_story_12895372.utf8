            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Climax Lawrence                           
	New Delhi: India could be without captain Bhaichung Bhutia when they take on Thailand in the first of the two-match series at the Yamaha Stadium in Bangkok on Saturday.         
	The return encounter will be played at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium on September 8.         
	According to sources in the Indian camp, national coach Bob Houghton may decide against fielding Bhutia though the Indian captain has been practising with the starting line up for the past few days after recovering from thyroid problems.         
	The coach, however, will take a final decision on the captain Saturday morning. Midfielder Climax Lawrence would be the stand in captain in Bhutias absence.         
	Though Mohammed Rafi , who is set to make his international debut on Saturday, will pair up with Sunil Chetri in the attacking zone, there is a chance that Bhutia could be sent in later as both the teams have agreed to use six substitutes in the match.         
	Of the other two strikers Sushil Kumar and Abhishek Yadav, the latter suffered an injury during the Portugal tour and it is not known whether he will be fit for Saturdays match.         
	Subrata Paul, who played most of the practice matches in Portugal, is certain to man the goal while Houghton is expected to start with Surkumar Singh, Anwar Ali, Gouramangi Singh and NS Manju with option to bring in Gawli and Mondal later. Nimble-footed Anthony Pereira would be the key man for India with his sudden accelerations on the left and Steven Dias would be Houghtons preferred man on the right though he had some injury concerns in Portugal.         
	An Indian team official said that Houghton, along with Thailand coach Bryan Robson (former England and Manchester United star), held a joint press conference on Friday and spoke about their respective teams. While Houghton said his players were yet to acclimatise with the humid weather in Bangkok, Robson said he could consider fielding a few junior players.         
	The time factor is creating a lot of problem, said an Indian official. We are also yet to recover from the jet lag.         
	Thailand are currently ranked 104th in Fifa rankings. Having failed to qualify for the Asia Cup, they are now preparing for the Asian Games in November. Robson has inducted several under-23 players in the 31-member squad, which will be cut down to 20 after the India match.         
	From the Indian point of view, the match on Saturday is of immense importance as it would be the first official friendly tie as a part of Indias preparations for the Asia Cup to be held in Doha in January 2011. India had been practising in Portugal for the last couple of months and played 10 friendly matches against local club sides.         
	After the second match against Thailand, India will play African side Namibia on September 15 followed by a few more friendlies in October.         
	The match will start at 4.30 pm IST.

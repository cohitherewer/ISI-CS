The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We hope to utilise our conditions: Graeme

            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Centurion: The rivalry between South Africa and India will be taken to a new level when the Castle Test series between the two major cricketing nations starts at SuperSport Park on Thursday.         
	There are so many sub-plots to throw into the mix: No. 1 against No. 2 on the ICC World Test rankings; Graeme Smith versus Zaheer Khan; Virender Sehwag versus Dale Steyn; the conditions that could be entirely unpredictable; Sachin Tendulkars ongoing target of 50 Test match centuries.         
	Proteas captain Graeme Smith discussed many of these issues at the news conference on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If weather is a concern         
	The weather hasnt been too frustrating as we have got two good sessions in. If we hadnt been able to train outdoors it would have been more frustrating. We had a good middle session at the Wanderers on Monday and we had a good net session here yesterday (Tuesday). Today (Wednesday) was always going to be about topping up and being ready for tomorrow.         
	South Africa is one of the toughest places to bat. We havent requested to play on green, seaming wickets as everybody seems to be making out but we like to play under conditions that we know with pace and bounce and that is something that we are hoping for. The weather has made life difficult for the groundstaff, so I think there will be more seam movement than even they anticipated. It is something both sides will have to adapt to over the five days.         
	Whether he has recovered from injury         
	My recovery has been a lot quicker than anybody expected. I have done exactly what I was required to do in this off period. This is going to be a big series both for myself and the team and I am glad that I will be able to be part of it.         
	On the Indian team         
	It is a difficult question to answer as to whether this is the best Indian team to visit us but it is certainly one of the most experienced. They have got a lot of players who have travelled around the world and have been playing cricket for a very long time. They have got a lot of experience and they should know how to adapt to the surfaces they will be facing.         
	Someone at the function the other night said that Sachin (Tendulkar) had been coming here since 1992, so he has probably seen more South African surfaces than I have! Their ability and experience is probably something they have got over other Indian teams.         
	 His battle with Zaheer         
	I have prepared for this series the same way I have prepared for any other. Zaheer is one of the top bowlers in the world especially against left-handers. He has achieved success against Hayden, myself and several others. Zaheer being the Indian spearhead and myself opening the batting, it is going to be a natural challenge. I try not to personalise too much. I focus on my own game and what I would like to achieve throughout the series.         
	Virender Sehwag versus the SA pace attack         
	It is important to notice that Virender Sehwag has been successful against us on the subcontinent. The last Test series he played against us here he ended up sliding down the order to No. 5 or 6 so he has got a couple of demons he needs to put right. He is a quality player who takes the pressure off the rest of the line-up with the way he plays. We have discussed him but not more so than any other player in their side.

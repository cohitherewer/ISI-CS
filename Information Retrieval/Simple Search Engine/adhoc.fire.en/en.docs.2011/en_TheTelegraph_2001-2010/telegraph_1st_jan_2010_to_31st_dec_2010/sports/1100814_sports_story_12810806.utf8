The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bindra is on ISSF panel
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bindra is on ISSF panel
                      
	New Delhi: He may not have clinched a medal at the World Championships this time but Abhinav Bindra continued to rise in stature by getting elected to the International Shooting Sport Federations (ISSF) Athlete Committee.         
	The rifle shooter, who became Indias first individual Olympic gold medallist by finishing on top in the Beijing Games, was voted into the four-member panel by his fellow marksmen competing in the 50th World Championships in Munich, on Thursday. He finished 25th in the 10m air rifle event.         
	Ironically, his name for the committee was proposed by the National Rifles Association of India with which he has often been at loggerheads over facilities and selection procedures.         
	Apart from Bindra, the others who have been elected are Slovak Rajmond Debevec, Frenchman Franck Dumoulin and Russias Vladimir Isakov.           (PTI)

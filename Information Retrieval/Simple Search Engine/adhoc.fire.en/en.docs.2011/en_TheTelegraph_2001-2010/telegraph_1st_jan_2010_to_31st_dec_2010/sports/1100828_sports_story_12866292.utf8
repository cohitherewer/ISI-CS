The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trott, Broad give England control
                                                                                                                       7                                      Trott, Broad give England control
                      
	London: Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad each hit a century Friday to lead England to a remarkable 346 for seven at stumps following an early collapse against Pakistan on the second day of the decisive fourth Test at Lords.         
	Paceman Mohammed Aamer claimed Test best figures of six for 73 to help reduce England to 102 for seven shortly after lunch but Trott and Broad rallied with an English record eighth-wicket stand of 244.         
	Trott was 149 not out at the close and passed 1,000 Test runs in the process. Broad was on a career best 125 for his first Test century after the 18-year-old Aamer had become the youngest bowler to reach and pass 50 Test wickets.         
	England were especially indebted to Trotts gritty 302-ball innings, with the South African-born batsman hitting a crucial century in the final Test of the summer for the second straight year.         
	Trott hit 15 boundaries in a chanceless innings including a sweetly timed on-driven four off Mohammed Asif to take him to 60.         
	He and Broad withstood tough batting conditions for most of the day and exploited a brief post-tea period of sunshine when England dashed from 200 to 250 in just 62 deliveries.(Agencies)

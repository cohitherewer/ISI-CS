            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi: M.C.Mary Kom, who won the fifth women boxing World championships gold medal in Barbados on Saturday, will still have to fight it out for a place in the Asian Games squad.         
	According to Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) sources, the icon of Indian women boxing will have to go through the qualification trials on September 26 in the capital to ensure a place in the national team in the 51 kg category.         
	The Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou, China in November.         
	The change of rules by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) has put Mary Kom in a spot of bother, said the source.         
	The Manipuri girl remained a 46 kg boxer for most part of her career but had to work hard to increase her body weight when the AIBA changed the flyweight category to 48 kg for the World championships.         
	Now that womens boxing is set to make debut in Asian Games and Olympics, the AIBA has decided to play the sport in three categories  flyweight (48-51kg), lightweight (56-60kg) and middleweight (69-75kg).         
	In the trials for the 51 kg, Mary Kom will be pitted against L. Saritha Devi, who is much heavier than the world champion. Saritha is also known in the boxing circle as Mary Koms closest friend.         
	I have a tough task on hand but I am not perturbed, Mary Kom told The Telegraph from Barbados on Sunday.         
	I had been taking some supplements to increase my body weight. I am arriving in India on Tuesday and hopefully should be well prepared to fight the trials, she said.         
	Mary Kom said her next target will be to win gold medals at the Asian Games and Olympics. I am doing everything to stay fit till the London Olympics in 2012. It will be a dream come true for me, she said.         
	Representing the country has always excited me. When I beat that Romanian girl (Steluta Duta) in the final, the first thing that came to my mind was how happy my countrymen will be. The sound of the national anthem being played has always thrilled me, said Mary Kom.         
	A lot of people are saying that I am getting older and wouldnt be able to sustain till the Olympics. But what they dont understand is that I am also getting richer in experience. Otherwise, how would I have won the gold medal here, he asked.         
	Balancing a demanding training schedule with the responsibility of being the mother of two young children is not easy, but with womens boxing finding a place in the 2012 Olympics, Mary Kom said has a reason to continue doing the tough twin jobs.

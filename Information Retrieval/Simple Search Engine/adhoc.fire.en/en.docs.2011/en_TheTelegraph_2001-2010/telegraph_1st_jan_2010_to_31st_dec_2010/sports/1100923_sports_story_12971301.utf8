The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirsten is happy with build-up 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kirsten is happy with build-up 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With series against some of the top sides lined up, India coach Gary Kirsten said the team couldnt have asked for a better build-up to the 2011 World Cup.         
	India will play Australia, New Zealand and South Africa prior to the quadrennial extravaganza, scheduled to start after exactly 150 days.         
	We could not have asked for a better build-up to the ICC Cricket World Cup, with 13 ODIs against top opposition, said Kirsten.         
	I think we have a good idea of what the make-up of the squad will look like as long as there are no unforeseen injuries. Our form has been a little patchy this year but as everyone knows, winning a World Cup is about the confidence of the team in the crucial moments of the big games.         
	With a lot of teams capable of beating each other, it will make for some exciting match-ups, Kirsten added.         
	The tournament kicks off with India playing Bangladesh in Dhaka on February 19. Kirsten, one of the 10 players to have scored 150 or more in a single World Cup innings, holds the record for the highest individual score in the tournament. The former South Africa opener smashed 188 not out against the UAE in the 1996 edition.         
	New Zealands Glenn Turner, another member in the exclusive 150-plus club, carried his bat to score an unbeaten 171 against East Africa, in the very first match of the inaugural edition in 1975.         
	Turner, however, admits that the thought of scoring a double century never crossed his mind.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bonhomie is behind good show
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bonhomie is behind good show
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: The biggest positive from Indias 3-2 win over Brazil in the Davis Cup World Group play-off, apart from the young guns coming of age, is the new found team spirit.         
	And the catalyst for the team spirit seems to be the revival of friendship between the two veterans, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi.         
	It was heart-warming to see the duo crack jokes among themselves and with the rest of the team, and indulge during practice sessions in some good natured ragging of the two newcomers to Indian team, Ranjit Virali Murugesan and Sonam Singh, who served as sparring partners.         
	It was not a faade. This was genuine friendship and mutual respect, a rewind back to the glory days when they had the tennis world at their feet. Has it come a bit too late? Well, better late than never!         
	I think so, Paes told The Telegraph when asked if there has been a turnaround in his relationship with his once estranged partner. I cant really explain, its not a tangible thing. I guess it comes with age as you grow, he added.         
	During the past week, the holder of a dozen Grand Slam titles had talked about how he has come to respect what he had achieved along with Bhupathi and individually.         
	His partner reciprocated the sentiment and pointed out how Paes has been an inspiration to a generation of players.         
	Leander has set the bar very high when it comes to playing for the country. He has been a role model for the youngsters and those who have played with him, he said.         
	There were not many chest-thumps during the course of their straight-set win in the doubles rubber against Brazil. Understandably so, since the pair of Bruno Soares and Marcelo Melo seldom posed a challenge to excite them enough.         
	But, Bhupathi recalled, one particular moment from the match that defined what it takes to be a Paes. Leander always likes the ball to come to him. At 5-4 15-40 in the second set, he crossed to get the ball. After winning the point he said, if you want to win, you got to have balls, the Bangalorean said. Interestingly, it was not long ago that Bhupathi and some others in the team had revolted against Paes captaincy.         
	Ever since I took over, there has been no bad vibes. There has been absolute camaraderie and the players, whether seniors and youngsters, have worked hard and always given their heart out for India, captain Shiv Prakash Misra said.         
	What this means to the Indian fans is that they can put a tick mark against a tennis medal, probably gold, at the 2012 London Games

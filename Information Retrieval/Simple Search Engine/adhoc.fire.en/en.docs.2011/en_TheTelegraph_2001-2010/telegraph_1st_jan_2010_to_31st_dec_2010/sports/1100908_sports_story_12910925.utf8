The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New challenge for Tendulkar
                                                                                                                       7                                      New challenge for Tendulkar
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar feels that playing in the Airtel Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20) is a different kind of challenge for him and his team. Mumbai Indians will take on Bizhub Highveld Lions at the Wanderers, on Friday.         
	There is an aura around the Mumbai Indians, largely because of Sachins presence.         
	Having played cricket for more than 20 years, this is the first time I am doing something like this.         
	You have champion sides from most of the cricket playing nations  its as tough as it can get. It will be competitive and exciting  you have some world-class players participating in this tournament and I think the crowds will thoroughly enjoy it.         
	Twenty20 has always been an exciting format  this takes it to a new level altogether, Sachin was quoted as saying in a press release.         
	He said the team had had no problem settling down as a unit again. We have had a superb IPL-III and the players understand each other very well. So there is no question of trying to understand each other again. We already know what the thinking is.         
	Sachin said he did not think the Australian and South African teams would have any particular advantage as a result of the conditions in South Africa.         
	It all depends on how you perform on any given day, he said.         
	Many of the players taking part in the tournament have been travelling around the world, and have grown accustomed to different conditions. All the teams have some world-class players, so its always a challenge to play against them.         
	But for me, its all about playing to the best of my potential. It doesnt matter who the opposition is. That is the way I have always approached the game, and I continue to do that now.         
	Sachin said the Lions would have a slight advantage in the opening match because of their knowledge of conditions at the Wanderers.         
	After having played for such a long time, Im playing in South Africa in September for the first time in my career, so conditions are slightly different. But that doesnt mean that we cant produce good cricket, he said.         
	Were here to compete hard and to compete fairly. The Lions have the advantage of knowing the conditions and the ground better than us, but that doesnt mean we cant beat them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Elano is out of quarters
                                                                                                                       7                                      Elano is out of quarters
                      
	Johannesburg: Elano will not play for Brazil in Fridays World Cup quarter final match against the Netherlands because of a right ankle injury, a team doctor said Wednesday.         
	Jose Luis Runco said Elano may be fit by next week but did not rule out the possibility that the playmaker could miss the rest of the World Cup. He has been undergoing intensive treatment which can take a few days, weeks or a month, there is no timetable, Runco said.         
	Each day we will make an evaluation. We have to see if nature will be on our side.         
	Runco said Elano was progressing clinically but exams showed the player has a bruised bone, which will keep him from being able to practice with the rest of the players at least until Friday.         
	We have hope that he will be available next week, but we cant affirm that yet, Runco said. Elano scored a goal in each of Brazils first two matches and was practicing normally Tuesday but was forced to leave after apparently feeling pain in the ankle. He was undergoing a light training session with the rest of the players but had to cut it short after consulting team doctors.

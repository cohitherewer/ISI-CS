	Lahore: A parliamentary panel on Monday made the stunning disclosure that some Pakistani cricketers were involved in match-fixing during the recent tour of Australia but declined to name the players involved.         
	The sub-committee of the Senate Committee on Sports made the revelation after a meeting with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials, including its chairman Ijaz Butt, at Gaddafi Stadium here.         
	The sub-committee was briefed on the tour with documents, and there are verbal, video and solid proofs that one or more players were involved in match-fixing, said Haroon Akhtar, a member of the sub-committee. The committee declined to name the cricketers involved in match-fixing.         
	Meanwhile the PCB has rejected the claim of Abdul Raquib, manager of the national team, that he didnt complain against any player. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer wins without much ado
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer wins without much ado
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                            
	London: Maybe Roger Federer did not realise that up in the darkness at the O2 Arena, he was being watched by another of sports immortals.         
	But whether it was the presence of Diego Maradona or not, there never really seemed any doubt that the hand of God would end up applauding the wand of God.         
	El Diego evidently could not resist popping over from his London sporting tour to see Federer cruise through his opening match of the ATP World Tour finals 6-1, 6-4 against David Ferrer.         
	It was all as predictably one-sided as the fare he had been subjected to but, then, many of the folk who go to watch the Swiss maestro these days dont go to see a contest; they go to be able to say I once saw him play. It felt like a night out at the theatre watching a great actor tread the boards.         
	Ferrer played his support role obligingly enough. The Spaniard, who had never beaten the Swiss in 10 previous attempts, was off to such a terrible start while Federer was apparently keen to show off to his new Argentine admirer.         
	He strung the Spaniard around the court like a plaything and offered such delicious volleying, that Ferrer was four games down seemingly before the 17,500 had even settled in.         
	Only one careless game, tossed away when 40-0 up on serve, spared Ferrer the indignity of being whitewashed in a 33-minute opening set but no-one has ever accused Ferrer of not being a tryer. Working Federer hard in the second set, he even had three break points to level at 5-5 before Federer wrapped up victory with an ace.         
	On Monday, Novak Djokovic had little trouble beating Tomas Berdych in his first match, winning 6-3, 6-3 on Monday in the Group B match.         
	The third-seeded Serb served well throughout, was only taken to deuce in two games and never faced a break point. He also ran his sixth-ranked Czech opponent around the court at the O2 Arena, using a variety of forehands and backhands to send Berdych sprinting from side to side.         
	Djokovics strong performance aside, Berdychs biggest problem may have been his serve.         
	The Czech landed only 48 percent of his first serves, and although he only had three double-faults, two of them came in the first game  on the opening point and on break point.         
	After holding to 2-0, Djokovic then had four break points in the third game, but Berdych was able to hold on and stay in the set.         
	Djokovic, however, broke again in the final game of the first set and then added another in the second game of the second.         
	Berdych has lost four of the five matches he has played against Djokovic, but his one victory came in this years Wimbledon         
	In doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi of India and Max Mirnyi of Belarus beat Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Oliver Marach of Austria 7-6 (2), 6-4.         
	On Sunday night, Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy lost their opening match to Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. The sixth-seeded Polish duo got the better of the Indo-Czech third-seeded pair 3-6, 6-7 (3).

                                                                                                                       7                                      Cesar scare for Brazil 
                      
	Harare: Brazil enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 victory over Zimbabwe on Wednesday in their penultimate warm-up match. Goals from Michel Bastos, Robinho and Elano gave Brazil coach Dunga plenty to smile about but an injury to goalkeeper Julio Cesar marred his afternoon.         
	In Covilha, Cameroon striker Samuel Eto was sent off during a 3-1 defeat by Portugal. Portugal eased to victory with two goals by Raul Meireles and one from Nani.         
	Capello to stay         
	London: Fabio Capello will remain as England coach until 2012, the Football Association (FA) said in a statement on Wednesday. The Italian had been linked in Italian and British newspapers with the vacant managers job at Inter Milan.         
	Bone of contention         
	Johannesburg: If Sebenzile Nsukwinis bones are anything to go by, the World Cup is going to pass off without a hitch and hosts South Africa are destined for great things.         
	Eish, it is looking very good for South Africa, the 33-year-old Zulu witch-doctor said after casting her eyes over a seemingly random scattering of animal bones and sea shells.         
	Suazo blow         
	Santiago: Striker Humberto Suazo seems certain to miss Chiles first match at the World Cup after suffering a hamstring injury. Medical reports released said Suazo may need up to three weeks to recover.

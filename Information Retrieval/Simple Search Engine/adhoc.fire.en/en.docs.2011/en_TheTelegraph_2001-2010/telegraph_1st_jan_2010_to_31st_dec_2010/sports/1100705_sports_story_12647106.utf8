The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Howard: No one country should dominate ICC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Howard: No one country should dominate ICC
                      
	Melbourne: John Howard refuses to blame India for scuttling his bid for the ICC vice-presidents job but the former Australia Prime Minister feels international crickets financial powerhouse should not be allowed to dominate affairs like it does right now.         
	We have to be careful of making India some kind of target of disdain in world cricket, Howard said when asked whether he considers India the primary reason for losing out on the crucial Afro-Asian support for his bid.         
	(But) I think it is very important we understand theres got to be a fair sharing of responsibilities and no one part of the world, no one country, should dominate.         
	People in the past criticised the fact it was dominated by England and Australia and now we dont want to replace one perceived domination with another, he told a TV channel.         
	That in a way is why the ICC put in place this rotation system and thats one of the issues CA have got to take into account when it responds to what has happened.         
	Howard said he still wants the job but it is up to Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket to consider whether he should be re-nominated.         
	Id like the job but at this stage its hit a roadblock, and what happens from now on is really CAs call, its not about me, its about the future of the game, Howard said.         
	I went into this because I love cricket very much and I had the time to devote to it and the energy and the commitment, but what happens from now on CA and New Zealand Cricket have been asked to re-nominate and they obviously separately and together will meet and talk about the situation, he added.         
	Howard once again expressed his disappointment at being rejected for the job and hoped CA would work out a conciliatory formula.         
	Theyve got to pay regard to whats happened, given that we had apparently put in place a procedure for choosing by rotation the president and vice-president of the ICC, and that appears to have been pushed to one side in the last week, he said.

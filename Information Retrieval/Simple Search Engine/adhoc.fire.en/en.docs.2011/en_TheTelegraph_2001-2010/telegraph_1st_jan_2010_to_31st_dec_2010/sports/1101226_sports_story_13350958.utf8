    The PCB chief operating officer, Subhan Ahmed, said on Saturday he had approached the IPL last week to clarify the status of Pakistan players in the lucrative Indian domestic league, ldquo;but we have yet to hear from them. rdquo;
    The IPL has issued a list of players to be auctioned in January but it did not include any Pakistani cricketers.   No evidence 
    Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has found no evidence of match-fixing in the Asian Games cricket match between the Pakistan A team and Afghanistan which the latter won unexpectedly to qualify for the final in China last month.
  A senior official of the board dismissed accusations made by the President of a cricket club in Islamabad that the match was fixed and that Pakistan had deliberately lost the game on the behest of former Pakistan captain, Rashid Latif who is chief coach of the Afghanistan team.   PCB ready 
    Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday announced that it would be playing more major home series at neutral venues because of the refusal of teams to play in Pakistan because of the security situation.
  The PCB said the England and Wales Cricket Board had confirmed a full series in early 2012 but it would most probably be played at venues in the United Arab Emirates. 
    BCCI faces flak 
    Panaji: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was on Saturday accused of turning a blind eye towards the alleged forgery of the birth certificate of the son of Goa Cricket Association rsquo;s (GCA) former vice president, Dayanand Narvekar.
  Shekhar Salkar, a former GCA executive member who has filed a police complaint against Narvekar and his family members, said the BCCI had discovered the forgery two years back, but did not take appropriate action.   Modi relief
    Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Saturday stayed the proceedings of BCCI disciplinary committee probing allegations of financial irregularities against former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi till January 10 next year.   IHF hits back

    London: The London 2012 organisers say two million people have registered for tickets to the Olympics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC to study new format
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC to study new format
                      
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) CEO Haroon Lorgat said ICC will closely watch the split-innings experiment with the one-day format in Australia next year even though it is confident that the 50-over game will survive in its present guise.         
	Lorgat hoped the 2011 World Cup to be held in the sub-continent would prove that the 50-over format needs no tinkering but made it cleat that ICC was open-minded about the issue.         
	We havent talked about changing that format, Lorgat said, ruling out any immediate change in the format. We will see how the 2011 event unfolds and Im very confident that you will see an excellent World Cup which means we wouldnt tamper with it for 2015.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Hunger drives Mathews
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Two of Angelo Mathewss teammates in the Sri Lankan team  Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene  will be his opponents when the Kolkata Knight Riders lock horns with the Kings XI Punjab on Sunday.         
	And to Mathewss credit, his show in this Indian Premier League has been much more impressive than his more illustrious compatriots.         
	Asked what was the secret behind his good performance, the all-rounder said: I think it is the hunger to do well that drives me. But then, it doesnt mean that the others do not have that hunger. They are good all-round players and will certainly do well. The important thing is you need to make use of the opportunities. I think I have done that.         
	The wickets here are not much different from those in Sri Lanka and that helps. But T20 is a funny game. The important thing is to hold your nerves, he added.         
	So far, while Sangakkara and Jayawardene have scored 136 (avg. 22.66) and 102 (avg. 17.00) respectively, Mathews have totalled a creditable 121 (avg. 24.20). He has also picked up eight wickets for his team.

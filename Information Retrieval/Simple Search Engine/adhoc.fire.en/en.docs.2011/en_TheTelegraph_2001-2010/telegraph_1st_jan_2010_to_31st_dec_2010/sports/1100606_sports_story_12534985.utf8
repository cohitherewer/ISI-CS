  - Chandimal hits 111 as SL thrash India by 6 wickets             Chandimal in Harare, on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	Harare: A sloppy India crashed out of the tri-series after Sri Lanka, riding on Dinesh Chandimals maiden century, thumped them by six wickets in a crucial match here Saturday.         
	Tottering on the brink of disaster after their back-to-back defeats against Zimbabwe, India badly needed to win this match with a big margin to keep alive their final hopes but they could not pull off a repeat performance of their previous encounter with the Lankans and went down with 1.4 overs to spare.         
	This is the third time in the last ten years that India have failed to reach the final of a tri-nation tournament.         
	Chandimals 118-ball 111, which included six fours and five sixes, knocked the stuffing out of Indias feeble bowling attack as Sri Lanka cruised to 270 for four in 48.2 overs.         
	Mondays Sri Lanka-Zimbabawe match is now rendered inconsequential and they would meet again in Wednesdays final at the same venue.         
	Earlier, put into bat, India had posted 268 for nine with Virat Kohli (68), Yusuf Pathan (44) and R. Ashwin (38) scoring bulk of the runs.         
	Desperate for a win, India effected three changes in the squad  bringing in the uncapped trio of Naman Ojha, Pankaj Singh and R Ashwin while leaving out Murali Vijay, Umesh Yadav and Amit Mishra  but the win remained elusive.         
	Sri Lankas chase got off to a brisk start with Tillekaratne Dilshan (21) looking in his element before he fell to Ashok Dinda in the sixth over.         
	Chandimal joined Upul Tharanga (27) in the middle and looked quite at ease against the Indian attack.         
	Even after Tharanga fell to Ashwin, Chandimal continued the good work in company of Chamara Kapugedera (42). He used his feet well against the spinners and never allowed the Indian bowlers to dictate terms. Chandimal smote Pankaj Singh over mid-on, greeted Pragyan Ojha with a six and twice hit Ashwin out of the ground.

	London: Saina Nehwal lost in straight games to Tine Rasmussen of the Netherlands in the semi-finals of the womens singles, and bowed out of the All England Super Series Badminton Championship here Saturday.         
	Saina became the first Indian woman to reach the last-four stage of the prestigious tournament but her journey was cut short by Rasmussen, who beat her 21-19, 21-17 in a 37-minute on-court battle.         
	Down 1-5 in the first game, Saina picked up four straight points to make it 5-5 and then moved neck and neck till 19-19, but Rasmussen had the last laugh as she sealed the game with the next two points.         
	In the second game, the world No. 7 Indian had raced to a narrow 3-1 lead, but the Dane soon surged ahead at 9-4 and held the fort as Sainas game crumbled.         
	Earlier, Saina had beaten German Juliane 21-8, 21-14 in just 27 minutes to reach the semi-finals at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham.           (PTI)

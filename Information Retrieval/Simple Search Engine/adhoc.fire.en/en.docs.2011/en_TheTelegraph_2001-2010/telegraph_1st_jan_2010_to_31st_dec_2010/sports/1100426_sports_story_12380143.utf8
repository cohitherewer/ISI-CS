            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashim Biswas and Joshimar at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Chirag United were a step closer Sunday to making history after moving to the top of the CFL Premier Division league table with a 2-1 defeat of Mohammedan Sporting in their 13th round encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium. The win took Chirags points tally to 33  same as Mohun Bagans  but Joshimar and company are on top with better goal difference.         
	With two matches left, Chirag are now in with a realistic chance of being the first team outside the Big Three (Bagan, East Bengal, Mohammedan Sporting) to win the top tier in the local league since Eastern Railway took the first division title, way back in 1958.         
	Sundays encounter was marred by erratic supervision from referee Pradeep Mukherjee. He issued marching orders to as many as three players  Mohammed Saqib, Lucky Imran of Sporting and Mathew Grbesa of Chirag. While Imrans straight red, after kicking Shankar Oraon, was justified, the decisions on Saqib and Mathew raise questions.         
	The match will however be remembered for a superlative match winner from veteran Chirag striker Ashim Biswas.         
	The tie was into its 59th minute then. Subhashis Roy Chowdhury took a corner which was headed on at the near post by Denson Devadas before being headed in turn by Mathew at the far post.         
	Ashim, who had his back towards the opposition goal, turned in a flash and suddenly went airborne to unleash a side-volley that went in.         
	Had Oraon and Joshimar been a bit more alert upfront, Chirag could have increased the tally.         
	Earlier, in the first half, Chirag went ahead in the 39th minute when Joshimar was brought down by Sarfaraz Khan. The Brazilian scored his 13th goal of the tournament from the resultant spot kick.         
	In the 44th minute, Nilendra Dewans sudden crack caught Chirag keeper Sandip Nandy unawares as the ball dipped at the last moment with the goalie out of position.         
	Dipendu Biswas could have equalised in the 64th minute but the veteran strikers volley hit the horizontal.         
	Teams

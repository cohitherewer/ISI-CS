The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The worst vote may decide Englands fate
                                                                                                                       7                                      The worst vote may decide Englands fate
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	A voter from Papua New Guinea, the joint-worst nation in world football, could decide the fate of Englands World Cup bid this week.         
	David Chung, the vice-president of the 11-nation Oceania Football Confederation, hails from a nation ranked joint 203rd in the world alongside San Marino, Anguilla, Montserrat and American Samoa, but was on his way to Zurich on Sunday hoping to take a seat on the Fifa executive committee that will choose the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts on Thursday.         
	Chung is hoping to replace Reynald Temarii, the OFC president, who was banned for a year by Fifa after a Sunday Times investigation.         
	If Temarii withdraws his appeal and stands down from the OFC Chung may take the seat by right, meaning 23 people will vote on the bids. Fifa offered no clarification of the issue.         
	Meanwhile, Qatari ex-co Mohamed Bin Hammam denied on Sunday that he had given an interview promising his vote to Spain-Portugal.         
	Bin Hammam has been at the centre of persistent allegations of collusion between the two bids, and was quoted by Spanish newspaper Marca last week saying that he would support the Iberian bid.         
	The story was even carried on his personal website, but Bin Hammam denied having given the interview and described the story as unethical resistance.         
	The Asian executive committee had taken a decision to support Europe in 2018. However no decision was taken to back any one country.         
	We agreed to give the four Asian members the freedom to select the country they deem appropriate.

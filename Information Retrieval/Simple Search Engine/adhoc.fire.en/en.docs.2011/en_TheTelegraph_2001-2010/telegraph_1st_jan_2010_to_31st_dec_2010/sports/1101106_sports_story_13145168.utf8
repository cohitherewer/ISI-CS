The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Old foes ready for new battle
                                                                                                                       7                                        Old foes ready for new battle
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Subrata Bhattacharya                           
	New Delhi: When Chirag United meet JCT in the Durand Cup final on Sunday, two top players of yesteryears would try to outwit each other from the sidelines.         
	The Calcutta team is coached by Subrata Bhattacharya, while JCT are managed by former India captain and midfielder Parminder Singh.         
	To regular visitors at the Ambedkar Stadium, Bhattacharya and Parminder still remain bigger stars than many of the present day footballers.         
	Fans fondly remember how the two players won 11 Durand Cup titles in their heydays, with Bhattacharya alone accounting for eight triumphs for Mohun Bagan in the 70s and 80s.         
	Things have changed, rued Bhattacharya. In our days, packed stands used to watch the contests between the Calcutta and Punjab teams.         
	JCT were a crack side with players like Inder Singh and Parminder, who had great individual skills.         
	The present JCT side is talented but these boys are yet to achieve that status.         
	Parminder was a classy midfielder, who played with lots of individual skills, continued Bhattacharya.         
	He used to cover a lot of area, had the ability to provide good through passes, and his sudden long rangers were simply dangerous, he said.         
	The Chirag coach is now busy plotting JCTs downfall in Sundays final. He is aware of how historic it would be for the Calcutta team to win the Durand and is trying to gauge the strength and weakness of the rivals.         
	Except for the IFA Shield in 2005, Chirag have never made the final of an all-India tournament before.         
	I played with a strategy against East Bengal and it clicked, said Bhattacharya. My advantage is that we have a bunch of players who are dedicated and have the urge to take the extra load on the field. The way two youngsters, (Mohammed) Rafique and Asif (K) played against East Bengal, they simply made me proud.         
	On the Diwali day, the players were in a relaxed mood at the Chirag camp. The boys were taken for a short tour of Delhi and had a luncheon meeting with the club sponsors.         
	The coach said the team will go for the practice session on Saturday.         
	Parminder, too, agrees with his counterpart that the prospect of a Bengal-Punjab Durand Cup final does not attract the fans any more.         
	Perhaps the spectators are not happy with the skills of the present lot. If you ask me, Bengal doesnt produce a defender like Manoranjan (Bhattacharya) or Subrata any more. They were solid players, capable of playing international football.         
	If JCT win Sundays final, Parminder says it will be a victory for Punjabs football policy.         
	We do not believe in hiring players from outside the state to win trophies. Except the foreigners, all the boys in my team are local players, groomed by JCT. They are all youngsters but have the quality to stage a coup on the big stage.         
	Bhattacharya has bagged one Durand Cup as the Mohun Bagan coach in 2000. Parminder, an AFC A license holder, had remained Sukhwinder Singhs understudy for a long time before taking over early this year.         
	The final against Chirag United would be his best chance to prove himself in a different role.

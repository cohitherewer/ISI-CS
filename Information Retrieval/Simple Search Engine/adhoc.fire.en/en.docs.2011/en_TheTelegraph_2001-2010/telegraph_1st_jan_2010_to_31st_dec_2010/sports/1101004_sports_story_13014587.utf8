The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are confident, not complacent: Jayanta
                                                                                                                       7                                      We are confident, not complacent: Jayanta
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The South Koreans may not be there to torment the Dola Banerjees and Jayanta Talukdars but the Indian archers are not taking anything for granted when they begin their quest for gold, at the Yamuna Sports Complex, here on Monday.         
	The mens team are ranked world No. 1 in the recurve category but still they are wary of the English, the Canadians and Australians. We are confident but not complacent, Talukdar said on Sunday.         
	With the compound no longer part of the Olympic Games, the Indians hardly give importance to the section. However, in the Commonwealth, compound is very much part of the scheme and England, Australia and Canada will definitely like to add a few medals there.         
	Compound is no longer our forte but I am sure we will give it a try, Dola said on Sunday.         
	Meanwhile, in table tennis, Indian mens and womens team were handed easy draws.         
	The second-seeded and defending champions India men have been clubbed with Guyana, Vanuatu and Dominica in Group B.         
	India should find it easy to enter the next stage of the event which has total 26 teams participating. Singapore have been given top billing.         
	The Indian womens team would have to fight it out against New Zealand. However, the Poulami Ghatak-led Indian teams expected to dominate their matches against Sri Lanka and Ghana in Group D.         
	The women have been seeded fourth in the Delhi Games.

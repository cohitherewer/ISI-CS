The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Randiv did it deliberately, says a disappointed Viru
                                                                                                                       7                                      Randiv did it deliberately, says a disappointed Viru
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Virender Sehwag had every reason to feel disappointed after he was left stranded on 99 despite a huge hit off Suraj Randiv for a sixer that was not counted eventually.         
	Although India comfortably beat Sri Lanka by six wickets, thereby earning a bonus point, it was the final delivery of the match that has stirred up a controversy.         
	In a bid to deny Sehwag his 13th ODI hundred, Randiv bowled a giant no ball and Sehwags six counted for zilch.         
	So huge was the no-ball that Randivs back foot was also close to over-stepping. It was a surprise, especially coming from someone who hasnt bowled a single no ball in Tests and ODIs this season.         
	Although Sehwag tried his best to hide the disappointment, he stated in no uncertain terms that it had been a deliberate no ball from Randiv to deny him a hundred.         
	Rival captain Kumar Sangakkara tried to play down the issue.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony he maintained that he was unaware of any wrongdoing but, when pressed by reporters later, the Lanka captain said that he would have a word with Randiv to find out whether he did it deliberately.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Of course, it was a good win. Especially, if you are fielding first on this track. The bowlers really did well for us. Praveen (Kumar) and Ashish (Nehra) started really well and were backed by Ishant Sharma. The spinners (Pragyan Ojha and Ravindra Jadeja) too bowled well. Their efforts should be praised even more considering they bowled on a wicket that was hardly assisting spinners. They rarely bowled loose deliveries... I would also like to praise Dinesh Karthiks effort.         
	One might look at the scoreboard and find that he has scored only 10 but, importantly, he consumed a lot of deliveries (35). It was important to hang around during the initial overs after which stroke making became easier. Karthik, and later Raina, did a good job of supporting Sehwag.         
	We always had the bonus point in mind. Sehwag is an experienced cricketer, having played a lot of one-day cricket, including league cricket in Delhi. He is the kind of player who will take the pressure off from his partner.         
	I realised that during my second series against Pakistan. Its always enjoyable to bat in Sehwags company. However, I would like to maintain that this is a pitch where it helps if you are batting first. 225 is a competitive total on this wicket.         
	I have been losing a few tosses but I dont mind losing tosses as long as I am winning matches. But, I feel that I will win a few tosses in the upcoming matches.         
	Sangakkara: Well, I am not aware whether Randiv bowled a no-ball deliberately. He is not that kind of a cricketer. If some members of the team have coaxed him, I will take it up strongly. This is not the spirit of cricket. They bowled very well and we batted pretty badly.         
	There were no partnerships and no top-order batsmen played a big innings. After that Sehwag delivered. Although we created pressure by reducing India to 32 for three, Viru batted exceptionally well to take them home.         
	On this track, 230-240 is a challenging score. Now we have lost two bonus points in two matches. So we are in a spot of bother. We have to get back to the drawing board and get our basics right.         
	Virender Sehwag: These things happen in cricket. Bowlers try to bowl wides or no-balls when batsmen are on 99. They do not want them to score a century... But that is fair enough...         
	Also, I think he (Randiv) has done it deliberately... If a player is on 99, it does not mean you bowl a no ball and give away four byes. That has no place in good cricket.         
	(So) why was a no ball bowled. It was not a small margin no ball but one that was a foot long. I dont know whether the captain was consulted or someone else However, it doesnt matter whether I score a century or not.         
	What is most important is that we have won the match. I believe if one is patient on this track, scoring runs is not difficult.         
	Even 240 is achievable. May be if you score 250-260, it can get difficult.

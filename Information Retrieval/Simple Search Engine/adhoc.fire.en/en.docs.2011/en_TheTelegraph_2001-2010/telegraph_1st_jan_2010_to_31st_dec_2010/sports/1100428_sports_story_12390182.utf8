	Lyon: Croatian striker Ivica Olics superb hattrick fired Bayern Munich into their first Champions League final since 2001, after the German side demolished Olympique Lyon 3-0 here Tuesday.         
	Three clinical finishes from Olic helped the four time European champions complete a 4-0 aggregate semi-final success at Stade Gerland.         
	Olic netted the first goal after 26 minutes with a neat turn and shot, smashed in a pass from Hamit Altintop after 67 minutes and completed his hattrick with a header 12 minutes from time. Lyon finished the game with 10 men after centre back Cris was sent off at the stroke of an hour.

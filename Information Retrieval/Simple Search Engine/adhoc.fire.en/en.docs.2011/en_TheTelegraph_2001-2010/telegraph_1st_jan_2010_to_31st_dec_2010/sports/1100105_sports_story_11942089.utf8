The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India hope to maintain run, Dilshan doubtful
                                                                                                                       7                                        India hope to maintain run, Dilshan doubtful

	Mirpur: In-form India hope to maintain their winning run when they take on Sri Lanka in their opening match of the tri-series here Tuesday.         
	India defeated Sri Lanka with consummate ease in a three-match Test series (2-0) in India late last year, and then pocketed the five-match ODI series 3-1. With the Lankans fielding a depleted side for the series, also involving hosts Bangladesh, a win Tuesday should not be a difficult task for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co.         
	Barely a month after becoming the No.1 Test team, India would be aiming for the top spot in one-dayers as well, with just Australia ahead of them. If India can keep a clean slate in the tri-series and Pakistan beat Australia comprehensively in the forthcoming five-match ODI series Down Under, India would become No.1.         
	The Indians had a successful 2009 with four series wins, including two against Sri Lanka. However, they lost to Australia at home and were knocked out of the Champions Trophy in the group stage. So consistency is something India would be looking to maintain this year. Batting has been Indias strong point in recent times, and Sachin Tendulkars absence  he has opted out of the tournament  would hardly make a difference.         
	The return of Yuvraj Singh, who missed the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka due to injury, will also strengthen the already formidable Indian middle order. The stylish left-hander had a long batting session during nets Monday, under the watchful eyes of coach Gary Kirsten.         
	Harbhajan Singh didnt attend the nets, but there is no cause for worry.         
	In Tendulkars absence, in-form Gautam Gambhir will partner Sehwag at the top of the order. The Delhi duo would be looking to provide a strong start to the Indian innings.         
	The bowling department has also been strengthened by the return of pacer Sreesanth, who has fully recovered from swine flu.         
	Sri Lanka, meanwhile, are worried by a hamstring injury to Tillekaratne Dilshan.         
	The Lankans are grappling with a spate of injuries to key players and now run the risk of losing Dilshan, who scripted Lankas convincing seven-wicket victory against Bangladesh Monday, smashing a brilliant 104.         
	He did not look too great out there and we are keeping our fingers crossed, hoping he will be fit enough to play at some point in the tournament, Sangakkara said after the match at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium.         
	It is a magnificent start to the New Year. Everyone is keen to do well but at the same we have lot of injuries. Anything more than this (Dilshans injury), we might not be able to field the team, he said.         
	The Lankan captain said the dew factor also played a big role in deciding the outcome of the match as Bangladesh were in a disadvantageous position while bowling second.         
	I have never seen dew like this. It was a great toss to win in hindsight. I would not want to field in these conditions, and my bowlers would not like to bowl, Sangakkara said.         
	They are already without Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews.

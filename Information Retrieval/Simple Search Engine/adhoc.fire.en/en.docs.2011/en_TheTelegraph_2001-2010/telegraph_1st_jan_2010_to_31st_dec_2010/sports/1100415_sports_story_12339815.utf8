The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rhodes game if its for fun
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rhodes game if its for fun
                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians fielding coach Jonty Rhodes retired from the game in 2003 but the South African legend does not mind getting back on it, as long as its for fun.         
	I love my cricket. I would love to be on the pitch only as long as it is fun. I dont want to get involved in serious stuff, the former South Africa cricketer told reporters on Wednesday.         
	Rhodes, who Wednesday took the field during a promotional match between the Mumbai Indians and Team Youngistan at Brabourne, said the encounter had been an experience to remember.         
	It was great to be back. The CCI has some great memories for me. I had a wonderful game here in 1993.         
	As the Mumbai Indians fielding coach, we had a good tournament and have been very successful in our home games here.         
	Good to be back here after retiring from the game in 2003.         
	It was good fun, Rhodes, one of the best fielders the game has seen, said.         
	Talking about his rivals in the promotional match, who were selected through a contest held by PepsiCo earlier this year, he said, they were a bit like me... a bit rusty.         
	But they cleared the boundary a few times. It was all about fun. The eight-over a side match was won by the IPL franchisee by three runs.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SC reserves verdict in Srinivasan case
                                                                                                                       7                                      SC reserves verdict in Srinivasan case
            OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan to explain whether it could ignore A.C. Muthiahs petition alleging conflict of interest arising from him holding on to the post of an administrator while at the same time being an IPL franchise owner.         
	The apex court, which is hearing an appeal against a Madras High Court order declining to prevent Srinivasan from contesting the post of president in the September 29 elections, was responding to his claim that Muthiahs plea was prompted by a personal grievance and hence was mala fide.         
	Srinivasans lawyer R.F. Nariman contended that the court cannot ignore the intent with which Muthiah had filed the petition. Drawing attention to the dates, Nariman contended said that the amendment that Muthiah was complaining about was passed well before the elections to the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA), which Muthiah had contested and lost.         
	He complained only after he lost the elections, Nariman argued, driving home the point that Muthiahs plea was mala fide and should hence be dismissed. The court has to examine the intent with which a person has filed a civil suit, Nariman insisted, before taking a call on his case.         
	Should we focus on the cause he (Muthiah) has raised or should be go by his intent, Justice Gyansudha Mishra wondered, shortly before close of arguments. The court will now deliver its judgement on Muthiahs plea.

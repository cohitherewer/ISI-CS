            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has set a base price of Rs 2.25 crore per match while inviting bids to sponsor the senior mens team for a four-year period, beginning with the 2010-2011 season.         
	The BCCIs tender notice, which also invited bids for sponsoring the India A, India Under-19 and the womens teams, opened on Monday.         
	The deadline for bids closes on May 29. The bids would be opened and awarded at the Boards marketing committee meeting here on May 31.         
	The Boards current deal with Sahara as Team India sponsors comes to an end in June this year.         
	The deal with Sahara, bagged at Rs 400 crore for a four-year period, ended December 2009 but was extended for further six months after BCCIs tender failed to evoke any response.         
	The set base price applies to Test matches, ODIs and T20Is. Although the International Cricket Council was yet to announce its Future Tours Programme beyond 2012, the BCCI did not see that as an impediment in attracting the sponsors.         
	Meanwhile, the Board seems to have closed the chapter on the seven players who were issued show cause notice for their involvement in an incident during the ICC World T20 Championship in the West Indies earlier this month.         
	Its an internal matter of the Board. Whether the players gave a reply or not, or what they replied, we are not going to discuss it in the media, a top BCCI official said.         
	The players, including Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, were show caused on May 18 and given seven days time to reply.         
	Three others  Murali Vijay, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja  are scheduled to leave with the Indian team on Tuesday for Zimbabwe where they would play a tri-series (May 28-June 9).         
	Piyush Chawla, was to join them for two T20Is against the hosts (June 12 and 13) later.

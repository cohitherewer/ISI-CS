The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF unruffled by Bobs plan
                                                                                                                       7                                      AIFF unruffled by Bobs plan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	 New Delhi: The news of chief national coach Bob Houghton planning to quit after the Asia Cup hasnt really left the officials of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) perturbed.         
	On Tuesday, the British coach expressed his desire to quit, for the second time in six months, if his side did not produce a good show in January.         
	Hinting that he may call it a day despite having a contract till 2013, Houghton said in an interview to a Dubai-based newspaper: You have to be realistic, if India goes out of the Asia Cup with no points theres going to be an enormous outcry to sack the coach. Sometimes decisions are taken out of your hands.         
	To be honest, it might be time for someone else, Houghton said when asked if there was anything left to do with the team since winning two Nehru Cups (2007 and 2009) and qualifying for the 2011 Asia Cup.         
	Though most of the AIFF brass remained tight-lipped, one official felt it was yet another attempt by the coach to pressurise the federation. In May, he (Houghton) threatened to quit and put us under great pressure to increase his salary and extend the contract. Knowing well India are in a tough group in Asia Cup, he may be using the same tactics again to wriggle out of the situation.         
	Sources, however, confirmed that senior AIFF officials are already trying to find a way out to get rid of the coach as he is proving to be too expensive. A below par show in the Asia Cup may be used as a ploy to replace Houghton as the national coach.

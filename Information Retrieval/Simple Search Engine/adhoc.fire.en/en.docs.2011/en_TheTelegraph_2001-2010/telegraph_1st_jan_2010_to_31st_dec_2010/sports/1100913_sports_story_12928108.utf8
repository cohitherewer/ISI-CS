  - Wont watch the final... Will spend time with my kids: Roger       Christopher Clarey             Roger Federer after losing to Novak Djokovic, on Saturday                                 
	New York: Heart. Guts. They are essential elements for a tennis star. But somehow, despite emerging from war-ravaged Serbia and leaving his family at age 12 to become a champion, Novak Djokovic has faced questions about them as he has settled into a supporting role behind two of the greatest players in history.         
	But there was duress aplenty deep in the fifth set of his semi-final, on Saturday, at the US Open.         
	It was too much for a man lacking in heart or guts to bear, and it would have been no surprise if Djokovic had stepped to the baseline  with two match points to save on his serve at 4-5, 15-40  and cracked.         
	Instead Djokovic bounced (and bounced) the ball, reared back and willed himself to a better place.         
	Less than 20 minutes later, not long after pounding his chest with his racket, he finished off a 5-7, 6-1, 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 victory that not only broke up the Rafa-Roger dream final but  win or lose in Sundays final  also redefined Djokovic for a global audience.         
	Its one of those matches that you will remember for the rest of your life, Djokovic said .         
	Among the spectators, there was as much chatter about Federer-Nadal as the match in front of them. I would have loved to play against him here, said Federer, who has played Nadal in the finals of the other three Grand Slam tournaments. I mean, I did my hard yards the last six years making it to the finals, and he was unfortunately never there. Thats obviously disappointing, and now one point away from this happening, obviously its a bit of a disappointment.         
	I wont watch the match. Look, Ive been around tennis for weeks and weeks and weeks right now. Last thing I want to do is watch another tennis match where Im not a part. I will spend time with my kids and take it easy, may be go shopping.         
	 During the critical exchanges down the stretch, the second-seeded Federer applied plenty of pressure, forcing Djokovic to come up with something special.         
	I just knew I have to be patient and not lose my emotions too much, because that was the case in the past where I was losing the momentum with him, Djokovic said.

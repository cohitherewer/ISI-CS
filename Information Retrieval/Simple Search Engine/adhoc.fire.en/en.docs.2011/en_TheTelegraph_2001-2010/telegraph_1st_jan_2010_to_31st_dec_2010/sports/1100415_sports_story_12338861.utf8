	Chelsea increased their stranglehold on the Premier League title on Tuesday after a 1-0 victory against Bolton Wanderers opened up a four-point lead at the top over Manchester United. But Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, will be fuming when he sees the television replays that show Chelsea were fortunate not to have had two penalties awarded against them, both for handball.         
	Matt Taylors free kick appeared to strike the left hand of Didier Drogba as he jumped with Kevin Davies in the penalty area after 28 minutes. Bolton did not protest, but they were furious that a strong appeal for a spot kick was turned down by Lee Probert, the referee, when John Terry appeared to use his left arm to block Lee Chung Yongs cross early in the second half.         
	We didnt get any luck tonight (Wednesday), Owen Coyle, the Bolton manager, complained. We had two stonewall penalties. Drogba can play volleyball for anyone and Terry must have a shoulder than stretches to his ankles.         
	Fergusons prediction that it would be an easy game for Chelsea proved incorrect. The match was won by the slimmest of margins through Nicolas Anelkas header. Fergusons psychological plan had the desired effect in motivating Boltons players that little bit more, but it also managed to concentrate Chelseas minds in the nervous late stages.         
	Chelsea know that three wins from their four remaining matches will be enough to claim the title for the fir st time since 2006. They have overturned a four-point deficit in recent weeks, helped by victory at Old Trafford, and have a superior goal difference to Fergusons team.         
	The United manager may not have waved the white flag yet, but it would take an horrendous slip-up from Chelsea  or an extraordinary run from Arsenal  to deny them.         
	Anelka nodded in Drogbas left-wing cross at the end of a laboured opening half, rewarding Ancelotti for his decision to play the two together for the first time in seven matches in all competitions. It was the France forwards first goal in 14 matches, although the architect was the outstanding Yuri Zhirkov, who had returned to the pitch moments earlier after having stitches in a head wound.         
	Salomon Kalou, put through by Drogba, should have eased the tension further soon after half-time, but his shot was pushed away by Jussi Jaaskelainen.         
	United can exert some pressure on Chelsea if they can defeat Manchester City on Saturday, before the leaders play at White Hart Lane later in the evening. Chelseas remaining fixtures are at home to Stoke City, away to Liverpool  who will be recovering from their second leg of their Europa League semi-final  and at home to Wigan Athletic. United also meet Tottenham and Stoke during the run-in.         
	Chelsea made three changes Tuesday to the side who reached the FA Cup Final with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. Avram Grant, the Portsmouth manager, who guided Chelsea to the Champions League final in 2008, stands in the way of a possible Double, which would be Chelseas first.         
	Lets make history, Ancelotti said in the match-day programme. We are in a good position to win two trophies but we have not won anything yet and we will not to do that this week. There is hard work for us to do and nobody here will get distracted.           THE TIMES, LONDON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No approach from a bookie in last two years, at least: BCCI
                                                                                                                       7                                        No approach from a bookie in last two years, at least: BCCI
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Anil Kumble and his company will be educating the India cricketers                           
	Calcutta: Irfan Pathans encounter with a suspected bookie, at the Sheraton in Karachi, on the 2005-06 tour, seems to be a one-off for Indias cricketers.         
	After the match-fixing scandal of 2000, that is. Ive been in office for two years and I can categorically say that in this period, at least, no player has come to the BCCI saying that hed been approached by a bookie, president Shashank Manohar told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Speaking from his Nagpur residence on the day the International Cricket Council (ICC) launched an investigation into Fridays ODI at The Brit Oval, he added: Unless a cricketer reports something unwarranted, we have to take it that nobody has been contacted by bookies.         
	The BCCIs chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, too, said that he wasnt aware of any India player reporting an approach from a bookie.         
	Its definitely good news, but a gentleman associated with the monitoring process made an interesting observation.         
	His take: One has to believe the India cricketers, but I do find it odd that they dont get contacted by bookies... There is, after all, some India connection in every scandal...         
	Apparently, after Pathan, no India player has notified the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) of an unwarranted approach.         
	Its mandatory to immediately report such happenings.         
	Manohar, meanwhile, confirmed that former India captain Anil Kumbles company (Tenvic) would educate the India cricketers on a number of issues, including the need to stay miles away from dubious characters such as bookies.         
	Ive already given my okay... Ive asked Kumble to sit with the secretary (Narayanswamy Srinivasan) and work out the specifics... The needful should be done soon, he pointed out.         
	Kumble, at present, is in South Africa. As for Srinivasan, hes focused on Tuesdays hearing in the Supreme Court and the BCCIs AGM, in Mumbai, later this month.         
	Clearly, then, theres no point expecting any movement forward in the next couple of weeks.         
	The lessons imparted by Kumble (who has an envy-inviting image) and the experts shortlisted by his company will complement the work done by the ACSU.         
	Or, the work supposed to be done by them.         
	Standard practice is for the ACSU personnel to extensively brief debutants. This has been in vogue for some years, but its obvious that everybody hasnt been getting the message.         
	No surprise, therefore, that the ICC intends reviewing a good many things  including the process of educating the players.

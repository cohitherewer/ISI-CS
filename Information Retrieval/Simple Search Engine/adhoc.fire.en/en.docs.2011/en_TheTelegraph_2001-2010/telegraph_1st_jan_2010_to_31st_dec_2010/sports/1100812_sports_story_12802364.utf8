The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goalline technology is now on Fifa agenda
                                                                                                                       7                                      Goalline technology is now on Fifa agenda
                      
	Singapore: The issue of goalline technology is on the agenda for the International Football Association Board (IFAB)s October meeting, Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Wednesday.         
	Blatter told a news conference in Singapore that IFAB, the body responsible for determining the rules of the sport, had agreed in their July meeting to put the issue on their agenda for their official gathering in Wales from Oct. 19 to 20.         
	At this meeting (in October), we will bring the point of goalline technology, Blatter said, adding, It is now on the agenda.         
	The debate on the use of technology was raised again when Englands Frank Lampard was denied a goal in their World Cup second round defeat to Germany in June, despite television replays showing the ball clearly crossing the goalline.         
	Soccer remains one of the few major sports to resist the use of technology, with tennis, cricket, rugby, NBA basketball and American football, all using applied science successfully.         
	Blatter said that he was in favour of using technology to rule on such contentious decisions providing it was reliable. My personal opinion on goal technology has never changed. I have said if we have an accurate and simple system then we will implement but so far we have not had a simple, nor an accurate system.         
	IFAB decided in July to expand their use of two additional referees officiating matches with the method also being employed in the Champions League and the Uefa Super Cup this season, after it debuted in the Europa League last year.         
	The 74-year-old, flanked by AFC president Mohamed bin Hammam, Fifa executive committee member Chung Mong-joon and Singapore FA president Zainudin Nordin, said that a number of groups would be able to present their solutions at the meeting.

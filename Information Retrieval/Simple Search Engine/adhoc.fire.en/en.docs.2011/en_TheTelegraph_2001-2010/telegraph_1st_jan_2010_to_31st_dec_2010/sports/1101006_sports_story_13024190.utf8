	New Delhi: Usain Bolt and Asafa Powells absence have left the mens 100 metre struggling for relevancy but this gives a new breed of athletes a chance to make a name for themselves as the athletics event of the Commonwealth Games, kicks off at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	In Bolt and Powells absence, an Antiguan Daniel Bailey  would have been the favourite for the title but he too pulled out at the last moment. The pullouts should give Englands Mark Lewis-Francis a reason to smile about. Lewis-Francis, who won silver in the European Championships in July, is now a favourite for the title.         
	The first of the 52 track and field gold medals will be decided on the opening day, with the mens 5,000m and womens javelin at stake.         
	Wednesday will also see the womens 400m heats and mens shot put qualifying.         
	South African champion Sunette Viljoen is the clear favourite to defend her javelin title after throwing an impressive 66.38m this year. Australias Kimberley Mickle and Englands Laura Whittingham are also both 60m throwers this year.         
	The track and field competition spans nine days but the top names are few and far between.         
	As well as Bolt and Powell, other withdrawals include Englands marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, who gave birth to her second child last month, and world and European heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis.                 
	English Olympic 400m gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu, world triple jump champion Phillips Idowu and Australias world discus champion Dani Samuels all opted out amid dengue and security fears.         
	Kenyas David Rudisha, who broke the world 13-year-old 800m mark in Berlin in August, and smashed it for a second time a week later, is also skipping the event, citing fatigue. Recently, world 800m champion Caster Semenya also pulled out.         
	South Africa will be looking to Commonwealth champions Elizna Naude (discus), Viljoen (javelin) and LJ van Zyl (400m hurdles).         
	Australia have a 57-strong team, spearheaded by Commonwealth, Olympic and world pole vault champion Steve Hooker. He is one of 10 track and field athletes defending a Commonwealth Games title.         
	The Australian mens and womens 4x400m relay teams will also defend their titles while Tamsyn Lewis (4x400m relay) has been picked for her fifth Commonwealth squad.         
	England have an experienced team in Delhi including newly-crowned European 110m hurdles champion Andy Turner.         
	Kenya appear ready to step up and disturb the traditional battle for athletics supremacy between Australia and England.         
	Twelve times in the last 18 versions of the Commonwealth Games, Australia and England have occupied the top two positions on the medal table  although in Melbourne in 2006, it was Australia on top, followed by Jamaica, and Kenya with England a disappointing fourth.         
	Kenyas customary strength in the middle and long distances look undiminished as they field the majority of their top performers. In 1500m they boast Silas Kiplagat, who introduced himself to the wider athletics world with a victory at the Samsung Diamond League meeting in Monte Carlo in 3:29.27, the worlds fastest time this year.         
	Wednesdays 5000m final will feature Eliud Kipchoge, whose victory in the inaugural Diamond League meeting at Doha in 12:51.21 remains the fastest recorded in 2010. I want to fight extremely hard for my first-ever Commonwealth Games medal. This is one of the events in which I havent got a medal, said Kipchoge.         
	Amid all this where do the Indians stand. Can they end their 52-year-old gold medal drought?

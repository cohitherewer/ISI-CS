The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev drops to tied 5th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev drops to tied 5th
                      
	Fanling: Jeev Milkha Singhs form fluctuated in each of his nine as he carded a three-under 67 to drop to tied fifth after the second round of the UBS Hong Kong Open here on Friday.         
	Jeev, who was overnight tied second, now has a total of 10-under 130.         
	The seasoned Chandigarh pro, who started from the 10th tee on Friday, played out a flawless back-nine which was studded with five birdies.         
	He lost his way in the front nine and ended up dropping three bogeys and a birdie to slip down the leaderboard.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Gaganjeet Bhullar was tied 33rd after second successive two-under 68 left him four-under overall.         
	SSP Chowarasia was a stroke adrift at tied 46th after carding a one-under 69.         
	Jyoti Randhawa (74) and Shiv Kapur (71), however, missed the cut along with four other Indians, including Indian Open champion C Muniyappa (75).         
	Englands Ian Poulter returned a magnificent 10-under 60 for a one-shot second round lead. The Ryder Cup star put on a master-class performance at the Hong Kong Golf Club, brilliantly sinking 10 birdies to lead the USD 2.5 million showpiece with a total of 13-under 127.         
	I think the back nine is the easier nine, and started off really well. Shot five-under, and I thought, lets do the same on the front. I think I got ahead of myself. Especially on the third hole, I drove it in the fairway, and Im normally a fade player and Ive tried to draw a 3-wood into that flag which is abnormal for me, Jeev said.         
	I think I got ahead of myself there; management was wrong. Im managing myself well, except today on a few holes, and hopefully learn from that and play well on the weekend, he added.

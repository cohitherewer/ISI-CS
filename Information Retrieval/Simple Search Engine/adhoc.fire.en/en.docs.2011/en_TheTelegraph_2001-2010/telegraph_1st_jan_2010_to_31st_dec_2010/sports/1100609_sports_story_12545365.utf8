	Loftus Versfeld, situated in Tshwane/Pretoria, is one of the oldest stadiums in South Africa. The stadium has been used for major sporting events since 1906, and the first concrete structure, which could accommodate no more than 2,000 spectators, was built by the City Council of Pretoria in 1923. Since 1948 it has undergone numerous upgrades. It has been used for both rugby and football matches and is home to one of the countrys top rugby teams, the Blue Bulls. It has hosted many significant matches including those during the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the 1996 CAF African Cup of Nations. South Africas national team, Bafana Bafana, achieved its first ever victory over a European side at this venue when they beat Sweden 1-0 in 1999.

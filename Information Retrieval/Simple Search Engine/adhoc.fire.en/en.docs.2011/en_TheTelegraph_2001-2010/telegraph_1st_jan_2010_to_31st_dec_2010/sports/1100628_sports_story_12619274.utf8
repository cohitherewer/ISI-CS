The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Javi ready to step in 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Javi ready to step in 
                      
	Potchefstroom: Spains rookie midfielder Javi Martinez is ready to step in if Xabi Alonso fails to recover from a sprained ankle in time for Tuesdays last 16 clash against Portugal.         
	The 21-year-old, who was a surprise inclusion in Vicente del Bosques squad and has made only three appearances for the European champions, will almost certainly fill the holding midfield role alongside Sergio Busquets if Alonso is ruled out.         
	I hope that Xabi recovers as he is a key part of the team, Martinez told a news conference at Spains training base on Sunday.         
	But if I get my turn then I am totally prepared. Its a responsibility but I will do everything in my power to try and do the job well.           (REUTERS)

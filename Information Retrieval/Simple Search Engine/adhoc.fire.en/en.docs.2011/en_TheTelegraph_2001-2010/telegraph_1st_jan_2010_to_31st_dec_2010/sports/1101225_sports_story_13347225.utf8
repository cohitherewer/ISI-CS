The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We can seal the series: Hashim
                                                                                                                       7                                        We can seal the series: Hashim
            A CORRESPONDENT            Hashim Amla                           
	Durban: Hashim Amla, who debuted six years ago against India at the Eden, will be playing his 50th Test match, when South Africa take on Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his boys at Durban from Sunday.         
	Amla, at a media conference, on Friday, spoke on playing his 50th Test, at his home ground, on the wicket and South Africas chances on sealing the Test series.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If he thought he would go on to play 50 Test matches after his debut in 2004         
	Im not sure. At that stage I dont think I was looking past the next game. Fortunately things have gone well and Ive managed to reach 50 Tests.         
	On how special it is playing the 50th Test at home         
	I think playing any Test match at my home ground is a special occasion. This being the 50th Test match doesnt make it any more important, to be honest. I think you all know that the team is always first and the fact that we won the last Test in a big series has taken precedence over any other distraction.         
	Whether he is thinking of making a century at Kingsmead         
	It would be lovely if I can because my record here is not fantastic in Test matches. In saying that, Ive always enjoyed playing at Kingsmead. It would be lovely to make a good contribution to the team here. Ive been brought up playing cricket here for the Dolphins and Ive made runs here over the years in domestic cricket. It will be lovely to get some runs in a Test here.         
	On Proteas chances to seal the series         
	Absolutely. A lot has been said about the wicket but at the end of the day, as a team, we try and keep things simple. Our bowlers and batsmen have been in good nick and hopefully we can continue in that vein. Its a big chance to seal the series, but as you can see its hot and humid so its going to be hard work.         
	The mood in the South African camp         
	The mood is quite positive Id say, after the win in Centurion. The team have played a lot of cricket together and weve been through a lot of ups and downs. Very rarely has there been any complacency and people are putting in as much hard work, if not more, coming up to this Test. Were just trying to keep things simple and do what works for us. Everybody is motivated to perform.         
	Views on the wicket         
	Ive been very fortunate growing up on this wicket, with the bounce and the pace. Im not sure how the Test wicket is going to play, but on a good day, when the wickets flat, its a fantastic place to play. The outfields small and the boundaries are short and you get fantastic value for shots.         
	If there are any cracks on the surface         
	I havent had a look at it, as detailed as that. Weve played enough to know that you have to do your best to succeed. Were not too fussed about the wicket.         
	Zaheer Khans returnZaheers a quality bowler. But in our team we dont place a lot of emphasis on one opposition bowler. Each batsman has just got to try and do his preparation in the best way possible.         
	If he relishes batting against India         
	Its quite funny actually. I really dont know what to say. Im just grateful that Ive had a good year so far, and the year is not over yet. At the end of the day its the players who can perform consistently that stand out.         
	If there is any weakness in the Indian attack         
	No, I dont think there is anything in particular. Things have just worked out for me in the one-Dayers and Tests this year.         
	On Indian support in Durban         
	Whenever the Indians have played here theyve had good support. But you know that in the middle its a different ball game. They may have a bit more support here than in other places but the game is played on the wicket and thats where youre going to need it.         
	Batting at the No. 3 position         
	Ive been fortunate to come into bat in good positions. Like in the last game, when we were 110 or 111 when I went out to bat. An opening partnership like that allows you to begin your innings when the bowlers are a bit more tired and operating in short spells. In that respect a good opening stand, and with Jacques and AB doing well, it does give me a bit of freedom here and there. At the end of the day its about trying to get in. Some days it takes a bit longer, some days it happens quickly. Things just work for you on some days. But the top order batting well does allow you to score a bit quicker and put some pressure on the opposition.

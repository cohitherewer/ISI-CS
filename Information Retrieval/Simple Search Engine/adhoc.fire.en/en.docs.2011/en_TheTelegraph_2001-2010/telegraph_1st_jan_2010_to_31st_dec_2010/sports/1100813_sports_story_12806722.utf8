The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A scandal a day, but the chief remains unfazed
                                                                                                                       7                                      A scandal a day, but the chief remains unfazed
    - Price for IOA affiliation: accept Kalmadis men!             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: A scandal a day, at least, but Suresh Kalmadi remains unfazed.         
	As for the gutsy Pargat Singhs, they can keep screaming that the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president represents the dirty face of sport in the country.         
	Thats because accountability is as alien to sport administrators in India as is, say, discipline on and off the field in cricket across our Western border.         
	Kalmadi, a Congress MP with a history of somersaults, has been running the IOA from 1996, when he ended B. Sivanthi Adityans reign. Today, Adityan is happy controlling volleyball, one of the 35 national sports federations affiliated to the apex body for Olympic disciplines.         
	Being a politician, Kalmadi is well versed in the art of flourishing and survival (when the going gets as hot as the Sahara at its most searing). How else does one explain the silence of Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the Archery Association of India chief...         
	Why Malhotra? Because hes a veteran in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been hauling Kalmadi and Manmohan Singhs government over the coals ever since the Commonwealth Games scams began to surface.         
	Malhotra, incidentally, has been heading his association from  believe it or not  1978! Sachin Tendulkar, by the way, was five years old then.         
	Clearly, the IOA is a restricted club and newcomers/aspirants must toe the Kalmadi line. If not, then either affiliation wont be granted or punishment meted out. As for the freebies (junkets a prominent form), forget about them.         
	The experience of one of the sports bodies seeking affiliation to the IOA is revealing. Somewhat chilling, as well.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Kalmadi didnt himself interact with the bodys president, but an emissary was blunt: Affiliation would be granted, but the officials nominated to represent it at the (quadrennial) elections of the IOA would have to be men of the supremos choice.         
	As direct as that, for its all about votes in sport, too. Each of the national sports federations is worth three votes, while every state Olympic association has two votes in the IOA.         
	Each vote may become crucial, as a Jagmohan Dalmiya would confirm. The next elections in the IOA are due in 2012.         
	Sources didnt exactly spell it out, but its possible that Kalmadi would have got just one of his men on board, possibly as the vice-president, and hed then carry the remaining two votes as proxy.         
	Its not a small game and theres a price to pay.         
	Last heard, the sports body referred to had apparently decided not to pursue the affiliation issue. Its bizarre... Why should Kalmadi or anybody else decide who all will represent us in the IOA? asked somebody, rather cut up.         
	Excellent question, but how many ask that?         
	Kalmadi has been known to pack the affiliates with officials swearing allegiance to him. Despite being in absolute control (till the scandals erupted, that is), insecurity seems to persist.         
	Why else would the head of a sports body seeking affiliation be told that its representatives at the IOA elections would have to be Kalmadis men?         
	Or, is it all about power and more power? And being so brazen about it.         
	Whatever, as the Commonwealth Games build-up has shown, the IOA president has certainly done his bit to damage national pride on the pretext of, well, enhancing it.

	Georgetown: Scott Styris and Nathan McCullum took three wickets each as New Zealand beat Zimbabwe by seven runs via Duckworth/Lewis method in a farcical rain-marred Group B match to qualify for the Super Eight stage of the World Twenty20 here on Tuesday.         
	Styris produced a superb spell of three for five from his two overs, while off-spinner Nathan took three wickets, giving away 16 runs to bundle out Zimbabwe for just 84 in 15.1 overs after New Zealand opted to bowl first on a turning pitch.         
	Both Styris and Nathan capitalised on some inept batting by Zimbabwe. All of Nathans scalps came in the ninth over while Styris took his three wickets in the 13th over.         
	Chasing 85 for the win, New Zealand made 36 for one in 8.1 overs before rain interrupted play with Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill at the crease on 22 and six respectively.         
	At that time, New Zealand were seven runs ahead of the par score under D/L method. Rain stopped after around one hour but confusion prevailed as the target was revised twice as players went out to resume play only to end it abruptly.         
	After the first revision, the target for New Zealand was 45 from 11 overs, but had to be changed to 40 from 10 overs. But all of a sudden, the match ended apparently because the ground was not ready for resumption of play after the heavy rain.         
	With Tuesdays win, New Zealand topped Group B after winning both their matches and qualified for the Super Eight along with Sri Lanka, who finished second with one win.         
	Zimbabwe lost both their group matches to crash out of the tournament. They had lost to Sri Lanka by 14 runs Monday.         
	New Zealand made a slow start to their chase and they were pegged back by the loss of Jesse Ryder in the third over. Ryder ended his miserable stay at the crease top-edging Prosper Utseya, while trying a slog sweep.         
	Wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu pouched the ball easily. Ryder consumed 11 balls for his two runs. New Zealand made 19 for one after five overs and they were 36 for one in 8.1 overs when rain interrupted play.         
	Earlier, Zimbabwe batsmen collapsed in a heap after a steady start as they were bundled out for a paltry 84.         
	Openers Tatenda Taibu and Hamilton Masakadza put on 36 runs in 4.4 overs and were 58 for two in 6.4 overs. But after that, Zimbabwe batsmen fell in a heap, losing eight wickets for just 16 runs.         
	They slumped from 58 for two in 6.4 overs to be all out for 84 in 15.1 overs.           (PTI)

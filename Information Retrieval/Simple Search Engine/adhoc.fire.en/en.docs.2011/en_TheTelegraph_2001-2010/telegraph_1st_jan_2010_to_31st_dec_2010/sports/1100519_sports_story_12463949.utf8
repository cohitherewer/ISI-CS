The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IOA refuses to fall in line 
                                                                                                                       7                                      IOA refuses to fall in line 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi faced some unexpected resistance for his style of functioning but that did not prevent the verdict at Tuesdays special general body meeting from going against the sports ministrys tenure limitation guidelines.         
	The meeting also ruled out amending the constitution to accommodate tenure limitation of office-bearers as desired by the sports ministry.         
	The special general body unanimously resolved that the IOA and national sports federations would decline to accept the government guidelines to protect their autonomy in accordance with the IOC Charter and International Federations Statutes, the IOA said in a statement.         
	No steps will be initiated by IOA/or any of the NSFs to amend their constitution as this will be seriously in breach of the Olympic Charter and render the IOA/NSFs vulnerable to suspension and deprive their teams of international participation, it added.         
	Despite enjoying the backing of majority of the members, Kalmadi faced huge embarrassment when Cycling Federation of India (CFI) president S.S. Dhindsa openly called the IOA chief a dictator. Dhindsa, the Akali Dal leader from Punjab, said: I hope the (IOA) president would not mind, I have been around for long and at times, the president functions like a dictator.

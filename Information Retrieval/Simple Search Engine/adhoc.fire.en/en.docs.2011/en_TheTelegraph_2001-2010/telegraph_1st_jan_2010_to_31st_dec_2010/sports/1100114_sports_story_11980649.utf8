The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhawal sets tough chase for hosts
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhawal sets tough chase for hosts
                  Dhawal Kulkarni on Wednesday                       
	Mysore: Dhawal Kulkarnis composed 87, followed by three quick scalps by Ajit Agarkar have put Mumbai in drivers seat after Day IIIs play at the Gangotri Glades cricket ground Wednesday.         
	Resuming at 108 for five, Mumbai piled up 234 in their second essay, thanks to Kulkarnis 181-ball contribution, to set a target of 338 for the hosts.         
	Karnataka were 135 for three, with Ganesh Satish unbeaten on 40 and giving him company was Manish Pandey (59 ..), at stumps.         
	Satish, who hit with five fours in his 125-ball innings, and Pandey (71 balls, 9x4) kept Karnatakas hopes alive. The hosts at one stage were in a spot of bother after being reduced to 46 for three. They still need 203 runs to score a come-from-behind victory.         
	Earlier, promoted up the order to stop Abhimanyu Mithun from running through the Mumbai batting-order, Kulkarni played with poise and purpose on a sporting deck.         
	Kulkarni was associated in a 95-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Abhishek Nayyar (50), who fell to an outstanding catch by Pandey at long-on off Sunil Joshi. (PTI)

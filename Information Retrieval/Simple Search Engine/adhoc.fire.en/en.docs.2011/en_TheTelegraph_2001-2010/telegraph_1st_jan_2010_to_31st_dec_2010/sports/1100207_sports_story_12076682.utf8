The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Focus on Shroff 
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Focus on Shroff 
            PRAVESH GUPTA                            
	Mumbai: Expectations are very high from Jacqueline, on Sunday. The Pesi Shroff-trained filly carries the tag of wonder filly, after she slammed the opposition in the Indian Oaks. The manner of her victory suggested that the King Charlemagne-Talita Kumi daughter was on routine morning canters when she beat a good Oaks field, with her jockey, Richard Hughes - riding on the bridle - having nothing to do but sit for an armchair ride.          
	The ante-post market odds quoted on the filly are absolutely judicious, 4-6, while trainer S. Padmanabhan (Paddy)s Becket is available at 5-1.           
	No race is, however, won till one touches the tape first and Paddys firm belief in the ability of his unbeaten-till-date colt may be gauged from his statement that Becket is improving all the time. Becket easily won the Bangalore (winter) Derby, dispelling all doubts about his staying prowess.           
	The horse had to be pushed to go into the winning lead and that is a normal exercise for any race. Beckets victims included Star Alliance, a Shroff-trained horse who finished fourth - about seven lengths behind - is no classic-horse but a useful handicap material.           
	However, most in Mahalaxmi feel that Youre So Beautiful, who placed 4 ls behind Becket in the Derby, is no great performer, having gone down to Systematic - another good handicapper - in one of their clashes over a mile-and-a-quarter trip.          
	The third horse in contention is Bruckner, the winner of the Calcutta Derby. The horse was not allowed to contest the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup, in Calcutta, despite an open request from those who matter in the RCTC.           
	The race appeared to be at Bruckners mercy but Shroff and his owners were quick to take the decision that the horses next start would be the Indian Derby. That decision says a lot.           
	Bruckner did leave the Calcutta Derby field cold but does he possess the class of Jacqueline, Becket and Onassis - another one from Shroffs yard. Performance-wise Onassis is as good or bad as Bruckner, and also yet to win a classic which is, however, no disqualification. Many a horse in the past has won Derbys without winning a classic. In fact, Pyare Miya won the Indian Derby as a maiden.           
	All said and done, Jacqueline is expected to win millions of hearts shortly after 5.15pm. It might turn out to be a race for the minor placings among Becket, Bruckner and Onassis.

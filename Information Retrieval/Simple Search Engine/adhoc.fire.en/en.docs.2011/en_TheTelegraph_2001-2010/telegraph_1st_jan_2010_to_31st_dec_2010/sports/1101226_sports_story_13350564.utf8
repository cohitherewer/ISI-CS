    - Chowdhury criticised for deserting team at a crucial juncture           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	New Delhi: The Bob Houghton-Pradeep Chowdhury spat took an ugly turn on Saturday when some members of the Indian team launched a vicious attack on Chowdhury and accused the manager of deserting the team in the build-up to the Asian Cup.         
	In a statement issued on the website run by the Football Players Association of India (FPAI), of which Bhaichung Bhutia is the president, the national team players not only criticised Chowdhury for leaving the camp in Dubai in a huff but also blamed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for allegedly leaking news to the media.         
	While the statement from the footballers even declared they would not take Chowdhury back as the manager before the Asia Cup, seven other footballers  skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, Mahesh Gawli, Sunil Chetri, Syed Rahim Nabi, Subroto Pal, Deepak Mondal and Anwar Ali  went a step ahead by issuing separate statements slamming Chowdhury of doing very little as the manager.         
	The entire team was upset at the fact Pradeep Chowdhury decided to do this and leave the team at sea, which just adds to the teams miseries. They (the players) believe he could have easily set aside personal differences with the coach to keep the spirit up, the statement from the national team said.         
	The players have also mutually agreed not to have Pradeep Chowdhury back in the camp as this has caused a lot of discomfort in the team, apart from being a cause of distraction and demotivation, it added.         
	Internal incidents are being leaked out of the federation and this is very unfortunate. The main reason for training away from India was to stay away from demotivating press reports but this has really caused a lot of disturbance, the statement further said.         
	The individual statement issued by Bhaichung read: I spoke to Pradip Chowdhury... He mentioned to me about his ill health and piled up personal work.         
	That may have been the reason he gave but we strongly feel that he could have stayed back and those were only alibis. At a time where the team needed all the support it could get, the manager left the team. This is something we did not really require when we needed to stick to together as a family. I am very disappointed at his decision, Bhaichung added.         
	Asked for his reaction, AIFF general secretary Kushal Das sounded extremely unhappy. The players shouldnt have got involved into this controversy. I will consult the AIFF president (Praful Patel) and the executive committee before deciding on our next course of action, Das told The Telegraph.         
	On Friday, Chowdhury decided to pack his bags after an apparent tiff with Houghton. The AIFF, however, said the manager was returning home because of personal reasons and may join the team before the Asian Cup.         
	Chowdhury, however, said he came back because of family problems. Those who are busy issuing statements against me are not doing any favour to Indian football. I would advise them to concentrate on their game and come out with an improved performance in the Asian Cup, he said.         
	While players like Chetri, Nabi and Gawli accused Chowdhury of deserting the team at a crucial juncture and called him a part-time manager, some AIFF officials felt the footballers had no business to get into acrimony.         
	We have a strong feeling that some people in the team are trying to cover up for their poor performance and are being encouraged by a section of the staff, said an AIFF office-bearer.         
	We have spent Rs. 16 crore for the team in the past eight months and all we received in return were 27 goals against us in nine matches. The Indian football fans surely deserve better treatment, he said.

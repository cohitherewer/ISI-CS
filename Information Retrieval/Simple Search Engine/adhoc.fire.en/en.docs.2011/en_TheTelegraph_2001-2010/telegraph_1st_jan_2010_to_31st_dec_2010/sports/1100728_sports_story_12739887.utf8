The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | for the record
                                                                                                                       7                                      For the record
                      
	 On 138 Kumar Sangakkara recorded the highest score by a Sri Lanka captain against India in Tests. He bettered his own record of 137 in Mumbai (Brabourne) in late 2009.         
	Sangakkara registered his seventh double century in Test cricket. He now stands at joint third position in the list of most double hundreds along with Englands Walter Hammond. Only Don Bradman (12) and Brian Lara (9) have scored more double hundreds.         
	Sangakkaras (219) was however his first double hundred as captain and the 41st to be scored against India in Tests. Interestingly Sri Lanka have never lost a Test when Sangakkara scored his six previous double centuries.         
	Kumar Sangakkaras 219 is now the fourth highest score by a Sri Lankan captain in Tests. Mahela Jayawardenes 374 (vs SA, Colombo 2006) is the highest, followed by Maravan Atapattus 249 (vs Zimbabwe, Bulawayo 2004) and Mahelas 240 (vs Pakistan, Karachi 2009).         
	Mahela (174) set a new world record of the most Test hundreds on a single venue by scoring his 10th century at the SSC, Colombo. He bettered the record of Don Bradman who had scored nine hundreds at the MCG.         
	Mahela scored his 28th Test century, 25th at No. 4, 24th batting first, 10th at SSC (a new world record), sixth vs India, and 19th on home soil.         
	Sangakkara and Mahela put on the 12th century stand of their career. They now have the most century stands by a Sri Lankan pair going past the previous record of 11 by Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva.         
	 Mahela now has 13 scores of 150-plus in Test cricket and the most by a Sri Lankan player. The previous best was Sangakkara (12).         
	 Sri Lanka posted their 11th 600-plus score in Tests, their seventh on home soil. Five of those have come against India. Sri Lanka are yet to score a 600-plus score against Australia and Bangladesh.         
	 On 62, Samaraweera became the eighth Sri Lankan to score 4000 runs in Test cricket. He took 59 Tests to achieve this milestone.         
	 Sri Lankas score of 642/4 decl is now the sixth highest by Sri Lanka in Test cricket, third highest by Sri Lanka against India, second highest posted at this ground and highest by Sri Lanka batting first in Tests.         
	 425 runs were scored in the days play for the loss of just 2 wickets. This betters the previous record of most runs scored in a days play at the SSC, which was 409/8 in 2001-02 (SL 309/4 and Bangladesh 100/4).         
	 COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

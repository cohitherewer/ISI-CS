	Wijk Aan Zee: World champion Viswanathan Anand ended his long chain of draws with a lucky victory over Spaniard Alexei Shirov in the 10th round of the A group of the Corus chess tournament here.         
	Having drawn the first nine games, Anand yet again tried hard to be back on his winning ways but missed a simple tactic which might have seen him on the receiving end.         
	Russian Vladimir Kramnik emerged as the new sole leader on seven points after Shirovs disastrous loss.           (PTI)

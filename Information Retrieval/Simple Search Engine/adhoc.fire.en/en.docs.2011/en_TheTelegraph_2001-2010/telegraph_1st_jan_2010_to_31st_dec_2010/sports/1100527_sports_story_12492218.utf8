	London: Lords may be only half-full when England begin their home season Thursday, but the noise if Eoin Morgan plays one of his dinky reverse sweeps will still be loud enough to raise the ground to its rafters.Not since Kevin Pietersen strutted into Test cricket in the 2005 Ashes has a debut been as eagerly awaited, with interest in Morgan even stretching into the home dressing room after his performances in the World Twenty20 this month.         
	Ian Bell spoke on Tuesday about Warwickshire practising Morgan-style flips and sweeps in the nets the day after one display in the Caribbean and if professionals are captivated, what impact must Morgan be having on children?         
	It will be interesting to see whether any of those reverse sweeps come out, Bell said, looking ahead to the first Test against Bangladesh. I have played a couple of games with him for the England Lions and he is a real talent.         
	Morgan insists that he will play his way. Asked whether he was concerned about the criticism that would follow a dismissal to anything considered unorthodox, he replied without pause for thought: Absolutely not.         
	He also dispelled the recurring suggestion that he finds first-class cricket too dull to sustain his concentration. I wouldnt say that I get bored, he said. My failure has been with indiscipline and I think I have corrected that to an extent. I have the patience to bat for five or six hours. I might have about 400 by then. I think I can translate my style to Test cricket. It is not really about playing any differently, more with batting to the situation of the game.         
	Reverse sweeps I have played millions of times. I have got out 10 per cent of times but it has got me 90 per cent of my runs. I will just assess how valuable the shot will be. I might not play it for a year, but if the time and situation are right, I will.         
	If the mathematics sound dubious, the argument is clear and, for all Morgans innovation, perhaps the most remarkable feature about his emergence as a one-day force during the winter was how infrequently he got out playing shots that might be considered over-adventurous.         
	There is certainly material for David Cameron to have pursued when the Twenty20 champions visited 10 Downing Street on Monday. Did the Prime Minister know his cricket? He did, surprisingly, Morgan said, confirming that Cameron had referred to Paul Collingwood as Colin.         
	Ajmal Shahzad rather than Steven Finn, Morgans Middlesex teammate, remains the most likely member of the squad of 12 to make way. Regardless, Shahzad already has plenty to remember from what is his first visit to London as a cricketer or member of the public.         
	Selection issues for Bangladesh are clearing. Tamim Iqbal, their equivalent of Morgan as a dashing batsman, visited hospital for checks on his injured wrist on Tuesday and has been declared fit enough, even though he may need surgery at some point.         
	Shakib-al Hasan was forced to cancel a trip to Stamford Bridge  he is a Chelsea supporter  because of chickenpox, but he, too, will play. The Decision Referral System will not be used for the two Tests after the ICC refused to meet a request by Sky Sports, the host broadcaster, to pay for a third of the cost of technology, about 80,000. It may, however, be in place for the four-Test series against Pakistan this summer.

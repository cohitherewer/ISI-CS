The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern are on a goal hunt

	Berlin: Bayern Munich know they must end their goal drought when they host AS Roma in their opening Champions League group match on Wednesday if they are to avoid putting themselves under pressure again.         
	Last year, the German club got into a tight corner in the group stage of the competition and had to win their final two matches to escape an early exit.         
	They made it through and eventually lost to Inter Milan in the final.         
	AC Milan welcome Auxerre in their first match and the introduction of goalline officials to help referees comes at the perfect time for the Rossoneri.         
	Matches in Europes premier club competition will have five officials this season after soccer bosses decided to extend a trial from the Europa League.         
	Milan should be glad of the extra two pairs of eyes after being incensed with the refereeing in Saturdays 0-2 Serie A defeat at promoted Cesena where the visitors felt they had two goals wrongly ruled out for offside and one for handball.         
	Real Madrid, meanwhile, are under pressure to entertain their demanding fans at home to Ajax Amsterdam after impatient whistling greeted Saturdays uninspiring 1-0 La Liga win over Osasuna.         
	The frustration of the Real faithful, still waiting to see the fruits of $448 million of investment, was plain when the players and new coach Jose Mourinho trooped off after a goalless first half.         
	Bayern striker Thomas Mueller cautioned his teammates before the clash. Against Roma we need to make sure we avoid making the group phase into a tension-filled affair like last season, he said on Monday.         
	Bayern, who drew 0-0 at home to Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday, have scored just two goals in three league matches, and none since August 20.         
	There does not seem to be a logical explanation for this (lack of goals), said Mueller.         
	AC Milan, the seven-times European champions, who have not won in six home games in Europe spanning almost two years, even put an extraordinary statement out on their website, referring to the Serie A defeat, with the headline: Without any further comment.         
	Law 6 on the assistant referee reads: If an assistant referee is not totally sure about an offside offence, the flag should not be raised, read the article.         
	New coach Massimiliano Allegri will be more concerned about Zlatan Ibrahimovic missing a penalty on debut as the pair gear up for their Champions League bows with the club.         
	The striker, signed on an initial season loan from Barcelona, has often flattered to deceive in the competition but the Swede is again expected to lead a three-pronged attack with Ronaldinho and Alexandre Pato.         
	For Real, captain Iker Casillas asked for patience and forward Cristiano Ronaldo said it was not always possible to put on a show.         
	I dont think all the fans were whistling, it was only a minority, the Portuguese international, who cost Real a record 94 million euros last year, told a news conference on Monday.         
	It would be better if people helped motivate us, but everyone is entitled to express themselves how they want, he added.         
	We cant always play brilliantly to entertain the fans and sometimes you have to try to lift the players.         
	All of us in the stadium want the best for Real Madrid and together can make a team that is more feared at home.         
	Arsenal, meanwhile, will have six first team players missing for their Group H opener at home to Braga on Wednesday after Abou Diaby and Thomas Vermaelen were both ruled out through injury.         
	Midfielder Diaby damaged his ankle in the Premier League victory over Bolton Wanderers on Saturday while central defender Vermaelen is still nursing a knock to his Achilles tendon sustained while playing for Belgium last week.         
	Chelsea, following a perfect start to the Premier League season, open their Champions League campaign at Slovak champion MSK Zilina.         
	Chelsea scored 17 goals in the first four league games while conceding only one, and newcomer Zilina faces a difficult task to stop the English champions.         
	Our aim is to improve if it is possible our kind of play to have more continuity, to do better and stay involved in all the competitions until the end of the season.

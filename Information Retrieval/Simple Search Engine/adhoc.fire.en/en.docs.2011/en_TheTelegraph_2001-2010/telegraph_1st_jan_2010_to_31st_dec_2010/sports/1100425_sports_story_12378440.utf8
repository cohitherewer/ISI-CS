The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bob Houghton is optimistic
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bob Houghton is optimistic
                      
	New Delhi: India coach Bob Houghton conceded that his side has got a tough draw in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup final round but vowed to give their best in the continents showpiece event in Doha.         
	India were clubbed in Group C along with 2010 World Cup qualifiers Australia and South Korea, and Bahrain, who just missed the showpiece event in South Africa in a play-off, in the draw held in Doha on Friday, but Houghton said his men can be competitive against Asias top sides.         
	Australia and Korea are two teams any coach would want to avoid being drawn alongside his team. The ranking itself speaks about the difference in standards. Bahrain are also good. Still, well try to put up the best effort, Houghton said.         
	The overall performance of the team has been improving steadily. We punched way above our weight in the recent tournaments. Thatll motivate our players. But still, weve a long way to go, he added.         
	Hoghton had already chalked out a plan on how to prepare for the January 7-29 tournament and he feels that his side will have to have some strategic preparations before the event.         
	I want the team to be together for a longer period ahead of the competition. Well spend some time in Europe preparing for the event. We hope to make strategic preparations ahead of the tournament, said the 62-year-old.         
	Houghton, however, was happy that the large expatriate crowd in Doha would cheer for India during the tournament.         
	I know that there are a lot of Indians in Doha. Itll be nice to have their support, but we need to deliver on the field as well, he was quoted as saying by the official AFC website.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB awaits Raman nod
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB awaits Raman nod
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are all set to announce the name of the new Bengal coach by the end of this week. As of Tuesday, the association was awaiting a nod from former India opener W.V. Raman who is favoured to replace Roger Binny as the coach of the senior team.         
	Raman, who guided Bengal to the Ranji Trophy semi-finals in 2001-02, met CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya last Saturday to discuss the contractual issues. Looking to avoid media attention, Raman met Dalmiya at the latters office instead of turning up at Eden Gardens.         
	According to reliable sources, the 45-year-old Raman has requested Dalmiya for some time to think over the offer. I cant divulge the details of my discussions with the CAB bosses. It is true that I am contemplating their offer, but I will only take a final call on this matter after a few days, Raman who has represented the country in 11 Test matches and 27 ODIs, told The Telegraph, on Tuesday.         
	It has been learnt that Raman is also in talks with one of the IPL franchises. That is specifically the reason why he is taking his time to decide about a second stint with Bengal. For CAB, Raman is the first choice. Other options will be explored only if Raman declines, a source informed.         
	Raman, who has been Tamil Nadus coach for the last five seasons, has guided the team to successive Vijay Hazare Trophy (national one-dayers) triumphs. Incidentally, it was Bengal on the losing side on both occasions. First, at Agartala during the 2008-09 season and, then, in Ahmedabad in 2009-10.         
	The reason why CAB are desperate for Raman to come on board is his reputation for being one of the hardest taskmasters in the domestic circuit.

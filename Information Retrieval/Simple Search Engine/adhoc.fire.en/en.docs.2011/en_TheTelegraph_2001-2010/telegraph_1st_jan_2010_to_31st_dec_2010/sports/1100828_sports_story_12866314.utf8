            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National hockey coach Jose Brasas outburst against the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Hockey India (HI) is likely to hamper the teams preparations for the upcoming Commonwealth Games. After Brasa made allegations about ill-treatment from the officials of the parent body on Thursday, HI secretary general Narendra Batra launched a scathing counter-attack against the Spanish.         
	I was having problems and I just said that. I was promised a lot by the authorities but very little was delivered, Brasa said.         
	At the same time, I said a lot of positive things but a certain section of the media chose to highlight the negative aspects, the coach added. But then, I am here to coach the Indian team till the Asian Games. The boys are doing a great job and I will continue to work with them if the authorities want me to do so, Brasa said.         
	Batra, went on record saying Brasa knew nothing about drag flicks and Harendra Singh should be immediately, made chief coach. The SAI officials on the otherhand alleged the coach was well aware of the government rules when he took over the reins of the Indian national team.         
	Brasa knew about the government rules when he decided to join as coach. Why is he cribbing now? He has been consulted during each and every selection meeting. He always knew that the decision of the selection committee is final. He shouldnt have any complaints, retorted the fuming official.         
	Brasa is only playing a game, the official said. For whatever reasons, he wanted to include Prabhjyot Singh.

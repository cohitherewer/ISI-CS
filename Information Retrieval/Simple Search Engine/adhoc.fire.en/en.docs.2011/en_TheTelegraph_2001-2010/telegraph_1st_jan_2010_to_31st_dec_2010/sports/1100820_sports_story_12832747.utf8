The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McEnroe backs Nadal
                                                                                                                       7                                      McEnroe backs Nadal
                      
	New York: This years U.S. Open is world No.1 Rafael Nadals best chance yet to complete a career Grand Slam by adding the one major title to elude him, according to John McEnroe.         
	A lot of people, including myself, believe his best chance to win the Open is right now, four-times U.S. Open winner McEnroe said, on Wednesday.         
	Nadal has shown formidable form in winning his fifth French Open and second Wimbledon crown in the seasons two previous Grand Slams to go, along with his 2008 Australian Open triumph.         
	The pounding, backcourt style has worn him down in the past and injuries have limited him at the end of past seasons, making it more difficult for him to shine on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows, which severely test his troublesome knees.         
	Various factors now favoured Nadal in the tournament at Flushing Meadows, starting on Aug. 30, McEnroe told reporters during a conference call.         
	Hes really tried to pull back. Hes trying to win it, the former bad boy of tennis said. Hes playing just enough tennis so he has confidence and to intimidate the other players. He is also giving his body a break.         
	Sometimes theres seven weeks between Wimbledon and the U.S. Open and sometimes there are eight. This year theres eight, and that gives him a chance to have five weeks off. It looks like a pretty promising situation for him.         
	The famed left-hander added that Nadal had improved facets of his game that enabled him to overtake five-times U.S. Why is Nadal number one? said McEnroe. I think because he volleys better, I think better than Federer now. He improved his serve. He took steps to make himself better.

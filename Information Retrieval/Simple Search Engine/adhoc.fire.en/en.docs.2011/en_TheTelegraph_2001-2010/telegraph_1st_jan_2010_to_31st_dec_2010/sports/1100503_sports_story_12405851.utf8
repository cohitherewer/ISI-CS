The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Expose has Higgins suspended
                                                                                                                       7                                        Expose has Higgins suspended
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH             John Higgins                           
	Snooker chief Barry Hearn has confirmed the suspension of John Higgins following allegations of fixing in the News of the World.         
	Higgins and his manager Pat Mooney were filmed by the newspaper allegedly agreeing to accept 261,000 in return for arranging the outcome of four frames in matches to be played later this year.         
	Mooney himself has had his resignation from the World Professional Snooker and Billiards Associations board accepted by the sports governing body.         
	World Snooker chairman Hearn said: A press release will be issued which will say Pat Mooney has resigned from the WPBSA board, while John Higgins has been suspended from all future WPBSA events subject to an investigation which begins immediately  and this will be dealt with in a summary fashion.         
	I dont think Ive ever felt so let down or kicked. Were working so hard on revitalising the game and there are lots of people pulling in the right direction.         
	We wanted the headlines to be about Steve Daviss revitalisation, Stephen Hendrys recovery... but all were talking about is the expose on John Higgins and his manager, which has left me feeling devastated.         
	The 34-year-old Higgins was reportedly caught on camera offering to fix a series of high-profile games.         
	The story claims that he made the offer during a meeting with an undercover reporter in Ukraine, after flying there following his defeat in the World Championship to Steve Davis.         
	Higgins agreed to deliberately lose four frames in four matches to help illegal gambling syndicates, according to the newspaper.         
	He is also said to have told the reporter that it was easy to fix matches. The deal was apparently set up and agreed with Pat Mooney, Higgins agent, a board member of the WPBSA and one of the sports top four officials charged with policing the game.         
	The claims threaten to overshadow the final of this years World Championship, which starts Sunday.

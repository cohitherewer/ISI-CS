The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shocking 1st-round exit for England! 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shocking 1st-round exit for England! 
            Henry Winter                      
	Footballs not coming to England. Its staying away, going to Russia. Despite the best efforts of the great, David Beckham, David Cameron and Prince William, and the great unknown, Eddie Afekafe, England failed to convince Fifa they can host the greatest sporting show on earth. Storm clouds join the snow clouds over England.         
	Recriminations now spill forth, about the timing of the Panorama programme alienating ExCo members, about the dysfunctional nature of the English footballing family that saw the bid fail to harness the power of the Premier League until well into the campaign.         
	What defeat showed was that English football lacks leadership within the Football Association; of the four 2018 bids, Englands was the only one that did not use their ExCo member, Geoff Thompson. Uncle Albert, as he is known in the FA, is no leader.         
	Defeat will encourage the government to look into the governance of the game, to assess the future of the FA, whose own finances will be harmed by this loss.         
	Problems beset the game, from the early signs of a return of hooliganism with England, to grass-roots issues, to dissent, to a national team failing to hold on to the ball.         
	Maybe Panorama would care to investigate those serious concerns. Dont hold your breath.         
	No blame can be attached to the bid team, who worked so hard out here in Zurich. Beckham appealed to the heart, reflecting on his and the nations passion for football. Cameron appealed to the mind with his promise of a well-run, Government-supported event.         
	Prince William appealed to everyone, a very modern Royal giving England a 21st-century chic.         
	Using Afekafe to begin the presentation was inspired, the Manchester City community man showing how football can be a force for social good. He talked of coming from the tough streets of Manchester, of being given hope through the KickZ project.         
	Sadly, it is difficult to know whether such stories appeal to 22 middle-aged men in suits, sitting in Zurich, musing about profitability.         
	England had a good bid, well-presented, but all the fish were sold and being made into Siberian fish soup.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

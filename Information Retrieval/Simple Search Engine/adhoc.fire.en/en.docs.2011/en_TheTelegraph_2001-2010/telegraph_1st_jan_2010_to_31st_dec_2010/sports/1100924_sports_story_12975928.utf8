The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Plan needed to combat Bhajji, Zaheer: Clarke
                                                                                                                       7                                      Plan needed to combat Bhajji, Zaheer: Clarke
                      
	Chandigarh: Michael Clarke, the vice-captain of the Australian team, feels that combating Indias pace spearhead Zaheer Khan and off spinner Harbhajan Singh will be a tough ask but they are up for the challenge.         
	Zaheer Khan is a wonderful bowler with the new ball and he can reverse it with the old ball. Harbhajan Singh too has had a lot of success in Test cricket, against Australia in particular. Both are probably two of Indias best bowlers who have had the experience of playing a lot against Australia, Clarke stated during a group interaction with the media at the team hotel, here on Thursday.         
	We have to come up with a plan to combat these two, Clarke added.         
	The visitors will play against the Board Presidents XI, led by Gautam Gambhir, in their tour opener at the Sector-16 stadium in Chandigarh, from Saturday.         
	All-rounder Shane Watson, who was present during the group interaction, also praised Zaheer and Harbhajan. It is always the hardest thing facing the new ball that swings. It had a huge impact on (an earlier) series (with India).Harbhajan is a brilliant exponent of spin bowling, Watson said.         
	Clarke, who has scored 4514 runs in 62 Tests at an average of 50.71, admitted that it was always a challenge to play against India on their home soil and more so when the visitors had a few inexperienced players in the squad. We know its going to be a tough challenge. Indias a strong team, but if we can play our best cricket, we can beat them in the series, he said.         
	However, the heavy rains which has robbed the Aussies from some serious match practice has been bothering coach Tim Nielsen. Sun came out after massive rain last night..120mm night! Got in to the nets even if only indoors but boys blew off some steam..good to go! Nielsen wrote on his Twitter page.         
	Clarke felt that an extended stay in India would help the team get used to the conditions in a better manner.         
	He also added that Australia would love to get back their No. 1 ranking in Tests though they were not bothered about it. With many youngsters in their current squad, Clarke felt that the tough tour was going to be a good learning curve for them.         
	On if he was preparing to step in to the shoes of skipper Ricky Ponting, Clarke dismissed that Ponting had any plans of retiring in the next couple of years.         
	On his own game, Clarke believed that his shot selection has improved a lot over the years. I am trying to improve with every game, he said.         
	On the recent fixing allegations, Clarke said, Its tough for the game at the moment. But, I think the game is in very good hands. The game of cricket has been in existence for a long time and has experienced such things in the past. I hope this time too, it will get over it.

    - Persistent rain threatens to play spoilsport in series opener           A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni, during a media conference, on Saturday                                 
	Kochi: For a change, the attention is perhaps a lot more on those who are not there rather than on those who would be taking the field.         
	On the eve of the first of the three-match India-Australia ODI series on Saturday, the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting, who are not a part of the series, are hogging the limelight with their virtual presence.         
	For India, apart from Sachin, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan are not at Mahendra Singh Dhonis disposal.         
	The Australians will have to fight it out without some of their frontline warriors, namely Ponting, Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson.         
	However, it is almost impossible to talk of an India-Australia clash and be oblivious of the above names. Time and again, we will refer to the sparkle of Sehwag-Gambhirs opening acts or Watsons all-round brilliance turning matches on its head.         
	It will also be interesting to see how the two captains, tied down by limited resources and having a contrasting build-up to the series, make their moves.         
	Dhoni is riding the clouds of confidence after clean sweeping Australia in the Test series. Perhaps, there couldnt have been a better backdrop to Dhonis plans than a 2-0 humbling of the Aussies. With the World Cup a few months away, it will be an ideal opportunity for the Indian captain to give his already impressive resume another lift.                 Michael Clarke, in Kochi, on Saturday    
	A lot will depend on the untested opening pair of Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan. Yuvraj Singh, making a comeback after being dropped from the Test team, would like to stamp his flair. Dhoni himself will try to plug in the gaps in the absence of the other seniors.         
	While Ashish Nehra will spearhead the pace attack, Ravichandran Ashwin, the lone specialist tweaker in the squad, has a difficult job of making up for Harbhajans absence. Saurabh Tiwary, as hinted by Dhoni, has an outside chance of making his debut on Sunday.         
	On the other hand, Michael Clarke, faces a tough job reviving the spirit of the trampled Aussies. The endeavour becomes harder because Clarke himself has to go on a form-hunt after some wafer-thin individual performances in the Test series.         
	With Ponting facing the music back home for his misadventure in India, it is needless to say that the burden of expectations on Clarke would plant further hurdles on his already bumpy path.         
	Also, after suffering the ignominy of sliding down to the fifth spot in the Test rankings, Clarke and Co. would like to announce to the world why they are still the No. 1 side in ODIs.         
	However, inexperience is a definite handicap for Clarke. While scoring runs would mainly revolve around David Warner, Clarke and Mike Hussey, for wickets the Australians will have to bank on the likes of Clint McKay, James Hopes and Nathan Hauritz. And if Doug Bollinger, who is yet to recover fully from the abdominal strain, fails to make the cut, it could be difficult to tear open the Indian batting line-up.         
	With the stars missing, the sky, too, has revolted. Unrelenting rain for the last few days has cast a cloud over the first ODI. The pitch preparations have also taken a hit and it would be interesting to find out how the 22-yard strip responses if any play is possible at all.

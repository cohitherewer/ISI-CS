	New Delhi: With Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, world champion Ronjan Sodhi and multiple World Cup medal winner Gagan Narang in the fray, the 28-member Indian squad are firm favourites to top the Commonwealth Games shooting, starting at the Karni Singh Range, on Tuesday.         
	So huge is the pressure on the Indian team that none of the shooters are willing to talk.         
	We are flooded with questions on how many gold medals we are going to win. This is putting a lot of pressure on us. We will only talk after we win those medals, said one of the top shooters.         
	The air rifle shooter was not far from the truth. Double-trap shooter Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores silver in the 2004 Athens Olympics and rifleman Abhinav Bindras historic gold at the Beijing Olympics, two years ago gave Indian shooters a shot in the arm. Today, they are a force to reckon with, at all international competitions.         
	On Monday, Indians are expected to win gold medals in the mens 10 metres air rifle pairs (Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang) and in the womens 3-position (Tejaswani Sawant and Lajja Goswami). Indians are also in contention for gold in two other events mens 50 metres pistol and womens 25 metres pistol.         
	Besides Rathore and Bindra, the number of top-class shooters from the country is equally impressive  with Gagan Narang, Ronjan Sodhi, Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Samaresh Jung and, the latest sensation, Indias first woman world champion, Tejaswini Sawant.         
	Indian shooters have been a dominant force at the Commonwealth Games. In the 2006 Melbourne Games, they won 27 medals, including 16 golds  comprising a large chunk of Indias overall tally of 50.

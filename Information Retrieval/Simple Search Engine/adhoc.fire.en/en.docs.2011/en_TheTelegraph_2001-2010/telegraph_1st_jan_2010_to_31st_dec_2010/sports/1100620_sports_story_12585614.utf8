The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia manage a draw
                                                                                                                       7                                      Australia manage a draw
                      
	Rustenburg: Australian forward Harry Kewell was controversially sent off midway through the first half but Australia managed to cling on to a 1-1 draw with Ghana on Saturday in a result that put the Africans atop Group D.         
	In an open and entertaining game, the Australians led as early as the 11th minute when Brett Holman profited from an error by Ghanaian keeper Richard Kingson who spilled a shot from Mark Bresciano, allowing Holman to net the rebound.         
	But 13 minutes later Australia were reduced to 10-men for the second successive game as Kewell was sent off for handling the ball on the line.         
	The Australians vehemently protested that the ball had struck Kewells upper arm and that it was not deliberate.         
	Asamoah Gyan, who scored the winner in Ghanas first group game against Serbia, converted his second penalty in two games with a low right foot shot.         
	Ghana then went in search of a winner but despite creating a host of chances they were left frustrated as Australia defended bravely and went close themselves to stealing an unlikely win when substitute Joshua Kennedy failed to score with a smothered close-range shot after 72 minutes.         
	Australias Kewell told reporters after the game that the decision to send him off was harsh. Everyone thats seen it is saying ok, fair enough, its a penalty. But was it deliberate? Of course not, Ive never been that way inclined, he said.         
	His dismissal left the team to battle with just 10 men for the second consecutive game. Australian midfielder Tim Cahill was sent off in their first group game against Germany and missed the Ghana match.         
	Ghana lead the group with four points from two games and need at least a draw in their final fixture against Germany at the Soccer City stadium in Johannesburg on Wednesday to guarantee qualification for the second stage.

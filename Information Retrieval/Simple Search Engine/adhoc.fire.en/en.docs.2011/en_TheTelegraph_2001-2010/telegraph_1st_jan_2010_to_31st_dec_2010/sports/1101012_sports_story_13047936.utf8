	Indore: Opener Tanmay Srivastava scored a run-a-ball 103, while Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary smashed a quick-fire 84 to help India Blue win the NKP Salve Challenger Series with a thumping 140-run victory over India Green here on Monday.         
	In reply to Blues challenging score of 287 for seven, the Greens were all out for 147 in 36.4 overs. India discard Rudra Pratap Singh took three for 20 for the winners.         
	For the second day in a row, India Blue captain Yuvraj Singh opted to bat after winning the toss.         
	Srivastava and in-form Shikhar Dhawan (44, 51 balls, 4x6, 1x6) added 67 runs before the Delhi batsman was caught by Ravichandran Ashwin at deep square leg off Abhimanyu Mithuns bowling.         
	Ajinkya Rahane (7) and Yuvraj Singh (12) were both dismissed off leggie Sarabjit Ladda. While Rahane mistimed a pull-shot, Yuvraj was done in by a googly.           (PTI)

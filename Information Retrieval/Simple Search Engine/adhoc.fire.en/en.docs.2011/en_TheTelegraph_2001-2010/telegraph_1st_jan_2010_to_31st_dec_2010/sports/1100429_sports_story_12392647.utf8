	London: Dismal domestic and Champions League campaigns have left Liverpool seeking Europa League salvation but they must first overturn a 0-1 semi-final first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid, on Thursday.         
	Poor form and injuries to key players like Spanish striker Fernando Torres have ensured a season of unfulfilled ambitions so far at Anfield.         
	I am confident. Anfield is massive and with the fans behind us, we can beat anyone, Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez, whose side are seventh in the Premier League, told reporters after their first leg defeat. The five-time European champions, chasing their fourth Europa Cup, have twice progressed in the competition this season after losing first-leg ties against Lille and Benfica.         
	However, Atletico, who won the Uefa Cup Winners Cup in 1962, and finished runners-up in the European Cup in 1974, have their impressive scoring form away from home to thank for a last-four berth. They have bagged six goals on their travels and only managed two at home in their two wins and five draws this season.         
	The Spanish side have a chance to finish their campaign on a high by appearing in two Cup finals, having already booked themselves a Kings Cup final date with Sevilla next month.         
	With the squad we have, we should be better placed in the league. We started the season badly but now we are in good form. We arent thinking of a double, just winning the next game, Portugal winger Simao Sabrosa told a news conference. We know Liverpool are more conservative away from home, and that at home they will put us under a lot more pressure, but we hold our destiny in our own hands.         
	In a dour first leg settled by Diego Forlans scrappy finish, Liverpool gave a performance of a team that had already travelled 1,200 miles by train and plane just to make the match. After laying on three assists in Sundays 4-0 league win over the relegated Burnley, rarely called-upon Italy midfielder Alberto Aquilani could be used in a more attacking role.         
	It is an option. He can play in both positions, Benitez, who is without injured talisman and former Atletico striker Torres, told the club website. In this position, he has freedom and with Gerrard behind him, they can pass to each other.         
	Atleticos Argentine striker Sergio Aguero will feature at Anfield after being suspended for the first leg.         
	Meanwhile, Hamburg SV will play at Fulham. The German side have won only four matches of the last 15. In their last match, Hamburg lost 1-5 at Hoffenheim on Sunday, and coach Bruno Labbadia was shown the door.         
	The sacking was not much of a surprise given the widely reported rumours that Labbadia had fallen out with a number of his squad including Ze Roberto, Mladen Petric, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Frank Rost. The timing, however, was a shock. Assistant coach Ricardo Moniz, dubbed a great motivator by the club, was handed the task of the stand-in coach.

	Durban: Englands Kevin Pietersen is set to turn out for South African franchise the Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN) Dolphins in October in a bid to find his form before the Ashes tour later this year, a KZN official said on Wednesday.         
	The South African-born batsman, who made his first-class debut for the Durban-based Dolphins during the 1997-98 season before relocating to England, will be available to play in two four-day matches for the franchise from Oct. 7-17.         
	Pietersen will not be paid for his time with the Dolphins, the KZN cricket official, who did not wish to be identified, said.         
	It is a win-win situation for us, said the KZN official.           (REUTERS)

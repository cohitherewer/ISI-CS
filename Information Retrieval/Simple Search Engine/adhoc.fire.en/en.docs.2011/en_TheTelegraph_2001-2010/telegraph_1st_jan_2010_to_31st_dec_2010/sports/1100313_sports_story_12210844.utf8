The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goswami looks to make mark
                                                                                                                       7                                      Goswami looks to make mark
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The recently concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy was the tournament where a young Sreevats Goswami came of age. The 21-year-old Bengal wicketkeeper-batsman finished the national one-day tournament as the countrys highest run-getter (568 runs with three centuries).         
	The pint-sized Howrah lad, a member of the Royal Challengers Bangalore squad, feels that him getting big scores just before the start of the Indian Premier Leagues third edition will be a great confidence booster.         
	Before an important tournament, its of great help. I know I am middling the ball well. The short camp that we had in Bangalore, too, was of great help. Its always a great thing when you get a chance to interact with the likes of Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, Sreevats, who arrived in the city from Bangalore with his teammates, said.         
	What exactly are his expectations from this IPL? To consolidate my position in the Royal Challengers team I believe I havent done too badly in the limited opportunities that I have got. I was adjudged the best U-19 cricketer during IPL-I, which is a great honour. Last year in South Africa, I scored 40-odd against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) while opening.         
	This time I sincerely hope to consistently score runs to cement my place in the side. It will be a great moment for me personally if I am in the first XI. Dont forget that its not only KKRs but my home ground too. I am a local boy, said Sreevats, who feels that he should have played a few first-class games this season.         
	Had I got a chance to play in Ranji and, may be, score a couple of centuries, it would have been good. But I dont want any negative thoughts to creep into my system.         
	The Royal Challengers reached early morning without skipper Anil Kumble and South African players Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher. The trio will be arriving on Saturday. Dale Steyn, Dillon du Preez and Eoin Morgan along with former India captain Rahul Dravid also reached Friday morning.

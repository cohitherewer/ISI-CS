The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drag-flickers hope to fire
                                                                                                                       7                                        Drag-flickers hope to fire
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            India captain Rajpal Singh (right) warms up with teammates before a practice match against the Netherlands at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, in New Delhi, on Thursday. India won the tie 2-1. Prabhjot Singh put the hosts ahead in the third minute and Deepak Thakur made it 2-0 in the 26th. Taeke Taekema converted a penalty corner to reduce the margin for the Dutch.

	New Delhi: When India and Pakistan meet on the opening day of the hockey World Cup on Sunday both would be counting on their drag-flickers to deliver.         
	If the return of veteran penalty corner specialist Sohail Abbas has been a big boost for the team from across the border, the hosts will be encouraged by the presence of Sandeep Singh, Dhananjay Mahadik and Diwakar Ram, players perfectly capable of taking the game to the Pakistanis.         
	National coach Harendra Singh, understudy to Jose Brasa, believes the current lot could go down in history as the best bunch of drag-flickers Indias had. Never before have India had three penalty corner specialists in the team, not even in 1975 when we won the World Cup, he said.         
	Sandeep converted a penalty corner against Argentina in a practice match on Wednesday and expressed confidence to do well in the tournament. Our basics are working out well, he said.         
	Mahadik said Spanish coach Brasa has been doing a wonderful job with penalty corners. To have three drag-flickers is always an advantage. It keeps the opposition on their toes, Mahadik said.         
	Mahadik called Brasa a perfectionist who has been doing everything in his powers to increase the rate of conversion. First, he made us practice drag-flicks with balls weighing more than 200 grams and, then, he used 150-gram hockey balls. He wanted us to have more power behind the shots, said Mahadik.         
	Diwakar is a Sohail Abbas fan excited by the prospect of playing against the Pakistani legend. I want to learn a few tricks from him and, at the same time, want to do well against Pakistan, said the youngster. I feel lucky to be picked for the World Cup, he added.         
	Although in Sandeep the Indian camp boasts of the player with the best conversion rate in the world, Abbas, even at 33, remains undoubtedly the worlds best drag flicker. And if recent statements by the Pakistan great mean anything, then the Indian defence should be on guard right from the word go in Sundays clash.         
	This is going to be my fourth World Cup, Abbas said upon arrival in the capital. I want to make it a memorable one. I am happy that we are starting our campaign with the match against India. I am sure of a positive result and thats going to be a morale booster for the team.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India captain Jhulan Goswami has reclaimed the No. 1 spot in the ICC womens ODI rankings for bowlers after a good series against England.         
	Fast bowler Goswami took 11 wickets in the series, which India won 3-2. Seven months ago, Goswami had surrendered her top position to Englands Holly Colvin.         
	Indian spinner Gouher Sultana, the most successful bowler in the series with 12 wickets, is the biggest mover in the latest rankings with a jump of 12 places as she is enjoying career-best 19th position.         
	Rumeli Dhar has also achieved her career-best ranking (No.5).

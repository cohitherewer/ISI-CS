The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India are hot favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                        India are hot favourites
            JAYDEEP BASU            Bharat Chetri                           
	New Delhi: For the first time in many months, Jose Brasa was all smiles as he walked into the International Zone at the Games Village on Wednesday.         
	The gold will be ours, said a beaming chief coach of the Indian hockey team before going to the internet caf. We take the pitch to win matches, not to pose for photographers with the runners-up trophy, Brasa said.         
	The Spanish coachs newly-found confidence on the eve of Thursdays final against Australia was understandable. After months of forgettable performance, especially in the World Cup at home, Brasas team is finally on the roll. If the victory over Pakistan was an emotional triumph, the historic semi-final win against England on Tuesday showed India as a technically better equipped side.         
	Despite the hype, the final is going to be a different ball game. Australia are the world champions, and, under their present coach, Ric Charlesworth, have not lost a serious competitive match in the last two years. The Aussies did lose to India in the Azlan Shah tournament a few months back, but half the players from Down Under were the members of their second string.         
	The problem is that for years, India have not won a match against top-notch teams like Australia, Germany or the Netherlands. The last time India won against Australia was seven years ago in a four-nation tournament in Sydney.         
	But, then, as Zafar Iqbal said, India should go for the final with a free mind. Losing to Australia would not be a matter of shame. After all, they are the best. In case we manage to topple them, it would be a priceless gold medal.         
	Brasa had no qualms in saying that it would be Indias best chance to upset the Aussies. They are definitely far ahead of all other teams in the world, have taken the game to a different level.         
	But tomorrow (Thursday), we are the favourites. It is good that the match will be played at 11.30 am. The heat and the weather will favour us. All the home teams get that advantage. I dont see any reason why the Aussies should complain. We will also get the crucial crowd support, the Indian coach added.         
	Charlesworth, however, said the weather might go against India in the final. We played four matches in five days under extreme conditions, something India are yet to experience. It is very hard to be consistent in those conditions, but we have the fitness to counter it, he said.         
	Still, India have reasons to feel confident. Even during the big defeat against Australia in the preliminaries, the home team showed definite signs of improvement in skills and fitness. The goal from Dharamvir Singh was a beauty as Tushar Khandekar brushed aside five Aussie defenders to pass the ball for the young striker.         
	It was very impressive, said former India captain Pargat Singh. The Australians are an extremely tough side. It is not easy to dodge past so many defenders.         
	If Dharamvir and Khandkar are in fine form, so is skipper Rajpal Singh. In addition, goalkeeper Bharat Chetri is now the toast of the nation after his superlative display against England in the semi-finals.         
	Indias major concern is the defence where Dhananjay Mahadik proved a bit slow at times and wing-half Prabodh Tirkey is nursing a problematic back.         
	All said and done, it could be a momentous occasion for Indian hockey at the Dhyan Chand Stadium on Thursday. For years, India have not won a major tournament involving top rivals. More than a gold medal, beating Australia would be like a ticket to be the part of the big league.

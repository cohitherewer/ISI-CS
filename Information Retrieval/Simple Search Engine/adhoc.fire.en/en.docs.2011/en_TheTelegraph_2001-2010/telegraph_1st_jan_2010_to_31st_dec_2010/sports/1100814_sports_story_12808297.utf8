The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Veron raps Maradona
                                                                                                                       7                                      Veron raps Maradona
                      
	Buenos Aires: Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron has broken a month long silence to criticise almost every aspect of Diego Mardonas coaching during the World Cup.         
	In a radio interview on Thursday, Veron questioned Maradonas use of Barcelona star Lionel Messi and said Argentinas midfield was unbalanced, presenting a problem for Messi.         
	He (Messi) is not used to going near midfield to receive the ball, Veron said. It is difficult to ask him to go 50 metres with the ball at his feet. Above all, since he had opposing players in front of him. He is not used to playing like this and it showed. It showed on his face.         
	Sadly, he didnt look comfortable in those games. He is never going to be Maradona. He does his own thing and he needs team support to be at his best. Sometime he had it. Sometimes he didnt.           (AGENCIES)

	London: England will look to wrap up the one-day series against Pakistan and maintain their perfect record in all formats this summer when they take on the beleaguered tourists at The Oval on Friday.         
	After being embarrassed 2-0 in a one-sided Twenty20 series, a patched-up Pakistan has put up a fight in the one-dayers but England has won both matches so far.         
	The host side needs one win from the next three games to claim another series victory ahead of the Ashes tour to Australia this year.         
	Its been a long summer and it would be nice if we could go out having won every series weve played, England spinner Graeme Swann said. That was the aim at the start of it, and I think weve got ourselves in a very good position to do it.         
	Wahab Riaz could make his first appearance in the one-day series, with Mohammed Irfan struggling for form and Abdul Razzaq nursing a back problem.           (AGENCIES)

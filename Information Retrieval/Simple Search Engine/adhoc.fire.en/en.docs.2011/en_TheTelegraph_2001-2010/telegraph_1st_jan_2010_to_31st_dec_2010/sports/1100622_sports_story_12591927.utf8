	Cape Town: Portugal skipper Ronaldo, finally put an end to a 16-month drought when with a bit of luck he scored the penultimate goal for his team in a 7-0 slug fest against North Korea. In the 87th minute he broke clear and the ball bounced into the air off keeper Ri, rolled over Ronaldos head and fell into his path with the goal at his mercy. He could not miss.         
	My goal was funny but Im very happy, said Ronaldo. Goals are always goals. To score seven goals in a World Cup game is not easy. I must mention my team, we played fantastic. I gave Tiago the man-of-the-match award because he was our best player. It was the right thing to do. This Portugal team believes in itself. Too true.         
	Ronaldo got on the scoresheet at last as the Portuguese put themselves in prime position to accompany Brazil into the second round after a scintillating display of attacking football. Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz had said he would approach the game in three stages  win, score goals and then look at the standings and his players followed the plan to the letter.

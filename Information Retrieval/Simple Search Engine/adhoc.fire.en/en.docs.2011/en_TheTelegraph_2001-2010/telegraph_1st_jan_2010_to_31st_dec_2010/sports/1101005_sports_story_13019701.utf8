                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians go down 0-1 to Hong Kong
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India went down fighting to Hong Kong by a solitary second-half goal in the first of the three international friendlies as part of their preparations for the Asia Cup, in Pune, on Monday.         
	According to information received here, the all-important goal was scored by the visiting captain Li Haiqiang in the 80th minute of the match.         
	The victory thus kept Hong Kongs unbeaten record against India intact.         
	India wasted several opportunities with Sunil Chetri guilty of squandering at least two sitters in the first half, after Anthony Pereira had done the spadework from the right. Clifford Miranda also wasted an easy opportunity.         
	In the second session, Hong Kong dominated the proceedings but the hosts, too, had their chances. Sushil Kumar Singh failed to capitalise on a fumble by goalkeeper Li Hon Ho, and then Pereira ballooned a chance from close after Sushil set him up with a header.         
	India now take on Vietnam on October 8.

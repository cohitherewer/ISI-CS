The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fernando sets up Robin date 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Fernando sets up Robin date 
                  Soderling                     
	Barcelona: Fernando Verdasco continued his impressive start to the clay-court season by beating David Ferrer on Saturday to reach the Barcelona Open final, where the Spaniard will face second-seeded Robin Soderling.         
	Fifth-seeded Verdasco will play his second final in two weeks after overcoming early frustrations to top Ferrer 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-1, denying his Davis Cup teammate a third straight appearance in the final.         
	I had confidence after coming back into the game in the second set, said Verdasco, who lost last weeks Monte Carlo Masters to Rafael Nadal.         
	 Ill have to recover quickly to be in good shape for tomorrow (Sunday).         
	Verdasco will try to make it nine straight Spanish winners at Godo when he plays Soderling, who reached Sundays final after winning 6-1, 6-4 over Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands.         
	While Verdasco was worn out by the 2-hour, 37-minute match played in the hot sun, Soderling needed only 76 minutes to get past the unseeded De Bakker and become the first Swedish player to reach the final since Magnus Larsson in 1995.         
	No Swede has won in Barcelona since Kent Carlsson did 22 years ago.         
	In the first set I felt a little heavy in the legs, I was moving poorly and I was late getting to a lot of balls, Verdasco said.         
	I got better with the game, it was a little strange.         
	I had the occasion and took advantage, said Verdasco, who will be going for his second title of the season.         
	Getting the two breaks in the second set, that was tough.

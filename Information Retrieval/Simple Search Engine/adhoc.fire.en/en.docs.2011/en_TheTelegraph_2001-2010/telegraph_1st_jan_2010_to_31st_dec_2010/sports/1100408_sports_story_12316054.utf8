The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreesanth may face penalty
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sreesanth may face penalty
                      
	Jaipur: Sreesanth sarcastically clapped at Rajasthan Royals opener Michael Lumb and the two umpires after being hit for a four in a free-hit, here on Wednesday.         
	Kings XI pacer Sreesanth, who was involved in the infamous slapgate with Harbhajan Singh during the IPL-I, might have to face a penalty.         
	In the third over of the Rajasthan Royals innings, an erratic Sreesanth was called for two successive no balls and was hit by Lumb for a boundary in the free-hit. Infuriated by the umpires decision, Sreesanth first clapped at Lumb and then at the umpires.         
	Soon teammate Yuvraj Singh ran up to him and asked the Kerala pacer to mend his ways and concentrate on his bowling. No stranger to controversies, Sreesanth was given a final warning by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) last October to mend his on-field behaviour.         
	During the first edition of the IPL, after an altercation, a slap from Harbhajan left the Kerala pacer crying on the field. The issue soon snowballed into a huge controversy and although Sreesanth was let off with a warning, Harbhajan was suspended from rest of the tournament.

                                  Alicia Coutts with her five gold medals    
	Melbourne: She went to Delhi in anonymity, but five medals at the Commonwealth Games have made swimmer Alicia Coutts a household name in Australia now.         
	The 23-year-old returned home on Saturday along with the rest of the over 500-strong Australian contingent to a warm reception from none other than the countrys Prime Minister Julia Gillard.         
	Coutts, who won three individual and two relay gold medals in Delhi, had no sponsors before the Games and even thought of quitting following an abdominal surgery just after the Beijing Olympics.         
	I actually didnt know if I wanted to swim any more. I always had in the back of my mind, Will I ever be back to where I was? Ive definitely got over that, Coutts told an Australian daily.         
	My dad said to me he knew I was going to be a good swimmer right from the word go. He told me, Youll go to the Olympics one day.         
	Now Im getting better and proving that I can be as good as he thought I was going to be, she said.         
	Coutts father Gary, also a swimmer, died when she was only six months old and she pursued the sport for him.         
	I actually had my first-ever swimming carnival when I was seven on the day my dad actually died.         
	He died in the morning, and the carnival was in the afternoon, and my mum said, Youre not going to go.         
	But I said, I have to go, I have to go and swim for Dad, so my grandparents took me, and I swam and I won all my races, she said.         
	Coutts now wants to get fitter for the 2012 London Olympics.         
	I definitely want to try and get fitter and thinner and stronger, she said.         
	The swimmer said she surprised herself with her performance in Delhi.         
	I wasnt expecting to go that fast. Im one of those people who doesnt go into anything expecting something.         
	I like to go in, see what I can do and see what happens.         
	I know therell be expectation, but I will still approach things the same way I have.           (PTI)

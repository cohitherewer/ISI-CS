                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhutias want coach to stay
  - Unfortunate that Bobs not getting the co-operation he needs, says India captain       A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	Calcutta: As it is, few things are right with Indian soccer. And it became even worse when the news of national coach Bob Houghton quitting his job rocked the football fraternity on Monday.         
	With many believing that the Houghton was the right person who could bring a semblance of respectability to Indian football, its beyond doubt that Bhaichung Bhutia and Co. would be the ones who would feel the pinch most.         
	Bhaichung, on Tuesday, said that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) should do the needful to dissuade Houghton from resigning, especially with the Asian Cup coming up in January next year.         
	It will be a huge setback for Indian football if he leaves at such a crucial stage when we are preparing for Asian Cup. Its unfortunate Houghton is not getting the co-operation he needs Thats hindering the way of his functioning. He is very important for our success, Bhaichung said.         
	Indian football will prosper with his support and he is taking it in the right direction. I just hope the issue gets sorted out as soon as possible, said the India captain.         
	Bhaichungs teammate Rennedy Singh echoed his captain and said that it was a shocking news.         
	I am shocked to hear such a news. If that happens, it wont be good for Indian football. The AIFF should sort out the differences and ensure that he stays with us, Rennedy said.         
	Without him, it will be extremely difficult for us to perform well in the Asian Cup. We had worked hard to qualify for this prestigious meet and it will be really unfortunate if he leaves, he added.         
	Rennedy was also of the view that it would be foolish to replace Houghton with a new coach at this juncture. Under Houghton, we have only improved. He has done a lot for us and all the players respect him. He knows the players like the back of his hand and I dont think a new coach would be a good idea, he said.Defender Mehrajuddin Wadoo was equally disappointed with the way things have been going.         
	I was hoping that something will be done to retain Houghton. But if he is really leaving, then I must say that it is disastrous news. With the Asian Cup coming up, it will be difficult for the players to concentrate, the Kashmiri defender, said.         
	He is such a good coach and we have done exceedingly well under him. I dont understand why such a thing should happen. He is the right person to take us forward and the players, too, respect him a lot. He had such noble plans for our preparations for the Asian Cup and it would have only benefited us, he added.         
	He also rubbished views that Houghton was only trying to desert India for better options. I dont think thats true. Even during our last camp we had discussions about the Asian Cup and he explained a lot of things to us. That we have been drawn in a tough group is not surprising since we expected as much. So, I dont think he is trying an escape of any sorts, Mehrajuddin said.

	Nottingham: James Andersons inspired swing bowling gave him a match haul of 11-71 and helped to wrap up a comfortable 354-run victory for England over Pakistan in the first Test on Sunday.         
	Pakistan slumped to their lowest Test innings total against England, bowled out for 80 in 29 overs.         
	When the ball is swinging there is not a better bowler in the world than Jimmy Anderson, England captain Andrew Strauss told reporters.         
	England needed just under two hours to take Pakistans last seven wickets. Pakistan, set a world-record 435 to win, had resumed on 15 for three on the fourth day at Trent Bridge.         
	No. 10 Danish Kaneria top-scored with 16 not out and was one of only two batsmen to reach double figures as the Pakistanis struggled to play the moving ball throughout. The total fell short of Pakistans previous low against England, which was 87 at Lords in 1954.         
	Fast bowler Anderson followed his five for 54 in the first innings with another excellent spell in cloudy conditions, in front of a stadium about a quarter-full. His second innings analysis was 15-8-17-6 as he bowled 11 consecutive overs on Sunday. Im very satisfied with what we have done over the last three or four days, Strauss said.         
	We had to work hard at stages in the game and the encouraging thing for me was that we got through those tight situations and came out the other side very well.         
	Huge credit must also go to Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood for their runs in the first innings and Matt Prior in the second.         
	The shell-shocked Pakistanis will need to rally quickly as the second Test in the four-match series begins at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on Friday. It was disappointing, nobody expected this (to lose seven wickets so quickly), Pakistan captain Salman Butt said. We were certainly expecting better things of ourselves and we need to improve.         
	(But) we must remember the second game that we won last week against Australia came only a few days after losing heavily to them at Lords, he added, searching for something to boost morale.         
	It is not much different between the two sides in terms of batting. I fully trust my team will be back.         
	England set up the win with a first-innings 354 courtesy of 130 by Morgan. Pakistan then slumped to 182, before Englands 262 for nine declared when Prior made an unbeaten 102. Pakistan, who lost their 2006 series in England 3-0, avoided their lowest Test total of 53  made against Australia in Sharjah in 2002  when Kaneria clipped Anderson through midwicket for a boundary. He also pulled Finn for a six and a four as Englands fielders smiled wryly.         
	For the first half-hour England bowled without the discipline of the previous evening when their lines and lengths were perfect. Instead, Anderson and Stuart Broad often bowled wide of the mark as the batsmen rarely had to play a stroke.         
	Anderson soon improved his accuracy and struck in the eighth over of the day when Imran Farhat (15) edged him to Strauss at first slip. That was 31 for four, which was soon to become 37 for five.         
	Anderson surprised right-hander Umar Akmal (4) by swinging the ball into his pads as opposed to bowling his stock out-swing delivery. Umar chose to review the dismissal but Asoka de Silvas decision was upheld by the third umpire.         
	Pakistan slumped to 41 for seven when night-watchman Mohammad Aamers stubborn innings of 4 from an hour at the crease ended when he drove Steven Finn to Kevin Pietersen low down in the gully. It was Finns fourth ball of the morning, and he struck again in his next over by snaring Kamran Akmal (0), though the wicketkeeper-batsman was unlucky to be given lbw.         
	Umar Gul, who slapped a career-best 65 not out in the first innings, was the eighth man to perish when he was brilliantly caught by Collingwood above his head at third slip.         
	Andersons maiden 10-wicket Test haul came when Shoaib Malik edged him to Collingwood, at ankle height. He added an 11th victim when last man Mohammed Asif (0) edged him to Graeme Swann at second slip.

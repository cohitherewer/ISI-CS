The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Spaniards aim to maim Paraguay
                                                                                                                       7                                        The Spaniards aim to maim Paraguay
            JAYDEEP BASU                                
	Johannesburg: Vicente del Bosque and Gerardo Martino will be taking their places in rival dugouts on Saturday, but, on the eve of their quarter final clash, the coaches, respectively, of Spain and Paraguay, were counting on much the same thing  their team creating history at Ellis Park.         
	Spain have never been in a World Cup semi-final and Del Bosque feels the time has come for them to break the jinx. Paraguays record, if anything, is even more unimpressive and the match against Spain will be their maiden last-eight appearance in the World Cup.         
	On Friday, when Del Bosque met a battery of newspersons, he confidently predicted that nothing could prevent his team from lifting the Cup, leave alone a lowly Paraguay in a round of eight meeting.         
	We know we are in good shape, especially after the Portugal match, the Spain coach said. We have been training together for a long time and the results are showing. We are here like a close knit unit and talking to each other regularly. All the players are eager to create history.         
	Del Bosque has every reason to feel confident. Slowly but surely, Spain, billed as favourites at the start of the World Cup, have steered their way through the group stages and the round of 16.         
	After the wake-up call following the defeat to Switzerland in their opening match, Spain registered impressive wins over their former colonies, Honduras and Chile, before overcoming the challenge of Portugal in the round of 16.         
	On paper, this contest could be described as a mismatch. Spain are the No.2-ranked team on the Fifa list and the reigning European champions. Paraguay, a nation of only six million people, are, on the other hand, placed 28th in the rankings.         
	More than anything, it is the presence of one man that would be giving the underdogs sleepless nights. With four goals, David Villa is jointly heads the leading scorers list at the World Cup and gives the impression that he is far from done.         
	With Fernando Torres yet to strike form, the burden of scoring falls on Villa, and he has to do it almost single-handedly. Apart from the four he got, the entire Spanish side have managed only one additional goal between them.         
	Villa is also on the verge of breaking the scoring record of Spanish legend Raul Gonzales who has 44 international goals to his credit. Villa has already found the back of the net 42 times for his country.         
	Like a true team player, Villa has come out strongly in support of Torres, his off-colour strike partner.         
	He may not have scored so far, but his desire to be with the team is spectacular. We all know what state his knee was in a month ago and I do not agree with the people who say that Torress performance has been below par, Villa said.         
	Paraguays problems are much bigger than that of Spain. The South Americans have scored only three goals on their way to the quarter finals with two of them coming against Slovakia. That is poor figures for a strike force comprising Oscar Cardozo, Roque Santa Cruz and Nelson Valdez, but Martino has strongly defended his forwards.

	Former Denmark forward Brian Laudrup has revealed he is undergoing treatment for cancer.         
	The 41 year-old, who enjoyed a highly successful spell with Rangers from 1994-98 during which time he won three league titles, has been diagnosed with a mild form of lymphoma.         
	I am obviously shocked by the diagnosis, but also know that there is now a tough battle ahead of me  a battle I will win, Laudrup told a television channel, where he works as a commentator.         
	Fortunately, I have had very optimistic reports from doctors to support me.         
	The former Bayern Munich, Fiorentina, Chelsea and Ajax star added: I now want to use my energy to get over the shock and take time with my family and those closest to me, so together we can move forward after this diagnosis.         
	Laudrup scored 21 goals in 82 matches for Denmark and helped his country to European Championship glory in 1992. He was named Danish Player of the Year on four occasions.

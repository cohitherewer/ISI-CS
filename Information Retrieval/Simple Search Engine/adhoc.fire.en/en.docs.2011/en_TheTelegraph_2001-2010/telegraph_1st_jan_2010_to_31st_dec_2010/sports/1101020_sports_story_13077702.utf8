The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India mentally stronger than Australia: Tait
                                                                                                                       7                                      India mentally stronger than Australia: Tait
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Mumbai: The ability to deliver the goods at crunch situations and a solid batting line-up are key reasons for Indias success against Australia in recent times, speedster Shaun Tait said on Tuesday.         
	India have done well in crunch situations. There was a time when Australia used to be good mentally in crunch time. Now, India have developed that quality, Tait said.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni led India to a clean sweep over Australia in a two-Test series to retain the Border- Gavaskar Trophy they won by identical margin in a four-match series at home in 2008-9.         
	India, led by Anil Kumble, also won the triangular series in Australia in 2007-08 after losing the Tests 2-1.         
	India have done well in the past few series. They are three up on Australia. Their bowling order is still mixed up, but their batting is solid. Its the best in the world, said Tait, who is recovering from an elbow injury and hence not a part of the touring party.         
	Not surprisingly, Tait was all praise for Sachin Tendulkar. He is the best player in the world. Australia and most of the other teams have struggled to bowl to him. You can ask any bowler how to bowl to him and they wont know. You have got to run him out these days, the quickie said.         
	Australia have won the last three World Cups on the trot, but with the next edition of crickets flagship event less than four months away, the defending champions hardly look the team to beat.         
	There are a few injuries ... Australia are sorting them out, Tait said.         
	There is a little bit of inexperience in the team. Both teams (India and Australia, presently engaged in an ODI series) would be thinking about the World Cup. Players would want to perform well and seal their berth in the World Cup squad, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good that Diego was crying, not us: Brehme
                                                                                                                       7                                      Good that Diego was crying, not us: Brehme
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Andreas Brehme, the man who scored the winning goal for Germany against Argentina in the 1990 World Cup final, said it was good that Diego Maradona was crying after the final and not the Germans. It was good that Diego was crying and not we. It was a very special moment in my life. Scoring the winning goal for my team, Brehme said at a media conference, here on Tuesday.         
	In the city for the Bayern Munich All Stars XI versus East Bengal All Stars XI charity match, Brehme said he was still undecided on which of his foot produced a better shot. I dont know. I think I have more power with my left, and more accuracy with the right, said the man who was one of the few players who could use both the feet. For the record, Brehme scored the penalty in 1986 against Mexico with his left-foot and used his right against Argentina in the 1990 World Cup final.         
	Brehme hailed Maradona as one of the most incredible players he has seen. I played against him in the Serie A during my Inter Milan days and also in national tournaments. He was an amazing player. But as a coach I am not sure about Maradona. He could not win the World Cup as coach in 2010 and was removed by the Argentine federation. I wish him all the best as a coach, he said.         
	 Meanwhile, Bayern held a clinic for young footballers and selected six of them to attend the FC Bayern Football camp in Germany.         
	The clinic was attended by 96 young football enthusiasts out of whom six winners were selected to be flown to the FC Bayern Football School. The clinic was held at the CC amp;FC ground.         
	The winners are Ram Chetri, Suman Rai, Donborlang Nongkynrih, Jacob Lalrawngbawla from Lajong and local boys Sanchayan Samadder and Simanta Murmu.         
	The six will be travelling to Germany for the two-week programme in August next year.

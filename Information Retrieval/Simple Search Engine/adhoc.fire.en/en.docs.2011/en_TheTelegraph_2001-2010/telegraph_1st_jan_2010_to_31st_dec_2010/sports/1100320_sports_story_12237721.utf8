The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan have upper hand
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bagan have upper hand
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans Edeh Chidi during a practice session on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans man of all seasons Jose Ramirez Barretos comment on the eve of his teams 17th round I-League encounter against Sporting Clube de Goa summed up the mood of camp.         
	If we have to get our championship campaign back on track, Saturdays match is a must-win encounter for us. Already we have drawn two matches. We cant afford to lose points against Clube tomorrow, Barreto told the mediapersons after their morning training session on Friday.         
	When Barreto was asked whether he will again take a spot-kick after missing an important one against JCT (he missed another one against East Bengal in Federation Cup), he said: Obviously, I dont have any problem taking penalties. I must admit that during the last game, I didnt do my homework I usually do before taking a spot-kick.         
	It will certainly be a match where the green-and-maroon brigade will like to log full points after losing four from their last two rounds against Pune FC at home and JCT in Ludhiana.         
	Saturday is the best chance for them, as they will be playing a team, who havent won a single match in this edition. Clube are currently languishing at the bottom of the 14-team table with only eight points.         
	But Barreto, as well as coach Satyajit Chatterjee, feels that it wont be a cakewalk against the Goan outfit. They are already in trouble and things cant get any worse for them. They will also try to go all out for a win. We should be careful, he said.         
	His apprehension is not wrong as Bagan have conceded 23 goals in 16 matches, whereas the basement club have conceded only three more goals than the fifth placed Calcutta giants. It will be an acid test for coach Vishwas Gaonkar whose boys will have to play out of their skin to breach the solid back-four comprising Surkumar Singh, Deepak Mondal, Rakesh Masih and N.S. Manju.         
	Ishfaq Ahmed, who normally plays on the wide left, will play on the right with Snehasish Chakraborty operating down the left. Marcos Perreira and Ryuji Sueoka will be the two providers for Chidi Edeh and Barreto.         
	However the 4.30 pm start in the searing heat is a cause of concern for the team.         
	The artificial surafce generates a lot of heat. Add to it the humidity and it becomes all the more difficult for the players, Chatterjee said.         
	The other worrying factor is card problems. Some of the players like Rakesh Masih, Deepak Mondal, Ishfaq Ahemd all have been booked once. Another yellow card will be catastrophic.

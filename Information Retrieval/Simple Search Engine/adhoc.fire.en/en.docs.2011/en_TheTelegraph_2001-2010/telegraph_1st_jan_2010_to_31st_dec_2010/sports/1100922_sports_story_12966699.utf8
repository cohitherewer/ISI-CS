The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sujan set to be joint secretary
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sujan set to be joint secretary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Strange are the ways of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). While at times their decisions call for applause, on some occasions they defy logic.         
	On Tuesday, sources in the CAB confirmed that Sujan Mukherjee of the Calcutta Customs Club will be elected unopposed as the new joint secretary, a post which was lying vacant after Arun Mitras demise. But what surprised many was the manner in which former assistant secretary Naresh Ojha, a frontrunner for the post till the other day, was dissuaded from filing his nomination.         
	The (CAB) president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, called me up this (Tuesday) afternoon and requested me not to file nomination for the post. I respect his decision and decided accordingly, Ojha said.         
	However, according to CAB insiders, the move came as some of the senior officials were against Ojhas appointment.         
	For the record, even a couple of seasons back, Mukherjee was from Dalmiyas opposition camp.

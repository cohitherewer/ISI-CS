	London: Spain striker Fernando Torres could miss his teams World Cup opener against Switzerland after undergoing knee surgery, Liverpools medical department said on Tuesday.         
	Torres suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee during the Europa League match against Benfica last month, ruling him out of Liverpools run-in, and the club said their priority was to make sure their leading striker was fully fit for next season.         
	Spain face Switzerland in their first match on June 16.         
	You cant be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup, Peter Brukner, Liverpools head of sports medicine and science, told the clubs website.         
	Spain are not the only heavyweights to have injury worries. Germany, too, have injury concerns of their own after first-choice goalkeeper Rene Adler and midfielder Simon Rolfes were Tuesday ruled out of the tournament through injury.         
	The 25-year-old Adler will undergo rib surgery and Rolfes, his Bayer Leverkusen teammate, has failed to recover from a knee injury which has kept him out of action for three months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wolves on the hunt for a United upset
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wolves on the hunt for a United upset
                      
	London: Wolverhampton Wanderers head to Manchester United for a League Cup match, on Tuesday, having shown they could give the defending champions a tough time  if manager Mick McCarthy picks a strong enough team.         
	McCarthy was warned by the Premier League last season for picking a weak side to play United as part of an effort to target other games he felt were realistically winnable.         
	He was arguably vindicated as Wolves avoided relegation, but Saturdays strong performance in a 2-0 defeat by Premier League leaders Chelsea and the chance of reaching a Cup quarter final may persuade McCarthy to field his first-choice side his time.         
	Wolves fell behind early at Stamford Bridge but competed well and had chances to equalise before Salomon Kalou killed off the game with a second goal nine minutes from the end.         
	We can take some confidence from it into the next few games, Wol-ves midfielder Matt Jarvis said. We played really well and maybe deserved something out of the game.         
	After Saturdays game, I think you can see were not afraid of playing against anyone. Weve played really well at Stamford Bridge and if we can keep playing like this in the next run of games Im sure well get something.         
	United fielded a mix of first-team regulars and backup players in the last round, when they won 5-2 at Scunthorpe, and are likely to do so again at Old Trafford.         
	The focus will be on Javier Hernandez, who scored two goals in the weekend EPL match, against Stoke City.         
	Also Tuesday, Birmingham host Brentford, Ipswich host Northampton, Sven-Goran Erikssons Leicester host West Bromwich Albion and Wigan manager Roberto Martinez meet his former team when Swansea visit the DW Stadium.         
	Birmingham will be without midfielder Alexsandr Hleb because of a twisted knee.                 
	On Wednesday, Aston Villa host Burnley, Newcastle host Arsenal, and West Ham  the Premier Leagues bottom side  host Stoke.         
	After winning his first two matches as manager of Villa, Gerard Houllier is without a win in three mat-ches after Saturdays 1-0 loss to Sunderland.         
	This team needs to have more faith and belief in itself, Houllier said.         
	Maybe because we are changing a few things, the philosophy of play. It will take time. We know where we are going but sometimes it looks as if they can do very well and they dont believe in that. We need to be more clinical, more lethal.         
	Nigel Reo-Coker is a candidate to captain Villa after fellow midfielder Stiliyan Petrov was ruled out for at least two weeks with knee ligament damage.         
	I trust him, very much, and he is doing a good job for the team, Houllier said.         
	West Ham, meanwhile, will hope the return to Cup competition provides some respite from their struggle against relegation in the Premier League.         
	The Hammers led Newcastle 1-0, on Saturday, but quickly conceded an equaliser and capitulated in the second half to lose for the fifth time in nine league games. (Agencies)

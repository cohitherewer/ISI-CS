	Johannesburg: Fifa will watch for any further signs of political interference in Nigerian soccer after a dispute with the government almost led to the suspension of the local football federation, it said on Tuesday.         
	Soccers ruling body on Monday lifted a threat to suspend Nigeria from all Fifa-related activities, including an annual grant of $250,000, after President Goodluck Jonathan reversed a ban on the national team participating in international competitions as punishment for their poor World Cup performance.         
	The Presidents decision, which narrowly beat a Fifa deadline, came after the federation pledged to disband the side and rebuild it following the Super Eagles failure to win a game during their first round elimination from the World Cup.

                                                                                                                       7                                        A beautiful batting wicket: Watson
            A CORRESPONDENT            Shane Watson, in Bangalore, on Saturday                           
	Bangalore: Shane Watson, whose 57 produced a 99-run opening stand with Simon Katich on Saturday, was all praise for the Chinnaswamy wicket.         
	The all-rounder said it was disappointing that none of the Australian batsmen could convert their starts into big scores on the opening day.         
	The disappointing thing about today (Saturday) was that not one of us was able to go on and get a big score because it is a beautiful batting wicket, Watson said.         
	He, however, added that he was confident that the visitors would be able to put up a challenging first innings total, in the ongoing Test.                   
	I could have scored a century plus runs as it is a very good batting strip. It is disappointing. But, we are sure that we will be able to post a good total in sub-continental conditions Close to the one that we did in Mohali, he said.         
	Watson, who had scored a century in the first Test, said that Marcus North held the key to Sundays play.         
	Marcus is looking very good and he started his innings very well The majority of balls were coming off the middle of his bat. It was really nice to see It is always great to see Marcus in full flight because he is a beautiful bat when he gets going, Watson said.         
	It will be very nice for him and for the team to be able to post a good score because it is a really nice batting wicket. So we need to post a good score, he added.

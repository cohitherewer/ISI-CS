                                                                                                                       7                                      Hughes joins as cover for Katich
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Sydney: New South Wales opening batsman Phillip Hughes has joined the Australian team in Sydney as cover for Simon Katich ahead of the second Test against Pakistan which begins Sunday.         
	The national selection panel (NSP) made the announcement Saturday.         
	Andrew Hilditch, chairman of the selection panel, said: The NSP has taken the opportunity to add Phillip Hughes to the Australian squad as cover for Simon Katich, who is struggling from the injury to his arm sustained during the Test at the MCG. A decision on the final make up of the Test team will be taken in the morning.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan will be without pacer Mohammed Aamer as they aim to level the series. In the absence of the impressive Aamer, whose five-wicket haul in Melbourne was not enough to avert a 170-run defeat in the first Test, Pakistan is expected to include Mohammed Sami in the playing eleven.         
	Among others, leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and pacer Umar Gul are set to replace off-spinner Saeed Ajmal and seamer Abdur Rauf.

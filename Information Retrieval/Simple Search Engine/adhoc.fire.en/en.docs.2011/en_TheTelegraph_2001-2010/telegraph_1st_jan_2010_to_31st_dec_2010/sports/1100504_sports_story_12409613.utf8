	Georgetown: England batsmen put in a great performance to pile up 191 for five in their campaign opener against the West Indies in the World Twenty20, here Monday.         
	Eoin Morgan starred with a 35-ball 55. His fifth wicket partnership with Luke Wright (45 off 27 balls) yielded 85 runs, taking England past the 180-run mark. England openers Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter made a strong start, racing to 36 in just 3.4 overs before West Indies captain Chris Gayle bowled Lumb.         
	Lumb, making his England debut, hit four boundaries in his 28-run innings (off 18 balls). Kieswetter, another young gun, scored 26 with the help of one boundary and three sixes.

  - Indian Open Manav lets it slip; Atwal ends tied fifth       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Swedens Rikard Karlberg after winning the Indian Open, in New Delhi, on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	New Delhi: Manav Jaini came agonisingly close to winning his maiden Asian Tour title but Swedens Rikard Karlberg had the last laugh in the Hero Honda Indian Open, at the Delhi Golf Club, on Sunday.         
	On a day of fluctuating fortunes, 24-year-old Karlberg (70) carded a total of 11-under 277 to earn a two-shot victory over overnight leader Baek Seuk-hyun of Korea, who ended with a nine-under performance.         
	It feels unbelievable. I came here with a goal to win but its still quite unbelievable that I actually did it, said the Swede, who celebrated his birthday earlier this week and got richer by $198, 125.         
	However, despite all the dramatic changes that one witnessed in the last couple of hours on the final day, the crowd returned home a slightly disappointed because of Jainis erratic performance on the back-nine.         
	It left his overall total at eight-under 280 for a tied third finish along with compatriot Shiv Kapur.         
	Indias only PGA Tour winner Arjun Atwal signed a steady three-under 69 on the final day and overall seven-under to end tied fifth along with Mukesh Kumar (71) and Ashok Kumar (69) while three-time champion Jyoti Randhawa returned a 72 to be tied 17th with a total of 284.         
	Jaini, the 27-year-old, started on a great note as he charged into the lead with five birdies in a blemish free front-nine which included a hattrick from the first to the third hole, but dropped costly shots on the 10th, 16th and 17th holes to see the title slip through his fingers.         
	I am extremely disappointed, admitted a crestfallen Jaini. I didnt hit it badly through 18 holes. Just made a few wrong decisions.         
	On 17, I went for the flag when I should have gone for the heart of the green and tried to hole a long one. I just came off from a bogey on 16 it troubled me the whole week.         
	I think I made two or three bogeys there this week. Off the tee I was just uncomfortable, Jaini added.         
	While Jaini gave away the advantage, Karlberg fought tooth and nail and seized the initiative with a shaky 20-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole which gave him a two-shot cushion.         
	In the 18th, he blasted the ball into the sponsors marquee and was left with the only option of a rather difficult chip to hold par.         
	The Swede, however, did a superb job after taking a free drop and sensationally holed out his fourth for an unlikely birdie before screaming in delight to the raptures of a large gallery around the 18th green.         
	I made great up and downs all week. The first day, it felt solid and then I struggled a bit. My short game has been unbelievable. I feel comfortable on the greens, he said.         
	Kapur, on the other hand, was happy after returning a five-under 67 in the fourth round, his best card of the week.         
	Today (Sunday) was a really good day and it is a shame we could not fight for the win. My putting has not been as good as it should have been over the first few rounds but I am really happy with my performance, Kapur said.         
	I had a really good chance to win here but it did not happen and I will be back next year to try again. I really enjoy playing here and the crowd support has been fantastic as well, he added.

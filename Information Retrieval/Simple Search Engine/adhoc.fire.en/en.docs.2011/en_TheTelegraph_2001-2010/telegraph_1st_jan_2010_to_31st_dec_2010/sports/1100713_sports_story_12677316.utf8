The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Final blackened by too much yellow
                                                                                                                       7                                      Final blackened by too much yellow
            ROB HUGHES                                  Referee Howard Webb flashed the yellow card 13 times and reached for the red once      
	Justice took almost until time ran out, almost until a dreaded shootout, to arrive in this World Cup final.         
	For 115 minutes, the Dutch players had done what they said they were prepared to do: they played ugly. They blamed their history, feeling that the team inspired by Johan Cruyff in the 1970s lost in spite of their talent. On Sunday, seemingly afraid of the gifted Spaniards, they simply opted to knock them down.         
	There has never been so foul an intent in the 40 years I have watched the World Cup. Sadly, the English referee Howard Webb added to it by handing out only yellow cards to eight Dutch players.         
	The red stayed in his pocket until extra time when John Heitinga, who had already received a yellow card for an earlier foul, brought down Andres Iniesta to prevent a scoring chance. In some soccer circles that is seen as a team-oriented act, deliberately accepting a second card to prevent what could have been the winning goal.         
	It stands up there, or down there, with Luis Suarezs deliberate handball to prevent a go-ahead goal by Ghana in the final seconds of a game Uruguay went on to win.         
	Long before Heitinga was sent off, Webb had the ability to protect the Spanish players from numerous fouls by the Dutch, notably by Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong.         
	The most vicious of those fouls came 28 minutes in when de Jong booted Xabi Alonso in the rib cage, a play that in many games would have resulted in his dismissal.         
	Webb chose to give him a yellow card, and the mayhem went on.         
	Yes, the Spanish players retaliated, sometimes with kicks of their own. But when a team are in the World Cup final against an opponent that has said it is prepared to win ugly, they have no choice but to defend themselves and show that they will not be intimidated.         
	When Spains goal finally came, it arrived with beauty. Iniesta had been the outstanding player on the field, and was probably the most fouled as well.         
	When his chance came, off a pass by the substitute Cesc Fbregas, he did not hesitate. His volley into the opposite corner of the net was a difficult play at the best of times. In the 116th minute of the World Cup final, with his legs bruised from the kicking and his energy level sapped, it was truly exceptional.         
	Iniesta then took off his jersey to reveal a white undershirt. It was inscribed Dani Jarque Siempre Con Nosotros  Dani Jarque, always with us. Jarque was a player on Espanyol, the rival team to FC Barcelona in the same Catalan city. He died of a heart attack in August 2009, at age 26.         
	Iniesta was given an automatic yellow card for taking off his jersey.         
	I wanted to carry Dani Jarque with me, and so did the other players, Iniesta said. And I think this was the best tribute.         
	Fifa is uncompromising when it comes to this rule. Any player who removes his shirt when celebrating a goal, regardless of reason or sentiment, receives a yellow card.         
	So Iniesta, the best player in this World Cup final, received the same punishment that players like van Bommel and de Jong received for hard fouls that had the potential to injure.         
	The correct team won the World Cup. Spain had overcome Germany in the semi-final. They had withstood the Netherlands attempts to kick their star players out of the final.         
	Iniesta had shown some humanity with his gesture, and taken the consequences. And he triumphed in a final game that almost shamed the tournament The Dutch, when they reflect on their performance, will know that they threw away a great opportunity. The two best teams in the world were on the field in Soccer City stadium, but one of them was not content to let skill decide the game. Thankfully, they lost.

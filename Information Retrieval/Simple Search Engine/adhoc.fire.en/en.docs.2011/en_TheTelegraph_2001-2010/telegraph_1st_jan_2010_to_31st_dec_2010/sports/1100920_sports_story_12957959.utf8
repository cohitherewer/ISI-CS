  - Hosts to meet in-form Iranians in the summit clash today       A STAFF REPORTER            Indian players after their win against Pakistan, at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: In the sporting world, some rivalries are like hotcakes  something which has an eternal demand and which carries with itself the burden of expectations of being a delicious affair.         
	However, when the steam vanishes even before you get a proper bite of the situation, the only thing you are left with is a bad taste.         
	An India-Pakistan encounter, be it at an outdoor cricket ground or an indoor volleyball court, is always mouth-watering. But on Sunday, at the 3rd Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship, the Indians had a cakewalk, literally, humbling Pakistan 25-17, 25-15, 25-22. The win earned the hosts a ticket to the final where they will clash with title favourites Iran, who beat Kazakhstan 25-20, 25-10, 25-19 in the first match of the day.         
	Having lost their earlier two matches, Pakistan were expected to give their best on the day, especially as it was against archrivals India.         
	But poor serves, lackadaisical on-court movements and blunt attacks by the Pakistan team ensured that expectations were smashed out of the Netaji Indoor Stadium.         
	The first set belonged entirely to the Indians as they garnered points with ease, both for themselves and their opponents. Most of the Pakistan points were gifts from the Indians, with over-confidence and loss of concentration at play. Some solid smashes by the likes Gurchand Singh were peppered with some faulty serves.         
	The second set began with the promise of better competition with both the sides locked at 4-4 at one stage. However, the Indians, clearly superior with their skills soon took the lead and maintained that to run away with the set.         
	The Pakistan players tried their best in the third, but even that was not enough. Down 11-18 at one stage, Pakistan showed some urgency as they cut the lead to 18-23.         
	Libero Shah Rukh had a busy game and was impressive with his timely interceptions. But the Indians, led by Sanjay Kumar, kept their cool and few smashes and some blocks later the set and match was sealed.         
	India coach Deshraj was happy with the teams show. We played a fantastic match today. Everything went according to our plan. If we can repeat the performance tomorrow, we do have a good chance. The crowd support too is great, he said.         
	Captain Sanjay admitted that it wont be easy against Iran. They are the favourites It will be a tough match. But all the members of our first team are fit and we will give our best in the final, he said.         
	Pakistan coach Augusto Sabbatini blamed poor planning for their hapless show. There was such confusion about our participation in this meet that it hampered our preparation. Poor travel arrangements didnt help either, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Red Bull Mark rages to win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Red Bull Mark rages to win
                      
	Silverstone: Mark Webber cruised to his third Formula One victory of the season on Sunday after overtaking Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel on the opening lap of the British Grand Prix.         
	The Australian finished 1.36 seconds ahead of championship leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren in second.         
	Webber led throughout after controversially pushing pole-sitter Vettel wide on the opening lap at Silverstone. I was obviously keen to make it my corner and it worked out well for me, Webber said. The car was faultless all day.         
	Vettel, who won the British GP last year, recovered to finish seventh after also picking up a puncture in the opening lap and being forced to the back of the field.         
	Hamilton leads the overall standings with 145 points, 12 ahead of McLaren teammate Jenson Button on 133. Webber is now third with 128.         
	Not bad for a number two driver, Webber quipped over his radio as he celebrated his victory lap.         
	Webbers car was equipped with the old version of Red Bulls front wing for qualifying Saturday after the new design was stripped and handed to Vettel, who subsequently took pole.         
	Webber had still felt aggrieved in the pits in the minutes before the race started, conceding that he wasnt too happy about the decision.         
	Hopefully it will be a pretty straightforward race, with the starting positions reversed, he said.         
	It turned out more than that  with Webber surging into the lead and Vettel slipping right to the back early on.         
	Struggling at the back, it took the safety car on lap 31 of 52 to enable Vettel to pick up pace and start overhauling his slower rivals.         
	The main beneficiary of Vettels disastrous start was Hamilton, with the 2008 champion moving up two places to second ahead of the German and Fernando Alonso.         
	Nico Rosberg of Mercedes claimed third depriving Jenson Button of his first podium finish on home soil as the defending world champion climbed 10 places from 14th on the grid to finish fourth.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil finished eighth to add four valuable points to his teams tally. His teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi finished 11th. Karun Chandhok came 19th, ahead of his Hispania teammate Sakon Yamamoto.

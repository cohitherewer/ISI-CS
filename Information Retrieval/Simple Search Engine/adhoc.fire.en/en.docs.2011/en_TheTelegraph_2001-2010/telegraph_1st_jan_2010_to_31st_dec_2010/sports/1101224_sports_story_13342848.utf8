            A STAFF REPORTER            Jerry Zirsanga (left) and Lalkamal Bhowmick, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: They may not satisfy the purists and they still do not have the look of champions, but Chirag United were happy with a 1-0 win over HAL in their fifth round I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	With technical director Subrata Bhattacharya still convalescing, Chirag have done well under coach Sanjoy Sen. A draw and a win is encouraging, but the series of fluffed chances may gradually dent the teams hopes as the league progresses. Sen, who was not over the moon with his teams performance, Thursday, said hes happy with the victory but theres a lot to be desired from the team. We are creating chances, thats a plus. But that we are wasting too many of them is something that may hurt our progress in future, Sen said.         
	Chirags Brazilian forward Joshimar had a game to forget when he shot wide from close range in the 18 th minute and missed an open net in the 41st minute when his header off Gauranga Biswass cross sailed over the target.         
	The Arnab Mandal-led side wont mind grinding their way to the top. But Joshimars increasing penchant for shoddy finish might force the thinktank to have a word with the striker. Though Sen said, theres no need to push the panic button, Joshimars slipshod finish in the 77th minute will have any team seething at the sideline. Junior Elijah latched on to a long ball and released Joshimar on the run. But the striker, who just had the keeper to beat, chose to finish with a feeble shot into P Pramods hands.         
	However, Jerry Zirsangas goal in added time gave the hosts lead before the lemon break. Elijah, who appealed for a foul in the area, picked up a pass from Bapi Saha after referee Yaima Singh played advantage. The Nigerian cut in sharply and played it to Jerry, who drove it past P Pramod for the teams only goal.         
	Chirag cried foul when Yaima turned down what looked like a penalty after R Srikanth brought down Gauranga inside the box. But other than that the hosts have to blame themselves for failing to win by a bigger margin. Its time Chirag got out of the second gear.

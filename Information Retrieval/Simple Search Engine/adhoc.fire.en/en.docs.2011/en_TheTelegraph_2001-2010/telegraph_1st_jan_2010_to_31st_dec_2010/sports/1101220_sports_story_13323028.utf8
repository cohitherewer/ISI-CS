	Calcutta: USPA Cavalry won the Rising Sun Polo tournament, beating Navy Bombay 12-6.5 at the Pat Williamson Polo Grounds, on Sunday. This was the first tournament of the polo season.         
	Navy Bombay began with a 1 and half point advantage due to the difference in total team handicap, but the USPA proved too strong for them. Major Vishal Chauhan emerged the top scorer with five goals. Col. Tarun Sirohi scored four, while Major Ravi Rathore managed three goals.         
	For the losing side, Major Faiz Siddqui and Cdr A P Singh scored two goals each while Mitesh Mehta scored one.

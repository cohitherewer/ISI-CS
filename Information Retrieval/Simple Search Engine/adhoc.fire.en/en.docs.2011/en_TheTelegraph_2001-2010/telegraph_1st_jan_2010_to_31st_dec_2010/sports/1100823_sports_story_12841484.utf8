            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England selectors named a 12-man squad for the fourth and final Test at Lords, commencing Thursday.         
	Yorkshire pace bowler Tim Bresnan is the only addition to the squad that lost to Pakistan by four wickets at the Oval in the third Test.         
	There were some real positives from the last Test, such as Alastair Cooks outstanding century and the way the team fought hard on the final day defending a small total. Ultimately, the team is looking for an improved performance, to finish the series well, said England national selector Geoff Miller.         
	We have been saying throughout this entire series that consistency is key and that certainly remains the case. We know Pakistan are a dangerous side so we will be looking for a strong performance in this final Test match of the summer.         
	The squad: Andrew Strauss (Capt.), James Anderson, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott.

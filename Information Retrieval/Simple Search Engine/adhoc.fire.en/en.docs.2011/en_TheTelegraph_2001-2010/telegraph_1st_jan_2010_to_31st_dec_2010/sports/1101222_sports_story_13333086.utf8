The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chawla is brought back from the cold
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chawla is brought back from the cold
    - Sachin set to play his 1st ODI since February           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                  Sachin Tendulkar and Piyush Chawla                                 
	Calcutta: That Piyush Chawla, 21, can be counted upon to contribute with the bat and save runs in the field has helped him make a comeback.         
	Leggie Chawla, who last played in a 50-over International as far back as July 2008 (Asia Cup, in Pakistan) is in the 16 for the one-off T20 International and the five ODIs in South Africa.         
	The matches will be played next month, after the three-Test series.         
	Chawla edged out fellow-leggie Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha (left-arm spinner)... Usually, leggies stand a good chance of breaking partnerships... With Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh certainties in the 11, Chawla, if he plays, would bring variety, a top source told The Telegraph.         
	The selectors had a telephonic discussion on Monday evening and the Board announced the squad on Tuesday afternoon.         
	With Narendra Hirwani and Surendra Bhave in South Africa, only chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma and Raja Venkat are currently in India.         
	According to the top source, Srikkanth and his colleagues had more or less informally decided on 13 names when they met in Mumbai, last week, to choose the 30 World Cup probables.         
	Sreesanth, Munaf Patel and Chawla made it after Srikkanth probably had a word with the coach, Gary Kirsten, the top source pointed out.         
	On paper, its an awesome squad and at least 12  Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Praveen Kumar  look certain to feature in the World Cup 15.         
	Theres no second wicket-keeper, though. In an emergency, young Kohli may have to wear the big gloves.         
	Also not in the 16 is Ishant Sharma.         
	With the big guns returning, the talented Saurabh Tiwary has had to miss out, but he shouldnt get disheartened. Somebody like Ravindra Jadeja, however, needs to put in 200 per cent.         
	Sachin, by the way, is in an ODI squad for the first time since February. In between, he either wanted to be rested or had an injury.         
	His last appearance, too, had been against South Africa (Gwalior, when history was scripted).         
	The T20 International is on January 9, with the ODIs scheduled between January 12-23. For India, it will be the last series before the World Cup.         
	Interest, one assumes, would be huge  irrespective of how the ongoing Test series ends.

	Port Elizabeth: Juan Theron took three wickets for the second successive match as the Warriors reduced Victoria Bushrangers to 130 for nine, Monday, for a 28-run win in a Group A match at the Champions League Twenty20.         
	Theron started his second spell by removing Andrew McDonald and then bowled Matthew Wade and Clinton McKay as the Warriors wrapped up their second win in two games in the tournament.         
	Theron finished with three for 22 off four overs.         
	Earlier, skipper David Jacobs smashed a classy fifty but Warriors suffered a mini-collapse to post a competitive 158 for six .         
	Jacobs blasted a 39-ball 59 bejeweled with nine fours and a six, while Mark Boucher (31) and Johan Botha (20) made some useful contributions down the order to help the Warriors cross the 150-mark. For Victoria, Andrew McDonald was the peak of the bowlers, scalping two wickets, while Dirk Nannes, Clint McKay and Shane Harwood took one each.         
	Electing to bat, Warriors were off to a rollicking start as openers David Jacobs and Ashwell Prince picked up fours at will to race away to 54 in first five overs.         
	Jacobs started the proceedings, clubbing three fours off Dirk Nannes in the first over, before clobbering another boundary in the second ball off Shane Harwood.         
	Prince then brought up his first boundary, sending Harwood across the short fine leg boundary as Warriors raced to 29 in first two overs.         
	Nannes and Clint McKay tried to slow things down by bowling two tight overs but Jacobs was simply unstoppable as he blasted three fours and a six to score 19 runs in the next over, bringing up his teams fifty on the way. Jacobs and Prince kept the scoreboard ticking, taking some quick singles and converting ones into twos.         
	The Warriors skipper brought up his fifty with a four off Andrew McDonald in the seventh over but a mix-up drew curtains to his innings in the 10th over.         
	Four balls later, McDonald removed Prince as all of a sudden the Warriors slipped to 83 for two. Warriors then lost two more quick wickets in Colin Ingram (8) and Justin Kreusch (1) within a space of five balls as Victoria bounced back .         
	Ingram perished when his swipe shot off Harwood found Maxwell at long-on, while Justin was done in by a quick stumping off McDonald.           (AGENCIES)

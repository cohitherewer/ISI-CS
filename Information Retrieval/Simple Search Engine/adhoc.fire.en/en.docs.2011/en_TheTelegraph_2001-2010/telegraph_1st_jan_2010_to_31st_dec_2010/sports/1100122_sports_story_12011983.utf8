The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutias fancy their chances
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhutias fancy their chances
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Rennedy Singh and Bhaichung on Thursday. A Telegraph picture    
	Calcutta: If the East Bengal players believe that they can get their I-League campaign back on track, Fridays 11th round encounter against Churchill Brothers gives them an ideal platform to do so. And why not? Because everyday, a team doesnt get a chance to square up with the Goan outfit without their skipper and talismanic Nigerian striker Okolie Odafe.         
	Odafe is out with double booking but has come with the team as Churchill will leave for Shillong from Calcutta for their next I-League campaign against Lajong FC.         
	East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder should be a relieved man as Churchill skippers menacing presence would have meant danger for his back four.         
	Churchill will also miss their key players like Robert, Khan Tang Paite (out for the remaining season) and Charan Rai. Felix Chimawuku will be lone man upfront for visitors. However, the profligacy of his forwards is his biggest worry.         
	It will be interesting to see whether De Ridder desperate to get three points gives senior pro Bhaichung Bhutia a start in this key clash. Although the coach insisted that Bhutia is slowly getting back into the groove but this will be one match where the home team can think of going with three forwards in Yusif Yakubu, Abel Hammond and Bhutia.         
	If Bhutia remains in the reserves then it will be Yakubu and Hammond upfront with Sanju Pradhan operatting from the right.

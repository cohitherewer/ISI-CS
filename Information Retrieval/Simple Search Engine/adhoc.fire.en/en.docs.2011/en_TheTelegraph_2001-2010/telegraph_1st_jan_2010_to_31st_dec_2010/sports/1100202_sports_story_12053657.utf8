            A STAFF REPORTER            Leander Paes                           
	Calcutta: Newly-crowned Australian Open mixed doubles champion Leander Paes Monday rose a rung to seventh in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) doubles ranking, displacing one-time partner Mahesh Bhupathi in the latest list.         
	Paes has 5575 ranking points, while Bhupathi lost a spot to slip to eighth with 5015.         
	Paes had made the quarter finals in the Australian Open mens doubles event with Czech Lukas Dlouhy. He clinched the mixed doubles championship Sunday with Zimbabwean Cara Black.         
	Bhupathi, on the other hand, had a forgettable outing at Melbourne Park, losing in the very first round of the mens doubles event due to a calf muscle injury.         
	The veteran later pulled out of the mixed doubles event in which he was to team up with compatriot Sania Mirza.         
	Sania, meanwhile, also slipped down three rungs to 59th following her second-round exit from the Australian Open in the Womens Tennis Association chart. However, she rose five places to 33rd in the doubles chart.         
	In the ATP singles tour, Rafael Nadal slipped two spots to be ranked at fourth after pulling out of the quarter finals against Andy Murray in the recently concluded Australian Open. Nadal hurt his knee again.         
	Also, Murray moved up one spot to No. 3 after losing to Federer in the Slam final Sunday. Fast-rising Croat Marin Cilic entered the top-10 for the first time, after making a Slam semi-final last week.         
	In the WTA chart, Li Na became the first Chinese player to break through the top-10 barrier after making the Australian Open semi-final, losing to eventual champion Serena Williams.

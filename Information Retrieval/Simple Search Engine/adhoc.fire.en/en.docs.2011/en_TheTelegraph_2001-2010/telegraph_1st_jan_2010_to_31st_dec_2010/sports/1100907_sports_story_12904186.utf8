            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After Aryan shocked defending champions Mohun Bagan last Saturday, it was the turn of Premier League debutants Southern Samity to create an upset as they defeated last years runners-up Chirag United 1-0, at the Barasat Stadium, on Monday.         
	Although Chirag dominated proceedings for the better part of the match, it was an early goal by striker Francis Xavier that settled the issue for Southern.         
	After a hattrick of losses, it was a welcome victory for Southern  especially coach I.M. Vijayan. It was a fitting reply to those who wanted to remove the former India captain from coachs post.         
	Post victory, Vijayan and his boys will get some more time to settle down. The Man-of-the-Match was awarded to Southern goalkeeper Amit Singha Roy who effected a couple of good saves.         
	Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya will have to do some serious thinking about his team, as they have been least impressive in their encounters.

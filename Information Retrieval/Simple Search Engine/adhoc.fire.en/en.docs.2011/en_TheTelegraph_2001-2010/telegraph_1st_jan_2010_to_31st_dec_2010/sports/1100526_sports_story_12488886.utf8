The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kimiko rolls back the years, ousts Safina
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kimiko rolls back the years, ousts Safina

	Paris: Victory was hardly painless for Kimiko Date-Krumm on Tuesday at the French Open. Deep in the third set with her right calf wrapped tightly in tape, she winced between points, limped toward her chair during the final changeovers and stretched the calf gingerly when she could.         
	It is no small challenge for a woman on the verge of her 40th birthday to win sets against the younger set, but Date-Krumm has proven that she belongs, truly belongs, back at this level after returning to the tour in earnest last year. She has proven it on multiple continents and multiple surfaces, and on Tuesday, she made one of her loudest statements yet with her first-round upset of Dinara Safina, the former world No.1 from Russia.         
	It was Date-Krumms first main-draw match at the French Open in 14 years, and her 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory made her the oldest woman to win a singles match at Roland Garros since Virginia Wade, the British champion, reached the second round in 1985 when she was three months older than Date-Krumm is at the moment.         
	Date-Krumm might have found the sultry weather unbearable as she went about thrashing out the upset but the favourite for the means title, four-time champion Rafa Nadal, enjoyed a workout in the muggy Paris heat on Tuesday as he dispatched teenager Gianni Mina 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 in his opening round match.         
	Nadal, who suffered his only defeat at Roland Garros in last years fourth round, was rarely stretched by the 18-year-old French wildcard, and the hustling Mallorcan delighted the Court Suzanne Lenglen crowd to a trademark rampaging win.         
	Nadal extended his Paris career record to 32-1 when Mina sent a forehand ballooning over the baseline.         
	Justine Henin took a big step in her return from retirement by beating Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4, 6-3 in her first-round match. The match was Henins first on centre court at Roland Garros since 2007, when she won the tournament for the fourth time.         
	Date-Krumm tried and failed to qualify for the French Open last year. The last time she played in the tournament was in 1996, when she was still a member of the top 10 and lost in the fourth round to Lindsay Davenport.         
	By the end of that season, she had retired young, weary of the spotlight. But she is demonstrating quite a second wind and has now climbed back to No.72 in the world and should climb a little more with the points she acquired on the Suzanne Lenglen court on Tuesday.         
	At least until now, Safina had fond memories of the Lenglen court, Roland Garross second show court. It is where she rallied to defeat Maria Sharapova in 2006 and then again in 2008, from match point down, on her way to the final. Safina made her way back to the final here again last year before losing her nerve and, too often, her serve against her Russian compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova.         
	It was the beginning of a downward spiral, and as stirring as it was to see Date-Krumm scamper across the clay and punch through the pain and age barrier on Tuesday, Safina is much easier prey on clay than she was in recent years.         
	Date-Krumm, who will turn 40 in September, may have trouble generating any more momentum at Roland Garros this year. She will next face Jarmila Groth, an Australian who once represented Slovakia and who is less accustomed than Date-Krumm to Grand Slam pressure.         
	Meanwhile, Andy Roddick, for whom a first-round exit would have been hard to explain despite the uncertainties and the rocky past, narrowly avoided such a fate on Tuesday, outlasting Finlands Jarkko Nieminen, 6-2, 4-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.         
	In a late match, Maria Sharapova reached the second round by easily beating Russian qualifier Ksenia Pervak. Trying to win the only Grand Slam title missing from her resume, the 12th-seeded Sharapova eliminated 110th-ranked Pervak 6-3, 6-2 Tuesday.         
	Sharapovas best showing at Roland Garros was the 2007 semi-finals. She missed time this season with a right elbow injury, but won a clay-court warm-up at Strasbourg last weekend.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Funds on AIFF agenda today
                                                                                                                       7                                      Funds on AIFF agenda today
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) would be faced with the difficult task of raising enough funds for the national squad when it meets in the capital on Friday to finalise the teams Asian Cup preparatory programme this year.         
	In 2009, the committee chalked out the ambitious Goal 2011 project that would empower the AIFF to keep an elite group of 25 to 30 players exclusively for national duty till the Doha Asian Cup in January 2011. A plan was also made to pay these players as per their existing market rates to stop them from playing club football.         
	On Friday, we are supposed to give a final shape to the project but the cash flow could be a hindrance, said an AIFF official. To pay these players till January next year, we need at least Rs 5-7 crore, he said.         
	The official said that the national coach Bob Houghton had already submitted his list of players.         
	They are all big names of Indian football and command high price from their respective clubs. With a couple of our sponsors paying irregularly, raising that amount could be a problem, he said.         
	Recently, the AIFF has managed to rope in another sponsor for the national team but the entire money could be spent on other heads.         
	The coach has planned camps in Dubai and later in the year in Spain or Portugal . We also have plans to play at least half a dozen friendly matches against some of the top national teams in Asia . The expenditure would be huge, the official said.         
	The national team will be leaving for a three-week training camp in Dubai in the first week of February.         
	Efforts are on to play a match against United Arab Emirates before returning to India. Once the I-League is over in May, the boys would be asked to report back to the camp.         
	The executive committee is also likely to reduce the number of foreign players in the I-League and bar the I-League players from taking part in the Santosh Trophy.

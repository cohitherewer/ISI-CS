	Hyderabad: Dinesh Karthiks attacking, unbeaten 161, laced with 23 hits to the fence, put South Zone in front against West Zone in an empty Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium here Tuesday.         
	Karthiks superb innings comes after the national selectors picked Bengals Wriddhiman Saha ahead of him as Indias second wicket-keeper for the series against South Africa.         
	The Hyderabad Cricket Association decided to not allow spectators in the stadium, fearing crowd trouble due to the political situation in Andhra Pradesh.         
	The absence of any support appeared to have had its effect on South in the initial stages of their innings, as the West pacers made their mark, dismissing the openers with just 34 on the board.         
	In conditions favourable for batting, and given the importance of the first-innings lead, South would have been disappointed with the start they got.         
	But the middle order stepped up. Ganesh Satish scored a patient half-century before being dismissed with the score on 120, but Karthik, by then, was well set.         
	He was involved in a stand of 121 with wicket-keeper M. Gautam (49), and 89 with Rohan Prem (24), to guide his side beyond 300.         
	Irfan Pathans three-for was a highlight for West, but Karthiks presence at the crease, with the scoreboard reading 356 for six, should provide enough encouragement for South to put up a substantial score .

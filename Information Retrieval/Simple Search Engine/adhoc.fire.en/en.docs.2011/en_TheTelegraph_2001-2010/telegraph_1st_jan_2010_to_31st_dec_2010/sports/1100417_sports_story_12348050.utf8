The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights seek redemption at the Eden
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights seek redemption at the Eden
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Will Eden Gardens, on Saturday, dish out a result similar to the outcome in Durban on May 20 of last year? Will the 53rd match of IPL III replicate the 53rd match of IPL II?         
	Call it coincidence if you like, but the fact is that the situation surrounding the Kolkata Knight Riders versus Rajasthan Royals match on Saturday is pretty similar to their clash in the Indian Premier League last year.         
	The Knights rounded off their awful campaign last year in South Africa by surprisingly beating the Royals by four wickets with the result shutting out Shane Warnes hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals.         
	A similar result this season will condemn the Royals to the same fate. The only difference is that, unlike last year, on the eve of the match this time, the Knights are mathematically not out yet of the semi-final race, and so not everything is lost really.         
	For Warne and Co., however, a mere victory will not suffice, it has to be by a handsome margin as well, if they are to keep their chances alive.         
	Defeats in their last two matches have undone the great comeback that Warne and his band of young and mostly inexperienced fighters effected in this edition. They began the tournament on a disastrous note, recovered midway and have again plunged into emptiness in the closing stages of the meet.         
	Sourav Gangulys team, on the other hand, started off with a bang, defeating last seasons defending champions and runners-up in their first two matches.         
	However, their roller-coaster performance graph (every time, after they won a match, they managed to somehow flop in the very next) has done little to keep principal owner Shah Rukh Khan smiling.         
	The Knights, who played a practice match among themselves on Friday, will give it their best to at least ensure the Shah Rukh has something nice to tweet about. For that to happen, the team management will have to unravel the mystery of getting the team combination right. Strange selections and stranger omissions have been behind KKRs steady progress backwards.         
	Chris Gayle didnt take an active part in practice on Friday. But captain Ganguly informed that the West Indian star was expected to be available on the morrow.         
	Shane Bond, it appears, has been hired to warm up benches while the Dindas and Agarkars get smacked around the park like truants taken to task.         
	Knights helmsman Sourav, however, was not short of motivation. Even after the practice session was over, the southpaw was seen practising a few hits in the nets alone. That sight alone should be enough to charge up the beleagured Knights.         
	The Royals will hope that Yusuf Pathan gets his canon-ball hits right and Shane Watson manages to do justice to the all-rounder tag on his cap.         
	The 40-year-old Warne will also play a crucial role, not only in exploiting the dry Eden track, but also in being the torch-bearer for a side whose success depends on collective brilliance rather than individual sparkle.         
	The pitch may once again be conducive for the batsmen. Almost all the matches at the venue have yielded high scores and ascertaining the ideal total on such a track has been difficult to say the least.         
	For the record, the Knights were humbled by the Kings XI Punjab even after scoring 200!         
	Such nature of the 22-yard strip also means that the bowlers job will be all the more difficult.         
	Losing is a part of the game But its the way that KKR are losing which disappoints us  was the inscription on a flash-board meant for the Knights fans at the Eden. Hope the same person gets to write a Thank you KKR after Saturdays match.

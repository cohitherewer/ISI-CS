	Calcutta/North Sound: Ryan McLaren kept his nerve in a tense final over to help South Africa snatch a one-run victory over the West Indies, and sweep their two-match Twenty20 International series here.         
	McLaren fired in a low full toss very wide of off stump on Thursday, as the West Indies, chasing a modest victory target of 121, required three from the final delivery of the match.         
	But he conceded just one run, after South African point fielder Jean-Paul Duminy swooped on the ball, when West Indies tailender Jerome Taylor essayed a slog at it, and it trickled 15 yards away.         
	It was a bit tense at the end, so we had to find somebody to remain calm, and Ryan kept a good sensible head Although we had a few guys running all over the place, it was an exciting finish, and nice again to get over the line, South Africa captain Graeme Smith said.         
	South Africa also won the opening match on Wednesday by 13 runs at the same venue to take a psychological boost into the five-match one-day International series between the two sides, which begin on Saturday.         
	Newcomer David Miller had battled to the top score of 33 from 26 balls, and Johan Botha made 23 from 22 balls to add some respectability to the Proteas total of 120 for seven from their 20 overs. McLaren, whose five wickets the previous day had wrecked West Indies batting, conceded 10 to Sammy from the first three balls  a deuce to deep mid-wicket, a top-edged four to third-man from a thick edge, and an all-run four. The Proteas fast-medium bowler, however, restricted Sammy to a single to square leg with a well-pitched yorker from the next delivery, and then saw left-hander Narsingh Deonarine run out off the penultimate ball before choking Taylor.         
	Botha took three for 22 from four overs and Morkel captured two for 15 from four overs.         
	However, the South Africa team has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during their the first Twenty20 International in Antigua on Wednesday.         
	Match Referee Roshan Mahanama imposed the fines after Graeme Smiths side was ruled to be one over short of their target at the end of the match when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	Smith was fined 20 per cent of his match fee while the players were docked 10 percent of their match fees each.         
	Also, West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard has been fined 25 per cent of his match fee for breaching the ICC code of conduct during the second Twenty20 International against South Africa.         
	The incident took place in the 18th over of the West Indies innings when Pollard ran towards the non-strikers end in such a way that he impeded the bowlers path to the ball.

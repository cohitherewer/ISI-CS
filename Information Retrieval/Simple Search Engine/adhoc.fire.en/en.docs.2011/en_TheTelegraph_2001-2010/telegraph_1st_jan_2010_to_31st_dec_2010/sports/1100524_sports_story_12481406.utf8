The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Collingwood ruled out, Morgan in
                                                                                                                       7                                      Collingwood ruled out, Morgan in
                      
	London: Paul Collingwood has been ruled out of Englands two-Test series against Bangladesh with a shoulder injury, it was announced Sunday.         
	But Eoin Morgan, who played in the side captained by Collingwood that last Sunday won the World T20 final against Australia in Barbados, has been called up into a Test squad for the Bangladesh series opener, which starts at the Middlesex left-handers Lords home ground on Thursday.         
	Meanwhile England fast bowler Stuart Broad will miss the series in order to undergo a strengthening programme. Collingwoods absence has created room in the Test squad for 23-year-old former Ireland batsman Morgan, although South Africa-born Jonathan Trott also remains in contention.         
	Morgans County colleague Steven Finn retains his place in the Test squad, the fast bowler having played in both of Englands wins in Bangladesh two months ago.         
	Their fellow Middlesex teammate Andrew Strauss returns to captain the side, having been rested from the Bangladesh tour and then missing the World T20 as the opening batsman has opted out of that form of the game.         
	Alastair Cook, who captained the side in Bangladesh, is set to resume his opening partnership with Strauss.         
	THE SQUAD (first Test)         
	Andrew Strauss (capt.), Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott, Eoin Morgan, Matt Prior (wkt), Graeme Swann, Tim Bresnan, James Anderson, Steven Finn, Ajmal Shahzad.

	Confusion at the archery venue  
	New Delhi: In a confusion of sorts at the archery venue of the Yamuna Sports Complex, the Australians countdown clock was mistakenly started when the South Africans were shooting during the mens compound bronze play-off. Play was stopped for almost 10 minutes while officials attempted to resolve the issue as that affected performance of the Aussies, who lost by a narrow two points.
  Robert Timms, Clint Freeman and Pat Coghlan were defeated 232 points to 234 by Nico Benade, Septimus Holtzhaus Cilliers and Jacobus Ignatius de Wet. But the Aussies coach Simone Fairweather told PTI, No there is no problem. We will not be protesting.   
	Thumbs up  
	New Delhi: The English diving contingent, including world champion Tom Daley, on Thursday, gave a thumbs up to the Dr. S. P. Mukherjee Aquatics Complex, saying the diving facilities at the venue are amazing.   
	Rude gesture  
	New Delhi: Cyclist Shane Perkins became the second Australian to get into trouble for making rude gestures at the Games, after reacting angrily to his disqualification from the keirin event, on Wednesday. Earlier, Australian wrestler Hassene Fkiri missed out on a silver medal, on Tuesday, after making a rude gesture.   
	Stars to pull crowd  
	New Delhi: The Organising Committee (OC) may be lost for ideas on how to attract people to stadiums to watch the ongoing Commonwealth Games here, but the spectators have a simple solution  the more Indian players win, the more crowds will fill up the stands.   
	Gritty Nigerian  
	New Delhi: A Nigerian woman wrestler, who fought with a bandage across her face on Thursday, received abdominal injuries during her bout but the wounds did not deter her and she ended winning a bronze medal. Lovina Odohi Edward, who won the third place after a gritty fight, was later treated at the polyclinic in the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex here. Edward, who had come to her bout with a bandaged face, received abdominal injuries during the game.   
	Bored Boxer  
	New Delhi: Irish light flyweight boxer Paddy Barnes reached the Commonwealth Games quarter finals, on Thursday, before revealing he found the sport a bit of a bore. It is just holding, jabbing and moving, said the Ulsterman, who won bronze for Ireland at the Beijing Olympics. It is boring. I really dont like any sport.  
	Sticky defeat  
	New Delhi: Nigerian Ekundayo Nasiru had his teammates to thank for booking a place in the last four of the Commonwealth Games team table tennis after an overnight botch-job on his bat led to a sticky defeat.  
	Cellphone trouble  
	New Delhi: The excessive use of mobile phones by visitors at the Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range is responsible for distracting the shooters participating in the Commonwealth Games. During the preliminary round of womens singles 50m rifle 3 position event, on Thursday, a visitors phone rang twice while the shooters were taking guard, forcing the range jury to reprimand the user.

	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was let off with a caution by the Match Referee during Bengals quarter final victory over Saurashtra Thursday.         
	The incident happened when an appeal for a caught behind against Cheteshwar Pujara was turned down by the umpire. Sourav approached the umpire and tried to reason with him that there was a definite nick.         
	The incident didnt go down well with Match Referee Amar Petiwale who summoned Sourav after the match.

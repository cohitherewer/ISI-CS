	Madrid: Second-seeded Rafael Nadal advanced to the third round of the Madrid Masters Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-3 win against Ukrainian qualifier Oleksandr Dolgopolov Jr.         
	Nadal broke early to take control of the first set, although Dolgopolov pressured the Spaniards serve in the second with some blistering groundstrokes.         
	Earlier, fifth-seeded Andy Roddick withdrew from the tournament ahead of his second-round match against Feliciano Lopez due to illness. Lopez instead played and beat Oscar Hernandez, who missed qualifying for the main tournament.         
	In the womens draw, seventh-seeded Jelena Jankovic beat fellow Serb Ana Ivanovic 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.         
	Fourth seed Venus Williams ensured she will rise to No.2 in the rankings next week after she pulled off a battling 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory in her third-round match against Francesca Schiavone.         
	With Venuss sister Serena at No. 1, it will be the first time since May 2003 the pair, who have won 19 singles Grand Slam titles between them, have been ranked first and second.

	Calcutta: The new Future Tours Programme 2012-20 will be discussed in detail during the ICC Board meeting in Dubai on Monday and Tuesday. This will be the second of the four meetings this year.         
	Among other items on the agenda will be the nomination of John Howard as vice-president. The executive board will be invited to accept that nomination and then propose Howard as the nominee to the ICC annual conference to be held in the last week of June 2010.         
	The executive board will also consider an alternative venue for the ICC U-19 World Cup 2012 after Cricket Canada decided to step down as hosts.

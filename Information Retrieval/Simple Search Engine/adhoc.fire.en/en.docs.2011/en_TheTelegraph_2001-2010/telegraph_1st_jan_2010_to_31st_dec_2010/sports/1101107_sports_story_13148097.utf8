	New Delhi: Placed in a tough group, India under-23 team will launch their Asian Games football campaign against West Asian champions Kuwait at the Huadu Stadium in Guangzhou on Sunday. Midfielder Joaquim Abranches has been named the captain by the team management on Saturday evening. The 24-team tournament kicks off on Sunday, five days before the formal opening of the 16th Asian Games, with the teams divided into six groups of four.         
	The top two from each group and four of the best third-placed teams advance to the round of 16. India are in group D along with defending champions Qatar, Kuwait and Singapore. Qatar are coached by former Senegal coach Bruno Metsu. Since the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) did not provide the jerseys to the football team and asked them to make it on their own, the team management had to face problems in the managers meeting.             India in asian Games      India have played 50 matches in the Asian Games football so far. They have won 21, lost 26 and drew three matches. India have scored 69 and conceded 92 goals.

  Worst defeat: lost 1-7 to China in 1974, Tehran.
  Leading scorers: PK Banerjee (6 goals); Chuni Goswami (5 goals); Bhaichung Bhutia (4 goals).

	After IOA refused to give us jerseys, we had to make them in a hurry here, and could not print the names of the players on the back of the shirts, said Subrata Dutta, head of the delegation.         
	Dutta said that India were told in the managers meeting Saturday morning that it was mandatory to have the name of the player printed on the back of each shirt.         
	Now we are left with no option but to use the old jerseys with the sponsors logo. As use of logo is not allowed in the Asian Games, we are covering the logos with handmade stickers. It turned out to be a cumbersome process, Dutta said.

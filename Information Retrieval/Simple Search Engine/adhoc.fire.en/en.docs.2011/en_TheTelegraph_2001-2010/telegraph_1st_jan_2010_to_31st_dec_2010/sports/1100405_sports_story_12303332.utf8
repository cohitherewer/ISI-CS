            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Paul Collingwood en route to his unbeaten 75, in New Delhi, on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: The Delhi DareDevils have been throwing up a new batting hero in almost every match. On Sunday, it was Paul Collingwoods turn to hog the limelight with a strokeful 46-ball 75 that helped the Delhi franchise register a 37-run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The victory was the DareDevils third consecutive at home and sixth in nine matches. With 12 points, they are now placed second in the eight-team competition.         
	Going by the trend in the last two matches at the Kotla, there wasnt much change in the script. DareDevils captain Gautam Gambhir once again won the toss and his batsmen didnt let him down, posting a challenging 184 for five.         
	On a wicket that slowed down as the match progressed, the visitors made a valiant effort but lost regular wickets in the last few overs and could finally manage only 147 for nine.         
	Given their batting strength, more was expected from the Royal Challengers batsmen. But except for Jacques Kallis (54 off 42 deliveries), no other Royal Challengers batsman could pose any real threat.         
	New Zealander Ross Taylor, playing his first match in the tournament, entertained the crowd for a short while with his 10-ball 22 run knock but was trapped leg before by Rajat Bhatia in the crucial 15th over.         
	Collingwood, on the other hand, launched a ferocious attack on the Royal Challengers bowling in the closing overs when DareDevils scored 59 runs off the last 36 deliveries. At the end of the 18th over, the home team were 154 for five but Collingwood picked up 31 runs from the last nine balls he faced. That included two sixes and one four in the 19th over off Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	In all, Collingwood hit three fours and seven sixes to take the DareDevils to a position of strength after the two openers  David Warner and Virender Sehwag  struck 33 and 35, respectively, in their typical hard-hitting style.         
	Sehwag, who faced only 22 balls and hit two sixes and five fours, looked set for a big score before he was played on off a Mithun delivery.         
	Like the other day, when Warner took four catches and effected a run out, the Aussie once again proved to be the best fielder for the home side by taking three spectacular catches in the outfield.         
	The DareDevils would have scored more but for some fine bowling by skipper Anil Kumble and left-arm spinner K.P. Appanna.

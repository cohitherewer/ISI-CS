The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney ruins Becks night

            THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES            AC Milans David Beckham and Wayne Rooney of Manchester United in Milan, on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Milan: Wayne Rooney upstaged David Beckham Tuesday as Manchester United rode their luck before coming from behind to secure a memorable 3-2 victory over AC Milan at a spellbound San Siro.         
	United are favourites to reach the Champions League quarter finals for the fourth successive season when Milan visit Old Trafford in three weeks time after Rooneys brace of headers.         
	But despite having scored three away goals, United were left to rue an 85th-minute strike from Clarence Seedorf that gave Milan renewed hope. United will, however, have to play the return leg of their round-of-16 tie without Michael Carrick after the midfield player was sent off for a second bookable offence in stoppage time.         
	Uefa, the European governing body, may also launch an investigation after a bottle was thrown on to the pitch towards the end of the game.         
	Alex Ferguson said it took his team a long time to recover after conceding a third-minute goal to Ronaldinho. I dont think we deserved to be level at half-time, but in the second half we were fantastic, the United manager said.         
	Rooney is one of the best players in the world right now. His form is fantastic and he continues to improve. The important thing for us is to play at our level at Old Trafford and not think were already through.         
	Having gone behind early, United hit back through a fortunate goal from Paul Scholes and two second-half goals from the irrepressible Rooney before Seedorfs late intervention set the stage for a mouthwatering second leg.         
	It was a disappointing start but after that we did well to get back into it, Rooney said. The second half we stepped it up and we fully deserved to win. We were always the better side.         
	Beckham believes that Milan still have hopes of reaching the last eight. Thanks to the second goal that Clarence got were in with a chance, Beckham said.         
	In Lyon, a spectacular goal by Jean Makoun gave the hosts a 1-0 win over Real Madrid, handing the Spaniards their first away defeat in this seasons competition.         
	Lyon picked up a third successive home win over Real in the Champions League after the Cameroon midfielder drove a stunning 25-metre shot into the top corner of the net in the 47th minute.         
	Real dominated possession but failed to create many chances despite Cristiano Ronaldos efforts up front.         
	Lyon were physically very strong, they ran a lot and prevented us from playing our game. We werent able to find the solutions, Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini told reporters.         
	This is a bad result for us as we conceded a goal and werent able to score one. Well have to put our game in order in the second leg but I have confidence in my players and I am sure we are able to do it, he added.         
	Lyon coach Claude Puel said his players could not be complacent despite having a slight advantage.         
	We played a really good game tonight against a good team and we managed to play at a higher level both individually and collectively, he told reporters.         
	I just slightly regret that we did not score a second goal after the break. The most important part of the job is still to come. There is a second leg .

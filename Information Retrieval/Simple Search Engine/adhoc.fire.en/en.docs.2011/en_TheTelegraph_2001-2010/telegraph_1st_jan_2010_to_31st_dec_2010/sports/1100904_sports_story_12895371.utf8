The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fahey stars in Irish win 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fahey stars in Irish win 
                      
	Yerevan: Substitute Keith Fahey scored a late winner Friday to secure a 1-0 victory for Ireland over Armenia in their qualifying opener for the 2012 European Championship.         
	Fahey came on for Aiden McGeady in the 68th minute and pounced on a rebound eight minutes later after goalkeeper Roman Berezovsky failed to control Robbie Keanes shot from inside the box.         
	Keane had hit the post previously, as Ireland wasted a number of chances to take the lead. Henrik Mkhitaryan had Armenias first effort on goal with a low shot from the right forcing Shay Given to make a save in the 14th minute.         
	Eight minutes later Berezovsky blocked Glenn Whelans header from a corner.         
	Given made two more saves late in the first half to deny the home side from scoring.         
	In a Group E match, played at Stockholm, Pontus Wernbloom hit a second half double to earn Sweden a comfortable 2-0 over Hungary.         
	Sweden went ahead six minutes after the break when Wernbloom headed home from close range after a great cross from the right by second-half sub Sebastian Larsson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals ownership may be probed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Royals ownership may be probed
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Mumbai: Lalit Kumar Modis direct attack on Narayanswamy Srinivasan, one of the owners of the Chennai Super Kings, who is also the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary, is likely to backfire.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, questions could be formally raised over the ownership pattern of the Rajasthan Royals, Kings XI Punjab and even the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Modi, the beleaguered Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner, has been linked to at least two of those franchises.         
	Srinivasan was a declared bidder, in January 2008... Nothing was hidden... The same cant be said of the Royals and the Kings XI and there may even be some confusion over the Knight Riders, the source pointed out.         
	Modis relatives have stakes in the Royals and the Kings XI, while what was disclosed about the Knights at the bid doesnt exactly tally with what co-owner Jay Mehta declared in an interview the other day.         
	The ownership pattern of Royals, in particular, probably needs a full investigation... The bid was made by Manoj Badale and Emerging Media, yet the contract was signed with Jaipur IPL, with Badale not figuring as a director, the well-placed source concluded.         
	With quite a few in the BCCI raising questions, action against Modi alone wont do. The International Management Groups role, too, could come under the scanner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spinners did it for us: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spinners did it for us: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised Man of the Match Gautam Gambhirs 82 off 101 balls but said it were the spinners who played a key role in the six-wicket win over Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.         
	Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasan, on the other hand, blamed poor batting for the defeat at the presentation.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Dhoni: The spinners won it for us It is 200 per cent difficult to bat under lights here. Gautam provided a decent start. When he gets a start he normally goes on to get a big one. It is always good to get a bonus point if we can Its good to see most of the senior players do well, most of them bowled really well. As the game progressed it became really difficult. The wicket also became difficult Good that we batted for half an hour before the break It is 200% difficult to bat under lights here (commenting on the low lights). The moment you win the toss, the game changes 60-40 in your favour.         
	Shakib: Losing the last nine wickets for 87 runs in the end was the turning point... Batting was not that difficult on this pitch. After a long time the fast bowlers did well, and thats good for them. We are up for the remaining games.         
	Gambhir: It was only at the T20 World Cup that I did not do well, but there has been a lot of talk about my form. This was a perfect pitch for me to make a comeback. It was a wicket where you had to graft. If Bangladesh had got 240-260 it would have been difficult. We did well to restrict them to 168... All the bowlers did well.

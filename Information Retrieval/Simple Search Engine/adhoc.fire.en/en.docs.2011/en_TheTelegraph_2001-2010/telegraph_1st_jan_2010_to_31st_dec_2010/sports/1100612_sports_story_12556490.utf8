	Calcutta: Australia chairman Jack Clarke Friday announced that Wally Edwards has been elected as deputy chairman of Cricket Australia (CA)s board of directors.         
	Edwards, 60, is Cricket Australias longest serving director having been appointed in 1996. He currently sits on the Audit and International Relations Committees and is a member of the International Finance Review Working Group.         
	Edwards represented Australia in three Test matches in 1974-75 against England as a left-hand opening batsman and played 25 first-class matches for Western Australia between 1973-74 and 1977-78.

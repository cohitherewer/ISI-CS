The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real too good for Atletico 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Real too good for Atletico 
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrid extended their dominance over city rivals Atletico and maintained their one-point lead at the top of La Liga when Ricardo Carvalho and Mesut Oezil scored in a comfortable 2-0 home win on Sunday.         
	Barcelona had gone two points clear with a 3-1 success at Getafe, Lionel Messi, David Villa and Pedro netting for the champions, before Jose Mourinhos Real snuffed out Atleticos bid for a first Madrid derby win in more than a decade.         
	After his Portugal defensive partner Pepe had gone close with a header at a packed Bernabeu stadium, Carvalho burst through from the back to fire Real ahead in the 13th minute.         
	German international Oezil bamboozled Atletico goalkeeper David de Gea with a low, swerving free kick from wide on the right to make it 2-0. (Reuters)

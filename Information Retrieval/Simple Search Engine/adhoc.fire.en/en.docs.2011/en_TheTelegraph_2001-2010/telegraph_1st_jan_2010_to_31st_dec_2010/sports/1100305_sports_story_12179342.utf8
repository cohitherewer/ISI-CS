The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary likely to open for KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tiwary likely to open for KKR

	Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary, in all likelihood, will be Chris Gayles opening partner for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)s campaign in the ensuing Indian Premier League (IPL). Tiwary didnt get too many opportunities to bat up the order for the Delhi DareDevils during the first two editions of the T20 league thus gets a chance to face the new ball for the Calcutta franchise.         
	Tiwary was seen in his new avatar when he came out to open for Murali Karthiks team during a practice match on Thursday. He scored a quickfire 26.         
	Manoj is being seriously thought of as someone who can open the innings along with Gayle since Brendon McCullum wont be available for the entire month of March. With Sourav Ganguly, Brad Hodge, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha and Angelo Mathews in the middle-order, it is better for both Manoj and the team if he opens the batting. In a way, that will also give him a chance to play more deliveries, a source told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	However, Gayle might miss a couple of matches as he is busy playing a home ODI series against Zimbabwe. The West Indies will be playing their last ODI on March 14 but the KKR management is trying hard to get Gayle for the second match (vs the Royal Challengers Bangalore, at Eden Gardens on March 14). The KKR management feels that if the Windies take an unassailable 3-0 lead by the end of the third ODI, on March 10, then Gayle will not play the last two ODIs.         
	KKR are yet to zero in on Sahas standby for the three-week period. It is learnt that Orissa wicket-keeper Haladhar Das, who was with the Deccan Chargers in the last two editions, will be attending the trials as the think tank is yet to be convinced about Sagar Jogiyani.         
	During Thursdays practice match it was Madhya Pradesh batsman Harpreet Singh Bhatia who impressed the most. The India colt scored 38 off only 17 deliveries including three huge sixes and looks a bright prospect.         
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Tamil Nadus Ganapathy Vignesh scalped four wickets apiece for Karthiks team which beat Souravs team by 33 runs.

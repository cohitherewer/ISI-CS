The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massa threatened with jail term
                                                                                                                       7                                        Massa threatened with jail term
            [+uc('Tom Cary   The Daily Telegraph')+]                              
	As if this world championship were not crazy enough already, Felipe Massa was on Thursday night threatened with a jail term of up to six years if he attempts to defraud Brazils sporting public by making way for Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso on Sunday.         
	 The warning, delivered by Paulo Castilho, a prosecutor in Brazils special criminal court, and reported in a Brazilian newspaper, is clearly ludicrous.         
	Were Massa to cede his position to the championship leader  and he admitted on Thursday that he would do so if the right opportunity arose  it would be of his own volition and would not even be punishable by the sports governing body.         
	But in another sense it illustrates perfectly the feverish levels of speculation in these parts over what may or may not occur in Sundays race, and the role Massa may have to play in the drama.         
	The Brazilians reputation in his homeland plummeted in the wake of the summers German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, where he complied with banned team orders to allow Alonso through to win.         
	Ferrari escaped with a $100,000 (65,100) fine but the incident has been simmering gently this side of the Atlantic.         
	Forget the rule. A public raised on a diet of Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna were simply appalled and saddened in equal measure by Massas apparent lack of ambition.         
	After years spent watching Rubens Barrichello play stooge to Michael Schumacher at Ferrari  a role that helped to earn Barrichello the moniker The Tortoise in Brazil  here was history repeating itself.         
	Was it written into Massas new Ferrari contract that he had to play second fiddle? Why would he agree to such a contract? If Massa moves over for Alonso on the final lap on Sunday to allow the Spaniard to win his third world championship, there would likely be a riot.         
	If he does this he will have to leave Interlagos in handcuffs, said Castilho, citing a special statute, which protects the rights of fans to expect to see honest competition.         
	The suggestion may be ludicrous, but it certainly raises the tension ahead of a fascinating race on Sunday.

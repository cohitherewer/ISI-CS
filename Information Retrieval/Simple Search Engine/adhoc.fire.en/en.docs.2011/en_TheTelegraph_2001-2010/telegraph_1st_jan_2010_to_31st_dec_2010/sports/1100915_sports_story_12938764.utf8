            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Alacrity, who has already let down as a favourite in his last two starts, may find himself again at the receiving end against Samarkhand and Star Impact in the 1,200m Aleksei Cup, Wednesdays main event. Both, Samarkhand and Star Impact, are not only working well they are also enjoying handicap advantage in the 12-horse field. Between the two, it is the John Stephens-trained Star Impact who may cash in on his brilliant workouts. Vinay Jaiswal partners the Major Impact son.

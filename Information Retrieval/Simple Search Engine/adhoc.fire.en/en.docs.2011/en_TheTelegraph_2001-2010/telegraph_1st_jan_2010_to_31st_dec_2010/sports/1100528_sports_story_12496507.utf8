                                                                                                                       7                                        Afridi wants Yousuf back
                  Shahid Afridi                     
	Karachi: Newly-appointed Pakistan Test captain Shahid Afridi is optimistic about Mohammed Yousuf coming out of retirement after speaking to the former skippers religious elders who can convince him to return.         
	Afridi is of the view that Pakistan would badly require Yousufs experience in the challenging tour of England next month where they would play Australia and the hosts in back-to-back series.         
	Ive talked to Yousuf and Ive also talked to a few elders, who can influence him to come out of retirement for the sake of Pakistan, Afridi said.         
	Im sure that he would listen to them and change his mind about retiring from international cricket, he said.         
	Yousuf is a great batsman and Im sure that even if he just plays in a couple of warm-up matches before the Test series, he will be ready for the tough assignment. He wont need much time to get ready for the tour.         
	We will certainly need his services in England, Afridi said.         
	The 35-year-old Yousuf had announced his retirement from international cricket earlier this year after the Pakistan Cricket Board banned him for indiscipline following the national teams disastrous tour of Australia.         
	But Afridi is keen to see Yousuf back in the team in England after the selectors included other banned players  Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik  in the 35-member preliminary squad for the Asia Cup and the subsequent tour of England.         
	Interestingly, Yousuf himself had said on Wednesday that he was ready to come out of his retirement only if his elders give him the permission.         
	Yes, Afridi called me up and we spoke at length about the cricket scenario.         
	I told him I took the decision to retire after seeking advice from my elders and I can only take back the retirement decision if my elders give me permission to do this, he had said.         
	Ever since converting to Islam a few years ago, Yousuf had always sought the advice of his religious elders before taking any important decision of his career.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Jwalas call for a proper calendar
 - Strong domestic circuit important            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jwala Gutta during a press conference, in New Delhi, on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: Commonwealth Games gold medallist Jwala Gutta fired a salvo at the Badminton Association (BAI) on Tuesday, saying the national body has done very little to help the players improve their skills.         
	Talking to newspersons during a function organised to promote the national championships, starting on January 3, in Rohtak, the star doubles specialist said that the BAI should restructure the domestic circuit.         
	A strong domestic circuit is important for the sport to flourish in the country and the BAI needs to do something about it, Jwala said.         
	There are not enough structured tournaments and often the tournaments are packed at the year-end. These tournaments have to be spaced out right through the year. If there is no proper calendar, it would be difficult for top players to plan their events because of their international commitments, Jwala added.         
	The juniors, Jwala felt, can benefit from a purposeful calendar of tournaments to prepare for bigger international events. In the absence of a strong domestic structure, the pipeline goes dry, affecting the bench strength, she said.         
	The Hyderabad based shuttler, who pairs up with Ashwini Ponappa and V. Diju in the womens doubles and mixed doubles, respectively, said she and Saina Nehwal hardly received any help from the domestic circuit in preparing for the international standards. We are strictly not the products of the domestic circuit We are doing well because of our regular exposure to international tournaments.         
	Jwalas next target is to win a medal in the 2012 London Olympics. I am in fine shape now and how to stay fit till the Olympics. My partner, Ashwini, is also in great form. We should be able to win a medal for India, she said.         
	Jwala and V. Diju, who were inside the top 10 bracket last year, slipped to 30th in world rankings after a series of unimpressive performance this year.         
	Asked about the dip, Jwala said: I am not worried about the rankings, what is important is the performance and I believe we have done well.         
	It is just that we missed a number of tournaments in view of preparing for the Commonwealth and Asian Games. If we play, rankings will improve automatically, said Jwala.         
	Asked about the injury woes to her mixed doubles partner, Diju, Jwala said: Diju has recovered from the back injury and we are looking ahead to play together at the Super Series (in Korea).         
	On a lighter note, Jwala suggested that she deserved to be named the sportsperson of the year. Suggest my name for the sportsperson of the year, Gutta quipped when asked who she felt should be the sportsperson of the year.         
	I am serious about it If you see the amount of hard work that I had to put in to play both the womens doubles and the mixed doubles, and then to win a gold from there I believe I deserve the accolades, she said.

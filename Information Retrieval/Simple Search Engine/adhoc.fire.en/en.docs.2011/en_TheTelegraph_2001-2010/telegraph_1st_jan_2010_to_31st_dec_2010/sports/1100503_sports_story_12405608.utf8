The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghtons contract to be renewed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Houghtons contract to be renewed
                      
	New Delhi: Faced with a resignation threat, the All India Football Federation is set to renew national coach Bob Houghtons contract beyond the Asian Cup in January next year.         
	Houghton had threatened to resign if his contract is not renewed till 2013, besides also demanding a hike of $10,000 per month after his current tenure ends in January 2011. The Englishman was apparently ticked off by the AIFF looking for a new coach after his current stint.         
	The AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that with president Praful Patels consent and consultation with some executive committee members, the federation has informed Houghton, through his manager, its willingness to renew the contract.         
	Bobs agent communicated to us Bobs willingness to extend his contract. After consulting the AIFF president Mr Praful Patel and some of the committee members, we have written to the agent that we are willing to renew the contract, Colaco said.         
	Houghton himself is incommunicado but sources who have been talking to him said it was a top AIFF official who told the English coachs agent that the national federation was looking for a coach after his contract ends in January next year.         
	That ticked off Houghton who, through his agent, informed the AIFF that he would resign if his contract is not renewed till 2013 besides also demanding a pay hike of $10,000 per month, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A special innings for Rohit
                                                                                                                       7                                      A special innings for Rohit
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mumbai are dreaming of an outright win after Rohit Sharma cracked a crisp double hundred on Thursday. Dropped twice inside three overs off Ranadeb Bose and once after lunch, Bengal grovelled miserably as the visitors piled on 620 for their first innings on Thursday.         
	We had lost two early wickets in the morning session. So, the partnership was required at that time.         
	I am glad that I was not out till the end... 200 is always a special one and I am very happy.         
	I was very unfortunate to miss out on a hundred and got 74 not out in the second innings (against Saurashtra), Rohit said after the second days play.         
	The Mumbai batsman explained how nicely Iqbal Abdulla was timing the ball when the two added 144 runs for the seventh wicket.         
	He (Abdulla) didnt need any advice because he was batting really well. He had great confidence because he got 150 in the last game.         
	I am glad that we were able to take that partnership very well.         
	They had their morale down because they had bowled for more than hundred overs. It was a good effort in all, he said.         
	Rohit felt the wicket was not too easy to play ones shots on.         
	The wicket had some bounce in the morning. But over the day it got slower.

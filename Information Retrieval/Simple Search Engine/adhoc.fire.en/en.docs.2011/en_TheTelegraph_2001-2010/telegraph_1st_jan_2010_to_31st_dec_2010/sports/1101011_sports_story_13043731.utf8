	A costly error

A month shy of his 58th birthday and with two gold medals in his possession from the 1994 and 1998 Games, Giustiniano could only raise his eyes in horror, when he realised he had blown his chances of a medal after firing five shots into a rivals target in the mens 25m centrefire pistol event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Player retention still a key issue
                                                                                                                       7                                      Player retention still a key issue
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The BCCIs first meeting with the IPL franchisees since the suspension of Lalit Modi here on Thursday failed to resolve major issues regarding the modalities of the T20 tournaments fourth edition next year.         
	If anything, the meeting turned out to be nothing short of being explosive. While the majority of the franchisees rejected the Boards proposal on two key issues  player retention and the format for 2011 season  the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, politely reminded them that the IPL was the Boards property and they should not interfere in its affairs.         
	With two new teams, Kochi and Pune, entering the fray, the expansion of the event, which would amount to 94 matches in the existing home and away format spread over about a two-month period, was a major concern for the BCCI.         
	With the ICC World Cup, from February 19 to April 2, preceding IPL 4, the Board wanted a format in which the number of matches would be reduced to around 60. The franchises, however, seemed to prefer the current format. With more matches translating to more revenues, the team owners position was hardly surprising.         
	The other contentious issue was that of deciding on the number of players that the franchises could retain going into the fourth season.         
	The BCCI had earlier appointed a three-member committee, comprising former India captains Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri who are also part of the IPL Governing Council, with a mandate to discuss and deliberate with the franchisees a proposal to retain three foreigners and four Indians.         
	But a majority of the franchisees rejected this proposal. When it was pointed out that they had arrived at such an understanding among themselves earlier during the Modi regime, they denied it outright, a source said.         
	The franchises actually demanded that all players be put in the auction pool.         
	The exception to this were BCCI secretary N. Srinivasans India Cements owned the Chennai Super Kings and the Reliance-owned Mumbai Indians, the two teams who have the most marketable players in Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar, respectively.         
	It maybe noted that the concept of icon players was only for the first three years of the IPL.         
	Vijay Mallya was the spokesperson for most franchises after the meeting.         
	Another key demand of the team owners was increasing the budget cap from $7 million to $9 million.

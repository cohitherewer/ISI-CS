The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chile, Swiss have same wish
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chile, Swiss have same wish
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Both Chile and Switzerland are expected to go all out for a victory when the two teams square off in a group H match on Monday. With Chile beating Honduras and Switzerland scripting one of the major upsets winning against Spain, the two teams will hope that another win will ensure a safe passage to the round of 16.         
	Nobody expected that we would beat Spain, but we did it and we have to forget this win, said Swiss striker Blaise Nkufo. We dont want to talk about it anymore, just focus on the next game, next opponent.         
	Midfielder Jean Beausejour, who scored Chiles winner against Honduras, stated that their team shall need to change their focus against Switzerland for the game at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.         
	Honduras gave us the responsibility of trying to win the game, we were the ones looking to get a result, Beausejour said.         
	Against Switzerland, thats going to change a bit. Theyve got a potent counterattack and its going to be a very even game.         
	There is no question about Switzerlands ability to defend  they now have the distinction of not having conceded a single goal for 490 minutes across this World Cup and the 2006 edition.         
	They were knocked out in the second round of the last edition when Ukraine pipped them in tie-breaker,         
	Switzerlands attempt to keep that scoreless streak alive will be harmed by the loss of key defender Philippe Senderos, who sprained his right ankle against Spain and will be out of action during Switzerlands last group league match against Honduras.         
	Concerns over the state of the field at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium forced revised training sessions and arrival times for the teams.         
	Fifa officials said that the field, waterlogged from three days of rain earlier this week, held up well after Serbias 1-0 win over Germany on Friday. But they dont want Chile and Switzerland to train at the stadium on Sunday.         
	Switzerland will train at a university ground in Port Elizabeth on Sunday afternoon.         
	 Chile is hoping to have Humberto Suazo, the leading scorer in South American qualifying, back from a left thigh injury for the match.

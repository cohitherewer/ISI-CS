The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am happy for the boys: De Ridder 
                                                                                                                       7                                        I am happy for the boys: De Ridder

	Guwahati: East Bengal coach Phillipe de Ridder was not happy with the 2-0 scoreline over arch-rivals Mohun Bagan as they made it to the title round of the Federation Cup.         
	The coach infact made it clear that one shouldnt look at this victory as a revenge for his teams 3-5 loss against Bagan during the first leg clash of the I-League.         
	I am happy for my boys, the fans and all who are associated with our club. But, it is certainly not a revenge. That is yet to come.         
	It will be another day which will come soon if our boys keep up the good show, De Ridder said after the match.         
	I will keep on demanding more from my boys, who have the potential, till we avenge the defeat, he added.         
	When asked about the turning point, he was quick to point out the missed penalty by Jose Barreto.         
	The penalty miss by (Jose) Barreto was certainly the turning point but our boys also played a far better game today, the Belgian said.         
	What was the strategy that his boys followed in the second half when they looked a completely different side.         
	Secrets are not to be revealed. But, as far as our strategy is concerned, I asked my boys not to give any free space to the opponents which our boys executed exactly.         
	An upset Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa stated that it was simply not Bagans day. The Moroccan also reasoned injuries to his key players affecting the sides chances.         
	 Most of them are yet to recover properly. Credit to East Bengal for defending well, he concluded.

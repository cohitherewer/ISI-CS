	East Bengal               
	Penn Orji: The Nigerian has an uncanny ability to score from difficult situations and his late strikes have saved his team the blushes a number of times. But will Orji be able to replicate his form today?         
	Tolgay Ozebe: The eight goals place him fourth in the CFL scorers list. East Bengal will hope the Aussie striker scores in the virtual league decider Friday.         
	Robin Singh: His six-feet-plus height and speed is a threat for any defence. Robin has strong legs and can strike from long distance. Bagan defenders have to be extra cautious to negate his influence.         
	Mohun Bagan               
	Murithala Ali: East Bengal will be wary of highest goal-scorer of the ongoing CFL. Whether the Nigerian can live up to his billing against the arch-rivals is a question staring at Bagan supporters.         
	Jose Barreto: The Brazilian is the teams lighthouse constantly feeding balls to the forward line. His deft footwork also makes him a formidable scorer.         
	Edeh Chidi: The talismanic Bagan striker would want to avenge the Federation Cup defeat. Coach Stanley Rozario feels the Nigerian will make a difference on Friday.

                                                                                                                       7                                      I never give up: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jaydev Unadkat was the Man of the Match on Saturday, but to many, Sourav Gangulys performance was the highlight of the evening. Besides taking a superb catch to dismiss the dangerous Yusuf Pathan, the Knight Riders captain scored an unbeaten 75 off 50 balls.         
	Sourav said at the news conference that Pathans catch was among the best in his career.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His ability to bounce back         
	Some people like pulling me down... Only a few days back, I had said here that I wouldnt have survived for so long if I werent good enough I never give up, always keep trying and improving. I guess that works to my advantage.         
	The secret behind his superb fitness         
	Ive worked hard on my fitness for six-seven months My passion for the Knight Riders to do well has also helped.         
	His performance on Saturday         
	Im happy with the way I batted and fielded Im happy to win this match Im not thinking about making it to the semis Lets win against the Mumbai Indians first.         
	Thoughts as he ran to take Pathans catch         
	I was only trying to give my best Thankfully, things fell (in place) accordingly It was a good catch         
	If that catch was the turning point         
	Pathan is a dangerous player but Unadkat bowled well and took important wickets. That helped         
	If this was the best catch of his career         
	Difficult to say I took one during the 1993 Ranji Trophy final, a one-handed catch This would also rank at the top. There have been quite a few in fact         
	On whether motivation was a problem after the Chennai defeat         
	I have never found it difficult to motivate myself. I play with a lot of passion Im aware of my responsibility to the team and always keep that in mind. My personal pride is also involved and, so motivation hasnt been a problem with me.         
	If he wouldve liked to further improve the net run rate         
	It wasnt an easy wicket to bat on The ball was stopping and coming. We needed to win first and then think about the net run-rate. So, it was important to keep the partnership going. We couldnt afford to lose any more wickets. Remember, we havent been consistent with our game We have lost from good positions in this tournament. We have played some outstanding cricket, but have been poor at times like in the games against the Kings XI Punjab and the Royal Challengers Bangalore recently. We lost the way. Weve let important moments slip and so, we needed to stay at the wicket.         
	On how he reacts to criticism         
	Ive been around for long and know what is justified and what is not I know whether the criticism is right or wrong. I adjust my game accordingly. Im a firm believer in the fact that the effort I put in off the ground will be amply rewarded on it. That is my motto.

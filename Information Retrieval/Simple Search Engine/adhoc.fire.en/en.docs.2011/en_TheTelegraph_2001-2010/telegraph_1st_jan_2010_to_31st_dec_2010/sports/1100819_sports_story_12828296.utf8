	Dambulla: Amid the embarrassing no-ball controversy, Sri Lanka go into their tri-series match against New Zealand here on Thursday, facing a daunting task to not only lift themselves out of the demoralising incident but to focus on cricket.         
	Sri Lanka had defeated New Zealand in their first match but the home side have been stung by the all-round condemnation they received after off-spinner Suraj Randiv bowled a no ball to deny India opener Virender Sehwag a century on Monday.         
	Sri Lanka now face the onerous task of shifting their focus on cricket and show that they are capable of winning matches even in difficult times.         
	The winner Thursday will enhance their chances of making it to the summit clash as all the three teams have won a game each at the halfway stage though Sri Lanka are one point less than the other two sides who have got a bonus point each.         
	After a spectacular start to the tournament with a 200-run mauling of India, New Zealand hit a low after losing to Sri Lanka by three wickets in their next match but the Black Caps would fancy their chances Thursday.         
	For that to happen, however, captain Ross Taylor, who hit a 95 in New Zealands opening match against India, will have to lead from the front against the Sri Lankans, who are expected to come out all guns blazing like a wounded tiger.         
	With home side fast bowler Lasith Malinga in fine form and getting support from the likes of Ajantha Mendis, New Zealand, who are on five points, will have their task cut out.         
	The Sri Lankan top-order will have to stand up against a balanced bowling attack at the sporting Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium if they want to seek some solace from the no ball controversy by maintaining a clean slate against New Zealand.         
	Opener Upul Tharanga, who made a fighting 70 in his sides victory over the same opponents on August 13, would look to repeat another such performance while captain Kumar Sangakkara will also be eager to continue his fine form starting from the Test series against India.         
	The islanders would also look towards a big innings from veteran batsman Mahela Jayawardene who has not contributed much in to the team cause in the two matches so far.

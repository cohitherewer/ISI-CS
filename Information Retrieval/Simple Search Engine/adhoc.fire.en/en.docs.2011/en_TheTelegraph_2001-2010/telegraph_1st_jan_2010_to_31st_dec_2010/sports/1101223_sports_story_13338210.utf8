The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger gets the better of Rafa in charity tie
                                                                                                                       7                                      Roger gets the better of Rafa in charity tie
                      
	Zurich: Roger Federer beat Rafael Nadal 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 on Tuesday to open a two-match exhibition series for charity between the worlds best tennis players.         
	Federer sealed victory on Nadals serve with a backhand crosscourt return for a winner in front of 10,000 spectators at the sold-out Hallenstadion indoor arena.         
	It was the first time they have played each other in Federers native Switzerland.         
	The match raised money for the Roger Federer Foundation which backs educational work with children in Africa. It currently supports projects in Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and his mothers native South Africa.         
	They raised more than more than 2.5 million dollars playing the exhibition match.         
	The pre-Christmas matches were at least the third set of goodwill gestures this season from No. 1 Nadal and his second-ranked rival Federer.         
	The elite pair also played in fund-raising exhibitions at the Australian Open in aid of the Haiti earthquake victims and at Indian Wells in March for Chilean earthquake victims.         
	This is a special match for me, which I will remember forever, Federer said. Im just so proud and so happy that we all made it work.         
	The friendly rivals travel to Madrid on Wednesday for a return match in Nadals home country in support of the Rafael Nadal Foundation.         
	It was an unforgettable experience. Im very happy to be a part of this event, Nadal said.         
	The good-natured match was the showpiece of a telethon-like event broadcast live by Swiss television.         
	Swiss sports stars, including Olympic champion cyclist Fabian Cancellara and Alpine skier Didier Cuche, helped auction prizes they donated.         
	Also attending was United States skier Lindsey Vonn. The Olympic womens downhill champion is a fan and friend of Federer, and arrived in Zurich hours after competing in a World Cup slalom race in Courchevel, France.         
	In tournament play, Nadal has the advantage with a 14-8 career record against Federer.         
	The Swiss won their most recent meeting, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in London last month.         
	Federer and Nadal, plus their various handlers and agents are donating all proceeds to the two charities, with no professional fees involved. Around 10,000 tickets for each match were sold out within minutes of going online.         
	Both of us realise we are in a very privileged position, where we have everything in life, the least we can do is to help people who are in difficulty said Nadal after the match.         
	Before the match, Federer had been looking to raise around $1 million, a target which was easily surpassed. When you can help 1,500 children to go to school, it is great but you need a lot around it: how do the children get to school, what do they eat at school, do they have toilets and that is where we come in, Federer told a Swiss television network.

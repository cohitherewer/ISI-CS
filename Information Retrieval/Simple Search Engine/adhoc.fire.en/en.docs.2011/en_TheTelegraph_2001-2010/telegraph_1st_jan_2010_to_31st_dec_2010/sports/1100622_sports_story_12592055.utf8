The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capello: Were not on holiday
                                                                                                                       7                                      Capello: Were not on holiday
  - One player is not so important       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                         Cristiano Ronaldo exults after ending his 16-month international goal drought, against North Korea, on Monday      
	Fabio Capello has reminded any discontented players in his squad that England are at the World Cup, not on holiday.         
	Former captain John Terry went public with a list of grievances in his remarkable account of life with England at the World Cup on Sunday. Terry confirmed that he had to plead with Capellos trusted right-hand man Franco Baldini to be allowed a beer in the aftermath of Englands dismal draw with Algeria in Cape Town on Friday.         
	The defender is unhappy at the way Capello has been guiding England through the tournament, feeling preparation, tactics and personnel have been wrong, whilst there has been little to alleviate the sheer boredom of spending so much time away.         
	However, in silencing Terry on Sunday, Capello proved he did not share the concerns and confirmed this afternoon that those who do not like it will have to lump it.         
	Probably one or two are not happy but the majority are, Capello said. One player is not so important compared to all the others. The group is more important. For this reason it is no problem.         
	We are here to play at the World Cup, not for a holiday.         
	Capello did not mention Terry by name following the Chelsea players extraordinary outburst. However, he almost taunted the 29-year-old by insisting no attempt was made to raise any issues at Sunday nights team meeting, which Terry had vowed to use as the platform from which to air his grievances.         
	And the thinly-veiled attempt to press the claims of Joe Cole for a starting berth in Wednesdays clash with Slovenia in Port Elizabeth were also dismissed, with Capello claiming Terry was not treating the other members of his squad with respect by singling out his Chelsea teammate for such lavish praise.         
	One of Terrys major bones of contention was Capellos post-match assertion that England were struggling so badly because they were fearful of the pressure they were under on such a grand stage.         
	It is a mental thing. When you are under pressure, big pressure, sometimes the legs do not work normally, Capello said.         
	Frank Lampard, meanwhile, has said Terry spoke out about Englands faltering campaign because he wants to hit things head-on.         
	Lampard said: I think its been overdone in terms of a crisis meeting but I understand what Terry was saying because hes passionate like that, as a player as a person.

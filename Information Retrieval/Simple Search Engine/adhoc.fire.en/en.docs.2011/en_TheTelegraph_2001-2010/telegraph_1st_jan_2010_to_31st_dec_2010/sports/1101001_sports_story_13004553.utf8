The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Views of Tiger and Sunny to   be sought 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Views of Tiger and Sunny to   be sought 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Shashank Manohar, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, has left it to president-elect and secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan to ascertain the views of former captains Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi and Sunil Gavaskar.         
	Pataudi and Gavaskar were on the Indian Premier League (IPL)s governing council for the first three years, but didnt make it when it got reconstituted during the BCCIs AGM, in Mumbai, on Wednesday.         
	Of the three ex-players, only Ravi Shastri, also a former India captain, got retained. After the restructuring, theres place for one other ex-player, thats it.         
	More important, from 2010-11, the former players wont be paid even a Rupee. Till now, theyd each been receiving Rs one crore annually, after the deduction of taxes.         
	Its a fact that Gavaskar did ask the BCCI to honour a commitment made by (Lalit Kumar) Modi, the erstwhile chairman of the IPL, that hed be paid Rs five crore for each of the five years of his contract...         
	However, the president has still asked Srinivasan to ascertain the views of Pataudi and Gavaskar on the decision taken at the AGM, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Thursday, the source added: Srinivasan is expected to get back to Manohar in a few days... An awkward situation will develop if both Pataudi and Gavaskar dont have an issue working in an honorary capacity...         
	The BCCI, clearly, ought to have handled this far better.         
	For the record, Manohar has been authorised to nominate one (ex) player of repute, wholl be sitting alongside Shastri.         
	The IPLs governing council isnt expected to meet in the immediate future, so theres no real hurry, it seems.

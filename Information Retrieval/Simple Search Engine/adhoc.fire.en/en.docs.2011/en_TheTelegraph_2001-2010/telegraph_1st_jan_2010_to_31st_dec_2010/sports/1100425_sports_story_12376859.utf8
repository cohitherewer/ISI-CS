	Subic Bay (Philippines): Second seed Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran was shocked by Indonesian Grandmaster Susanto Megaranto in the third round of the Asian continental chess championship here.         
	The loss, coming with white pieces, proved costly for the Indian ace as he had been on the threshold of breaching the 2700 Elo rating barrier but will now have to start a fresh campaign for that.         
	Out of the top ten seeds only local star Wesley So maintained a clean slate winning his third game in a row at the expense of compatriot Oliver Barabosa.         
	As the events unfolded, Megaranto, So and young Chinese Yu Yangyi, who defeated SP Sethuraman, emerged as the new joint leaders with a perfect score with six rounds still to come in the strongest Asian tournament.         
	Barring Sasikirans eventful loss from a position of strength, it was a day of recovery for the Indians who had lost some ground. Leading the way was fifth seed P. Harikrishna who scored his second win in a row, against Vietnams The Anh Duong.         
	Abhijeet Gupta, playing white, gave a positional lesson to IM Goh Weiming of Singapore to also reach two points from three games.         
	Amongst other Indians in the fray, former world junior girls champion D. Harika got the better of Chinese Li Hanbin. Neelotpal Das, S. Kidambi and B. Adhiban played out draws while Padmini Rout went down fighting against Filipino Ronald Dableo.

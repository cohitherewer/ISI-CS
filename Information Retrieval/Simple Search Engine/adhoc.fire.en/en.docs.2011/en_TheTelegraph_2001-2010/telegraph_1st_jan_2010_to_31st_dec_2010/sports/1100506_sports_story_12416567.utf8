The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Government picks up the gauntlet
                                                                                                                       7                                      Government picks up the gauntlet
  - Official to visit IOC headquarters to sort out issue 
  Rattled sports chiefs meet PM         OUR BUREAU                            
	Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief Suresh Kalmadi and other national sports federations (NSF) officials, on the warpath ever since the Union sports ministry announced a plan to limit their tenures, Wednesday met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and sought his intervention in the matter.         
	But the move to curtail the inordinately long tenures is being followed up with equal vigour by the government which Wednesday proposed to send a senior official to the International Olympic Council (IOC) headquarters in Switzerland to sort out the matter.         
	A day after the IOA forwarded letters of support from the IOC and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) warning against any interference, the government said it would send a detailed response and also offered to send an official to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne to discuss the matter.         
	The government is immediately sending to the highest authorities in IOC a detailed response on the matter, said an official statement issued on Tuesday. (It) is also proposing to IOC that, in order to have a thorough and conclusive discussion on the subject, it would be deputing a senior official to the IOC headquarters to sort out the matter across the table, it added.         
	But Kalmadi had his own discussing to do with the powers that be and was accompanied by IOA secretary general Randhir Singh and several other NSF chiefs, including Archery Association of India top-boss V.K. Malhotra, for their meeting with the PM at his Parliament office.         
	The delegation gave the PM the letter from the IOC which states that the tenure and age-limit of office bearers cannot be decided or imposed by the government.         
	Kalmadi said after the meeting that the PM had promised to look into the matter. Kalmadi warned that sports in the country would suffer were the regulations being advocated by the government to be implemented.         
	The PM told us that he will look into the matter and get back to us. If you fiddle with the autonomy, you get into trouble. If IOC imposes sanctions it can bring to a standstill all sports activity in the country, Kalmadi told reporters.         
	Kalmadi yet again lashed out at sports minister M.S. Gill for the timing of the move.         
	Gill should have come up with this idea after the Commonwealth Games. The timing (of the sports ministrys move) was not good, he said.         
	Not to be outdone, the sports ministry singled out Randhir Singh for conflict of interests.         
	It has to be regrettably emphasised that Randhir Singh, who is an independent member from India on the IOC, has clearly a conflict of interest on the tenure issue, in view of his 23-year-long continuous tenure as secretary general of the IOA, it said.         
	The new regulation bars NSF chiefs, including Kalmadi, from occupying the top posts for more than 12 years, with or without break, while secretaries and treasurers can serve eight years at a stretch and seek re-election only after a gap of four years.         
	Malhotra informed there would be no changes in any regime till the Commonwealth Games, scheduled from October 3-14.         
	The status quo remains till the Commonwealth Games, Malhotra said.

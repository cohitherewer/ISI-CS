            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Forget about the past and concentrate on making the present and the future better will be Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) motto in the third edition of the Indian Premier League, teams principal owner Shah Rukh Khan said on Tuesday.         
	The Knights have been sporting a new look this season, thanks mainly to the change in the colour of their jersey, from black and gold to purple and gold.         
	Shah Rukh is positive that this edition will be a great one for hi team. When we decided to change (the colour of the jersey), it was because we wanted to start afresh. We dont want to look behind. All we would like is to look forward and win matches, he said at the team unveiling ceremony which coincided with the announcement of one of the sponsors of the team.         
	Shah Rukh also reassured that he was in the IPL for a long haul and his plans were less likely to be affected by the ebb and flow of the teams fortunes on the pitch. I have never equated the teams performance with making money. Hopefully, however, the team will start to win more matches in the coming weeks, he said. Coach Dav Whatmore had similar words. I cannot guarantee victory, but can guarantee that we will try hard, he said.         
	Captain Sourav Ganguly said he wanted his team to play without the fear of failure and hoped the home players would do well for their own and teams sake. The emphasis is on playing freely. We want to have fun and enjoy ourselves on the field, give our best during the 40 overs, the former India skipper said. Hopefully the local players will fire for themselves and for the team. A good performance in the IPL would get them a look-in into the national team.         
	Wasim Akram said, I have not done something like this before. This team has a lot of talent and the boys have worked hard. I believe they will do well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Minister was not happy with the IPL auction
                                                                                                                       7                                        Minister was not happy with the IPL auction
  - Close relative telephoned a governing council member       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Despite all the controversies, IPL III ended with a spectacular win for the Chennai Super Kings, with Mahendra Singh Dhoni becoming the first Indian captain to lift the trophy                                 
	Calcutta: Two ministers in the Manmohan Singh government have gone overboard denying any involvement in the Indian Premier League (IPL)s March 21 auction, which determined whod get the two new franchises, but a Union minister was definitely an interested party.         
	According to The Telegraphssources, a close relative of that particular minister actually telephoned at least one member of the IPLs governing council, after the auction, to say that he (the minister) just wasnt pleased with the outcome.         
	Sahara got Pune, while unfancied Rendezvous Sports picked up Kochi. Both debut in 2011, when 10 teams will be in the T20 competition.         
	Videocon was among the losers, while the Adanis bid for Ahmedabad ($315 million) didnt match the money put on the table by Sahara ($370 million) and the Shashi Tharoor-mentored Rendezvous Sports ($333.33 million).         
	The minister is very unhappy, was the message conveyed to the governing council member, shortly after the successful bidders were identified.         
	Apparently, the governing council member didnt react in a big way, but did inform colleagues about that call. We were shocked, is how one colleague put it, speaking exclusively, on Friday.         
	Thats not all         
	Right now, its an allegation, but if sources are to be believed, Lalit Modi, the suspended IPL chairman and commissioner, advised Rendezvous Sports that a bid of $310 million should serve the purpose.         
	It wouldnt have, for both Videocon ($319.9 million) and the Adani Group bid higher. Only a probe will determine whether Modi was trying to mislead and if he had a bigger agenda.         
	Significantly, one of the charges against Modi, listed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), is that hed rigged the first auction for the two new franchises, on March 7.         
	That, as it turned out, was scrapped and, at the behest of BCCI president Shashank Manohar, retendering ordered. The revised auction was held on March 21.         
	Indeed, but for Manohar, the script wouldve been very, very different.         
	With Modi suspended, the governing council now has 13 members. Industrialist Chirayu Amin is the interim head.

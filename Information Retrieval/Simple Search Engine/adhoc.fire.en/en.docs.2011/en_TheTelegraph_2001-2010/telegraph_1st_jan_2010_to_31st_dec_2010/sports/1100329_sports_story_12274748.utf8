                                                                                                                       7                                      Toni gives Roma a thrilling victory
                      
	Rome: A Luca Toni goal gave AS Roma a thrilling 2-1 home win over Inter Milan on Saturday that took them within a point of the Serie A leaders and kept the three-way title race wide open approaching the final stretch.         
	The striker controlled a mis-hit Rodrigo Taddei shot and fired home in the 72nd minute as the hosts continued their remarkable recovery from the disarray they found themselves in at the start of the season.         
	Inters Diego Milito had equalised just six minutes earlier with a goal that looked offside, after Romas Daniele de Rossi opened the scoring in the 17th by capitalising on a blunder by goalkeeper Julio Cesar.         
	Champions Inter hit the woodwork three times, the last occasion from Milito deep in stoppage time.         
	This is a great, beautiful night, Toni told said later. Weve been chasing for a while. It was important to win to try to realise a dream. Now were a point away well see what happens.         
	Inter, who meet CSKA Moscow in the first leg of their Champions League quarter final on Wednesday, may be suffering from fatigue because of their packed fixture list, having only won two of their last nine league games.         
	Elsewhere Palermo consolidated fourth place, which is worth a slot in next seasons Champions League preliminaries, with a 3-1 home win over Bologna courtesy of a Fabrizio Miccoli hattrick.         
	The striker nutmegged keeper Emiliano Viviano on 10 minutes and then restored his sides advantage with a penalty in the 43rd after Adailton had been on target from a free kick for Bologna.         
	Miccoli then sealed victory for the Sicilians 11 minutes from time.         
	In Spain, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored for the third straight match to fire Barcelona to a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Real Mallorca on Saturday and send the champions three points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.         
	The Sweden striker smashed the ball into the roof of the net from close range in the 63rd minute for his 15th league goal of the campaign to end Mallorcas stubborn resistance and give his side 74 points from 29 matches.         
	Barca have been relying on a flood of goals from league top scorer Lionel Messi to keep their title bid on track but coach Pep Guardiola started with both the Argentina forward and fit-again Spain midfielder Xavi on the bench.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar save crucial: Jadeja
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tendulkar save crucial: Jadeja
  - Proteas stand-in captain blames misfortune for the defeat         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jacques Kallis celebrates one of his wickets during the first ODI against India, in Jaipur, on Sunday                                 
	Jaipur: Sachin Tendulkar saving that one run in the crucial final over made all the difference in the one-dayer here, according to Ravindra Jadeja.         
	The all rounder, who was adjudged the Man of the Match, said there was a moment when he thought India might lose the match. But PK (Praven Kumar) bhai sent down a good over and Sachin paaji (Tendulkar) then saved one run when he dived to stop that boundary. Otherwise, it would have been a tie or we would have even lost, he said.         
	Tendulkars heroics came in the penultimate delivery when he dived full length at long leg to save a hard hit from Charl Langeveldt that was going for a four. The batsman could take only three runs off it and eventually the South African fell short by one run.         
	Jadeja said accuracy also paid him rich dividends. After contributing 22 brisk runs with the bat, Jadeja played a stellar role with the ball as well, claiming two South African wickets conceding just 29 runs in 10 overs.         
	Since I was bowling in the Powerplays, the idea was to keep it stump-to-stump. There was no question of giving width to the South Africans. I decided not to bowl too outside the off-stump. They were going great guns, so we could not afford to gift them easy runs, said the all-rounder.         
	There was not much turn in the track, so I thought I would bowl to their pads. I thought even if I dont get the wickets, I would not concede runs since containing was also important at that stage, the Saurashtra player explained.         
	Jadeja said even though bowlers like Sreesanth went for some runs initially, they made amends in the end.         
	I think all the bowlers did well. Some conceded runs early but then came back in the middle overs and everything was fine in the end, he said.         
	Asked if he struggled with the dew problem, Jadeja said: Not really. I came out early to bowl and the ball was not wet yet. I think other spinners bowled well when it was not easy gripping the ball.         
	The youngster, who has been banned from the Indian Premier League for allegedly sounding out franchisees outside his Rajasthan Royals team, remained tight-lipped when asked if he expected mercy from the IPL authorities.         
	I dont want to talk about that. I came here with my concentration only on this ODI series, he said.

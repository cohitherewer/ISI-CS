The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Gunners to miss Fabregas

	London: Arsenal will not have captain Cesc Fabregas on the team for Tuesdays Champions League home fixture against Porto after being ruled out of the last-16 second leg tie against Porto at the Emirates stadium with a hamstring problem, manager Arsene Wenger said.         
	This was the last thing the Gunners needed at a time when their European fortunes rest on their ability to turn around a deficit against the Portuguese club.         
	Arsene Wengers boys have been buffeted by injuries this season and, after the horrible fracture sustained by Aaron Ramsey in the 3-1 win over Burnley, news that Fabregas is missing with a recurrence of the injury suffered in Saturdays Premier League match is sure to make the Frenchman feel that that victory had come at a severe price.         
	Although Arsenal had lost the match away to Porto 2-1, the young Gunners have effected an emphatic turnaround and are again in the race as the Premier League heads to a photo finish. The really mouth-watering matches in this suite of matches are on Wednesday when there is a potential of David Beckham stepping on to the Old Trafford pitch when Manchester United host AC Milan.         
	There is scope for more dramatic stuff when Real Madrid host Olympique Lyon knowing they must find a way past an defence which has not conceded a goal in more than 10 hours football if they are to keep alive their dream of playing in a Champions League final in their own stadium.         
	Beckham will return to Old Trafford for the first time in seven years as Milan visit his old club, who may be without injured Wayne Rooney.         
	Bayern Munich visit Fiorentina in Tuesdays other match, with the first leg having witnessed highly-controversial refereeing decisions. Four-times champions Bayern, unbeaten in 18 games in all competitions, take a 2-1 lead to Fiorentina thanks to a last-gasp Miroslav Klose goal which both coaches agreed was well offside.         
	The Arsenal manager was incensed after Colombian striker Radamel Falcaos goal from a quickly taken indirect free kick was allowed to stand.         
	First of all, it has to be clarified how Uefa nominate referees for games. They have to be much more open on how they rate their referees. Nobody really knows how they name their referees, he told a news conference a couple of days after the game.         
	Where is the ranking of the referees? I believe too much has gone on in the last 30 years. What has happened is not good for football.         
	Referees are likely to be even more under the spotlight this week after soccers rule-makers, the International Football Association (IFAB), on Saturday decided to indefinitely reject the use of goal line technology.

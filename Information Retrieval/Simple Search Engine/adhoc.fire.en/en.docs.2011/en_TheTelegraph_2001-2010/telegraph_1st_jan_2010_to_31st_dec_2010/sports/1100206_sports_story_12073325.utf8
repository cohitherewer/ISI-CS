The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A test for the middle-order 
                                                                                                                       7                                        A test for the middle-order 
            SUDIPTO GUPTA    
	Nagpur: Sometimes opportunities come disguised as misfortunes. For Mahendra Singh Dhoni, missing Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh (both out with injuries) against a South African pace attack that threatens to be menacing is nothing but misfortune.         
	But then, on the eve of the first Test for the Jaypee Infratech Cup, the flip side to that will of course be a chance for likes Murali Vijay and S. Badrinath to announce that the future of the Indian middle-order is not in doldrums.         
	If Badrinath, who has been on the fringe for quite some time, will be itching to make it count, his statemate and reserve opener Murali Vijay will be keen to justify his inclusion in the middle-order.         
	After the nets at the Vidharbha Cricket Association Stadium, in neighbouring Jamtha, on Friday, captain Dhoni refused to confirm the status of senior-pro VVS Laxman, who is nursing a finger injury sustained during the first Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong.         
	According to the Indian captain, a final call on Laxmans availability will be taken after consultation with the physio.         
	Under these circumstances, it will again depend on the smash-hit opening pair of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir to give the team a solid start and Sachin Tendulkar to shoulder the burden of the middle-order which looks fragile on paper.         
	The bowling department, on the contrary, looks pretty composed with Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma sharing the new ball. The wily Harbhajan Singh, will have leg-spinner Amit Mishra for company.         
	But if injury worries appear to be Indias bane, Graeme Smiths men, too, have their own baggage of woes to tackle.         
	Smith, on Friday, uttered weve tried to cover all our bases as many as four times during the news conference. That goes a long way in explaining the psyche of the captain.         
	Add to that the fact that this Test series was arranged in a jiffy and it would be easier for one to visualise the plight of captain Smith whose ship has been thrown into one of the most tumultuous waters in international cricket  India.         
	Also worrying them will be their vulnerability against spin, as exposed by Englishman Graeme Swann who snared 21 wickets in their last series.         
	But the visitors do boast of a tearaway speed duo in Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel who can be a handful for the Indians.         
	The pitch may, however, come to the Indians rescue as it promises to be fruitful for the spinners towards the later half of the match. The last and only time a Test was played at this ground, between India and Australia in November 2008, the spinners shared 24 wickets between them with Australian Jason Krejza bagging 12 of them.         
	Also, the overcast conditions have thrust a sudden importance on reverse swing and as admitted by both the captains, it will play a significant role in the five-day encounter.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman/Rohit Sharma, S Badrinath, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Amit Mishra, Ishant Sharma

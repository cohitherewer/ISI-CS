The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand sets sights on No.1 spot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand sets sights on No.1 spot
                                  Anand    
	New Delhi: Having defended his World Championships title two months back, Indian Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand has set his sights on regaining Fide No. 1 spot by the year end.         
	I wanted to win the world championship and now that I have done it, I will focus on ranking and regaining No. 1 status by this year end, Anand said.         
	Anand, who defended his world title against Bulgarias Veselin Topalov in May, said the priority, however, would be to win the big tournaments that are coming up in the next few months.         
	But I believe, I should focus on the board rather than the scoreboard because once I do that, the ranking will take care of itself, he said on the sidelines of a seminar on Role of Chess in Developing Young Minds here.         
	I have some big tournaments coming up in August, October and December in Spain, China and London. The emphasis would be to play in tournaments and win those as it will automatically lead to the surge in ranking, he explained.         
	Anand is currently ranked third with 2800 Elo points, which he touched for the first time since April 2008. Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen (2826) and Topalov (2803) are at the first and second spot respectively.         
	Anand said he would not only try to win tournaments but also study the games of his opponents as he faces the winner of the Candidates Tournament for World Chess Championship 2012. Magnus, who is currently number one, will pose a good challenge. Even Russias Vladimir Kramnik, Topalav they all are fighting in the challenger. So I would have to study their games to chalk strategies for World Championship of 2012, he said.         
	The 40-year-old Indian has achieved literally everything in chess but he remains insatiable and doesnt even want to think about his retirement.         
	I am still motivated to compete and I am doing well. It feels strange when people ask me about retirement. At times you dont need targets. Thinking about retirement is a wrong attitude to have, said Anand, who in April 2007 became the oldest person to become world No. 1.         
	In a career spanning more than two decades, Anand has seen the best and worst of times and he said it was in such moments he took to experimenting with his strategies and it helped him to improve.

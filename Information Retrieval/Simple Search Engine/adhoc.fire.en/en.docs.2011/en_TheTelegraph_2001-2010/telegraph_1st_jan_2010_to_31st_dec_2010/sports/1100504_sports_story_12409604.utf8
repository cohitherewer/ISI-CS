The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal go down 1-2

	London: Blackburn Rovers upset Arsenal 2-1 Monday, riding on goals from David Dunn and Christopher Samba. A victory would have ensured third-place finish for Arsene Wengers men.         
	Gunners opened scoring in the 14th minute through Robin van Persie, but two minutes from half-time, Blackburn equalised through Dunn. Samba scored the winning goal in the 68th minute of the match.         
	In the other match, Hull Citys inevitable relegation was rubber-stamped when Wigan Athletic equalised in stoppage time to deny the visitors their first away Premier League win of the season.         
	The 2-2 draw means Hull are five points behind 17th-placed West Ham United with one game to play, though even a win would have been futile as their vastly inferior goal difference would have counted against them if they matched the London club on points.         
	Hull are 18th with 29 points and will go down to the Championship (second division) next season along with Burnley and Portsmouth.

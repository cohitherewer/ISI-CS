                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian shooters get gag order
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Rattled by the negative publicity the Organising Committee (OC) received after the Indian shooting team bitterly complained of being made to wait at the airport for more than four hours, the star marksmen have been asked not to speak to the media till the Commonwealth Games are over.         
	Having bagged 16 of the 22 gold in the medals tally, the shooters were Indias biggest medal winners in the last Commonwealth Games. With top stars like Abhinav Bindra, Gagan Narang, Ronjan Sodhi, Manavjit Singh and Tejaswani Sawant in the squad, Indians are hot favourites to repeat their Melbourne showings at the home range.         
	Though the chief coach Sunny Thomas said the gag order was issued to help the shooters to concentrate on their performance, sources said the OC has asked the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) to restrain the shooters from talking.         
	OC found itself in an embarrassing situation when the shooters, with Thomas himself taking the lead, lambasted the organisers for making them wait at the airport after they flew down from Pune.         
	Thomas, who then called the arrangements chaotic said on Wednesday: We are enjoying our stay at the Games Village. I have asked the shooters not to talk since tension is building up. The focus is now firmly on the Games. They are now concentrating hard.         
	NRAI is not the only body that has asked its athletes not to interact with the media. The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) is also believed to have issued similar instructions to the pugilist after Akhil Kumar leaked out the story of the broken bed.         
	Interestingly, in the International Zone at the Games Village where the media gets an opportunity to speak to sportspersons from different countries, Indian athletes were the only ones who looked hesitant to talk.         
	Out of the 7,000 athletes from 71 participating nations, more than 4,500 have already checked into the Village and said they were happy with the arrangements.

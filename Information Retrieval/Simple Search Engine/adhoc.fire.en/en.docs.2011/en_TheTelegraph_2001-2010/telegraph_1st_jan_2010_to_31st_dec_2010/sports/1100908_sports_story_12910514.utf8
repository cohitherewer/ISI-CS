The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC asks for call details
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC asks for call details
                      
	London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has reportedly asked Pakistans suspended Test captain Salman Butt and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal to give their cellphone records for an investigation into possible spot-fixing during the Asia Cup, in June.         
	According to an English newspaper, Kamran and Butt were contacted by the ICC after suspicions arose during the Asia Cup.         
	The ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) have told the duo to release details of their mobile phone records during the tournament in Sri Lanka.         
	They expect full co-operation from both the players, but are yet to receive a response from the Pakistan camp, the newspaper reported.         
	The ICC reportedly wrote to them on August 21, days before a British tabloids sting operation had Butt implicated in a spot-fixing scandal leading to his suspension pending an inquiry.         
	The report thus confirms the fact that the Pakistan cricketers were being investigated by the ICC even before their contentious fourth Test, against England, at Lords last month.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed has refused to comment on allegations that two of his players were being investigated for fixing during the Asia Cup.         
	There will be absolutely no comment, Saeed said when asked about the investigation. I am not going to say anything on the allegations. They are there and we are here, getting on with our job on the tour.         
	However, a phone call to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt went unanswered.         
	The newspaper also reported that 18-year-old pace sensation Mohammed Aamer will be told he could avoid a life ban if he gives evidence against his teammates in the ongoing inquiry against him, Butt and Mohammed Asif.         
	However, Pakistan teams associate manager Shafqat Rana said that if Aamer is found guilty, he should not be shown any leniency because of his tender age. I do not believe a players age has any significance in this issue  it is the same for everybody. If Aamer is found to have broken the law, it doesnt matter that he is so young. He should be given the same punishment as anyone else, Rana said.         
	Rana added that in Pakistan, too, the general mood is that the trio should be punished if the charges against them are proved.         
	I think that is the feeling back home in Pakistan too. At home, they want everything to be done in the best spirit of the game, he said.           (AGENCIES)

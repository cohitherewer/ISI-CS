	Erasmia: The shadow of Diego Armando Maradona has been looming large over the German camp ever since it became known they would cross swords with Argentina in the quarter finals.         
	On Wednesday, when he spoke to the media at the Velemore Hotel here, German coach Joachim Loew was flooded with questions as to how he was going to handle the new-look Argentina under Maradona. And Loew confirmed what most have been saying  beating Argentina would be more difficult this time than it was on home soil in 2006.         
	The German football federation is doing everything to lift the team spirit before the team take on a side that have four back-to-back wins under their belt.         
	A day before the tie, star striker Michael Ballack, who missed the World Cup with an injury, will be flown into Cape Town. Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised to be present in the stands to cheer her team onto victory. All because the Argentines have the advantage of Maradona standing in their technical area.         
	As a player, I had great regard for Maradona. He was a genius and an idol for soccer lovers, Loew said. As a coach, I dont know much about him. I have heard he is doing a good job in training. It could be true, as Argentina have won all matches since the start of the World Cup. He must be good.         
	Loew was unfortunate to miss the services of some top players, including the seasoned Ballack, one of Germanys most capped players.         
	Yet, Race to the summit is the motto that Loew has chosen for Germanys quest for the 2010 World Cup. We are the best and my boys will prove it on the pitch. The cup would be ours, said Loew proudly.         
	The German again coach spoke at length about Maradona when he was asked whether the encounter at Cape Town could turn out to be a rough affair.         
	Maybe, I dont know... in 2006, Argentina were rough and created a lot of problems, even after the match.         
	This time, I find them a highly spirited side. Maradona has injected a kind of pride in them, which is a positive sign for any team, Loew said. But that doesnt mean Argentina wont be rough. Maradona is putting pressure on the referee before every match but they too are indulging in rough play. Fifa and the referees should look into it,         
	At the last World Cup, Germany overcame Argentina in a penalty shootout. This time, there is a chance of the match getting over within stipulated time as both teams have good strikers.         
	Argentina have a forward line that can turn them into world champions (Lionel) Messi, (Carlos) Tevez are all brilliant players. We dont lag far behind. We have (Thomas) Mueller, (Miroslav) Klose, (Lukas) Podloski All are potential world beaters.         
	I accept Argentina are dazzling They have Maradona as the manager. We in Germany also know how to win matches, Loew said.

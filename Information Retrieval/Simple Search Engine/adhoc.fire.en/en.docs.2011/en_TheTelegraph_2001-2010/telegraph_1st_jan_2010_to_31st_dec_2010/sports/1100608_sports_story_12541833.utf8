The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This is Africa, against all odds
                                                                                                                       7                                        This is Africa, against all odds
            RIAN MALAN            There will be no dearth of colour in the Rainbow Nation. A South Africa supporter outside one of the Cup venues                           
	In apartheids heyday, I played left-half for an all-white soccer team at my whites-only primary school. Photographs show a sorry aggregation of spindly little snivellers, but in our own minds we were giants. We slew all rivals in our corner of Johannesburgs white suburbs and made it into the quarter finals of a city-wide tournament, where we were taken out (1-0) by a rival white suburb known as Rosebank.         
	In South Africa, in the early Sixties, everything was starkly black and white, including professional soccer. Our teams had names like Germiston Callies and Durban United. Their most famous teams were Kaiser Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. White teams played in segregated stadiums with separate entrances and seating for the various races. Black teams played in the parallel universe to which blacks were relegated by apartheid. The twain were forbidden to meet, which is why differing racial capacities (as manifested on the football field) were an object of heated schoolboy debate.         
	Schoolboy racial theory held that blacks had incendiary striking skills, but struggled in positions requiring discipline and a steady head - in defence, and in the pivotal slot once known as centre-half.         
	Wed never seen the great black teams play, because whites simply didnt go to Soweto in those days, and our stern Calvinist rulers had outlawed television lest it rot our brains. Our assessment was based entirely on racial superstition.         
	Oddly, it turned out to be uncannily accurate. When professional soccer was desegregated two decades later, almost all the legendary black clubs recruited white backs and goalies, while white teams hired black strikers.         
	This formula  whites in the backline, incendiary black strikers as spearheads  informed the selection of the national squad that carried our new flag into battle in the heady first days of Mandelas reign. We even had a white coach and a white captain, and for a year or two we were almost invincible, crushing African soccer powerhouses like Cameroon and Nigeria and winning the 1995 African Cup of Nations tournament.         
	Youll have to pardon the thought crimes that seem to lurk hereabouts because the moral of this story is entirely benign: when South Africans pull together, we can move mountains.         
	When Fifa awarded South Africa the 2010 World Cup, there were groans of disbelief around the planet. Some thought it foolish to stage the tournament in a country best known for its high crime rate and close proximity to Robert Mugabes Zimbabwe. Others maintained that such considerations were irrelevant, given South Africas allegedly manifest inability to host such a complicated event.         
	 Before approving our bid, Fifa made us promise to jump through all hoops of its choosing, and our leaders eagerly complied. We agreed to refurbish freeways, upgrade airports and build elaborate new mass-transit systems. We agreed to build a high-speed train linking our largest international airport to surrounding cities and, most improbably, to erect 10 new world-class soccer stadia.         
	Many observers thought the task way beyond our capabilities. I agreed.         
	By 2008, the sceptics were looking prescient. Work on the stadiums proceeded painfully slowly. A miscalculation on the part of tunnellers caused a giant sinkhole to appear in Johannesburgs suburbs. Traffic was paralysed by roadworks. Taxi warlords threatened violence against Fifas proposed bus service. At this point, Fifa boss Sepp Blatter conceded that there were plans to move the 2010 World Cup elsewhere in the event of a natural disaster in South Africa.         
	Blatter was, of course, being diplomatic. The disaster he had in mind was a human one, brought on by sloth, incompetence and rudderless government. Shaken by this unspoken ultimatum, South Africans pulled their socks up. Golden pleasure domes soared skywards. Fleets of gleaming new buses trundled on to our streets.         
	Six years ago, experts estimated that the World Cup stadia would cost 2.3 billion rand (200 million). The final cost was 10 times higher, thanks to soaring commodity prices and an unknown measure of tender manipulation by politicians and their cronies. All told, the World Cup will cost us around 100 billion rand (9.11 billion)  a dumbfounding sum for a country where most people live on or under the breadline. The Left is incensed, describing our leaders willingness to squander money at Fifas behest as an act of national prostitution whose only legacy will be increased hardship for the underclass and a brace of stadia so superfluous to requirements that most will never be used again after the World Cup.         
	Ah, well. Im as old as Methuselah, and I cant recall a single week in which South Africa wasnt facing a crisis that threatened to put an end to our precarious existence. Against all odds, we surmounted all of them, and well probably weather this one too. Let the games begin!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Munaf for Sreesanth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Munaf for Sreesanth
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sreesanth has been ruled out of the Test series against Sri Lanka with a knee injury and will return home. Munaf Patel will replace him in the squad, the BCCI said Monday.         
	Sreesanth has sprained a ligament of his left knee, and been advised rest for 3-4 weeks. He will accordingly be returning to India, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement.         
	The all-India selection committee has picked Munaf Patel as his replacement in the Indian team that will be playing the Test series in Sri Lanka. Munaf will join the squad at the earliest, the statement added.         
	Sreesanth was ruled out after an MRI scan revealed he had a ligament tear, a development which has come as a big blow for Team Indias already depleted pace attack in the absence of spearhead Zaheer Khan, who is nursing a shoulder injury.         
	With Sreesanth too being ruled out, Ishant Sharma would have to lead the attack, which also includes Zaheers replacement Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	It was probably the best birthday gift for Munaf, who turned 27 Monday. The pacer has played 12 Tests so far, his last being against New Zealand in Wellington last year.         
	India are scheduled to play a three-day warm-up match against Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI here from Tuesday. The first Test begins in Galle on July 18.

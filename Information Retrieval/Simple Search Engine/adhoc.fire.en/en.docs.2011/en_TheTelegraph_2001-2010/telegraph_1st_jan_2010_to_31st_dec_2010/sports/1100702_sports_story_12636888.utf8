The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ghana will carry hopes of Africa
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ghana will carry hopes of Africa

	Ghana stand on the threshold of history. If this exciting young team beat Uruguay in their quarter final in Johannesburg on Friday they will go further than any African team have in the World Cup. If they do, believe me, the whole continent will celebrate.         
	Only two African nations  Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002  have made it as far as Ghana, but if they can take it one step further then the first World Cup to have been held in Africa will have found its true heroes. We are not like other continents in the way our football allegiance works. Here there is real continental solidarity and national differences are quickly put aside. This has been clear for all to see at every game involving an African team and, at Soccer City, I can guarantee almost the whole stadium will be supporting the Black Stars. Ghana are not just flying the flag for their supporters in Accra but for Africans all over the world.         
	For me it has been one of the very few disappointments of this World Cup that other African sides have not matched Ghanas success. This was a big opportunity for African football, a showcase for our best talent, and it has ended with too many failures, though for Nigerias president to suspend the team for two years is completely crazy.         
	They had a disappointing campaign but Nigeria is one of the biggest football countries in Africa and they must be allowed to compete.         
	The biggest disappointment was the failure of South Africa to qualify from their group. They could hold their heads high after beating France but their chances had really gone by the Uruguay game. The atmosphere for those Bafana Bafana games was incredible, both moving and exciting. Now I am sure those fans will back Ghana.         
	I think this is the time for African football to take a look at itself and make some important changes. The federations have to provide more support for the players, to put the interests of the team first. Players need to come into big tournaments properly prepared. That also means African teams have to stop looking to expensive foreign coaches for a solution. Its time to get in local coaches who know the culture and style of play with which these boys have been raised. Lets stop inhibiting African football with a negative, European-style approach.         
	Ghanas example of bringing through their young players is one to be followed. They have promoted players from the World Under-20 Championship-winning team last year to the senior side with great success, blending them with the more established players.         
	Their success has been about a team dynamic but there have been some excellent individual performances too. Asamoah Gyan has made history of his own by becoming the first African to score four goals at a finals since Roger Milla. Andre Ayew, the son of the great Abedi Pele, has been impressive on the wing, as have Anthony Annan and Kevin-Prince Boateng in midfield. John Mensah will need to continue his excellent form in defence to combat the dangerous Diego Forlan.         
	What is remarkable about Ghana is that they have succeeded without their heavyweights. Any team would find room for Michael Essien, so to lose him to injury was a huge blow. Yet they have coped and moved on.         
	Even Sulley Muntari and Stephen Appiah have taken a background role as the stars of the future have been given their chance. All over Africa, kids have new heroes to emulate. I remember when I was a kid in 1990 seeing Milla take Cameroon further than any other African team had before. I was in awe of those guys but also inspired by them.         
	There has been talk all week in the Ghana camp of pride, not pressure. This is important. Ghana have come a long way already. That should give them the belief they need to make the next step. Then, when you are down to the last four, who knows? What an incredible story it would be if they went the whole way.             The writer is a former SA captain

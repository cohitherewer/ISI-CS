                                                                                                                       7                                      Osayomi stripped   of 100m gold
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) Tuesday confirmed that Nigerian Osayomi Oludamola has been stripped of her womens 100m gold after her B sample, too, tested positive for banned substance methylhexaneamine.         
	Osayomi had failed a dope test, Monday, for the banned substance, and had been provisionally suspended till her B sample results were found.         
	Consequently, her gold medal will now be awarded to Natasha Mayers of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, while the silver will go to Katherine Endacott of England, with the bronze going to Bertille Delphine Atangana of Cameroon.         
	Meanwhile, for a second day in a row, doping plagued the Games, as yet another Nigerian athlete tested positive for methylhexaneamine on Tuesday. Samuel Okun, a finalist in the mens 110metres hurdles, was suspended on Tuesday, following a hearing after a waiving of his right to have his B sample tested. Okon finished sixth in the mens 110m hurdles finals.         
	Fennell said: I have to report a second anti-doping violation. It is another Nigerian athlete, Samuel Okon in the 110m hurdles, and it is the same substance, methylhexaneamine. The athlete has been notified.         
	Fennell added: We are concerned with the number of incidents that are coming up with the same substance.         
	At this stage, I cannot speak very definitively as to where its coming from, but it appears that it may be coming from the use of supplements.         
	The supplements industry is by and large an unregulated industry world wide, and it is an industry that is a cause of great concern, not only for the fight against doping, but also for the protection of athletes.

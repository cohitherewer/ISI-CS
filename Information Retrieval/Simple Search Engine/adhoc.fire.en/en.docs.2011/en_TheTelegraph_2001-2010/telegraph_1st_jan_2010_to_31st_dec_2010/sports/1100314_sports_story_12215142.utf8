The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil: Sourav captaincy made the difference
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anil: Sourav captaincy made the difference
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble feels Sourav Gangulys return as captain has made a big difference to the Kolkata Knight Riders this season.         
	Souravs experience and involvement have helped the team gel as a unit, said Kumble at a press conference on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His thoughts on the eve of their opener         
	Twenty20 is a format where every game is important. IPL is a pretty long tournament Nobody gave us a chance halfway through the tournament last year. Once we started winning and got the momentum, we were a different side. Eventually we made the title-round That will be our strategy this time, too. Well take one game at a time. We certainly respect every opposition. We would like to start on a winning note.         
	The preparations         
	In terms of interaction with the players, most of the players came during the last week because of their international and domestic commitments. No matter what you plan, Twenty20 is such a format that you have to think on the field. You can do whatever planning and strategies, things may change. Like what happened yesterday. Hopefully, we will be able to do better than what we did last time.         
	The balance of the side         
	We have six foreign players available for selection tomorrow (Sunday). (Jacques) Kallis and (Mark) Boucher will be joiing us tonight. We have a really exciting bunch of Indian players who are in great form. We will be looking forward to the combination like the last time  the right blend of foreign and Indian players.         
	If the form of their players is a good sign         
	In cricket, confidence is very important. Its really important that most of our players are in good form either at domestic or international level. I am sure the confidence level in batting or bowling will certainly help.         
	On a personal level, his thoughts         
	Feels nice to know that you just have to play 45 days of cricket. If you get to the final, you just have to bowl 64 overs. Its not a bad task for someone who would probably bowl 64 overs in a game...         
	Getting back into competitive cricket         
	Its all about individual motivation. In terms of skills, yes it will take some time to get back into the groove. I am looking forward to the challenge.         
	If he will quit after this edition of the IPL         
	I dont know... I have not even played the first game. Its a long tournament...maybe you should ask this question later in the tournament.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders as an opposition         
	On Friday, the Kolkata Knight Riders showed that it just takes two batsmen to bring them out of the rut... Angelo Mathews and Owais Shah...one partnership can change the game. Thats the beauty of this format. We are not really targeting just one player.         
	If Sourav Gangulys return as captain has made the difference for the Knight Riders         
	Definitely... his experience and also his involvement with the Knight Riders... Sourav certainly brings in that quality to his captaincy and to his game. That helps in putting the team together as a unit.         
	The battle between two former India captains         
	Its still the Royal Challengers Bangalore versus the Kolkata Knight Riders, not Anil Kumble vs Sourav Ganguly. I respect Sourav as a teammate and now as an opposition. I dont think its any different.

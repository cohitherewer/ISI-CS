The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harper issue is not over yet
                                                                                                                       7                                      Harper issue is not over yet
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	England will find out this week who will be appointed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to hear their complaint about Daryl Harpers umpiring, which contributed to their innings defeat by South Africa in the fourth and final Test in Johannesburg.         
	The ICC says it will appoint a panel that includes one lawyer and one former cricketer to discover whether Harper, in the television umpires room, had the feed volume turned up to the right level. He was unable to hear a snick when South Africas captain, Graeme Smith, apparently edged one off Ryan Sidebottom. Smith, who was on 15 at the time, went on to make a match-winning century.         
	Harper, 58, has been one of only two permanent members of the elite panel of umpires since it was founded in 2002 (Rudi Koertzen being the other). But the South Australian has courted far more controversy and criticism than any other umpire, and it is understood that his employers, the ICC, are becoming fed up with his mistakes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney will bounce back, says Ferguson
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney will bounce back, says Ferguson
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                  Wayne Rooney		      
	Manchester United return to the scene of one of their defeats last season, and the season before, as they face Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday. United began the season with a 3-0 home win over Newcastle but have lost to Fulham the last two seasons, conceding five goals and not scoring a goal.         
	United were crippled by defensive injuries when they were well beaten 3-0 in London last December but they too made amends at home, winning by the same score in March.         
	With Roy Hodgson departed and new boss Mark Hughes only having a few weeks to work with the Fulham squad, the chances of a hattrick of home wins against United look slim.         
	United are again expected to be Chelseas main challenger for the title but will have to do without Rio Ferdinand for another five weeks as the England captain recovers from medial ligament damage suffered just before the World Cup.         
	We are still thinking the end of September for Rio, United manager Alex Ferguson said. It was a medial ligament problem rather than a cruciate, so the recovery time is exactly what we thought.         
	Midfielder Anderson, who is back in training after recovering from a cruciate ligament injury sustained in February, also will be absent when United play Fulham away on Sunday, but Ferguson said the Brazil international is expected to return to first-team action at the start of next month. Then there is the question of Wayne Rooneys form.         
	A mere 145 days ago, Rooney was about to record his 19th goal in 14 games for Manchester United, sustaining a remarkable run of form which appeared destined to flow like a torrent through to the World Cup final, enabling Sir Alex Fergusons team to sweep all before them to a Premier League and Champions League double on the way.         
	Then came the Sliding Doors moment, the split-second that changed everything and hauled Rooney back from the brink of immortality.         
	Had he allowed the covering Ryan Giggs to check the run of Mario Gomez deep into stoppage time against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena, Rooney would not have mistimed his challenge on the German forward and he would have escaped the damage to his right ankle sustained after his attempted intervention.

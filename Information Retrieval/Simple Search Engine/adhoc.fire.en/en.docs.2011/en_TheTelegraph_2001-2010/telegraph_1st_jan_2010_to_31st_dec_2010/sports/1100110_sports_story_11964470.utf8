The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag rein in East Bengal 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag rein in East Bengal 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Last Sunday, the East Bengal players were on a high after winning the Federation Cup in Guwahati. However, in less than a week, they have suffered a rude jolt as Chirag United logged full points with a 0-1 defeat of the red and gold brigade in their ninth round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	The win took Chirag to 18 points after nine rounds. They are second on the league table after Dempo who also have 18 points but are on top by virtue of better goal difference.         
	It was Brazilian Edmilson who proved to be the thorn in East Bengals side, scoring from the spot for the winner, in the 67th minute.         
	A defence-splitting through ball from Joshimar caught East Bengal side-back Nirmal Chetri unawares. Just when Edmilson was about round custodian Abhra Mondal, the latter pulled the striker down and referee Rizwan-ul-Haq pointed to the spot.         
	Over the next 27 minutes (including four minutes of stoppage time), Subrata Bhattacharyas boys did well to stop their opponents from scoring.         
	East Bengal may feel slightly unlucky that the referee didnt award them a penalty when skipper Syed Rahim Nabi looked like he was pulled down by Chirag stopper Arnab Mondal in the 82nd minute.         
	However, a close look at the full 90 minutes would reveal that it was Subrata Bhattacharyas tactical acumen that tilted the scales in Chirags favour.         
	Not only did he curb East Bengals wing-play but his boys also enjoyed the numerical advantage going forward as counterpart Phillippe de Ridder chose to deploy three, instead of the usual four men, in defence.         
	Still, East Bengal had their share of opportunities, the first in as early as the second minute.         
	Subhash Singh bustled into the 18-yard box, latching on to a Yusif Yakubu assist. Subhash nicely set it up for Abel Hammond whose tap-in hit the post.         
	Chirag got a couple of free-kicks in the first half, in the 6th and 26th minutes, but on both occasions, Abhra Mondal dived to deny Bhattacharyas boys.         
	Although Yakubu tried his best to make inroads, the lack of support upfront made it difficult for the Ghanaian. Harmanjot Khabra gave a poor account of himself down the right. Sanju Pradhan and Hammond lacked the sting.         
	On the other hand, Chirag skipper Denson Devadas slowly started controlling the midfield along with Soumik Chakraborty and Gouranga Biswas.         
	Although there were defensive lapses, the Chirag back-four complemented each other well. Arnab, Eduardo, Dhanrajan and Rahul Kumar defended with grit.         
	In the 42nd minute, Eduardo made an impressive goalmouth clearance when he prevented Pradhan from taking a crack from close. On another occasion, it was Dhanrajan whose timely tackle on Hammond averted danger.         
	Chirag could have gone 2-0 up, against the run of play, when Joshimar had Abhra at his mercy but his placement was poor and Abhra stretched his legs to foil the danger.         
	Thus, after beating their much-fancied opponents twice and having held them to a draw on one occasion, Chirag, with Saturdays win, maintained their unbeaten record against East Bengal this season.

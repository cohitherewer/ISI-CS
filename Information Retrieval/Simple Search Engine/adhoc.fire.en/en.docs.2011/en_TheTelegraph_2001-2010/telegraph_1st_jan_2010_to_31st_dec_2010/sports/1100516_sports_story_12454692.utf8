The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wouldve kept Aamer back for last, says Ramiz Raja
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wouldve kept Aamer back for last, says Ramiz Raja
  - Former Pakistan captain shocked by semi-final defeat       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ramiz Raja                                 
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Like Pakistanis all over, Ramiz Raja was numbed by the failure of Shahid Afridi and Co. to defend 191 for six.         
	My wife texted me a one-word message from Lahore... It read shocked... That accurately sums up my feelings, too, Ramiz, a former captain and one-time chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday evening, he added: We made mistakes, most notably giving the final over to a spinner, (Saeed) Ajmal... (Michael) Hussey is known to play the spinners well and it was known hed look for sixes over the short boundary... In any case, giving the 20th or the 50th over to a spinner is always mighty risky... I wouldve kept (Mohammed) Aamer back for the last...         
	Ramiz continued: I also feel Afridi shouldve bowled better and not taken himself off when he did...Then, some boundaries ought definitely to have been saved... Its sad that such a fine batting performance went in vain... Nobody expected Pakistan to bat so well (on being inserted) and, after doing so, we shouldve been able to defend... The slog just wasnt checked.         
	According to Ramiz, Umar Akmal (56 not out) and Aamer (three for 35) continue to impress and have a terrific future. As he put it: Theyre the much-needed fresh legs in the team... Well be better served with a few more...         
	Given Australias stunning win, Ramiz was of the view that it would be difficult to look beyond Michael Clarke and his men in the World Twenty20 final, in Bridgetown, on Sunday.         
	England, the other finalist, have never won a world event. Theyve lost in the finals of the 1979, 1987 and 1992 World Cups and in the title-round of the 2004 Champions Trophy.

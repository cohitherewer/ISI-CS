                  Mohammed Hafeez in action, in Dubai, on Saturday                     
	Dubai: Umar Gul led an impressive fightback by Pakistan to limit South Africa to just 380 Saturday and put on 144 for 2 in their first innings, on the second day of the first Test.         
	At stumps, Younis Khan (21 not out) and Azhar Ali (12 not out) were at the crease after Pakistan openers Mohammed Hafeez (60) and Taufeeq Umar (42) put on 105 runs. The latter fell in quick succession but it was still a good comeback from Pakistan after Gul and the spinners had sparked a Proteas collapse.         
	Proteas started the day at 311 for three, but the last eight wickets fell for the addition of only 73 runs. Gul initiated the slide with three quick wickets, while spinners Abdur Rehman and Saeed Ajmal chipped in with two each for the day. Pakistan were without fast bowler Wahab Riaz, who could not take the field due to a side strain.         
	Pakistan manager Intikhab Alam confirmed that Riaz had been advised one-months rest and would be taking no further part in the two-match series.           (AGENCIES)

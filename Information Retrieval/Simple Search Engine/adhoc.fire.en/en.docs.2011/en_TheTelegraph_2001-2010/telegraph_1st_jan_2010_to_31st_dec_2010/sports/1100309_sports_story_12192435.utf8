The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev ends tied 35th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev ends tied 35th
                      
	Palm Beach Garden: A roller-coaster two-over 72 in the final round meant he could only manage to lift himself by a rung as Jeev Milkha Singh signed off tied 35th at the $5.6 million Honda Classic golf tournament. Colombian Camilo Villegas clinched the title by five strokes after a two-under 68 in the final round left him 13-under overall.         
	His worst card of the week left Jeevs overall total at three-over 283. The Indian opened steadily and parred the first two holes before going one-under with a birdie on the third hole. But he was undone by a bogey on the sixth followed by a double bogey on the seventh.         
	A birdie on the ninth arrested the slide as Jeev made the turn at one-over. (PTI)

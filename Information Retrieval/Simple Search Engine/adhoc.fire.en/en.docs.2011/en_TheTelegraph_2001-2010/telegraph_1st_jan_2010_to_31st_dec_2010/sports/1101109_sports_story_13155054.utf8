The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary: Dont need to justify top ranking
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gary: Dont need to justify top ranking
                      
	New Delhi: India coach Gary Kirsten Monday said that although his team does not need to justify the numero uno status in Tests to anyone, but if the side could register a series win in longer version of the game in South Africa, it might be termed as one of the greatest achievements in the history of Indian cricket.         
	We dont need to justify it to anyone, Kirsten said in an interview.         
	The performances speak loud: 23 Tests, two losses, 12 wins. When you look at the performances of the five top-ranked Test teams over the last two years, you know why India are at the top.         
	But to remain the top-ranked team, we need to continue performing. If we do win in South Africa, then you can start talking about one of the greatest Test teams India have ever produced, added the coach.         
	However, the former South Africa opener is aware that it is not going to be easy at all for the Indians.         
	South Africa are very tough to beat at home, just as India are to beat in India, he said, adding, The wickets really suit the pace bowlers.         
	But he refused to believe that Indias batsmen are vulnerable to short bowling.         
	It is all about players hitting form at the right time.         
	I certainly dont think that any opposition can use that as an out-and-out strategy to undo the Indian Test batting line-up. There is too much experience in this team now.         
	Also the Indian fast bowlers are good themselves on helpful wickets  Sreesanth, Ishant (Sharma) and Zak (Zaheer Khan) are a good bowling attack... This Test series will be a defining moment for us.         
	Meanwhile, talking about how the team would cope once the big guns  Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman retire, Kirsten assured that none of them has yet spoken to him of retirement.         
	There is no inclination of any of them retiring, Kirsten said.         
	And I always ask them. They are certainly not in any rush. Look, if Rahul Dravid decides to retire, it is a major blow. Just like when (somebody like) Jacques Kallis decides to retire, it is a major blow for any team.

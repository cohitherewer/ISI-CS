  - SL captain says Malinga rsquo;s absence is an opportunity for the others to come good
            A CORRESPONDENT            Sri Lankas Ajantha Mendis during a practice session, in Colombo, on Sunday. (Reuters)                           
	What do you call a Sri Lanka attack without Muttiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga in it? Well, definitely not weak is what their captain believes. At the match-eve news conference, Kumar Sangakkara said that although the key men from the victory in the first Test will be missed, the team have no great worries in the bowling department.         
	The following are excerpts         
	The inexperienced bowling         
	Its not exactly inexperienced. Dilhara Fernando has been there for a long time, Chanaka Welegedara has played Test cricket. Dammika Prasad as well. They have bowled well for us in the past. They are looking forward to grabbing these opportunities. The competition is really high. Lets see how it goes.         
	On Ajantha Mendis         
	Mendis has always bowled well. Unfortunately, for him, he took 26 wickets in his first Test series and, in his first big final, he took six for 13. So people have been expecting him to do that over and over again. It doesnt work that way. Hes also played a lot of cricket against India. The more you play, the more players get used to your bowling. Hes done well for us in the practice match and taking the field tomorrow (Monday), I am sure hes going to do a great job for us.         
	Not having Malinga         
	I think its a big loss to be honest. The trouble is that, with Malinga, everyone tries to survive rather than score off him. They know how dangerous he is and hes effective with both the new ball and the old. So when a player of his calibre goes out, its a huge blow. But we are looking forward to having him in the third Test.         
	The spinners for the second Test         
	I think we are going to look at all three spinners and pick the most two effective ones. With a batting line-up like Indias, we need to pick up wickets. Rangana (Herath) did well in the Test match, especially with the bat. He bowled steadily with the ball. He didnt do anything wrong. We need to make sure we make the right decision based on the conditions.         
	On Suraj Randivs chances         
	Our entire squad is in with a chance now. Murlis gone. Lasiths not fit for this Test match. So, everyone is in with a chance.         
	The wicket         
	We have a very good balance in our side because of Angelo Mathews, who is a very good seam bowler. If theres anything in the wicket, hell probably get something out of it. The SSC wicket is pretty good. Its brought a lot of runs (and) it doesnt look any different.         
	Key to batting in Lanka         
	None really. Conditions are pretty much similar in India and Sri Lanka. The wickets are a bit more difficult to score on than in India. In India, when the wickets go flat, they remain flat for a very long time. The balls we use are different as well. We use SG balls and you use Kookaburra balls. That could be a factor.         
	Any change in approach         
	You kind of change your plans a bit, but the attitude remains the same. All bowlers are different. How you plan with Lasith to take a wicket is different from how you plot with Welegedara, Prasad or Dilhara. They are all effective in their own way. You just need to make sure that you adapt to the situation...         
	Pressure on Mendis         
	Before the last Test, everyone seemed to have worked out Murali, but he ended up taking eight wickets. Its never a case of working someone out. If you dont play properly, the bowlers are in with a chance. If you are accurate and keep bowling in the right areas you cannot make any mistakes. Mendis is no different, the more he bowls on the spot, the more he puts pressure on the batsmen.         
	Lankans unorthodox style         
	Its been a strange thing for us. Most of us have grown up on formalised coaching based on the English technique. But once in a while these guys bring something unique with them because they have escaped formalisation. Weve been very lucky with the ones weve had, because they have been very good cricketers.         
	Thilan Samaraweeras fitness         
	Thilans fine, hes batted today (Sunday) and he feels hes ready to go. He can field too and he did some hard catching today. Hes fine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag held by Port
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag held by Port
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United were held to a 1-1 draw by Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in the Premier Division of the Calcutta Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium, here, on Tuesday. After Ezeh Henry had put CPT ahead at the stroke of halftime, Denson Devadas equalised in the 68th minute.         
	Some aimless running and rudderless football meant the teams meted out soccer as dull as dish water. Chirag never showed the willingness to win and were content with the end result.         
	CPT scored against the run of play when Henry scored with a left footer latching on to a Ayan Chowdhury pass.         
	Down by a goal, Chirag suddenly showed the urgency to score. Shylo Malswamtulunga used the flanks and stretched the rival defence and the introduction of P.C. Lalawmpuiya meant that there was more action inside the penalty box.         
	The Chirag midfield struggled and Eduardo complicated matters in the defence. He was lucky to escape the second yellow card, after losing his temper often, without any valid reason.         
	Denson equalised when he tapped in Eduardos lob inside the box. Denson was unlucky a little earlier when his firm header hit the crosspiece.         
	Chirag wasted another chance in the closing stages when Lalwmpuiya failed to beat the goalkeeper following a Malswamtulunga centre.

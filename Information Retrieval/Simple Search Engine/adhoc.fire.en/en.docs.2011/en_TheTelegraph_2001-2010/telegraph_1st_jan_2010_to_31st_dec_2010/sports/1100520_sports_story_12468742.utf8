The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salman Butt likely to get Test captaincy
                                                                                                                       7                                        Salman Butt likely to get Test captaincy

	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will announce the squads for next months Asia Cup and the tour of England on May 22 and opener Salman Butt is likely to get the Test captaincy.         
	Sources said acting on the advice of former coaches Intikhab Alam and Aaqib Javed, the PCB has ruled out selection of banned seniors like Mohammed Yousuf, Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik.         
	This is the suggestion that Aaqib gave to the inquiry committee of the board during the hearings in February and March and he had told them to appoint a compromise candidate for the Tests in England against Australia and England, a source said.         
	With Afridi still not inclined to play Tests and the selectors also not too keen to try him out, it appears Salman Butt who has been in good form in recent matches might get the captaincy for the Tests in England while Afridi would be retained as ODI captain for Asia Cup, the source said.         
	The PCB appears in no mood to forgive the three senior players who are automatic candidates for captaincy and indications are their appeals against their bans before the appellate tribunal will not be dispensed with quickly.         
	It is unlikely the appeals judge will give his verdict before the Asia Cup although Younis has been insisting that he should atleast be given temporary relief and suspend the indefinite ban imposed on him by the board, the source noted.         
	Sources said all indications are that the selectors would be bringing in several new faces for the tour to England where Pakistan is due to play six Tests against Australia and the hosts.         
	You might see the return of discarded players like Faisal Iqbal, Asim Kamal, Hasan Reza plus the indication of some new faces, the source said.         
	He said the PCB chairman Ijaz Butt held a meeting with coach Waqar Younis in London where the team stopped over while returning from the West Indies after playing in the World T20.         
	In all likelihood Waqar has also supported the appointment of Butt as Test captain, the source said.         
	Butt also got the vote of confidence from former captain Wasim Akram.         
	Salman has performed really well in recent times. Afridis place in the Test squad is not fixed, so there is no question of him being made the skipper, Akram said.         
	In the absence of senior blokes like Yousuf, Younis and Malik, Salman is the right choice for the job, he told a sports channel.           (PTI)

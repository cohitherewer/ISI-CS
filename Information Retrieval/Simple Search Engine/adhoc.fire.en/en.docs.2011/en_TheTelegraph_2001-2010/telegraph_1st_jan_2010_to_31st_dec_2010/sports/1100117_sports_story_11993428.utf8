                                                                                                                       7                                        Eric will be an observer in first Test, says Kirsten
  - lsquo;He comes with high credentials... I rsquo;m happy that he rsquo;s coming on board rsquo;
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Kirsten                      
	Chittagong: Eric Simons, Team Indias newly-appointed bowling consultant, will basically be an observer during the first Test against Bangladesh, which begins here on Sunday.         
	Simons, South Africas coach for around two years from late 2002, is due to reach Chittagong on the morning of Day I.         
	Eric will essentially be an observer here... Hell need time to settle down and to understand the players, coach Gary Kirsten told The Telegraph.         
	Kirsten added: Eric comes with high credentials... He was very good as South Africas coach and has worked in the corporate world, too... Im happy that hes coming on board and, yes, Ill now be able to focus on the areas that I really want to.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men have been without a specialist bowling coach/consultant ever since Venkatesh Prasads sacking three months ago.         
	Kirsten pointed out that Simons, an all-rounder who played 23 ODIs for South Africa in the mid-Nineties, had been the coach during the closing stages of his own career as an opener.         
	I do know what Erics capable of doing and it will be helpful that hes served as the coach at the international level, Kirsten said.         
	Kirsten didnt deny that hed strongly recommended Simons to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). In fact, there were a few names which were forwarded to the BCCI, he maintained.         
	According to Kirsten, Simons is going to be closely involved with the planning from the lead up to the second and final Test, in Dhaka, from January 24.         
	For now, the 47-year-old Simons will be with Team India till the end of the home series (Tests and ODIs) against South Africa, next month.

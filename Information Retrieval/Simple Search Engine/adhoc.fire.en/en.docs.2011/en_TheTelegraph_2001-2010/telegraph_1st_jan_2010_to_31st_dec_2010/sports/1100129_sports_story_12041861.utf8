	Rajkot: West Zone are all but assured of a berth in the Duleep Trophy final after dismissing North Zone for 294 to take a huge 475-run first innings lead on Day III of their semi-final match Thursday.         
	The hosts, however, did not enforce follow-on and had scored 56 for the loss of one wicket in their second essay. Cheteshwar Pujara, who opened the innings with Ajinkya Rahane, was batting on 31 at stumps along with Parthiv Patel who was unbeaten on 23.         
	Earlier, resuming at the overnight score of 36 for three, North lost wickets at regular intervals to get bowled out in 81.2 overs.         
	Overnight batsmen Virat Kohli and Vikramjeet Malik added 95 runs for the fourth wicket before both were scalped in quick succession by all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.         
	With North reduced to 108 for five, Rajat Bhatia and Mithun Manhas created hopes of a fightback with 100 runs for the sixth wicket.         
	However, the duo had departed in a space of five overs as Manhas was pouched by Parthiv off Abhishek Nayar while Jadeja accounted for Bhatia. Jadeja ended the day with three for 54.         
	Irfan Pathan was the other successful bowler for the hosts, claiming three for 69 runs.         
	Brief scores

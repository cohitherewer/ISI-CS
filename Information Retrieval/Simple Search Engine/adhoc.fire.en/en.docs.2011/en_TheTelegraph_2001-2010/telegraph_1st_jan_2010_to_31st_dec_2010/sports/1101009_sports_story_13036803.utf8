The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev, Sania keep golden hopes alive
                                                                                                                       7                                        Somdev, Sania keep golden hopes alive
  - Doubles fault for Indian men and women       SHARMISTHA CHAUDHURI            Somdev Dev Varman, in action, on Thursday                                 
	New Delhi: It was a mixed day for Indian tennis fans at the Commonwealth Games (CWG) here on Friday. While they could cheer about Somdev Dev Varman and Sania Mirza reaching their respective gold-medal rounds in singles events, the fans watched in disbelief as the doubles combinations of Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi and Somdev-Rohan Bopanna bowed out in the semis.         
	Top-seeded Somdev steamrolled his Australian opponent, Matt Ebden, 6-3, 6-1 in an hour and ten minutes in the singles semis, and, Sania (second seed) rallied from behind to beat Australias Olivia Rogowska 1-6, 6-4, 6-4.                 
	India are now assured of, at least, two silver medals in singles tennis. Sania, who looked visibly relieved, said after the match: Im looking forward to the final.                 
	The Indian tennis sensation struggled in the first set as she committed too many unforced errors. It took her one-and-a-half sets to settle down before unleashing her signature forehands. The womens semi-final ultimately boiled down to who could keep more balls in court and get the opponent to commit a mistake - an age-old formula. Cheered by husband and former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and her parents, Sania finally prevailed.         
	When you are not timing the ball well, you have to do something different. I am happy I could fight back. My game is aggressive, but I had to run, the 23-year-old, who is ranked 131 in the world, said. I knew she would not be able to beat me. Otherwise, she would have been in top 50. But she played a great match, not to take anything away from her. She really played fearlessly, Sania said.         
	Somdev, on the other hand, fired aces and relentlessly played his baseline game to wear down Ebden. The strategy worked as the Aussie was forced into committing errors.                     
	Somdev will now take on fifth-seeded Greg Jones of Australia in the final on Saturday. Jones got the better of second-seeded compatriot Peter Luczak 6-7, 6-4, 6-2. Jones is aggresive. I will have to find a way to counter that on Sunday, Somdev said.         
	Nirupama Sanjeev and Poojashree Venkatesh lost their semi-final, 7-5, 3-6, 5-7 to Australian third seeds Jessica Moore and Rogowska.         
	As Paes and Bhupathi, the top-seeded duo, took to the court, one could only watch in disbelief as the Indians lost the match to fourth-seeded Australians Paul Hanley and Luczak 2-6, 2-6. After a point, one just refused to keep track of the number of unforced errors. While Bhupathis powerful serves did not fire, Paes failed to time his razor sharp volleys. Not even chants of Go India and Go boys could do any good.         
	Unfortunately, we could not fire today, was all Bhupathi said after the match.         
	It was also curtains for Somdev and Bopanna. The second-seeded Indian pair lost to the English duo of Ross Hutchins and Ken Skupski 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.         
	For now, India can only hope for a bronze in mens doubles.

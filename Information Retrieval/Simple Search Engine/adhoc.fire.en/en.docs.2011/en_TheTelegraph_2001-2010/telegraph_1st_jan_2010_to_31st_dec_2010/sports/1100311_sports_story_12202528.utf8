	Calcutta: It was supposed to be East Bengals home match and at the end of their AFC Cup Group D tie against Al Ittihad of Syria, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday, all that one can infer is that they were buried alive at home.         
	Never were the red and gold brigade at home during their 1-4 thrashing at the hands of the Syrian club, who are languishing at the bottom half of their local league table.         
	So what exactly was the reason behind the home teams flop show? Too many, in fact.         
	Topping the charts was the East Bengal defence who revelled in collective failure, often allowing the rival players with ample space to execute their free will. Reacting late on one-on-one situations they were the architects of the home teams defeat on the day.         
	East Bengals midfield appeared an out of tune orchestra with good moves being as rare as the Dodo. Under utilising the flanks, Phillippe de Ridders men, didnt do themselves a favour as their efforts down the middle were easily nipped in the bud by the Syrians.         
	And last, but not the least, was the lack of penetrative power from the hyped duo of Bhaichung Bhutia and Yusif Yakubu upfront. Well, the stars didnt shine and there was darkness in East Bengal.         
	For the Syrians, who exploited the advantage of having a better physique, the combination of midfielders Mohammed Fares and Wael Ayan with striker Abdulfatah Alagha, who hit a brace, ran havoc in the hosts defence.         
	Otobong Ene Edet put Al Ittihad ahead in the 8th minute and the lead was doubled by Alagha in the 28th. East Bengals best effort in the first half was a Mehtab Hossain long-ranger in the 34th minute which was just tipped over by the Syrian goalkeeper.         
	But the hosts did have a brief bright patch early in the second half and their urgency earned them a goal, their only one. A spot kick, resulting from Bhaichung being brought down inside the box, was converted by Yakubu in the 56th minute. A few other chances were created but were wasted. However, the dying minutes of the match confirmed the home teams death. In the 89th and 91st minutes, Alagha and Obaid Al Ali Salal picked the right corner of the East Bengal net to hit the third and fourth goals for the visitors.         
	De Ridder had spoken about a reality check on the match eve; the Syrians unveiled the bitter truth for him.

	London: A spellbinding display of brutal hitting and raw speed from Rafael Nadal secured the Spaniard his second Wimbledon title on Sunday with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 victory over 12th seed Tomas Berdych.         
	It was probably one of the toughest moments in my career, Nadal said after accepting the winners trophy Sunday from the Duke of Kent. A win here was always my dream. I did it two years ago.         
	Nadal has now won 14 straight matches at the All England Club and defended the title he won in his last appearance here two years ago. It was amazing for me that, after a difficult last year, I can be here, he said. Im lucky, I have a great team that supports me.         
	Nadal posed with the trophy in the clubhouse next to the green board with his name already etched as the 2010 winner. He cradled the trophy under his left arm as he signed autographs outside the members entrance, where hundreds of fans gathered to see him.                     
	Nadal is the first Spanish man to win Wimbledon twice. Manolo Santana took the title in 1966. For the Spanish players for the last 40 years it was very difficult to play here, Nadal said. We are doing better right now. We are very satisfied for that.         
	Berdych was playing in his first Grand Slam final and was the first Czech to reach the Wimbledon final since Ivan Lendl in 1987. It was a great two weeks for me, Berdych said. It gives me a lot of confidence and power to be stronger for next time and who knows whats going to happen for the next years.         
	Its the second time Nadal has won the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back. He is now 5-0 in his last Slam finals.         
	With eight Grand Slam titles, Nadal joins a list of greats that includes Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, Fred Perry and Ken Rosewall.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Ojha is confident
                      
	Indore: Impressive performance in the third Indian Premier League (IPL) has earned Naman Ojha a berth in the Zimbabwe-bound national team and the stumper-batsman Monday said he is raring to go all out if given a chance.         
	I am in good touch since IPL III and if given a chance in Zimbabwe, I will leave no stone unturned to perform well. I am happy to get a berth in the India team and now waiting to prove my mettle in the one-day International circuit, Ojha said.         
	Ojha, who played for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, made 377 runs in 14 matches with an average of 31.41.         
	I would not let the selectors down. They have given me an opportunity. I believe that you will keep getting chances automatically if you show consistency, the 26-year-old said.         
	The Madhya Pradesh cricketer also admitted that the IPL has done a world of good to him. I have learnt a lot while playing in the IPL III, he said. (PTI)

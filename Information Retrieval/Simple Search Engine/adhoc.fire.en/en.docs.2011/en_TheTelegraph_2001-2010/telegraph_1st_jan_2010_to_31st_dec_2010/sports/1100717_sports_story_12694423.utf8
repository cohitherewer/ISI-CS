	London: Australia beat Pakistan by 150 runs on the fourth day of the first Test at Lords, with part-time spinner Marcus North claiming six wickets to be the surprise match-winner on Friday.         
	Pakistan were bowled out for 289 before tea in their pursuit of a world record victory target of 440.         
	North took six wickets for 55 runs, beginning with the prize scalp of top-scorer Salman Butt (92) with his first delivery of the match. Another occasional bowler, Shane Watson, was the bowling hero in the first innings with his five wickets for 40 runs.         
	It meant Australia won their seventh Test in succession and 13th overall against Pakistan, which must claim their first Test win over the Australians in 15 years next week at Headingley to draw the two-match series.         
	Pakistan, who won the toss in bowler-friendly conditions on Tuesday, limited the Australians to 252 in their first innings but ultimately were behind the game as soon as they were dismissed for just 148. Australia made 334 in the second essay to set up the challenging run chase.         
	Pakistan, resuming on 114 for one on Friday, lost their first wicket in the morning session when Azhar Ali was caught by wicketkeeper Tim Paine off Ben Hilfenhaus for 42.         
	Australia struggled to exploit the overcast conditions for the first 40 minutes and Mitchell Johnson in particular bowled without any discipline to end up offering too many boundary opportunities.         
	But Australia finally made the breakthrough when Hilfenhaus gleaned an edge off debutant Azhar, who spent just over two hours at the crease.         
	Butt, who made 63 in the first innings, looked set to go on to a first Lords century until he was stumped for 92, off 173 balls. It was an innocuous delivery angled down the leg-side and Butt, who attempted a leg glance, overbalanced to allow Paine to complete a neat stumping.         
	A disconsolate Butt remained at the crease with his head bowed for about 10 seconds until he kicked angrily at the turf and exited the field.         
	Entertaining middle-order batsman Umar Akmal made his intentions known instantly when he clubbed left-arm fast bowler Doug Bollinger back past him to the boundary. Bollinger, surprisingly, still had a few angry words for the unflustered Akmal.         
	Akmal also attacked North and, in the 60th over, advanced down the pitch and lifted him over long on for six. He looked to repeat the stroke in Norths next over but just managed four runs on that occasion.         
	But Akmals propensity to attack proved his downfall when he departed on the final ball before lunch, caught at slip by Michael Clarke off North while trying to cut him through point. That was 216 for four.         
	Pakistan slipped to 229 for six shortly after lunch when Umar Amins inside edge off North was caught by Simon Katich at short leg on 33, and captain Shahid Afridis aggressive instincts failed when he was caught on the mid-wicket boundary by Mike Hussey, also off North for 2.         
	Kamran Akmal hit 46 off 82 balls until he tried to slog leg-spinner Steven Smith over mid-wicket and was bowled. Pakistan lost their last four wickets for just six runs as North and Smith shared nine wickets in the Lords sunshine.         
	South African umpire Rudi Koertzen, who will officiate his last Test at Headingley, was allowed to lead the players off the field on his final appearance at Lords.         
	The Pakistanis are playing as the home team even though the match is being staged at a neutral venue because of the precarious security situation back home.           (AGENCIES)

	New Delhi: Eyeing an outright win to reach the quarter finals, Bengal failed to make an impression on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy match against the Railways and were all out for 201 at the Karnail Singh Stadium, here on Wednesday.         
	On a slow and tricky track, Bengal skipper Manoj Tiwary won the toss but his batsmen couldnt take much advantage of it. From 144 for four, the visitors lost their last seven wickets for only 57 runs and were all out 10 minutes before the scheduled close of play.         
	While young opener Geetimoy Basu (58) and Tiwary (42) remained the only two notable contributors with the bat, former India captain Sourav Gangulys (13) failure to play a longer innings was the biggest disappointment.         
	Ganguly, who came after the fall of third wicket, was greeted with cheers from the couple of hundred spectators, who were waiting in the stands since morning to watch the left hander in action. Sadly, Ganguly lasted only 30 balls before being bowled by a Anureet Singh delivery that kept low.         
	On the eve of the match, Bengal captain Tiwary had said the wicket could be helpful to spinners. He feared the crucial tie could finish well before the fourth day. In reality, the pitch helped both the spinners and medium pacers as Anureet Singh (3 for 48) and Jaiprakash Yadav (2 for 41) accounted for five wickets.         
	Anureet complemented Yadav but Railways had to thank left-am spinner Murali Kartik (2 for 49) for his excellent show that was worth more but for a catch being dropped and some appeals not being rewarded.         
	Though credit should go to the Railways bowlers for being able to maintain tight line and length throughout the day, the Bengal batsmen should also blame themselves for playing some rash shots.         
	Tiwary himself fell to a shot that he could have easily avoided. He did not and his uppish stroke off Nilesh Chauhan was taken by an ever alert Kartik at mid on. Tiwarys innings, studded with four well hit boundaries, however, was without a blemish till his departure.         
	Tiwary was not the only one to give away his wicket. Some other batsmen like Arindam Das (21) and Anustup Majumdar (7) could also have been more discreet with their shot selections.         
	While most of them failed to live up to their reputations, young opener Geetimoy Basu emerged the days hero. Flown in at the last moment as a replacement for an injured Sreevats Goswami, Basu grabbed the opportunity to score his maiden first class half century.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prince: We will treat India with respect
                                                                                                                       7                                      Prince: We will treat India with respect
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The SuperSport Park has always been a happy hunting ground for South Africa. And not just the team as a whole, individual players, too, have a good record at the venue. Proteas batsman Ashwell Prince is one such example.         
	The left-hander has an awesome record at SuperSport Park where he has a career Test average of 67 and has made three centuries. In fact, he has gone on to reach three figures at this venue every time he has reached 50.         
	A gritty player, Prince likes to grind it out when runs are at a premium and the teams fortunes are on the line.Prince thus presented himself to the media, on Tuesday, as totally unfazed about batting under conditions that seem to be hugely favouring bowlers following the amount of rain and the lack of sun over the past few days. He was also able to look on the bright side of things quite literally.         
	The weather forecast is not great for the days leading up to the Test match, Prince said. As long as there is rain, there will be moisture in the pitch. We expect the pitch to do a little bit in terms of movement. Then again, when the sun comes out, SuperSport Park becomes a very good wicket to bat on, he added.         
	You are not always going to be able to perform under those conditions but it is nice to come in under such conditions and play a match-winning or a match-saving innings. The team is of paramount importance and if the surface lends itself to making it easier to get 20 wickets then that is more important than one or more batsmen being able to fill their boots, he said.         
	Prince is also well aware that India have their own pace attack that has contributed to the teams success. As a batting unit we respect the Indian teams attack. They must have done well in the past to be No. 1 in the world.         
	Meanwhile, the Moses Mabhida Stadium, which is scheduled to host the India vs South Africa Twenty20 next month, officially became CSAs newest playing venue on Tuesday when a practice match took place to try out the new pitch.

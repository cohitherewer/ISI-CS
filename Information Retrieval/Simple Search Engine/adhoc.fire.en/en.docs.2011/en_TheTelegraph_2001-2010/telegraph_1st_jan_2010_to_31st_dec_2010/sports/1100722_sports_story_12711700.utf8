	Calcutta: Maharashtra paid the price for missing too many chances as Karnataka beat them 1-0 in a pre-quarterfinal match of the Santosh Trophy, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	It was a match dominated by Maharashtra for the better part of 120 minutes. But it was Ngurnei Lal of Karnataka, who did the most important job, scoring the winner in the 92nd minute.         
	After a goalless 90 minutes, Karnataka got the winner on a counter attack. A long clearance from the Karnataka half fell into the oppositions defensive third. Taking marker Nihal Chandran in his stride, Lal unleashed a powerful angular right footer which was good enough to beat the outstretched hands of lanky custodian Kunal Sawant.         
	Karnataka will now play in the quarterfinal league. They have been clubbed with defending champions Goa, Services and the winner of the match between Manipur and Punjab.         
	In the first half, Maharashtra attackers, Alex Ambrose and K Anees, made repeated inroads into the opposition territory but poor finishing let them down.         
	Even substitute Surajit Bose was guilty of holding onto the ball for too long. Surajit also got a free header but failed to direct it.         
	Their opponents did make some sporadic counterattacks with veteran Xavier Vijaykumar initiating the moves from the left wing. However, former Mohun Bagan striker R.C. Prakash failed to cash in on the assists.         
	Meanwhile, in a Cluster V tie, Delhi beat Arunachal Pradesh 3-1, while Uttar Pradesh blanked Madhya Pradesh 3-0 in another match.         
	In a Cluster VI match, Sikkim, buoyed by Bhaichung Bhutias presence, thrashed Haryana 4-0.         
	The North Eastern side were off to flyer and notched up three goals in the first half sending their rivals on the back foot.         
	Tshering Lepcha opened the scoring in the sixth minute, while ONGC midfielder Vikas Jairu doubled the lead in the 19th minute. Before the break, Birendra Rai netted in the third goal as Sikkim dictated the terms right from the outset.         
	They played a crisp passing game and the team from North India had no answer to that style.         
	A possible fightback for Haryana was far from their reach as they failed to recover from the initial damage and went on to concede the fourth goal in the 85th minute, when Rupesh Diyali scored for Sikkim.         
	TEAMS         
	Karnataka: Nagendra, Bimal Minz, Ricky Joy, J. Murali, A.S. Shiyad, P. Rajendra Prasad (A. Don Bosco, 81st), Xavier Vijaykumar, Ramu V (Karthigeyan, 90+5), B.V. Pradeep, R.C. Prakash, Ngurnei Lal

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | UK minister to look into Bolt case
                                                                                                                       7                                      UK minister to look into Bolt case
                      
	London: Britains sports minister Hugh Robertson said he could intervene after Olympic and world 100m and 200m champion Usain Bolt decided to miss next months Diamond League meeting in London for tax reasons.         
	On Monday Bolt said he would not run at the event because of Britains prohibitive tax rules but Robertson suggested he could work something out with UK Athletics and the promoters.         
	Ive not had a direct approach from either the sports governing body or the promoters of the Crystal Palace meeting so I dont know exactly what we are dealing with here, Robertson said on Tuesday.         
	It is a problem we have come across and addressed with other sports and clearly if they write to me I will take it up with the treasury. Others have come to me, and Im pretty sure that at the back end of the 2012 Olympic bill is a commitment not to tax overseas stars who come over to compete in the Olympics. If there is a particular problem (with Bolt) Im happy to look at it and see if I can help.

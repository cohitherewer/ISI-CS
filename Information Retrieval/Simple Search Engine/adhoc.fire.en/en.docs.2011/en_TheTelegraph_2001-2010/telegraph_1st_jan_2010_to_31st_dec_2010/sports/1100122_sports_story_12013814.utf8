            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Defending champions India, in spite of their 31-run defeat against England on Thursday, made the quarter finals of the ICC under-19 World Cup.         
	After winning the first two games while bowling first, India invited England to bat and chasing a target of 247, Ashok Menarias boys collapsed to 215 in 46.4 overs to finish second in Group A.         
	India will take on Pakistan in the Super League quarter final on Saturday.         
	They had assured themselves a quarter final berth after their back-to-back wins against minnows Afghanistan and Hong Kong.         
	Put in to bat, England were reduced to 60 for four before the English middle-order turned things around with Ben Stokes scoring a blazing century. Stokess 100 came off just 88 balls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods should open up: Palmer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger Woods should open up: Palmer
                      
	Orlando: Arnold Palmer believes redemption for Tiger Woods starts with being more open with the media.         
	Palmer initially was guarded with his opinion about Woods and the sex scandal that has tarnished golfs biggest star. But when asked at Bay Hill how Woods could show more respect for the game  as Woods pledged in his public apology last month  Palmers suggestion was for him to let his guard down.         
	Its up to him to do and say whatever he feels he needs to do to redeem the situation, put it in the proper place, Palmer said.         
	My opinion, as I said ... I was going to keep to myself. But I suppose the best thing he could do would be open up and just let you guys shoot at him. And thats just my thought.         
	Such advice comes from an 80-year-old, seven-time Major champion who first made golf popular among the masses in America with his charisma, hard-charging comebacks and a connection with fans unlike any other player. Palmer won them over by looking them in the eye and speaking from the heart.

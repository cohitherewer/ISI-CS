The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schiavone makes history
                                                                                                                       7                                      Schiavone makes history
    - 29-year-old becomes first Italian woman to triumph at Roland Garros           John Branch                                  
	Paris: The point before she won the most improbable of French Open championships, Francesca Schiavone of Italy backhanded a volley into the empty space across the court.         
	Schiavone, the 17th seed, galloped across her end of the court, caught in the moment before the moment. She wiped the excitement away with a towel from the ball boy.         
	The stoic and strong Australian across the court, Samantha Stosur, had overpowered the most powerful womens players, three former No. 1s, on the way to the final. But she had no response for the spry, extroverted Schiavone. Stosur shanked a shot into the air, and Schiavone dropped onto the baseline before the ball hit the ground. She landed on her back, rolled over and kissed the clay-court surface.         
	Schiavone became the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam singles event, beating No. 7 Stosur on a hot and dry afternoon at Court Philippe Chatrier, 6-4, 7-6(2).         
	Schiavone, 29, her nose smudged with the red crushed-brick powder that tops the courts at Roland Garros, clamoured into the stands, into a section of Italians wearing black T-shirts that read Nothing is Impossible.         
	Schiavone, 18 days short of her 30th birthday, became the oldest first-time Grand Slam champion since 30-year-old Ann Jones of Britain won Wimbledon in 1969. She will make her debut in the top 10 when the rankings are released on Monday.         
	I have to say congratulations to Sam, because she is a great, great person and a great athlete, Schiavone said. You deserve to be here next time. Youre young. You can do it.         
	Schiavone, who spent her decade-long professional career on the fringe of the spotlight but never in it, had more to say.         
	Im getting comfortable here, she joked. Finally, she sent a message home to her father and mother, Francesco and Luiscita.         
	I love you, Daddy, Mommy, Schiavone said. Ciao.         
	Stosur had beaten Schiavone four of the previous five times they played, including in the first round of the 2009 French Open. Stosur was seeded 32nd and Schiavone was unseeded, demonstrating just how much their fortunes have changed in one year.         
	For most of two weeks, Stosur looked like the best player in the tournament. She plowed through the draw, beating four-time French Open champion Justine Henin, current No. 1 Serena Williams, and No. 4 Jelena Jankovic in the semi-final.         
	None of her opponents leading up to the final could control Stosurs powerful serve or her pinpoint forehand. In any match of power against power, Stosur won.         
	But Schiavone undid Stosur with quickness and defense. The booming shots that skittered past the likes of Williams and Jankovic were flipped back across the net by Schiavone, often with a spinning one-handed backhand that she wields with the motion of a backhand slap.         
	Schiavone seized every opening to rush to the net, and the pressure seemed to unnerve Stosur. Schiavone took control of the match-winning tiebreaker when, at 2-2, her service return was a wickedly spinning backhand drop shot. Stosur got to it and flipped it back, but Schiavone was charging and punched it back for a point.         
	She kept Stosur buried in a back corner again on the next point, then rushed the net and knocked the ball into the opposite, empty corner. The crowd, cheering mostly for the underdog  a sentiment interrupted occasionally by the familiar Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! chant from the smattering of Stosur fans  sensed that one of the tournaments biggest upsets was at hand.         
	Schiavones career rode a long plateau before taking an unpredictable rise here. She has spent most of the past decade ranked in the teens, but never went as far as the quarter finals of a Grand Slam event.         
	Stosur, by contrast, seemed more like a player with staying power. It was about three years ago, after Stosur had spent 61 consecutive weeks ranked No. 1 in doubles and was in the 20s in singles, that she mysteriously contracted Lyme disease. Her energy flagged, and she missed about 10 months in 2007 and 2008 recovering.         
	At the time, she had won 22 doubles titles, including the United States Open in 2005 and the French Open in 2006, and mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. But she had no singles titles. While absent, her singles ranking fell below the top 150.         
	Away from the game, Stosur found a singular focus.         
	I thought I could definitely get better than what I was, Stosur said of her singles game.         
	Her breakthrough came last year, when she negotiated her way to a surprising semi-final match as a No. 30 seed, beating the unseeded Schiavone in two sets in the first round. Stosur lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova, who won the title.         
	I got this label of a doubles specialist and a doubles player because I had good success, Stosur said the day before the match. But that whole time, my goal was to do those kinds of things in singles.         
	She found an unexpected niche on clay. Stosur was 39-37 on the surface before her illness, but 28-8 since before Saturdays match. She was 20-2 on clay this spring, showing a rare ability to power past opponents on what is considered a slower surface requiring more nuance and shot making.         
	Schiavone outdid her, though, with panache.         
	Schiavone was a steady foil to Stosurs serious, ball-bashing ways, the extroverted Schiavone relied heavily on guile and showmanship. After beating No. 3 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarter finals and No. 5 Elena Dementieva in the semi-finals, Schiavone kissed the crushed-brick court.         
	Asked what she would do if she won the final, she smiled and scooped her hands together. I take all the clay like this, she said, and I bring home.         
	In the end, she did not need her hands to take home the clay. Much of it was all over the clothes on her back, and a little smudge was on her nose, just above her smile.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New culture led to win: Waqar 
                                                                                                                       7                                      New culture led to win: Waqar 
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans coach Waqar Younis believes that his teams first Test win over Australia in 15 years is the beginning of a new era for the game in the troubled country.         
	Waqar said that the hard-earned victory in Headingly showed that the new culture which has been introduced in the Pakistan dressing room has started to bear fruit.         
	All the players have been told clearly that no one is allowed any personal agenda in the dressing room. Every player has to play for the team and for the country and we dont expect anything less from anyone, Waqar said. Clear guidelines have been laid out that if any player tries to spoil the dressing room or team environment he will have to face severe consequences, he added.         
	The former Test captain, who took over as coach after the troubled Australian tour, said what had happened in the past is now history.         
	Now no one is allowed to have his own personal agenda except performance. Because at the end of the day we owe it to the Pakistani nation to deliver. No one can win all the time and no one expects us to win all the time. But we must give our best in every match, we must show commitment as a team, he said.           (PTI)

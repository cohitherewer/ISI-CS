                                                                                                                       7                                      Foreign players barred from local meets
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided to cancel the registration of all the foreign players who have signed with the various clubs. The decision has been taken as per the rules set by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) which says that no foreign player will be allowed to take part in any of the domestic tournaments which also includes the club tournaments of the various state associations.         
	Thus the likes of Sanath Jayasuriya and Thilan Samarweera, who signed for Bata Sports Club, wont be able to play for any team.         
	Incidentally on Friday, Mohun Bagan and Kalighat were at loggerheads with both clubs claiming that the former Sri Lankan captain had signed in their favour. After that, both clubs decided to withdraw the registration which automatically put an end to Jayasuriyas chances of playing in the CAB league.         
	Meanwhile, Aryan Club on Saturday lodged an official complaint against two umpires Biplab Basu and Indranil Chakraborty alleging that they deliberately delayed the start the second days play of their CAB league match against Kumartuli.

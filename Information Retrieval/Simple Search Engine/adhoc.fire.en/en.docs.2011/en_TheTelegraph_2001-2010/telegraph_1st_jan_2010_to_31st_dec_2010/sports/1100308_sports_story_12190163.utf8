            HONKY DORY      
	Trainer S. Padmanabhans Becket upstaged the hot-property, Jacqueline, to claim the champion of champions crown  the Vandrevala Foundation Indian Turf Invitation Cup, over 2,400m, at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Sunday. Jockey Suraj Narredu, who partnered the Hawk Wing-Boiling River son for the winners purse of Rs 60 lakh, also avenged the defeat suffered at the hands of Jacqueline in the Indian Derby, exactly after a month.          
	It was also a wedding gift for Suraj who tied the knot on February 24, when Beckets owner Haresh N. Mehta had offered him the ride, replacing Martin Dwyer who had failed the horse narrowly in the Derby.          
	Becket was ridden well off the pace till the home turn and was brought the shortest way home to beat Jacqueline right at the post.          
	In the Maj. P.K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile Cup, the city challenger Aboline had a narrow measure of Dancing Dynamite, the favourite.

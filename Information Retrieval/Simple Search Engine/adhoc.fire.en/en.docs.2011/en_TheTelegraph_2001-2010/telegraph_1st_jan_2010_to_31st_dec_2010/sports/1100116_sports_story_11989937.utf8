The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ministers have their Cup of joy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ministers have their Cup of joy
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: If you want to know how does the Fifa World Cup feel, you can jolly well ask Kshiti Goswami, Kanti Ganguly or Pratim Chatterjee.         
	The three West Bengal ministers did what in Fifas eyes is a breach of protocol.         
	When Lothar Matthaeus unveiled the Fifa World Cup at a plush city hotel on Friday and walked up the dais to give the packed house and the jostling photographers a better view, Goswami could not control his excitement. In the heat of the moment  well thats what the official reaction is  he helped the German legend in holding aloft the Cup.         
	Probably taking cue from the PWD minister, sports minister Ganguly and fire services minister Chatterjee also managed to get a feel of world footballs greatest prize which even eluded the likes of Zico or Michel Platini during their playing days.         
	The standard policy for African and Global legs of the tour is that only heads of the state and World Cup winning members can touch the World Cup.         
	A source said the dignitaries, ministers and the former players, were aware of the policy. Obviously they (ministers) got carried away by the situation.         
	Yes, we have to be extra careful during the next two days. Fifa media representative Liu Lingling told the newspersons. But Fifa wont take any offence as a goodwill gesture, she added.         
	Like the trios once in a lifetime experience with World Cup, the under-16 Mir Iqbal Trophy winners also had a red-letter day.         
	The youngsters had the rare chance of shaking hands and clicking a group photo with Matthaeus. We will never forget this day, a beaming Sandeep Bhadra, the Jharkhand skipper, said later.         
	The starry-eyed youngsters were already coaxing photographers to mail them pictures. And soon their drawing rooms will adorn the group picture. I will definitely do that, Bhadra said excitedly.         
	The Jharkhand boys were given Rs 25,000 each and the Jharkhand Football Association Rs 1 lakh by the sponsors.         
	The Indian legends, too, were bowled over by getting a glimpse of the Cup and the chance to meet the former Bayern Munich and Inter Milan star. He is so humble. It shows even champions are human beings, PK Banerjee said.         
	Subrata Bhattacharya, though, did not get carried away by the hype that World Cups maiden visit to Calcutta had generated.         
	Matthaeus spoke about collective responsibility to bring Indian football out of the rut. If we dont do that then all this unveiling and the stars coming will come to nought.         
	The Chirag United coach surely has a point.

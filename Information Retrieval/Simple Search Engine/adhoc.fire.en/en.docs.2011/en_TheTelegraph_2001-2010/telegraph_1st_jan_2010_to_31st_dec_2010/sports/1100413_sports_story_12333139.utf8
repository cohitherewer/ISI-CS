                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB mulls ways to beat the heat
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Due to the unbearable heat, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are planning to have a two-hour afternoon break during the two-day league matches. The CAB tournament committee, led by Prabir Chakraborty, will soon be having a meeting with the umpires sub-committee to discuss on starting the league matches earlier than usual.         
	Although, we havent formally discussed anything, we need to look at the players comfort also. We have never seen 40 degrees celsius in early April. I have decided to propose an 8:30 am start instead of 10 am. Also from 12 noon to 2 pm, we are planning an extended lunch break.         
	That is the time when it becomes unbearable for the players. We can have the final session from 2 pm to 5 pm, Chakraborty stated. The relegation play-off matches will start from the last week of April.         
	Meanwhile, on Monday, the working committee ratified the tournament committees decision the cancel the West Bengal Police versus Aryan match.         
	It might be recalled that WB Police chased Aryans mammoth 514 but later, on scrutinising the scorebook of the Police team, it was found that they have scored six runs less.         
	Both teams didnt get any points from the match.         
	Police, now, will play in the relegation play-off. Tollygunge Agragami, who were supposed to play in the relegation play-off, will now play in the championship play-off.

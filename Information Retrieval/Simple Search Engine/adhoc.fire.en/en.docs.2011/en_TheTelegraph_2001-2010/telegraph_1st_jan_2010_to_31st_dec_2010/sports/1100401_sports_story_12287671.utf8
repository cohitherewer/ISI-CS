The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Berdych stuns Federer

	Miami: Roger Federer became the latest upset victim at the Miami Open after the world No. 1 went down 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 to 16th seeded Czech Tomas Berdych in the fourth round on Tuesday.         
	The 16-time Grand Slam champion had beaten Berdych in eight of their previous nine encounters but paid the penalty for an error-strewn display in which the Swiss top seed could only convert two of 12 break point opportunities.         
	Federers defeat means the top three mens seeds have all been knocked out after Serbias Novak Djokovic and Britains Andy Murray both suffered shock defeats earlier in the tournament.         
	It was a tough match. Look, its no secret Ive struggled the last, what is it, five matches Ive played here in the states, Federer said after his second early exit in a row since winning the Australian Open in January.         
	Its disappointing, I think, my performance overall, if Ive got to analyse right now after the match, but I fought as much as I could with my game having issues at the moment.         
	Definitely lacking timing. I dont know where that comes from because I played so nicely in Australia. Maybe the sickness (a lung infection in February) did take it out of me more than I thought.         
	Berdych cautioned against getting too carried away with one of the best wins of his career.         
	To beat the No. 1 player in the world, the best player so far is a great feeling. But still, it was not a final. There is another match waiting next day, another really tough opponent, he said.         
	Earlier, world No. 8 Andy Roddick needed to overcome a sluggish start to book his ticket to the quarter finals while Rafael Nadal also advanced after being tested early in his match.         
	Roddick, fresh from finishing runner-up at Indian Wells, beat Germanys Benjamin Becker 7-6, 6-3 while Nadal brushed past Spanish compatriot and Davis Cup team mate David Ferrer 7-6, 6-4.         
	The big-serving American fell behind 4-1, 0-40 in the first set but rallied back against Becker. After breaking to get to 4-3, Roddick served a 134 mph (214kph) ace as he tied it 5-5.         
	It was downhill from there for the unseeded Becker as Roddick won the tiebreak 7-4 before easing through the second set.         
	World No. 4 Nadal is now the highest-ranked player left in the tournament after he held off Ferrer in just under two hours. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Katich century puts Aussies ahead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Katich century puts Aussies ahead
                      
	Hamilton: After two days of frenetic activity, Simon Katich returned the game to Test pace and his important, grafting century led Australia to a commanding lead of 300 at stumps on the third day, according to Cricinfo. Australia batted poorly in the first innings but Katich virtually eliminated risk during a gutsy 106 that put his side on track for a total of 333 for four.         
	The total might already be enough for Australia, who are chasing a 2-0 cleansweep, but Ricky Ponting will be in no rush to declare given there is so much time left and the forecast is for more sunshine. A pitch offering less spin and tricks than expected will also delay the closure and New Zealand will pray for a massive innings to save or level the contest.         
	There were two periods when the hosts were in with a chance, but once Tim Southee broke through twice in the morning Katich and Michael Hussey crept ahead during a 155-run partnership. Both men fell to Brent Arnel after tea, when the lead was just over 200, before Michael Clarke (42) and Marcus North (42) lifted the pace to power further ahead.         
	Katich held the innings together over the first two-thirds of the day to ensure there were no terminal wobbles during the most crucial segment of the Test. Australia began the morning with a two-run advantage and Katich really wanted to bat till stumps. He was rarely put off as he played within himself during his 279-ball occupation, which included 12 fours, but when he exited Clarke and North quickly pressed forward.         
	Katich brought up his half-century in the over after lunch with a clip behind square off Southee and backed up with another boundary through gully. There were more lulls and then a couple of crashing shots, including two lofted fours over the offspinner Jeetan Patel, while two strong strikes off Chris Martin with the new ball took Katich into the 90s.         
	A French cut for four off Martin moved him to 99 and the hundred was sealed in the second-last over before tea with a strong cover drive.

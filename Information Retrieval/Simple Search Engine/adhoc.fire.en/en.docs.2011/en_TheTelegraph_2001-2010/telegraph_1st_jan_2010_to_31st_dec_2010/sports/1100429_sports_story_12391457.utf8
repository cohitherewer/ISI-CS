The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury puts Lee out 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Injury puts Lee out 
  - Ryan Harris will replace pacer in the Australia squad       A STAFF REPORTER            Brett Lee                                 
	Calcutta: Australias campaign at the ICC World Twenty20 suffered a jolt as pacer Brett Lee was Wednesday ruled out after injuring his bowling arm. Ryan Harris will replace the pacer.         
	Lee suffered the injury during Tuesdays lost warm-up game against minnows Zimbabwe. A few weeks back, Lees IPL stint was also hit by a fracture in the thumb of his right hand.         
	According to a team spokesman, Lee strained a muscle in his right elbow. Lee felt pain after taking one for 13 in four overs and later had MRI scans. The team spokesman, however, said that the strain was unrelated to his elbow trouble.         
	During Tuesdays game against Zimbabwe, Brett developed increasing right elbow pain and by the time he completed his final over the pain was significant, team physio Alex Kontouris said in a statement.         
	At the conclusion of the innings it was obvious Brett had sustained an injury to one of the forearm muscles near the elbow and this was confirmed by a subsequent MRI scan.         
	Due to the condensed nature of this tournament Brett will not recover in time to take any further part and has therefore been withdrawn from the squad, said Kontouris.         
	This is not a recurrence of the elbow injury that recently required surgery but a new injury that will require specialist opinion upon his return to Australia.         
	National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch termed the injury as disappointing.         
	While it obviously disappointing for Brett, this gives Harris a wonderful opportunity to join the Australian squad in the West Indies for the ICC World Twenty20.         
	Ryan was very close to selection in the initial 15-man squad. He has been in excellent form for Australia in one-day and Test formats and during his recent stint at the IPL, Hilditch said.         
	We believe he is the ideal replacement for Brett being a right-arm swing bowler with a good ability to bowl at the death of an innings. His ability with the bat and in the field also adds extra versatility to our squad.         
	Doug Bollinger, who impressed for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, was also in the running for the replacement but lost to Harris.         
	The latest problem will raise further questions over the future of Lee, 33, who retired from Tests in February but wanted to remain a key Twenty20 and one-day player.         
	A broken thumb curtailed his IPL season and although he retained his Cricket Australia contract, his ongoing injury worries must be a concern for the team management.         
	Australia play their second warm-up game against the Windward Islands on Thursday before their opening match of the tournament against Pakistan on Sunday in St Lucia.

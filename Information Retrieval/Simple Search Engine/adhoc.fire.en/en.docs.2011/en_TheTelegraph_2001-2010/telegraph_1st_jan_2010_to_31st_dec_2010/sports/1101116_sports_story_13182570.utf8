	Guangzhou: Ace drag-flicker Sandeep Singh scored a double as Indian mens hockey team started their Asian Games campaign on a rousing note, blanking a lowly Hong Kong 7-0 in their first group B match here Monday.         
	Coach Jose Brasas boys completely dominated their rivals in the entire 70 minutes, and pumped in four and three goals respectively in both the halves at the Aoti Hockey Field to start their proceedings in the quadrennial mega-event in style.         
	Against Hong Kong, India utilised three out of the five penalty corners they earned in the match, with Sandeep (4th and 18th minutes) converting two and Tushar Khandker (37th) scoring from a variation.         
	Bharat Chikara (2nd), Sarvanjit Singh (22nd), Arjun Halappa (38th) and Shivendra Singh (48th) completed the rout for India through field strikes.         
	India will now face minnows Bangladesh in their group match on Wednesday.         
	A penalty corner shot by Mahadik came off rival goalkeeper Leung Hong Wang to Khandekar, who made no mistake in putting home the rebound in the 37th minute of the match. One minute later Arjun Halappa indulged in a one-two, on the left, with Dharamvir Singh before finding the mark.         
	India, who got bogged down for sustained periods of play despite having the better ball possession, completed the tally with an eye-catching effort. Skipper Rajpal trapped a long hit from the centre of the field sent by Sardar Singh, relayed the ball to Shivendra on his right who first-timed it in.         
	India coach Brasa said after the match that it was an easy first game for his wards and they used it to get acclimatised to the conditions.         
	This was an easy first game, but it was difficult to play on this pitch as the ball bounces more than normally. Playing the Hindustani type of hockey at high speed was difficult, he said.         
	It was also difficult to control the ball during penalty corners. We have to get used to the conditions. The main pitch (where their remaining matches are to be held) is also bouncy, but not to this extent. It was too bouncy and difficult to control the ball, Brasa said.         
	Brasa said that the league games against Pakistan and Japan, to be played on successive days, would be crucial. (PTI)

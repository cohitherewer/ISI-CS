The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jharkhand bow out after a 1-6 rout
                                                                                                                       7                                        Jharkhand bow out after a 1-6 rout
  - Maharashtra, Karnataka sail into pre-quarters with all-win record       A STAFF REPORTER            Action during the Karnataka-Jharkhand match, at the Howrah Stadium, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Finishing in soccer is somewhat similar to salt in a dish  an ingredient which, if missed, may render all the hard work tasteless. And, as a hapless Jharkhand side discovered on Monday, it can also turn out to be a shameful experience.         
	The boys from Jharkhand were hammered 6-1 by Karnataka in a Cluster I match of the Santosh Trophy at the Howrah Stadium. The result saw Karnataka qualifying for the pre-quarters with an all-win record. Jharkhand, who lost both their matches, and Meghalaya, thus, bow out of the meet.         
	Karnataka, no doubt, started favourites as they had won their previous match against Meghalaya and needed just a draw to sail through. Perhaps that led to them being a little complacent.         
	Chasing down every ball and stitching passes between them, Jharkhand made repeated forays into the rival half only to squander the efforts. That allowed Karnataka to settle down and, in the 31st minute, it was the team from Southern India who grabbed the lead when Xavier Vijaykumar slotted home from point blank range.         
	Jharkhand did well to restore parity three minutes later when Ravinder Singhs low drive beat Karnataka goalkeeper to the left post. While a 1-1 scoreline at the break would have been praiseworthy for Jharkhand, a defensive lapse saw Karnataka veteran R.C. Prakash volleying one into the net to make it 2-1 in the added time.         
	However, with their energy fizzing out, Jharkhand were ruthlessly overpowered by Karnataka in the second half. They added four more to the tally with Prakash getting his second, Ngurneilal netting a brace and Satish Kumar scoring one.         
	In the other matches of the day, Maharashtra trounced Tripura 4-1 to make it to the pre-quarters while Andhra Pradesh edged past Chandigarh 2-1.         
	Both Karnataka and Maharashtra advance with an all-win record.

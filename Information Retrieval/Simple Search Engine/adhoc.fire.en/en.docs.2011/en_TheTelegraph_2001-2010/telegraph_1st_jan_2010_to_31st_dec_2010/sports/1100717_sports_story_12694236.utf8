	Calcutta: East Bengal, on Friday, appointed 53-year-old Trevor James Morgan as their chief coach for the 2010-11 season. Morgan, comes in place of Portuguese Manuel Gomez, who backed out last week, joining a Saudi Arabian Club.         
	The Englishman, who worked as a development coach of the now-relegated Hull City, will be arriving at the end of this month. Among the foreign coaches who have worked in Indian clubs, Morgan is definitely one of the most high profile managers.         
	As a player, Morgan represented various clubs, including 77 appearances for Bolton Wanderers. He started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Birmingham City.         
	His first assignment as the chief coach was for a Perth based club called Sorrento FC. His next assignment was for S-League club Sengkang Punggol. He joined Hull City in 2008.         
	Club president Pranab Dasgupta informed that Atanu Bhattacharya and Tushar Rakshit will continue as the goalkeeper and assistant coach respectively. However, if Morgan feels otherwise, the executive committee will then decide on their replacements.         
	We had received CVs from a number of coaches. That includes coaches from Italy and Croatia. However, the clubs executive committee felt that Morgan fits the bill perfectly. We hope that East Bengal will do well under him, Dasgupta told mediapersons.         
	East Bengals arch-rivals Mohun Bagan also have a new coach in Stanley Rozario, who was formally introduced to the local players at the club ground on Friday.         
	The foreign trio of Jose Ramirez Barreto, Edeh Chidi and Subair Murithala Ali will report on August 1.

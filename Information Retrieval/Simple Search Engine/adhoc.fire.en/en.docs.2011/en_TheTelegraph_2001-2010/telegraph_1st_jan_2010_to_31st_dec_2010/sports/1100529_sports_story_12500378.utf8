    - Line of succession in the ICC Morgan, Pawar meet in London             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Howard                                 
	London: John Howard is realising that becoming Australias Prime Minister, in 1996, was easier than trying to become vice-president and then the president of the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	The current Big Two  president David Morgan and Sharad Pawar, wholl be succeeding him after the June 27-July 1 annual conference in Singapore  met here on Thursday afternoon, but the impasse over Howard didnt exactly end.         
	Earlier, it was expected that their meeting would take place in Dubai.         
	Howard, it may be recalled, is the joint nominee of Cricket Australia (CA) and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) to succeed Pawar, first as vice-president and then as president, the latter post in 2012.         
	Indeed, on Friday morning, the ICC issued a media release merely stating that both Morgan and Pawar back the nomination process (by rotation) for the ICC presidency and vice-presidency.         
	Howards name didnt figure even once.         
	The media release went on to say: Mr Pawar made his position clear. He said that he had no reason to object to the nomination based on the process which has been previously agreed (to) by the ICC board.         
	He added: I am sure we can reach a decision which will be unanimously supported by the ICC Board...         
	To clear his position, Pawar, a politician all his life, should have thrown his weight behind Howard. He didnt.         
	Pawar, according to The Telegraphs sources, isnt comfortable with the idea of a powerful No.2 and, so, hasnt discouraged Cricket South Africa and the Zimbabwe Cricket Union from objecting to Howards nomination.         
	Moreover, the buzz is that Pawars the one who encouraged Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to join the anti-Howard bandwagon.         
	It seems much pressure has also been put on the West Indies Cricket Board. Eventually, it may abstain, which would actually mean opposing Howard.         
	As things stand, only Australia, New Zealand, England and possibly Pakistan are supporting Howard. The West Indies is somewhat non-committal... Biggest player India, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh arent in Howards favour, one of the sources pointed out.         
	For the nomination to be approved, seven of the 10 Test-playing nations (or Full Members) have to give their consent. The process ought to have been completed last month itself.         
	Meanwhile, CA spokesman Peter Young reaffirmed that Howard would remain Australia and New Zealands joint nominee.         
	Speaking exclusively from Trentham (near Melbourne), Young said: Both are rock-solid behind Mr Howard... Were welded to his nomination... While deciding on the nominee, CA and NZC looked at somebody whod be able to deal with cricket issues dispassionately and Mr Howard fits that bill... Its now up to the ICC.         
	Asked to comment on chairman Somachandra de Silvas view that an outsider wouldnt be backed by SLC, Young replied: Perhaps, we need to recall that Mr Howard, as Australias Prime Minister, had cut all the red tape to facilitate the tsunami relief match (at the MCG) in January 2005... Funds from there benefited projects in Sri Lanka, too... Really, its not for us to say what SLC should do...         
	The ICC, to say the least, has handled the issue very poorly and the mess doesnt reflect well on Morgan and chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	For now, then, its back to hectic lobbying and even some arm-twisting.

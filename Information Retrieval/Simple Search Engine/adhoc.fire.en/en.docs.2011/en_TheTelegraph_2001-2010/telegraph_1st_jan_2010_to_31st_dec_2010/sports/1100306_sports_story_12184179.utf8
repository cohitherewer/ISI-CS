	Moscow: India are in danger of losing their hard earned place in the elite Davis Cup World Group as they conceded a 2-0 lead to Russia on the opening day of the first round tie following contrasting defeats of Somdev Dev Varman and Rohan Bopanna here Friday.         
	India entered the World Group after a gap of 11 years and destiny gave them the best chance to progress as Russias top players  world No. 6 Nikolay Davydenko and world No. 38 Igor Andreev  suffered injuries and were ruled out.         
	However, India could not take advantage of their absence and now find themselves in a position where they have to win all three remaining rubbers over the next two days.         
	Much depended on Somdev but the Indian lost the opening rubber 7-6(8), 6-7(4), 3-6, 4-6 to Igor Kunitsyn despite winning the first set.         
	Kunitsyn was not scheduled to play the rubber but Andreevs last minute knee injury sent him in and the Russian responded to the SOS call in the best manner.         
	Big serving Bopanna was no match to world No. 13 Mikhail Youzhny, losing the second singles 4-6, 2-6, 3-6 to round off a disappointing day for the visitors.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bupathi will take on Kunitsyn and Teimuraz Gabashvili in the doubles rubber Saturday and the reverse singles will be played on Sunday.         
	The winner of the tie will move to the quarter finals while the loser will compete in playoffs to re-enter the elite 16-team World Group.         
	After Somdevs unexpected defeat, Bopanna had the big responsibility to rescue India but the task was too much for a player who has been concentrating on doubles on the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour in recent times.         
	Bopanna had helped India in the playoff tie against South Africa by pulling off impressive singles win but he could not repeat the act.         
	He created opportunities with some booming forehand winners and big serves but Youzhny showed he was a class apart, and proved that sheer power was not enough to win matches.         
	Earlier, Somdev let advantage slip out of hands, losing the opening rubber from an advantageous position.         
	Somdev had taken control of the first singles match after winning the first set and took a 5-2 lead in the second but lost the plot after that in a marathon contest which lasted close to four hours.         
	Due to the slow nature of the court, long rallies came into play and rather than the power, it was persistence, precision and stamina that was required to earn points.         
	Somdev came up with a big serve and sealed the first set after Kunitsyn sent a forehand wide.         
	With the crucial lead in his pocket, Somdev came up firing on all cylinders in the second set, racing to a 3-0 lead.         
	The body language of the Russian did not look positive after the assault but Kunitsyn fought his way into the match and turned it around brilliantly, winning the second set.         
	Momentum shifted in favour of the host player but Somdev too was not ready to throw in the towel and an intriguing fight ensued in the third set.         
	Another doubtful call on a Somdev forehand handed Kunitsyn a crucial break in the eighth game. Somdev pleaded his case with the chair umpire but the decision remained and the Russian served out the set in the next game.         
	The two players fought hard in the fourth set but it was the Russian who took points when it mattered most and gave his side lead.           (PTI)

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjun Atwal at the RCGC, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: A professional, on and off the golf course.         
	If he wasnt so, Arjun Atwal may have skipped at least some of his engagements in Jamshedpur, on Wednesday. He wouldve had a good reason  elder son Krishans illness in the US  for doing so.         
	Actually, I hardly slept on Tuesday night, because my wife (Sona) kept calling me... Krishan started throwing up and had severe pain in the stomach... He was taken to hospital, made to wait before being seen, and then released...         
	My wife, who just had our second son (Shiva) for company, brought Krishan home, only to find that he continued to throw up... She was panicking and I had to call one of my doctor friends in Florida... He was again taken to hospital and, on the second visit, put on drips...         
	Krishans recovered, but it was a bad night for the family... Yet, I had to be up early, on Wednesday, and fulfil my commitments (including inaugurating a golf course)... I had to act like a professional, Atwal, the lone Indian to win a US PGA Tour title, told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	The elder sons illness has delayed the arrival of Atwals family in the city. Now, they wont be here on Saturday, he said.         
	Asked if he was conscious of being a role model, at least for the young golfers in the country, Atwal replied: Look, I dont tell myself that Ive got to behave in a particular way because of this or that... More than anything else, my actions are guided by the values instilled by my parents (Bindi, Rupi)...         
	Speaking on the sidelines of his felicitation by the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (my home), Atwal added: I accept that unlike a Sachin Tendulkar, I wont get mobbed in Calcutta, thats fine, but people do recognise me in the US because golf is huge there...         
	At the end of the day, though, its not about recognition but being respected as a professional by the fraternity and beyond. On that count, Atwal neednt lose sleep.

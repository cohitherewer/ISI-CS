The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lankans run for cover as Sehwag takes over
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lankans run for cover as Sehwag takes over
    - FINAL TEST 
  -  Samaraweeras 137 not out takes hosts to 425             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Colombo: Virender Sehwag continues to rewrite the grammar of opening in Test cricket.         
	Fifty off 44 balls, an unbeaten 97 from 87 deliveries... The second fastest, after Walter Hammond, to 7,000 runs. All quite another level stuff and definitely mind blowing.         
	Clearly, Sehwag doesnt cease to amaze. Nor does he give the opposition relief. No wonder Thilan Samaraweera meekly acknowledged: Its one wicket when Sehwag is batting, it becomes another when he gets out... Sehwags the biggest threat.         
	Not Sachin Tendulkar, mind you.         
	Samaraweera is no Sehwag, but hes more than a useful bat and remained not out on 137 (370 minutes, 288 balls, 12x4, 1x5, 1x6), enabling Sri Lanka cross 400 in innings No.1 at the P. Sara Oval.         
	The hosts, in fact, reached 425 before their essay ended 42 minutes prior to tea on Wednesday, Day II of the third and final Test.         
	A commanding total, given the turn and bounce which the spinners have been attracting. Also, the visitors will have to bat last, thanks entirely to another toss-loss.         
	With that as a daunting backdrop, India needed to start strongly. Forty-plus partnerships were registered for the first two wickets, but the need of the afternoon was to build big.         
	Sehwag took that task on his shoulders. Being the vice-captain, he had to show the way, too. After all, were trailing 0-1 in the Micromax Cup.         
	Angelo Mathews, of course, may forever rue having spilled a return catch from Sehwag. Hed then been on 52, with India 98 for two. Had it been taken, the day could have ended entirely differently.         
	But, then, cricket wont be the sport it is if every catch gets taken. Would be awfully dull sans the drama.         
	Murali Vijay featured in a soft dismissal, while Rahul Dravid went leg-before playing from the crease. Both had seemed up for it, particularly Dravid, who countered Lasith Malinga superbly.         
	On the comeback trail, Malinga hurled everything at the India batsmen, but failed to intimidate.         
	Chanaka Welegedara, also returning to the XI, after being dropped at the SSC, got plenty of stick, with Sehwag out to quickly correct the Galle blot. In the first Test, the left-arm quick had dismissed him in both innings.         
	Sehwag may forgive, but doesnt forget. And, so, Welegedara was taught a lesson. His drooping shoulders said everything.         
	The bindaas opener is effectively just a stroke away from his 21st hundred. Hed scored 109 and 31 in Galle; 99 at the SSC.         
	Sachin, who is keeping Sehwag company, has looked good, too. Its to be seen exactly how he celebrates becoming the most capped Test cricketer.         
	If its done in a mega manner, then Sri Lankas party would get ruined. Action will resume on 180 for two.         
	This wicket is the real Test, not the one at the SSC, Samaraweera reminded. The surface, however, doesnt make any difference to Sehwag.         
	Earlier, Samaraweera got his third Test hundred (12th overall) against India and Pragyan Ojha returned career-best figures (four for 115). Ishant Sharma, whose confidence has grown, got three wickets.         
	We stuck to the basics and were disciplined in the morning. Our game plan succeeded, Ojha pointed out.         
	With more personnel on view and the security cordon stronger, there was no untoward incident on Wednesday. It was fine, Yuvraj, whod been abused on Day I, told The Telegraph.         
	Meanwhile, according to manager Ranjib Biswal, Gautam Gambhir left for home late on Tuesday. Harbhajan Singh departs on Thursday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mancini pat for Tevez
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mancini pat for Tevez
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Roberto Mancini has brushed off Carlos Tevezs criticism of the Manchester City managers training regime by billing the Argentina striker as second only to Lionel Messi in the worlds-best player rankings.         
	Tevez, set to face former club Manchester United in Saturdays derby at Eastlands on Saturday, claimed earlier this week that he was unimpressed by Mancinis double-session training regime at Manchester City.         
	And with 28-goal Tevez inspiring Citys push for Champions League qualification, Mancini insists that the striker has now proved his calibre as one of the worlds top players.         
	Mancini said: Carlos is already an important player for us, but he could improve over the next year.

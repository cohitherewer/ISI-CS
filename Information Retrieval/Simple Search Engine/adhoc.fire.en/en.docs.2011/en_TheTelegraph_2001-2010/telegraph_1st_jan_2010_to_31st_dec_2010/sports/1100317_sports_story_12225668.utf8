The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings topple Knights
                                                                                                                       7                                      Super Kings topple Knights
    - 55-run loss for Sourav Ganguly amp; Co. as Shane Bond makes IPL debut             INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                        MoM Dhoni in action at the Eden, on Tuesday		    
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan and Eden Gardens will have to wait. After emphatic back-to-back victories, the Kolkata Knight Riders Tuesday tasted once more the low of a defeat at the Eden.         
	The principal owners promise to dance once five victories were achieved suffered a setback as Mahendra Singh Dhonis calculated assault virtually nipped their early promise in the bud.         
	The Chennai Super Kings won by a whopping 55 runs to record their first victory in the tournament after the loss in their opener against the Deccan Chargers. Eden had fallen silent.         
	The Knight Riders challenge ended early after an unbroken 109 run partnership off 65 balls for the fourth wicket between Dhoni and Subramaniam Badrinath had lifted the Super Kings to 164.         
	The pair changed the complexion of the game after Sourav Gangulys men had them in a spot. Dhonis unbeaten 66 and Badrinaths 43 took the steam out of the attack.         
	While Dhonis cameo took only 33 balls, with six boundaries and three sixes, Badrinaths came off 33 balls (3x4, 1x6). There was no looking back for them after that.         
	The home batting collapsed like a pack of cards as none of the batsmen showed the wherewithal to stay at the wicket.         
	Once Brad Hodge fell on the second ball of the innings, Ravichandran Ashwin taking advantage of his height at short mid-wicket, the Super Kings bowlers called the shots.         
	The Knight Riders batsmen dug themselves into a hole with poor shot selection. Manoj Tiwary hitting through the line, Wriddhiman Saha playing all over, Sourav failing to clear Albie Morkel at deep mid-wicket. Angelo Mathews, too, fell victim to indiscretion. Only Owais Shah got out to a great delivery.         
	It was all over by the start of the 11th over. The chase lacked momentum and fizzled out in a flash.         
	Shane Bond had said at the break that the wicket was two-paced and chasing wouldnt be easy. His words proved prophetic. Justin Kemp returned the most successful bowler with three wickets but the Knight Riders had very little excuse to offer.         
	While Dhoni won the battle of captains, Souravs miscalculating Brad Hodges quota of overs, resulting in the all-rounder bowling only one, will remain the talking point.         
	They had gambled with Bond and it paid off until Dhoni spoiled the figures in his final over. There was no doubting his form though  he finished as New Zealands top wicket-taker in the just-concluded Chappell-Hadlee Trophy with nine wickets in five ODIs.         
	The Knights wanted to make optimum use of Bonds pace and accuracy and the fast bowler was bang on target. Shrugging off jet lag, he enthralled the Eden crowd with perfect line and movement, not to mention the 145kmph average speed.         
	Bond cramped Hayden for room, thereby restricting the Australian as he tried to break free. The two overs from Bond in his first spell were enough to frustrate Hayden, sans his Mongoose.         
	Bond had virtually set it up and an inspired Ishant Sharma dislodged the opener. Only six runs had come off the first three overs and Hayden had to take the initiative.         
	Ishant had dug it in short and as Hayden went for the cut, he realised it was too close to his body. The inside edge rolled onto his stumps and the Bond magic had worked.         
	Murali Vijay lived dangerously for 26 balls and Suresh Raina was scratchy for his 18 runs. Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Brad Hodge dismissed them in consecutive overs. At 55 for three in the tenth over, the Knights had everything going in their favour.         
	Sourav brought Bond back hoping for further inroads, and Dhoni withstood a painful blow on his forearm. Then, with Badrinath for company, Dhoni started to rebuild the innings. It was not until the final delivery of the 15th over that he managed the first big hit, a six over long on.         
	And it was not until the 18th over that he really went berserk. Sixteen runs came off that Shukla over. But, more importantly for the Chennai Super Kings, Dhoni survived a caught behind chance on 43.         
	It was time to bring on Bond, who was back for his final over. Dhoni was at his lethal best as they hammered 16 runs and Badrinath one.         
	The mayhem inspired Badrinath who started off with a six in the final over off Ishant. Dhoni, too, joined the party as 16 runs came at a canter. The Knight Riders missed a run out opportunity as the batsmen collided in the middle. But the visitors had by then set themselves up for an imposing total.

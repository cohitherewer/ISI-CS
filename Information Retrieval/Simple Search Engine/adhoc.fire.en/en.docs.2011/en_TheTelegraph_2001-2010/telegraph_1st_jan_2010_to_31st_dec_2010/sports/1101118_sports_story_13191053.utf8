The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara, Jayawardene score fifties
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sangakkara, Jayawardene score fifties
                      
	Galle: Captain Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene scored half-centuries to steer Sri Lanka to 165 for three in reply to the West Indies 580 for nine declared before rain brought an early end to play, on day three of the first Test, on Wednesday.         
	Sri Lanka went to lunch on 148 for three but only 25 deliveries were possible after lunch when bad light stopped play. The rain then started and persisted through the scheduled second session, forcing Australian match referee Alan Hurst to call off the days play.         
	Jayawardene was unbeaten on 51, with Thilan Samaraweera on 11 at stumps.         
	Resuming Wednesday at 54 for one, the hosts added only seven before opener Tharanga Paranavitana (10) was bowled by seamer Kemar Roach.         
	Sangakkara rallied with an aggressive 73, his 34th half-century, before being bowled by Dwayne Bravo with a yorker. He and Jayawardene shared 71 runs for the third wicket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warnes got the aura: Dav 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Warnes got the aura: Dav 
  - World Cup-winning coach says Australians leadership skills on a par with Imran, Arjuna and Sourav       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dav Whatmore                                 
	Calcutta: Shane Warne didnt get to captain Australia at the highest level (he did in ODIs, though), but Dav Whatmore has placed his leadership skills on a par with Imran Khan, Arjuna Ranatunga and Sourav Ganguly.         
	Warne, who retired from international cricket in January 2007, is currently leading the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL.         
	Doing a terrific job, too.         
	Its always nice when a captain performs... Warne has been doing just that and, in terms of leadership, Id definitely place him alongside Imran, Arjuna and Sourav, Whatmore, the Kolkata Knight Riders coach, told The Telegraph.         
	Whatmore, who played seven Tests and a solitary ODI for Australia, hasnt worked with Imran, but he did with Ranatunga. As for Sourav, hes the Knights captain.         
	Imran and Ranatunga are World Cup winners, 1992 and 1996, respectively, while Sourav took India to the 2003 final. All are, of course, icons.         
	Whatmore, incidentally, is himself a World Cup-winning coach.         
	Warnes got that aura, besides his record as a leg-spinner does all the talking... Hes already done it big for the Royals (in 2008, the inaugural IPL), Whatmore added, on Tuesday.         
	Whatmore watched the first half of the thrilling Royals versus the Deccan Chargers match on Monday and, then, saw the rest in a highlights package.         
	After having failed to defend even 200, on Sunday, the Knights can draw much inspiration from the Royals win. Indeed, Warne and Co. pulled it off from a position of no hope.         
	Now, what at the Eden, on Wednesday?

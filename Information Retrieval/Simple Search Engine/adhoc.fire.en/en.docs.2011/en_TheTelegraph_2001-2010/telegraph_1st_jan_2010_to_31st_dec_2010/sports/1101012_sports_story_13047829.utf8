  - Day VIII Haul of Fame: One gold, one silver and six bronze medals         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rajpal Singh is counting on crowd support once again                                 
	New Delhi: A team on a high takes on a team on a roll. India, fresh from their emotionally charged 7-4 win over Pakistan, play England in the second semi-final of the Commonwealth Games at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, here on Tuesday. England, of late have been playing brilliant hockey.         
	They were the Champions Trophy runners-up, losing to the indomitable Australians, and also the semi-finalists in the World Cup, held here in February-March.         
	So will India be able to put it across the Englishmen? Given the way India played against Pakistan, they can do that. But lets not forget that England are in top form. Unlike Pakistan, they play a very physical game and India are known to capitulate against teams like England.               
	It will be a tough match for us. England and Australia have come to Commonwealth Games as potential finalists.         
	They are the Champions Trophy runners-up and also the European champions. So, you can understand we have to play really well if we want to make it to the final, foreign coach Jose Brasa said.         
	Brasa, who had said that Sundays 7-4 win was the best he had experienced since he took over as the foreign coach, felt that Indian players should forget the Pakistan tie and focus on the semi-final.         
	Its easier said than done. Getting the Sunday clash out of your system so fast will be difficult, he said.         
	India will have to play with their mind and not heart as they did against Pakistan. Pakistan with a bunch of inexperienced players were not being able to create much trouble for India, but the likes of Ashley Jackson, Richard Mantell and Simon Mantell will be a different ballgame altogether.         
	India and England did play three practice matches before the Commonwealth Games, with India winning two and drawing one. So wont it give them a psychological advantage on Tuesday?         
	Captain Rajpal Singh doesnt think so. Practice matches are practice matches. If we think that England will play the same way they played in those matches, then we are in for trouble, he said.         
	Rajpal is counting on crowd support once again. I hope they come in large numbers once again.         
	Against Pakistan the vociferous crowd made the Zeeshan Ashrafs so nervous that they conceded four goals within the first 20 minutes. Yeah, I hope something similar happens against England too, he said.         
	England may not get intimidated by the crowd. They are disciplined and mentally far more strong than the Pakistanis. You will hardly see any flamboyance in the English style of hockey, and under Jason Lee this team has improved by leaps and bounds.         
	All said and done, a win on Tuesday will not only give India a maiden place in the gold medal match since hockeys introduction to the Commonwealth Games in 1998 Kuala Lumpur edition, but will also avenge their 2-3 loss to England in the World Cup earlier this year.         
	Australia take on New Zealand in the first semi-final at 11 am Tuesday.

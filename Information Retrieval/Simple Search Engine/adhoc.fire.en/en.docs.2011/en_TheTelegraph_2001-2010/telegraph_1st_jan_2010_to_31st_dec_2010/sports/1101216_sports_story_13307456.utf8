                                                                                                                       7                                      India Blues in last four
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: Formidables of Delhi and India Blues of Mumbai entered the semi-finals of the Ruia Gold, in the 52nd Winter National Bridge Championships, being held at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, here on Wednesday. Both their opponents, Shree Cement and MMRMC respectively, conceded with one session to go.         
	Super Swiss toppers Sunil Machhar of Mumbai, who had the first pick of choosing their quarter final opponents, obviously made the wrong choice when they picked fellow citymates, Poddar Developers.         
	The Developers trounced them by over 50 IMPs.         
	In the tight Indian Railways B versus C.V. Rao match, the latter prevailed by 27 IMPs to enter the last four. In the the semi-finals Poddar Developers will take on C.V.Rao, while the Formidables will meet India Blues.         
	The prestigious Holkar Pairs, the blue riband pairs event, has attracted over 200 entries.         
	The first elimination saw the field pruned down to I08 pairs on Wednesday. Thursday will feature the 54 board semi-finals in the Ruia Gold and final elimination in the Holkar pairs.         
	The Ruia Gold is being shown live both on the VU-Graph at the venue and worldwide on the BBO. One can see the matches in real time and even participate in the commentary.

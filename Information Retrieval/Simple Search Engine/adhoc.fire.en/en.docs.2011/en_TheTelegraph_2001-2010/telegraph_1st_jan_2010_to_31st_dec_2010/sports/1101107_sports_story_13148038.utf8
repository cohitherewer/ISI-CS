The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McCullum: Weve fought   our way back into the Test
                                                                                                                       7                                        McCullum: Weve fought our way back into the Test
  - New Zealand opener feels his team showed character on the third day       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kane Williamson on way to his unbeaten 87, in Ahmedabad, on Saturday                                       
	Ahmedabad: Brendon McCullum may have wasted a wonderful opportunity to score his first hundred as a Test batsman, but he was more than satisfied with his teams overall performance on Saturday.         
	Speaking to the media after the days play, the opener heaped praise on Jesse Ryder and Kane Williamson for their remarkable batting performance.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His reading of the days play         
	I think today we fought our way back into the Test match. We showed good character. Hopefully, we can carry that forward in the next two days.         
	On Jesse Ryders comeback knock         
	He has shown that he wants to move on from the off-field things that he had been involved in. He had made some mistakes in the past. But with this innings, he showed how huge a player he is. He has incredible talent. He is a valuable member of our team. We saw the confidence in his batting when he walked out to play. We have to make sure now that he continues to focus the same way throughout the series.         
	Kane Willamsons batting performance         
	He is just 20 years old and from a New Zealanders point of view, guys develop after being much older than his age. Hes an incredible talent for us. He had a one-day hundred in Bangladesh a couple of weeks ago and he played very well today against a very good Indian bowling line-up. To be able to negotiate tough periods and be calm at the crease are good signs for any batsman. I really hope he goes on tomorrow to score his maiden Test hundred. I am sure itll be a memorable hundred for him.         
	Whether the team had expected Ryder and Williamson to bat the way they did         
	Yeah, we got a chance to sit back and watch one of the best batting we have seen from a No. 5 and a No. 6 batsman in a New Zealand Test team for a long long time. It was pretty enjoyable to watch even when I was done for the day. But I dont think anyone could have expected those guys to play as well as they did. We have high expectations from each member of the team. Jesse hasnt played any Test for a while and today put on that partnership against quality bowlers. That put us back into the Test match.         
	If hes satisfied with the teams batting         
	From New Zealand players point of view, we were satisfied with our days work. We have more hard work lined up in the next two days. From the spectators point of view as well, it has been an enthralling days cricket.         
	On his new role as a Test opener         
	I am going through a challenging period at the moment. I am trying to come as a Test opening batsman and thats quite different from the previous 50 Tests that Ive played. I have really enjoyed the role of the opener so far in this game. I have been probably more aggressive in my approach. But thats what was requited for our team as well. Our tactic was to push the score and also take the shine off the ball. But I was little bit disappointed getting out after all the hard work that I had done. Hopefully, I will get an opportunity in the second innings and will make sure that I make a significant impact on the Test match.         
	If he was disappointed missing on a hundred         
	You work so hard to get into a situation like that, get used to the pace of the wicket, start reading all the bowlers and then if you get out, its disappointing. It was close to Ross (Taylor) dismissal as well. That brought two new guys at the crease.

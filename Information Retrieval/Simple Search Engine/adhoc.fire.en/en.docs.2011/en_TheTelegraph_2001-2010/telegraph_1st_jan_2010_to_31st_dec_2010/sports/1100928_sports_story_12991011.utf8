The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aamer puts Butt in a spot
                                                                                                                       7                                        Aamer puts Butt in a spot
    - Young pacer says Test captain lured him into fixing; Yawar Saeed resigns                 Salman Butt                           
	Karachi: Barely five days after the end of their scandal-hit tour of England, fresh turmoil Monday gripped the Pakistan cricket team with suspended pacer Mohammed Aamers shocking revelation that he was lured into spot-fixing by Test skipper Salman Butt.         
	On a day when team manager Yawar Saeed stepped from his post, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was left to do more fire-fighting in the spot-fixing scandal with the latest revelation.         
	The 18-year-old left-arm pacer was suspended by the ICC for his alleged involvement in spot-fixing during the fourth Test against England, at Lords last month, along with Butt and Mohammed Asif.         
	Sources in the PCB said Aamer had told chairman Ijaz Butt that he never wanted to be part of this business (spot fixing) but was forced into it by Butt and Asif.         
	Aamer had gone to Butt and claimed he was innocent and a victim of the seniors power lobby in the team, a source said.         
	But the PCB refuted the reports with legal adviser Tafazzul Rizvi saying that the implicated players continue to claim innocence.         
	All three boys have been saying all along that they did not do anything wrong and they stand by it. They claim innocence and complete innocence and nothing but innocence. We are holding our investigations back at the moment and we are waiting for the Scotland Yards investigation report, he said.         
	Another source revealed that Aamer, regarded as one of Pakistans most promising young talent, had told Saeed about the pressure being exerted on him by Salman Butt.         
	Aamers claim is that he just did what he was told to do. He is claiming innocence now and says he didnt even know Mazhar Majeed was introduced to him by (Salman) Butt and Asif, the source said.                   Mohammed Aamer      
	Quite a few former Test captains, and even Pakistans former President, Pervez Musharraf, have urged the ICC to show leniency towards Aamer, all of 18 and the quickest to take 50 wickets in Test cricket.         
	But chief selector Mohsin Khan said that he didnt agree with the viewpoint that Aamer should be shown leniency because of his age.         
	I dont buy this argument because if you can do something wrong at 18, you can keep on doing it later as well. If these three players are found guilty they should be punished, including Aamer, Mohsin said.         
	The chief selector insisted that no cricketer was indispensable and there should be no compromise on discipline and commitment towards your team and country.         
	Aamer must be punished if he is guilty. I just hope that that these three are eventually cleared because they have already damaged the reputation of Pakistan cricket and the country, Mohsin said.         
	Meanwhile, (PCB) media manager Nadeem Sarwar told reporters that Saeed, during his meeting with PCB chairman Butt, requested to be relieved of his duties as national team manager.         
	The chairman has accepted his request. The PCB will decide on a new manager later on for the forthcoming series against South Africa, Sarwar said.         
	Saeed, when contacted, declined to comment on his decision stating that he had done his duty as manager in England and that his agreement with the board was on a series to series basis.         
	I have had a long discussion with the chairman and he understood my point of view, Saeed said.         
	Saeed and Butt are close friends and since Butt took over as chairman in 2008, he has reposed faith in Saeed except for the tours to New Zealand and Australia early this year.

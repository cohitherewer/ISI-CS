The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swiss fail to deliver
                                                                                                                       7                                      Swiss fail to deliver
                      
	Bloemfontein: Switzerlands World Cup campaign came to a shuddering halt on Friday after an uninspiring 0-0 draw with Honduras in Group H saw both teams eliminated at the Free State stadium.         
	Switzerland, who had excited everybody with a shock 1-0 opening win over European champions Spain, could have reached the second round with victory over the Central Americans but rarely looked like scoring.         
	In the end, they finished with just one goal scored and one conceded in their three games. Honduras came bottom of the group and failed to score in the tournament.         
	We failed to deliver because we had too much pressure. We had to score twice, Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld told a news conference.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal: Need to hit a few balls
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi : Arjun Atwal did not have the best of starts at the Indian Open golf, on Thursday, but it will be too early to rule out the Indias only PGA Tour title winner.         
	Placed tied 46th at the end of the first day, Atwal, too, was optimistic about his own chances.         
	 I think it is just off-season rust showing up. I need to go and hit a few balls. I need to get the alignment right, he said at the end of the day.         
	After Wyndham (which he won on PGA Tour) Singapore, I played three of the five events in fall season and was third in one. Then, in Asia, I played in Malaysia, Shanghai and Singapore Open.         
	After Singapore Open, which was three weeks ago, I havent played much and spent time with family and friends. So I just need to get to the range and hit some balls and putt a bit, said the star golfer.         
	Compatriot, Shiv Kapur, however, was not too happy with his performance.         
	It was a frustrating day. I was hitting the greens fine, I hit 16 greens, but putting let me down. I just could not hole anything, said Kapur, tied 21st on the leaderboard.         
	I must have had something 33-34 putts. There were a couple of three-putts, once when I had an eagle putt from 20 feet. Frankly I felt the way I played, I was good enough for a six or seven-under today. I missed so many putts for birdies out there, some were short and then at times I was short on confidence.         
	Kapur said he was going to try his old putter from Day II, the one with which he won the Volvo Masters in 2005.         
	I am bringing it out and am going to give it a try. Overall, it was a good day, but one part  putting  did not work, he said.

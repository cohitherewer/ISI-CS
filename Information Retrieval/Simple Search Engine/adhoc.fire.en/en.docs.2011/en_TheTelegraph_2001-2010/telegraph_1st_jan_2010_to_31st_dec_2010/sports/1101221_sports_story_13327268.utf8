The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Novak supports father
                                                                                                                       7                                      Novak supports father
                      
	Belgrade: Serbias top tennis player Novak Djokovic has expressed support for his fathers initiative to topple the countrys tennis federation (TSS) leadership and the bodys president Slobodan Zivojinovic.         
	Djokovic senior and Zivojinovic clashed after Serbia won their first Davis Cup title earlier this month with a 3-2 win over France in Belgrade. Im really sorry that the situation is almost out of control but changes are inevitable, world No. 3 Djokovic said on his website.         
	The Tennis Association needs new people in order to finally build a national tennis centre and provide better conditions for young talents to progress. I have to say my father has no intention of taking any position in the TSS, but to present to all clubs the functioning of the concept he represents. He does it very successfully and we fully support him because prosperity and well-being are guaranteed with the new management, added Djokovic, who posted his comments in his online diary while on a holiday in Dubai.         
	Djokovics father Srdjan said last week that the TSS deserved no credit for Serbias Davis Cup success and called on Zivojinovic to step down.         
	His public statement was backed by coach Bogdan Obradovic and the players, but Zivojinovic replied that he would run for another four-year term in office.         
	Zivojinovic, twice a Wimbledon semi-finalist, said in his own statement he would put forward a realistic programme devoid of unrealistic promises if he was re-elected.

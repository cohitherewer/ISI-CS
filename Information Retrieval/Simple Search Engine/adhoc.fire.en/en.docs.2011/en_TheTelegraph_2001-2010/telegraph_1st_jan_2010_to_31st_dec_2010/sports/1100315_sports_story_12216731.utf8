	Shillong/ Margao/ Mumbai: Dempo suffered second defeat in a row as they went down to Salgaocar 2-3 in a 16th round match of the I-League, at the Nehru Stadium, here on Sunday.         
	Salgaocar, who led 2-1 at half time, scored through Ekene Ikenwa (43rd, 66th) and Roouhollah Samiena (38th). Ranty Martins (33rd) and Anwar (60th) found the target for Dempo.         
	In Shillong, hosts Lajong FC played out a goalless draw against Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	For two teams languishing at the bottom of the 14-team table, it was a match of squandered opportunities. The Goans were awarded a penalty after Lajong custodian R. Lalthuammawia brought down Sporting striker Nathaniel Amos in the 19th minute. However, Lalthuammawia managed to fist away the Amos shot.         
	In Mumbai, Air India ended Pune FCs seven-match unbeaten run when they defeated the visitors by a solitary goal. Kailash Patil scored the all important goal in the 54th minute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky has plans for India tour
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ricky has plans for India tour
                      
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting feels playing a Test series in India just ahead of the Ashes at home will require major adjustments in the squad.         
	Its obviously vastly different, if you look at the squad that we could probably put out for the first Test in Brisbane compared with the squad youd think about playing on a spinning wicket in India. Theyre probably two completely different squads, Ponting said.         
	It would be nice to get some match hardness into the guys, having not played a lot of Test cricket at that stage, but well come home then and be back into one day cricket in Australia anyway so well just have to manage that as well as we can, he added.         
	Australias tour of India later this year was supposed to be a seven-match ODI affair but after India became the world No. 1 Test side, the BCCI requested Cricket Australia to include five-day matches during the tour. CA is yet to respond but there is a possibility that it would not have any problem in accommodating the BCCI request.         
	The Aussies are busy gearing up for the Ashes, aiming to beat old rivals England in the historic series at the end of the year. Well make sure that hopefully every player will get at least two Sheffield Shield games under their belt leading into that first Test, Ponting said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashwin runs through Central batting
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ashwin runs through Central batting
                      
	Indore: R Ashwin spun South Zone back in contention with his sensational six-wicket haul after his side conceded a slender first innings lead to Central Zone on a dramatic Day Three of the Duleep Trophy semi-final, here on Thursday.         
	Resuming the day at 254 for eight, South were all out for 295, conceding a 38-run lead but Ashwin changed the complexion of the game after that.         
	He ran through the middle-order of rivals in their second essay and all Central Zone could manage was 252 on board, setting South a 291-run victory target.         
	Brief scores         
	Central Zone 333 amp; 252 (Raina 59, Chawla 56, Ashwin 6/67). South Zone 295 amp; 57/1 (Karthik 33). (PTI)

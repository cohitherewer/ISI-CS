	Madrid: Fourth-seeded Venus Williams reached the semi-finals of the Madrid Masters, beating Samantha Stosur 6-3, 6-3 on Friday.         
	In a strong performance Venus broke the eighth-seeded Stosurs serve four times.         
	Venus, who will climb to the second ranking behind sister Serena next week, has now won all four of her meetings with the Australian. Venus will play Shahar Peer of Israel, who beat Li Na of China 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.         
	Earlier, Lucie Safarova progressed to the semis with a 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 victory over 16th-seeded Nadia Petrova.         
	It was the Czech players first win over Russias Petrova in four attempts.In the mens singles, Rafael Nadal was close to his claycourt best in beating Gael Monfils 6-1, 6-3 Friday for a place in the Madrid Masters semi-finals.         
	The 23-year-old Monfils was playing his first clay tournament of the season and was outclassed by a dominant Nadal, who has not lost a service game in his three matches in Madrid.         
	The second-seeded Spaniard pressured Monfils serve from the start, and broke to go up 3-1 in the first set after the 12-seeded Frenchman double-faulted.         
	Nadal is undefeated on clay this season with a 13-0 record, having won titles in Monte Carlo and Rome and is looking for a record 18th Masters title. Nadal and Andre Agassi have won 17 each.         
	Nadal will play fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro, who beat Jurgen Melzer 6-3, 6-1 in the only quarterfinal not to feature a seeded player.           (AGENCIES)

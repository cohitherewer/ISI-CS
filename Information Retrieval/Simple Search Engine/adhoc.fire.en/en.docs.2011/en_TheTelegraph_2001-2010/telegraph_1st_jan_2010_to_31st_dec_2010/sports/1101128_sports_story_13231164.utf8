	Colombo: The second Test between Sri Lanka and the West Indies ended in a tame draw Saturday after most of the match was washed out by rain.         
	Set 202 runs to win in 22 overs under fading light, the West Indies ended the final day at 12 for two wickets from 11 overs.         
	Opener Adrian Barath (8) was trapped in front spinner Ajantha Mendis and Chris Gayle (3) edged Tillekaratne Dilshan to Mahela Jayawardene at slip.           (AGENCIES)

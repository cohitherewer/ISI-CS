	Toronto: The spate of withdrawals from the Delhi Commonwealth Games continued with Canadian diver Meaghan Benfeito and badminton player Alvin Lau becoming the latest to opt out of the event, citing contrasting reasons. Canada will have a 400-strong presence in the October 3 to 14 Games which includes athletes, coaches and support staff.         
	While Benfeito has pulled out because of a shoulder injury, the 25-year-old Lau has cited university commitments, the local media reported. The duo joins archers Kevin Tataryn and Dietmar Trillus, who cited health and security fears, in the list of Canadian withdrawals from the Games.         
	The 21-year-old Benfeito was to participate in two events  the 10-metre platform and the 10-metre platform synchro  with teammate Roseline Filion. Benfeito will be replaced by Rachel Kemp. Lau, who attends the University of British Columbia, will not be replaced in the badminton team.         
	Kyle Hunter, Badminton Canadas executive director, said, We have made some adjustments to the pairings and our athletes are looking forward to competing in what is a very strong field.         
	The first batch of Canadian athletes has already reached Delhi for the event. (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Materazzi: Were losing our leader
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Jose Mourinho admitted he was more likely to leave than stay after guiding Inter Milan to a Champions League final win over Bayern Munich that sealed his second career Treble.         
	Inter beat Bayern Munich 2-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium where Mourinho expected to be in charge of Real Madrid next season. Having become only the third coach to have won Europes premier competition with two different clubs  he won it with Porto in 2004  he said he wants to go one better.         
	I want to be the only coach to win the Champions League with three different clubs, he said. Its more likely that I will leave rather than stay.         
	The Champions League I won at Porto (2004) was my last game there and this time it will almost certainly be my last game for Inter. I want another challenge in my career. Its not definite that Ill go but I want new risks, new experiences, and now is the moment to decide.         
	He further added: Great season, incredible season. But at this moment I have not many words to describe how I feel because its almost for sure that I will leave.         
	He continued: Real Madrid is the only club that wants me. It is an enormous club, a club that wants the same as me; I want to win, I want to feel important, I want to keep winning.         
	And added: My target now is to win another championship where I have never won it and another Champions League ... And then I return to England.         
	In Italy, as in England, Mourinhos has been an incendiary presence and the Portuguese managed to antagonise just about everyone from fellow coaches to the countrys mafia, but one thing doesnt seem to have changed, the adulation he receives from his players.         
	Were losing our leader  the person who made us invincible and turned us all into brothers, was what defender Marco Materazzi had to say.         
	Should Mourinho decide to take over at Real, it has been widely speculated that he will ask for Douglas Maicon to join him at the Bernabeu.

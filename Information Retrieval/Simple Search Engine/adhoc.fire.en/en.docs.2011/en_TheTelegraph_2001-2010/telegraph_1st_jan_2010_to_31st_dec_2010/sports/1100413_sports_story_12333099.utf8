	New Delhi: Gayatri Vartak and PC Thulashi failed to make it to the main draw of the Asian Badminton Championship after losing their respective matches in the qualifying rounds of the prestigious event being staged at the Siri Fort Stadium here, Monday.         
	Gayatri started her campaign on a positive note, winning her first match against Chandrika D Silva 21-17, 21-12 but couldnt get past Xin Liu of China in the second match. She lost 12-21, 11-21.         
	Compatriot Thulasi also had a good start when she beat Sara Khan of Pakistan 21-9, 21-16 but Hsiao Ma Pai of Chinese Taipei proved too much for her as she lost 8-21, 9-21 to crash out of the tournament.         
	Thulasi admitted that she made too many unforced errors. She was very quick in the court and I was not able to retrieve her shuttles. My shots went outside the court and I made too many mistakes. They proved costly, she said.         
	Gayatri said she was mentally tired after playing the first match.         
	I was getting mentally tired after regular intervals, she said.         
	I had an infection coming back after the Uber Cup and so I didnt get enough time to train. Hopefully I will pick soon, she added.           (PTI)

Sachin injures hand, expected to be fit for the final             K. KUMARASWAMY                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar was out for a single digit score. Harbhajan Singh didnt sledge. And there were comparatively less sixes. Yet, one thing remained unchanged  the Mumbai Indians won.         
	Oh, yes! There were a couple of other constants too. Saurabh Tiwary slammed a typical half-century, 52 not out, and Man of the Match Kieron Pollard made an unbeaten 33 off 13 balls.         
	The total of 184 for five proved too good to chase for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who finished on 149 for nine. The end result, a 35-run victory, that took the Mumbai Indians to their maiden IPL final.         
	It didnt look so rosy in the beginning, though. With the Royal Challengers firing on all cylinders after being asked to bowl, it looked for a while that the Mumbai Indians, who had been dominant throughout the league stage, might implode under the weight of expectations.         
	But thanks to a right mix of caution and aggression, the Mumbai side made sure the fairy-tale continued.         
	There was a bit of worry though, as Sachin split the webbing of his right hand and required five stitches. Hopefully, Ill recover for the final, the Mumbai Indians captain said later.         
	If anything, this win should rank among the Mumbai Indians best in the tournament so far.         
	For, the foundation was laid by the young batting trio of Ambati Rayudu, Tiwary and Pollard, and backed by an overall superlative performance by the bowlers and fielders.         
	Rayudu showed his maturity in anchoring the innings after a top-order collapse.         
	When Rayudu walked in, Sachin Tendulkar had fallen to Dale Steyn chasing a wide delivery and Shikhar Dhawan was run out to a superb piece of fielding by Virat Kohli.         
	Abhishek Nayar, the Mumbai man, had been given the No.3 slot and Rayudu, rightly so, confined himself to the secondary role.         
	After some initial entertainment when he struck R. Vinay Kumar and Praveen Kumar for three fours, Rayudu settled down to finding the gaps instead of the boundary ropes.         
	His pragmatism continued after the dismissals of Nayar and JP Duminy, and well into his partnership with Tiwary.         
	In fact, as Tiwary strained under the leash, it was the composure of his teammate that helped him keep his nerves.         
	Rayudus 40 contained 18 singles and three twos apart from the four boundaries. Some way to pace a T20 innings!         
	When he departed, deceived by a slower one from Steyn, he had put on 67 runs for the fifth wicket with Tiwary.         
	Tiwary was his usual belligerent self. He was keen to take on the Royal Challengers from the outset but with the DY Patil pitch offering pace and bounce, he couldnt walk down the track and perch the ball into the stands as he has so often done in this tournament.         
	Indeed, his first boundary shot came after he had faced 12 balls.         
	But once he hit the ball out of the park, it stayed hit. After hoisting the part-time stuff from Kohli over mid wicket, Tiwary started dealing with boundaries. Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble and Dale Steyn, none were spared.         
	And with Pollard joining him, the duo went berserk. Their unbroken partnership for the sixth wicket was worth 40 runs while 77 runs came from the last five overs.         
	Royal Challengers simply failed to get going and, again, it was Rayudu playing a crucial role in the background.         
	Jacques Kallis failed to take advantage of a reprieve, when Dhawan dropped a sitter at fine leg with the batsman on three, as he nicked Lasith Malinga to be caught behind.         
	Rayudu came up with a low catch to send back the South African but he reserved his best for Kevin Pietersen who was beaten down the leg as he charged to Harbhajan and the Hyderabad player dived to whip the bails in time.         
	Not bad for a make-shift wicketkeeper!         
	Then Rahul Dravid and Robin Uthappa fell in successive balls to upset their charge.         
	With Kohli, Manish Pandey and Praveen Kumar falling in quick succession, Ross Taylor was left stranded at one end.

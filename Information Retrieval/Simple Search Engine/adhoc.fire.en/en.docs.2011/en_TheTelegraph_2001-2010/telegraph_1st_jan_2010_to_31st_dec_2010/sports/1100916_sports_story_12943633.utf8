	Barcelona: An inspired Lionel Messi netted two superb goals, had a penalty saved and twice rattled the woodwork as Barcelona romped to a 5-1 comeback victory over Panathinaikos in Champions League Group D on Tuesday.         
	The World Player of the Year picked up where he left off in last years edition of Europes elite club competition, when he was the top scorer, pulling Barca level after the Greek champions had taken a shock 20th-minute lead and running the visiting defence ragged.         
	His second goal came after a brilliant passing move that typified Barcas electric playing style and he created their fifth of the night for defender Daniel Alves with a sublime chip that left the hapless Panathinaikos players rooted to the spot.         
	David Villa and Pedro completed the rout, Pedros goal coming after Messis shot from an acute angle bounced back off the far post, ricocheted off the other upright and fell perfectly for the Spain forward to tap across the line.         
	The 23-year-old Argentines performance, showcasing the full range of his talent, recalled his four-goal destruction of Arsenal at the same Nou Camp arena last season. He is the best player in the world by some distance from the rest, coach Pep Guardiola said at a news conference.         
	Barca were smarting from a shock La Liga defeat to Hercules at the weekend and came out with guns blazing at a packed stadium, Messi testing Panathinaikos keeper Alexandros Tzorvas with an acrobatic header in the third minute. The home side were on cruise control but failed to convert a slew of chances and were stunned on 20 minutes when the visitors scored on their first foray upfield.         
	Barca were level within two minutes. Xavi carved open the defence with a trademark precision pass and Messi popped up on the right of the penalty area to lift the ball over Tzorvas into the far corner.         
	After striking a close-range shot against the crossbar in the 43rd minute, Messi was the architect of the goal of the night seconds before halftime. He exchanged passes first with Xavi and then with Pedro to leave the Panathinaikos players chasing shadows and finished past Tzorvas with a low left-foot strike.         
	Messi blotted his copybook after winning a penalty 10 minutes after the break as his weak effort was easily parried by Tzorvas but made amends with two more assists. After Pedros effort made it 4-1 with just over 10 minutes of regular time left, Alves raced clear and sent a looping header over Tzorvas from Messis chip in added time.         
	Barcas other two Group D rivals are Rubin Kazan of Russia and Danish side FC Copenhagen and they next play in Kazan on Sept. 29. Copenhagen beat Rubin 1-0, on Tuesday.         
	Meanwhile, Werder Bremen were surely not surprised by their comeback from two goals down to grab a 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur but they are eager to contain their dark side. The German escape artists have put on two faces in their games recently, including during their Champions League playoff against Sampdoria when they trailed 3-0 in the second leg before losing 3-2 to reach the group stage on away goals.         
	They managed to salvage a point in their opening Group A match against Spurs but luck may not be on their side throughout the campaign as they set their sights on a place in the last 16. While Bremen had a disastrous first period, their battling performance in the second has boosted the sides confidence going into the next two matches against holders Inter Milan and Twente who also drew 2-2 in Enschede on Tuesday. Bremens top striker Peruvian Claudio Pizarro will be back after a muscle problem while Per Mertesacker and Naldo are also close to returning from injury to bolster the defence.         
	Spurs would have wrapped up the points with a third goal midway through the first half but for Wieses goalkeeping.

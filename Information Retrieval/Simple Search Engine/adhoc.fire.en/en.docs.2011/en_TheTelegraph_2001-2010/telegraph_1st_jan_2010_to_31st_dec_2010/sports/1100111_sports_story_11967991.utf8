The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni praises bowlers
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni praises bowlers
            A CORRESPONDENT            Zaheer Khan with the Man of the Match trophy at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, in Dhaka, on Sunday                           
	Dhaka: Team India thrashed Sri Lanka by eight wickets in a crucial match of the Idea Cup tri-series in Mirpur Sunday and, in the process, ensured themselves a place in Wednesdays final.         
	After dismissing Lanka for 213 in 46.1 overs, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. took just 32.4 overs to reach the target.         
	While Gautam Gambhir (71) and Virat Kohli (71 ..) were the chief architects of the chase, it was actually the bowlers, led by Man of the Match Zaheer Khan (3/38), who did the ground work for the victory by keeping a leash on the Lankan total.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, Dhoni lauded his bowlers efforts and also had a word of praise for the fielders for putting up better display on the day.               
	The following are excerpts               
	DHONI: It was a great bowling performance. Zaheer was superb and Sudeep Tyagi, in only his second International match, bowled pretty decently.         
	Actually, if you can restrict a side to 220-230, it means everyone has bowled well. Amit Mishra bowled quite efficiently.         
	With the wicket not providing much assistance to the spinners, his effort is praiseworthy.         
	However, the credit goes to the fast bowlers for bowling well collectively. This was also the best fielding effort we put up in the past 12 months. We fielded really well today (Sunday)         
	It was important to get a good start and, (Dinesh) Karthik and Gambhir did provide us with one. Unfortunately, Karthik couldnt complete his half-century and Gambhir couldnt get a hundred.         
	Kohli, who has been quite consistent for the last few matches, also did a fantastic job today.         
	Its good that we won this match and its great to make it to the finals, but we still have a match left before that We would like to concentrate on that match and fetch a good result before we think about our plans for the final.         
	ZAHEER: It was a good match, but I didnt do anything special. I just stuck to the basics and tried to keep the ball in the right areas. However, we did have a specific plan for (Tillekaratne) Dilshan, like we did during the ODI in Calcutta (on December 24).         
	If you cramp him for room, he makes mistakes and that is how he was dismissed today. Im happy with the way the team played. It was important for me to get wickets.         
	The sub-continent wickets are not conducive for fast bowling and so, it feels good to have done well here. The toss has remained a crucial factor in this series and will be important in the final as well.         
	KUMAR SANGAKKARA: We wanted to take back some positives from this match. But unfortunately, we havent learnt anything from this match  neither in batting nor in bowling. We fared poorly Luckily, it wasnt the final and hopefully we will be able to pull up our socks before that.         
	Its important to assess the conditions and adjust accordingly. We failed in that today and couldnt concentrate on the job today.         
	Our batting was certainly not up to the mark and there is nothing much to speak of. But we are a much better team than what we performed in this match.

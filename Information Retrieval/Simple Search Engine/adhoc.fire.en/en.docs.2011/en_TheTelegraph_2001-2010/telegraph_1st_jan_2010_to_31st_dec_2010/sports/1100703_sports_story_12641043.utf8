The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Predators look to go for the kill
                                                                                                                       7                                        Predators look to go for the kill
    - Lionel Messi has a cold before the hot last-8 clash                 Germanys Mesut Oezil (from left), Thomas Mueller and Cacau, during a training session, at the Green Point Stadium, in Cape Town, on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Cape Town: It is a quarter final with all the makings of a final. Capricious Diego Maradonas Argentina and precocious Germany have already produced the beautiful game that any World Cup thrives on.         
	Yet memory shows Saturdays game also has all the trappings of an ugly clash. And for an added twist, the worlds greatest player, Lionel Messi, was said to be suffering from a touch of a cold, less than 48 hours before kickoff.         
	The game however, already reached fever pitch without any potential illness.         
	For all the sweet moves of Messi and Germanys Mesut Oezil, the wild push-kick-and-shove melee at the end of Germanys penalty shootout quarter final victory over Argentina four years ago is still fresh in the mind. And plenty of mind games are being played, as if the clash of talent is not enough.         
	Surprisingly, Germany started off with mudslinging, and did so with their renowned thoroughness. They are impulsive, temperamental and they dont know how to lose, said captain Philipp Lahm of the Argentineans.         
	And midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said the Argentine players had not changed. They have no respect. Its their mentality and character and well have to adjust.         
	Coach Maradona took much of it in jest. Whats happening Schweinsteiger, are you nervous?, he said. The boys are thinking about getting out on the pitch and getting revenge for 2006, he said. I dont worry about what he says about the penalties, about the kicking, that we dont know how to lose. That doesnt bother us, he said.         
	The point that could well bother them is that playmaker Oezil and strikers like Thomas Mueller and Miroslav Klose could put defenders like Martin Demichelis in trouble like they have never seen at this World Cup.         
	The Germans know Demichelis all too well since he is a linchpin in the defence of Bayern Munich which reached the Champions League final two months ago.         
	And Demichelis said he knows the Germans well enough to know it betrays nerves. Maybe because we beat them on March 3 they respect us a little more, Demichelis said, referring to a 1-0 win in a preparation game.         
	The important thing is that we answer on the pitch. The best answer is during the game.And Argentina hopes Messi will be there to lead them.         
	Team doctor Donato Villani said Messi was kept out of Thursdays training because he has cold-like symptoms, nothing serious. He would undergo thorough medical tests on the eve of the game to test his health.         
	Even if he has not scored yet himself, the Barcelona forward has been instrumental in running up Argentinas 10-2 goal tally with probing runs and crisp passing.         
	On top of that, Argentina has in Real Madrids Gonzalo Higuain a striker on form who shares the lead in the scoring with four goals from the three matches he played. If he fails, Carlos Tevez proved with a double strike in the 3-1 second-round win over Mexico that he can also easily step in.         
	After running England ragged in a superb 4-1 victory of creativity and speed, Germany enters the game with some question marks.         
	Forward Lukas Podolski and Oezil missed Germanys training session because of vague muscular problems and fatigue. Striker Cacau also missed the session because of a right thigh injury and has not trained for the past two days. He is not likely to play against Argentina.         
	Likely Teams         
	Germany (4-4-2): 1-Manuel Neuer, 3-Arne Friedrich, 17-Per Mertesacker, 20-Jerome Boateng, 16-Philipp Lahm, 6-Sami Khedira, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 8-Mesut Oezil, 13-Thomas Mueller, 10-Lukas Podolski, 11-Miroslav Klose         
	Argentina (3-4-3): 22-Sergio Romero, 15-Nicolas Otamendi, 2-Martin Demichelis, 4-Nicolas Burdisso, 6-Gabriel Heinze, 14-Javier Mascherano, 17-Jonas Gutierrez, 8-Juan Sebastian Veron, 10-Lionel Messi, 9-Gonzalo Higuain, 11-Carlos Tevez         
	Referee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson offers help to the US
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ferguson offers help to the US
            [+uc('George Caulkin   THE TIMES, LONDON')+]                            
	Sir Alex Ferguson is one of a group of leading Premier League managers who have been offering assistance and support to the United States before their opening World Cup finals fixture against England.         
	Bob Bradley, the US head coach, has been a regular visitor to Manchester Uniteds training ground in recent months, when he has watched England stalwarts such as Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand at close quarters.         
	Before Wednesdays friendly against Holland at the Amsterdam ArenA, Bradley cheekily suggested that several of Fergusons peers have privately offered him their backing for when the countries meet in Rustenburg on June 12.         
	I have been in Europe a lot lately and Ive had the chance to catch up with different people, he said. I appreciated those opportunities, whether it was watching training sometimes or communicating about our players.         
	Occasionally, there are some managers in England who subtly let me know they will be rooting for us that day. You can guess that they were not actually born in England. Thats all part of it, I guess.         
	Bradley, who turned 52 Wednesday, refused to confirm whether he was making specific reference to Ferguson, who is a proud Scotsman. Ive said too much, he said, with a laugh, but he has previously admitted to visiting United at different times.         
	Oguchi Onyewu, Clint Dempsey and Charlie Davies are absent because of injury for the US, but Bradley is optimistic that they will be available to face England in South Africa.

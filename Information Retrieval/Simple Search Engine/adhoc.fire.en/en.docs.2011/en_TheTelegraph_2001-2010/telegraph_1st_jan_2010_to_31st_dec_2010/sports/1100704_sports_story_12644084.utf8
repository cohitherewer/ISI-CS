The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor may be the alternative 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Taylor may be the alternative 
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australia captain Mark Taylor could be proposed as an alternate candidate for the ICC vice-presidents post by the cricket boards of Australia and New Zealand after John Howards bid was thwarted by the Afro-Asian bloc.         
	According to a report in an Australian daily, although Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket continue to back Howard, they might propose Taylor by the August 31 deadline set by the ICC.         
	Mark Taylor could be floated as an alternative candidate to John Howard for the ICC vice-presidency at a Cricket Australia board meeting next week, the report stated quoting sources.         
	Howard was rejected by the Afro-Asian members of the ICC Executive Board and though no specific reasons were given for the snub, there is speculation that the former Australian Prime Minister was seen as somebody with too little experience and too much of a political baggage.         
	Although CA is seething in anger over Howards rejection, it does not want the matter to drag too much, the newspaper reported. Taylor, a successful Australian captain who was succeeded by Steve Waugh, is a member of the ICCs cricket committee and CAs board.         
	NZC chief Justin Vaughan said the former Aussie captain is a perfect candidate but the issue would have to be discussed thoroughly before proposing his name. Mark Taylor is an outstanding individual. But I think its too premature to be talking potential candidates at this stage, he said.

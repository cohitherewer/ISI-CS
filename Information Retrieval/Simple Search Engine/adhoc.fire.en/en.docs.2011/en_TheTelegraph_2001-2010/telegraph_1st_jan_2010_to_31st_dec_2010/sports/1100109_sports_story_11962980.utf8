The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cairns welcome to sue IPL: Lalit Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cairns welcome to sue IPL: Lalit Modi
                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner, Lalit Modi, has made it clear that IPL would not reconsider its decision to remove New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns from the auction list.         
	The former New Zealand cricketer has announced that he intends to sue Modi for his comments that Cairns name was removed from the auction list due to the match-fixing taint.         
	He (Cairns) is welcome if he wants to sue us... some people want to sue us all the time. But we know what we are doing, Modi told a TV channel.         
	Cairns, whose name featured in the original list for the January 19 auction, was removed from the list because of the match-fixing slur against his name during his stint with the Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	If they want to sue us now, they can do that. We will produce what we have to produce in the court, Modi said.           (PTI)

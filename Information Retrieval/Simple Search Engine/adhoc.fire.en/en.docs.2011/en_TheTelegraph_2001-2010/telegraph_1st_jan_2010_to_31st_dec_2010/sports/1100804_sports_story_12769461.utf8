  - Icon features in Ranatungas speeches in his parliamentary constituency       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                                 
	Colombo: Sachin Tendulkar, crickets hottest record-getter, features in Arjuna Ranatungas speeches in his parliamentary constituency, Kaluthara, around 30kms from the Sri Lanka capital.         
	Oh, Sachins huge in Sri Lanka... Hes an icon in this country, too... I regularly cite his example when I talk of commitment and the importance of being dedicated, Ranatunga, the 1996 World Cup-winning captain, told The Telegraph.         
	A third-term Member of Parliament, Ranatunga added: My constituents respond to any mention of Sachin... Theyve never seen him in person, but relate to him nevertheless. Id say quite strongly.         
	For his part, speaking exclusively at the Taj Samudra, Sachin (now the most capped Test cricketer) said: I had no idea that a politician in Sri Lanka would be holding me up as an example before his people... Its a nice surprise, yes.         
	Ranatunga, a one-time deputy minister, won the last election as a candidate of former Army chief General Sarath Fonsekas Democratic National Front. He sits in the Opposition.         
	Earlier, Ranatunga had been with President Mahinda Rajapaksas United Peoples Freedom Alliance. First-timer Sanath Jayasuriya, by the way, is on the Treasury bench.         
	Why the switch?         
	Because the President has been shielding the corrupt... The corrupt need to be prosecuted, not protected... As you know, I cant stand corruption... Its because I tried to end corruption in Sri Lanka Cricket that I got removed as its chairman (in December 2008), Ranatunga responded.         
	Definite shades of another World Cup-winning captain who has turned a politician  Imran Khan.         
	Footnote: On Sachin breaking yet another record, Ranatunga quipped: I guess he can keep on playing... His innings wont ever end!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | T20 is not cricket: Nadkarni
                                                                                                                       7                                      T20 is not cricket: Nadkarni
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A very economical yet simple bowler during his playing days, it has been 42 long years that Ramachandra (Bapu) G. Nadkarni has left playing cricket. But the veteran left-arm tweaker showed a different simplicity, in his diction this time, at a ceremony organised by the Central Calcutta Sporting Club on Saturday.         
	Nadkarni, who played 41 Tests for India between 1955 and 1968, picked up 88 wickets at an economy of 1.67. The veteran left-arm spinner, who enjoyed five-day cricket at its pinnacle, said the sport is no more a gentlemans game. He said cricket has lost its prominence and the management of the sport has gained importance at present.         
	Referring to the Indian Premier League (IPL), Nadkarni said: I dont know how many people are interested in running IPL-IV. We need to confirm that first and fix up the number of teams and then think about its future. Some cases are being fought in the court and that doesnt paint a good picture. I dont think cricket is a gentlemans game anymore.         
	The 77-year-old maintained hes not one of those following the T20 bandwagon and felt the shorter format is not cricket. I certainly dislike T20. Its just entertainment and not cricket.         
	He named Don Bradman, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar as legends and said: Legends come after decades and I am fortunate to have seen them during my life time.         
	Among others invited at the programme to donate free beds to Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital was former hockey goalkeeper Mir Ranjan Negi.         
	Negi felt there is something drastically wrong with Indian hockey and the in-fighting is corroding the team spirit.

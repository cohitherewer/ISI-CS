The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt wins on return
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bolt wins on return
                      
	Lausanne: Jamaican triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt overcame a nagging Achilles tendon strain to equal the seasons fastest 100 metres at the Lausanne Athletissima Diamond League on Thursday.         
	The quick-finishing Bolt clocked 9.82 seconds in his first race in six weeks to equal compatriot Asafa Powells season leader.         
	There was definitely pain, said the world record holder who had not raced since straining his left Achilles tendon in late May. But it was not unbearable, it was slight.         
	Bolt easily beat Jamaican club mate Yohan Blake, who clocked his seasons best of 9.96 seconds. Churandy Martina of the Netherland Antilles was third in 10.16 seconds.         
	The sell-out crowd cheered each time Bolts name was announced and roared with approval with his victory.           (REUTERS)

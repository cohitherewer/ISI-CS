The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods woes continue
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods woes continue
                  Tiger Woods, on Monday                     
	Bangkok: Tiger Woods returned to his mothers home country for a four-man skins tournament on Monday and left soon after winning only one hole in another disappointing performance.         
	Colombian golfer Camillo Villegas won the most money at the World Golf Salutes King Bhumibol Skins Tournament, at the Amata Springs Club, in Chonburi province, taking five skins for $109,800. Paul Casey won nine skins for $92,400, and local golfer Thongchai Jaidee claimed three skins for $90,000.         
	Woods earned only $6,600 for his skin and left the country right after the event on his private jet to Melbourne, where he will defend his Australian Masters title starting Thursday.         
	It was Woods first trip to the homeland of his mother, Kultida, in 10 years. She did not accompany him due to health reasons.         
	In a skins tournament, players compete for a reward for each hole, with prize money added to the next hole in case of a tie.         
	The prize money of $900,000 will be donated to a charity foundation associated with Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The event is part of celebrations marking King Bhumibols 60th year on the Thai throne.         
	Woods made a visit early, on Monday morning, to the ailing 82-year-old King Bhumibol, who has been at a Bangkok hospital for more than a year. The golfer did not meet the king but signed a get-well book at the hospital.         
	Woods has not won a tournament this year after stepping away from the game for nearly four months in the wake of an infidelity scandal that hurt his image and led to the break-up of his marriage.         
	Thais adore Woods because of his family connection to the country. But the golfer displayed his American side by shaking hands with Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and ignoring the leaders wai, the traditional Thai greeting of palms pressed together with a head bow that is a sign of humility and respect.         
	Dressed in a grey blazer and black trousers, Woods and Thongchai, Thailands top player, presented Abhisit with a golf club during a brief meeting at his office, the Government House.         
	The golfers handed Abhisit a check for 2.2 million baht ($73,000) from ticket sales they are donating to the victims of recent floods that left more than 100 people dead. Woods then boarded a helicopter for the tournament in Chonburi, a seaside province southeast of Bangkok.         
	Woods arrived in Bangkok on Sunday night after competing in the HSBC Champions in Shanghai. (Agencies)

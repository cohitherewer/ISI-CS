The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Livid Eto says hell quit team
                                                                                                                       7                                        Livid Eto says hell quit team
                  Samuel Eto                     
	Paris: Striker Samuel Eto is so angry at criticism by Cameroon great Roger Milla that he is threatening to walk out on his teammates before the World Cup.         
	Milla, who thrilled world football with some dazzling goals and quirky celebrations in helping Cameroon reach the 1990 World Cup quarter finals, claimed Eto still hasnt brought anything to our national team when meeting reporters Friday.         
	Eto is Cameroons all-time leading scorer and has won the Champions League three times  twice with Barcelona and last week with Inter Milan  and is deeply upset by Millas barb.         
	Is it worth me going to the World Cup? I still have a few days left to think, but I will see if its important for me to participate because I dont need this (criticism) in my career, Eto said late Friday. Its always just before the (major) tournaments that the old geezers wake up. Whats Milla done? He hasnt won the World Cup, they played in the quarter finals.         
	Milla was 38 when he scored four goals in the 1990 World Cup, dancing around the corner flag after each one with a toothy grin in the days when designer goal celebrations were not predictable and commonplace like they are now.         
	Milla also scored in the 1994 World Cup  Cameroons consolation goal after getting thrashed 6-1 by Russia  to become the tournaments oldest ever scorer.         
	Eto said he respects Millas quality as a player, but that he was helped by having better players around him in 1990.         
	They had one of the best teams with great players in every department. Its not because they became famous at 40 that they can start talking, Eto said. You end up asking yourself: are these my people? Are these really my people?         
	Millas 28 goals in 102 games is way below Etos 44 in 94 games for Cameroon, and Eto is also the African Cup of Nations all-time leading scorer.         
	Millas modest club career took him to Monaco, Bastia, Saint-Etienne and Montpellier where he scored regularly but did not have anything remotely like the success Eto has enjoyed.         
	In a prolific spell with Barcelona, Eto scored 108 league goals in 145 games and won the Spanish league title and was also La Ligas top scorer.         
	Eto scored far less goals than he used to for Inter this season, but showed versatility by adapting his game to play in a more defensive, wide role out on the right under coach Jose Mourinho.         
	Inter also won the league title and the Italian Cup, with Eto outstanding in the Champions League.         
	While Eto hopefully cools down in time to lead his countrys attack in South Africa, Cameroon had a lukewarm outing against Slovakia in a friendly in the Austrian town of Klagenfurt on Saturday. The World Cup debutants held Cameroon to a 1-1 draw.         
	Kamil Kopuneks first goal for the national side gave Slovakia the lead in the sixth minute.         
	The Slovaks claimed a second goal early in the second half but the referee ruled that centre-forward Stanislav Sestaks shot had not crossed the goal line.         
	The Lions, missing Eto, put pressure on Slovakia for most of the match but created only few chances.         
	Cameroon equalised with a late strike from midfielder Eyong Enoh who slid the ball home past goalkeeper Dusan Kociak after sloppy defending by Slovakia to score the teams first goal in three matches.         
	Slovakia play another friendly in Bratislava, against Costa Rica next Saturday, before flying to South Africa. Cameroon meet Portugal in a friendly in Covilha on Tuesday.         
	Cameroon are drawn in Group E for the June 11 to July 11 tournament, with the Netherlands, Denmark and Japan, while Slovakia face Italy, New Zealand and Paraguay in Group F.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morgan blasts IFA
                                                                                                                       7                                      Morgan blasts IFA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Trevor James Morgan got a taste of the whimsical manner in which the Calcutta football is run, when the Indian Football Association (IFA), on Saturday afternoon, postponed the big match between the red and gold brigade and Chirag United.         
	The match was scheduled for Monday but Chirag was not keen to play a big match before they leave for Durand Cup. According to the new fixture, East Bengal will play Railway FC on Monday before leaving for Delhi.         
	Its ridiculous. We did not give start to eight regulars just to keep them fresh for the Monday clash, and on Saturday afternoon they postpone the match, Morgan said, sounding very upset.         
	This League is run in a very amateurish way with the itinerary being changed every second day. How do you plan in such a scenario, Morgan asked.         
	Morgan said his team looked cagey in the first half as most of the players were rested. We were miserable in the first half since most of the regulars were not there.         
	Tolgay Ozebe said that he and Robin Singh had discussed about some ways of celebrating goals. After the first goal we enacted rowing and then after I scored my second I asked Robin to do a chest bumping. Every goal we score will be followed by a unique celebration, Togay said.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan take on Eastern Railway at the club ground on Sunday. As per the earlier itinerary, it was Mohun Bagan was to play Mohammedan Sporting. But the IFA rescheduled that clash for November 4. Edeh Chidi, who is nursing a shoulder injury, is doubtful for the match. Chidi, for the record, scored a brace in the last match against Railway FC.         
	Captain Ishfaq Ahmed who is recuperating from a knee injury will sit out once again. It is very frustrating to be out for so long, Ishfaq, who picked up the injury during the Federation Cup, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB mulling legal action against Trott
                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB mulling legal action against Trott
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is considering legal action against English batsman Jonathan Trott for his pre-match altercation with pacer Wahab Riaz, hours before the start of the fourth one-day International at Lords earlier this week.         
	According to sources, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt had discussed with his legal team, the possibility of filing a legal action against Trott for allegedly calling Riaz a match-fixer while the two teams were warming up in the nets.         
	There is a strong possibility that the PCB chairman will file a legal case against Trott as what he did warrants a police case in the United Kingdom, a source in the PCB said.         
	He pointed out that the Pakistan team management had advised Riaz to drop the issue after Trott appeared before the match referee and apologised for his actions. But the source said that with the ECB now threatening to take legal action against Butt for his remarks against English players, the PCB also had to go after Trott.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistani trio who remain suspended for their alleged role in spot-fixing during the recent England tour, have consulted their lawyers to file a detailed reply to the ICC notice sent to them outlining the reasons for their suspensions.

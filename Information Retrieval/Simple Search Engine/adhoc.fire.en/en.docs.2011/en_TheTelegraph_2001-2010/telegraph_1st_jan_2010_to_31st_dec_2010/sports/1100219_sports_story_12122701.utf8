                                                                                                                       7                                      Zaheer is to miss the ODIs
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Zaheer Khan has been ruled out of the three-match ODI series against South Africa, starting from February 21, in Jaipur.         
	Sreesanth, who was initially dropped from the 15-member squad, will be his replacement, according to a media release issued by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan.         
	Zaheer strained his quadriceps while bowling in the second innings against South Africa, here on Wednesday. After being Indias most successful bowler in the first innings (four for 90), Zaheer bowled only six overs in the second innings, giving away 32 runs and was not able to pick up a wicket. He did not take the field on the final day.

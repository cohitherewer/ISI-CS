            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In yet another twist to the sorry state of affairs of Indian hockey, the sports ministry, on Monday, issued showcause notices to Hockey India (HI) and Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on how they propose to meet the governments guidelines to run the sport in the country.         
	In a letter issued to HI president Vidya Stokes and secretary general Narinder Batra, joint secretary in the ministry Injeti Srinivas questioned HIs decision to go ahead with the elections on Thursday as a private body. The ministry asked HI to explain as to why the government should not de-recognise th body in the wake of the federations declaration before Delhi high court that it is a private body, failing which the governments provisional recognition to HI will be withdrawn.         
	Failure to furnish a satisfactory reply will automatically result in withdrawal of recognition to the HI as a National Sports Federation (NSF) in India, the letter said.         
	In the notice to IHF, the ministry gave the KPS Gill-led body 14 days to explain as to how it will meet the FIH as well as governments guidelines.  it has become incumbent upon the sports ministry to seek the co-operation of IHF and others in finding the way out of the present impasse in the management of hockey in India, the ministry said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Be patient, urges Tim

	Melbourne: Australian coach Tim Nielsen has urged the supporters not to jump to conclusions following Australias third successive Test loss, and believes they will prove the doubters wrong during the Ashes.         
	There has been little sympathy for the side following the 2-0 series loss to India and the previous defeat to Pakistan, the first time since 1988 the team has lost three Tests in a row, but Nielsen fired back.         
	The most important thing is not to jump to conclusions.         
	A lot of stuff thats been talked about at the moment is being led by public opinion from outside the group, and a lot of the time public opinion is a long way from the action, Nielsen told the Sydney Morning Herald.         
	They dont necessarily have an insight into how hard the players are working, and how passionate they are about playing for Australia.         
	Nielsen said while England would see potential opportunities to target Nathan Hauritz and their middle order, Australia had plans of their own, especially for under-pressure batsman Kevin Pietersen.         
	It would certainly be nice for us to have some individual wins in the Ashes series, Nielsen said.         
	Wed like to think we can keep Pietersen at bay, break the opening partnerships early, and wont let them take early wickets. A lot more goes into it than just talking about it.         
	If we can have success over Pietersen that would certainly go a way towards opening up their middle order for us, the Australian coach added.           (AGENCIES)

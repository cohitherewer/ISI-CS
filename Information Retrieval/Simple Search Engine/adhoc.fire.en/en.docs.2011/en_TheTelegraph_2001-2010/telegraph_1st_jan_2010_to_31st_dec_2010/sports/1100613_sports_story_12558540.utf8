The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Algerian captain axed from team
                                                                                                                       7                                      Algerian captain axed from team
                      
	Polokwane: Algerias coach Rabah Saadane has dropped his team captain for the opening World Cup clash with Slovenia on Sunday after a build-up marred by poor results, injuries and reports of dressing room discontent.         
	Saadane says captain Yazid Mansouri is not playing well enough to make the side and that Hassan Yebda will take his place in the centre of midfield. Defender Antar Yahia will take the captains armband for the Group C match.         
	For any player, it is always difficult to explain to him, to make him understand hes lost his place due to competition, Saadane said in explaining his decision. We must do it, even if its painful.         
	The North Africans, appearing in the World Cup for the first time in 24 years, have had a poor build-up to the competition including 3-0 loses to both Serbia and the Republic of Ireland in friendlies.         
	This is the first time they have faced Slovenia, whose only previous appearance at the finals, in 2002, ended in three defeats.         
	Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek has to decide whether to field Zlatan Ljubijankic or Zlatko Dedic up front. Dedic scored the goal that secured Slovenias World Cup berth in a 1-0 victory over Russia last year, but Ljubijankic has been in impressive form since then.         
	Whoever gets the nod  and Dedic is favourite  will start alongside Milivoje Novakovic with fellow striker Nejc Pecnik on the bench.         
	Pecnik acknowledged that, with tough matches against England and the United States to come, the Slovenians had to take all three points on Sunday to stand a chance of qualifying for the second round.         
	Asked whether his side could beat England to top the group, Pecnik said: We will cross that bridge when we come to it because the top spot is Englands to lose and we will be happy if we finish as runners-up.         
	On paper at least, Group C should be one of the most evenly balanced. It is the only group in which all four teams figure in the top 30 of the Fifa rankings.         
	While Slovenia have yet to record a World Cup victory, Algeria do at least have some pedigree.         
	The Desert Foxes will forever be remembered for their stunning 2-1 victory over reigning European champions West Germany in their opening match of the 1982 finals.         
	Sundays clash will be refereed by a man who never expected to be here. Guatemalan Carlos Alberto Batres was drafted in as a late replacement for Chilean match official Pablo Pozo Quinteros, who injured himself on the eve of the tournament.         
	Likely teams         
	Slovenia (4-4-2): 1-Samir Handanovic, 2-Miso Brecko 4-Marko Suler, 5-Bostjan Cesar, 13-Bojan Jokic, 10-Valter Birsa, 8-Robert Koren, 18-Aleksandar Radosavljevic, 17-Andraz Kirm, 14-Zlatko Dedic, 11-Milivoje Novakovic.

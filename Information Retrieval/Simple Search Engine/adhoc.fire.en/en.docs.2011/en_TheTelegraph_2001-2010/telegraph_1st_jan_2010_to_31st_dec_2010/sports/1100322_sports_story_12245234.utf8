The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karun aims to finish
                                                                                                                       7                                      Karun aims to finish
                      
	New Delhi: After his Bahrain debut ended inside two laps, Indias lone Formula One driver Karun Chandhok reckons finishing the race in the Australian Grand Prix would be a strong result for his rookie F1 outfit.         
	It took nearly a miracle for Karun and Hispania racing team to overcome huge odds, financial and otherwise, and put the car on the starting grid.         
	A bump on the Sakhir circuit prematurely ended Karuns F1 debut and the Chennai driver now is looking forward to a less roller-coaster outing in the March 28 Australian GP.         
	I am really looking forward to my second F1 race this weekend. I have never driven in Melbourne, but I am a very quick learner, Karun said.         
	Our next step with the teams engineers is to make the car reliable for the race. The secret of good preparation is to complete as many laps as possible on Friday to see where we are with the car, said the Indian.

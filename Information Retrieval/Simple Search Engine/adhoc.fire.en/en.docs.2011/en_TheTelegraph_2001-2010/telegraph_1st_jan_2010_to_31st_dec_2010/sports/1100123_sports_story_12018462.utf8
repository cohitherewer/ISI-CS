	Melbourne: Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard is likely to succeed Sharad Pawar as the International Cricket Council (ICC) president, media reports said Friday.         
	According to the reports, Howard has already been nominated as a candidate for ICCs presidency by Cricket Australia. While Cricket Australia didnt divulge that Howard was their candidate, a CA spokesman, however, said that it has a preferred candidate.         
	We do have a preferred candidate. He is very dedicated to cricket and willing for his name to go forward, the spokesman said.         
	Howard, who has been a regular follower of Australian cricket, too, chose to keep mum and refused to comment. He does not want to say anything about the rumours, a spokesman for the former Prime Minister said.         
	It maybe noted that Jack Clarke, the CA chairman, is also keen to be the next vice-president of the ICC.         
	Indias Pawar, the current No. 2, will succeed David Morgan of England next June. Jagmohan Dalmiya had been the first Indian  Asian, in fact  to hold the No.1 position in the ICC.         
	As per the governing bodys rule, Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket will propose an Australasian candidate for the leadership of the ICC from 2012 next month.         
	Following which, the candidate will serve as ICC vice-president from the middle of this year. He will, then, eventually head the world body for a two-year period, from 2012-13, once Pawars term gets over.         
	Howard, who often describes himself as a cricket tragic, also ran for a senior position with Australias National Rugby League in October last year.         
	He served as the Prime Minister of Australia from March 1996 to December 2007 and had the second-longest tenure in the office after Sir Robert Menzies.           (AGENCIES)

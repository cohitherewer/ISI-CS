	Madrid: Champions Barcelona will sit top of the Spanish first division for the Christmas break after notching a tenth successive league victory with a resounding 5-1 win over city rivals Espanyol at the Cornella-El Prat stadium.         
	Spanish World Cup winners Pedro Rodriguez and David Villa grabbed two goals apiece with compatriot Xavi Hernandez, one of three players shortlisted for the Ballon DOr crown, netting the other as Barcelona triumphed in the Catalan derby, and opened up a five-point lead over second-placed Real Madrid Saturday.         
	Barcelona signed off 2010 in the perfect fashion, ending Espanyols 100 per cent home record emphatically with a 5-1 thrashing and putting pressure on Real to win their game-in-hand against Sevilla at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.         
	Real have won all seven of their home matches in the league while Sevillas confidence is rock bottom after four successive league defeats.         
	Espanyol had a perfect seven wins and were flying high in fourth, however, Barcelona turned in a mesmerising display making it a remarkable 26 goals in their last five league matches with a drubbing of their local rivals to maintain their flawless away record with an eighth win.         
	My team never cease to surprise me, purred Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.         
	Espanyol had only conceded two goals at home in the league before this match and it isnt a coincidence that they are up near the top of the table. It is a great night for us because not only did we beat our local rival, but we also beat a very good team.         
	In other matches, Valencia took advantage of Espanyols defeat coming from behind to win 2-1 at promoted Real Sociedad on Saturday.         
	Argentine midfielder Tino Costa scored a terrific equaliser before Aritz Aduriz grabbed a stoppage time winner as Valencia moved above Espanyol into fourth. Earlier, Villarreal maintained their impressive unbeaten home record with a 3-1 win over Real Mallorca at El Madrigal to secure third place for the festive break.         
	Elsewhere struggling Sporting Gijon salvaged a point with Diego Castro scoring an 89th minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Deportivo la Coruna.

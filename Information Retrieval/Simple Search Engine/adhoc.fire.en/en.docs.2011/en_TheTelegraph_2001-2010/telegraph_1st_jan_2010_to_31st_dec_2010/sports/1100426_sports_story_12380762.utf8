	Sydney: Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin has blamed Australias first-round exit at the 2009 World Twenty20 on the Ashes and says things will be different in the West Indies.         
	Michael Clarkes side are unseeded in the 12-team tournament which starts on April 30 with the final in Barbados on May 16. This time around with Australia, were actually respecting the game of Twenty20 a lot more, Haddin was quoted by an Australian newspaper on Friday, before catching a flight to the West Indies.         
	Last time we went to the World Cup, there was a lot of focus when we went over there on the Ashes and preparation for that. But this time were going to the West Indies with our sole focus being the World Twenty20. And the way it is at the moment, its taking over the world, so youve got to show the game the respect that it deserves.         
	Australia play warm-up games in St Lucia against Zimbabwe on April 27 and against Windward Islands on April 29. Australias opponents in Group A are world champions Pakistan on May 2 in St Lucia and Bangladesh in Barbados on May 5.         
	Haddin says his New South Wales teammate Brett Lee, who is recovering from a fractured thumb, will be given every chance to prove himself in the warm-up matches. However, Lee, 33, may struggle to get a game behind the pace trio of Shaun Tait, Dirk Nannes and Mitchell Johnson.         
	West Indies great Sir Garfield Sobers says Australia will be title threats.         
	Meanwhile, captain Clarke has said he is ready to take his batting up a notch. The event is Clarkes first major tournament in charge of the national team following Ricky Pontings decision to retire from T20.

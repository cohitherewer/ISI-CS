The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winning start for Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Winning start for Pakistan
                      
	St Lucia: Openers Salman Butt and Kamran Akmal cracked 73 each to guide defending champions Pakistan to a 21-run victory over Bangladesh in their opening Group A match of the World Twenty20 here on Saturday.         
	Butt (73 off 46) and Akmal (73 off 55) shared a breezy 141-run opening stand to help Pakistan pile up a competitive 172 for three after captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and elected to bat in the slow Beausejour Stadium wicket here.         
	In reply, Bangladesh lost two early wickets but Mohammed Ashraful (65 off 49) and captain Shakib-al Hasan (47 off 31) kept them in the hunt with a quickfire 63-ball 91-run third wicket partnership.           (PTI)

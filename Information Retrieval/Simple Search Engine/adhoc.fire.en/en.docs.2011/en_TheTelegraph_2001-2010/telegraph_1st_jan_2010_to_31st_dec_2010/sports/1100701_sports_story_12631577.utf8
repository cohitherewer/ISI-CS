The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | President suspends the Super Eagles
                                                                                                                       7                                      President suspends the Super Eagles
                      
	Abuja: The President of Nigeria suspended the national football team from international competition for two years after their poor showing at the World Cup, his spokesman said Wednesday.         
	The announcement by President Goodluck Jonathans spokesman also followed corruption allegations which surrounded the team in the run-up to the competition. Spokesman Ima Niboro said all funds directed towards the Nigeria Football Federation would be examined and all those found wanting will be sanctioned.         
	Niboro gave no other specifics about the investigation into the team, other than saying Jonathans decision came after reading a report submitted by the presidential football task force. Federation spokesman Ademola Olajire said that he had no information about the suspension.         
	We have not been directed, Olajire said. We have no letter from the president.         
	The Nigerian Football Federations executive committee had earlier tendered an apology to the government and all football loving Nigerians for the early exit.         
	Nigeria left the World Cup competition with just one point, which they earned in a 2-2 draw with South Korea in their last game. Nigeria lost to Argentina 1-0 in their Group B opener and fell to Greece 2-1 in a game turned by the first-half expulsion of midfielder Sani Kaita.         
	The team, nicknamed the Super Eagles by loyal supporters and the Super Chickens by dissenters, faced almost countrywide derision after finishing in the African Cup of Nations earlier in the year.         
	Nigeria fired coach Shaibu Amodu in February and later hired Swedish coach Lars Lagerback to take charge with only about four months before the World Cup.         
	But local newspapers questioned Lagerbacks selection and made allegations about endemic bribery in the program. The football federation also had to pay a reported $125,000 contract to cancel its reservations at the Hampshire Hotel north of Durban in South Africa. Nigerian officials apparently complained the three-star hotel was noisy, mosquito-infested and unsafe. Analysts and watchdog groups consider Nigeria, an oil-rich country of 150 million people, as having one of the worlds most corrupt governments.         
	The Super Eagles havent won a World Cup match since 1998. The Nigerians went out with two losses and a draw in 2002 and did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup.         
	Nigeria now risks being banned by Fifa from all international football because of the political interference. At the time of writing, we have no official information on this matter, Fifa said in a statement. However, in general, Fifas position regarding political interference in football is well known.         
	Nigerias next scheduled international match is a qualifier for the 2012 African Cup of Nations, at home to Madagascar in early September.         
	Fifa statutes demand that national federations manage their affairs independently, or face suspension from world football. National and club teams, plus referees, would be barred from participating in international matches and football officials are prevented from attending meetings.         
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter had already expressed concern over the French governments investigation into Frances first-round exit from the World Cup.         
	Definitely I can tell you that political interference will be dealt with by Fifa notwithstanding what kind of interference and what is the size of the country, Blatter said Tuesday.         
	Its the right decision ... President Jonathan has made a bold step to clean up the rot. We need to move the country in football, John Fashanu, a former England footballer partly of Nigerian descent, told a local radio station.         
	We cannot be held to ransom by anybody.         
	Some Super Eagles fans were shocked by the decision.         
	Sounds to me like the President is trying to score cheap political points... The next major international competition is two years away anyway, said one irate fan in Lagos, asking not to be named.

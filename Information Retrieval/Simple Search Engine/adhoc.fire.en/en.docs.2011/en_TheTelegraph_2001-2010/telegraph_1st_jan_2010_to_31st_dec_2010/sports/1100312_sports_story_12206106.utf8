The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United sweep past AC Milan
                                                                                                                       7                                        United sweep past AC Milan

	London: Wayne Rooney scored twice again as Manchester United cruised into the quarter finals of the Champions League after a 4-0 win over a feeble AC Milan sent them through 7-2 on aggregate on Wednesday.         
	Rooney, who scored twice in the 3-2 San Siro win, was on target with a 13th-minute header that broke the hearts of the seven-time winners.         
	He added his second at the start of the second half and in a virtual exhibition match, Park Ji-sung after an hour and a late Darren Fletcher header completed the crushing victory. We got the break with the early goal in the second half and after that we played very well. When we play at that tempo we are difficult to play against. With the team Ive got it doesnt matter who we play next, said United manager Alex Ferguson.         
	Milan, without injured centre back Alessandro Nesta, striker Alexandre Pato and midfielder Luca Antonini looked off the pace from the start but few could have predicted their total capitulation.         
	Rooney shot wide after three minutes and even fullback Gary Neville was allowed to let fly just over the bar with his left foot soon after.         
	Milan should have scored from their first real attack though as an Andrea Pirlo free kick reached Ronaldinho but the Brazilians header went just wide after eight minutes.         
	The introduction of David Beckham as a 65th-minute replacement for Ignazio Abate raised the biggest cheer of the night as the midfielder, who left United for Real Madrid in 2003, was given a standing ovation and even tested Edwin van der Sar with a sharp shot.         
	With not much of a contest to keep them occupied Uniteds fans spent most of the last 20 minutes chanting anti-Glazer songs and displaying their green and gold protest scarves against the American owners of the club  Beckham left the pitch wearing one at fulltime. They were brought back to the action two minutes from time when Fletcher stretched well at the far post to head home the fourth goal and complete Milans humiliation.         
	In Madrid, big-spending Real Madrid failed to qualify for the quarter finals for the sixth straight season when Olympique Lyon dumped the Spaniards out 2-1 on aggregate.         
	Reals dream of winning a 10th European title at their Bernabeu Stadium in May was shattered by Miralem Pjanics 75th-minute strike, which secured a 1-1 draw for visiting Lyon in the last 16 second leg after Cristiano Ronaldos goal in the sixth minute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brasa shows lighter side
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brasa shows lighter side
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jose Brasa in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: For the past few months, the Jose Brasa-coached Indian hockey team has been under great strain. Still the Spaniards wit has remained intact.         
	After being ordered by the authorities, last month, not to speak to the media, the Spanish coach met up with newspersons on Friday, and brought to life a briefing, which would have, otherwise, remained dull and mundane.         
	The Spanish coach was, quite often, sarcastic and hit the nail on the head without even using a hammer.         
	Brasa, though, did not joke all the while. When it came to Indias chances at the World Cup, beginning Sunday, he sounded fiercely protective of his players and used every opportunity to show the brighter side of his team.         
	Ladies and gentlemen, I am here finally, was Brasas first line. It was dramatic, all right, but it also helped to liven up the mood in the run up to a World Cup that has been characterised by off-field reports, most, if not all, of which have been negative.         
	It is like a honeymoon, I am really happy about it, he said with a broad grin while settling down in his chair.         
	Asked whether he was aware that a poor result in the World Cup could cost his job, Brasa laughed and said: After a few months in India, I have come to realise that I can lose my job any time, World Cup or no World Cup.         
	The atmosphere, for the moment, he said was absolutely normal.         
	Things are moving in normal fashion. I am learning a lot from a country that knows hockey very well, said Brasa with a faint smile on his face.         
	When it came to making predictions, Brasa remained guarded: We have to fight a lot. I cannot say where we will finish because that would be like trying to know the future.         
	It wasnt easy, he said. There were a lot of problems. It was difficult to make the players concentrate on the game.         
	Thankfully, we have managed to overcome those.         
	Our main aim would be to reach the semi-finals, but thats the toughest part of the job. We are in a strong pool but we will try our best to surprise everyone, he said.         
	Brasa made it clear that he would treat the opening tie against Pakistan as a normal one.         
	Thats a normal game for us, nothing else. In the last match against Pakistan, we lost because our players were too excited. We tried to play too much of an attacking game. I hope that wont happen again.         
	I wont mind losing the Pakistan match if we win the Cup in the end, Brasa commented.         
	Acknowledging that ability with penalty corners would be key to winning games, Brasa said his side was not lacking in that aspect of the game.         
	In Sandeep Singh we have one of the best drag-flickers. Then we have Diwakar Ram and Dhananjay Mahadik. So we have three drag-flickers. We are also working on indirect methods of taking penalty corners and many variations, he said.

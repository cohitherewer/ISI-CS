	Calcutta: Trainer Daniel Davids filly, Burst Of Speed, defied the handicapper in the 1,600m Red Chief Cup, which she won the way she liked on Wednesday.

	The 1,100m Adolfito Handicap, on the other hand, turned out to be a close contest between the Arti Doctor-trained Asiatic Star and Shafiq Khans Palme Dor. The former, ridden by P. Kamlesh, just about managed to score. The Crystal Man Cup was an easy pick for Bharath Singhs Awesome Indian.

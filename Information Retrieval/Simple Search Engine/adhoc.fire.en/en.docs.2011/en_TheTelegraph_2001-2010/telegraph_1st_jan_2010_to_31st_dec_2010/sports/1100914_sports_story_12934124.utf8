                                                                                                                       7                                        Singles a test for Bopanna, feels Mahesh 
    - Davis cup 
  -  We are ready for the Brazilian challenge: somdev Dev Varman             OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rohan Bopanna during a practice session, in Chennai, on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: Doubles ace Mahesh Bhupathi, on Monday, said the fast improving Rohan Bopanna had come of age as a doubles player but would face a tough task to cope with the burden of doubling up as a singles player in Davis Cup ties.         
	Its going to be tough for him, especially with Davis Cup rubbers being of five sets. He has not played singles for a while, Bhupathi, just returned from the US Open, said here.         
	But he has a big game with a big serve, so the points wont be that long. So hopefully he can pull through, he added.         
	The Bangalorean, believes that Bopanna and Aisam-ul- Haq Qureshi had come of age as a doubles pair.         
	I have always said that Rohan had the potential. He has been playing well this summer, and its good to see him translate potential to success, he said.         
	The most important thing is that they (Bopanna and Qureshi) reached their first final (at the US Open). They now believe they can do it, they have made the transition. Its a matter of staying injury free and maintaining it.         
	India would be taking on Brazil in a World Group play-off in Chennai from September 17 to 19. The visitors would be lead by world No. 28 Thomaz Bellucci and include 81st-ranked Ricardo Mello as the second singles player.         
	Bruno Soares and Marcelo Melo, with doubles rankings of 37 and 38 respectively, would pose a tough challenge to Bhupathi and Leander Paes. Bhupathi said although Brazil were the favourites, the hosts had an edge.         
	They are a better team, there cant be any doubt about it. But we are playing at home and will have big crowd cheering for us. The conditions, the heat, will also work in favour of us, the 36-year-old said.                 Bhupathi    
	On a diferent note, Bhupathi criticised the athletes who were apprehensive of participating in the Commonwealth Games in Delhi next month citing a various reasons.         
	People looking to pull out will give ridiculous excuses. They would want to brush teeth with mineral water nowhere in the world you get mineral water to brush teeth, Bhupathi said.         
	Such things are uncalled for and only come from those who have not visited India. Its not fair. We as tennis players have been to places like Uzbekistan and struggled.         
	The most important thing is you are getting to play for your country and you have to put your best foot forward.         
	Bhupathi and his fellow tennis players themselves were in the eye of the storm a few weeks ago when they allegedly threatened to pull out of the Games if the All India Tennis Association (AITA) did not clear their dues from the government.         
	They withdrew the threat after the Centre intervened and promised to pay the dues. The government subsequently announced last week that Rs. 1 crore has been disbursed to the AITA towards the elite players money.         
	I heard about it. I will be heading for Chennai to play in the Davis Cup. The government had assured us that everything would be taken care of, I hope it has been done, he said.         
	India might miss the services of Bhupathi and Paes during the 16th Asian Games, although for a different reason.         
	 The duo have a good chance of qualifying for the year-end ATP Tour finals which clashes with the multi-disciplinary event to be held in Guangzhou, China, from November 12 to 27.         
	Lets take one step at a time. We have the Commonwealth Games first, he said.

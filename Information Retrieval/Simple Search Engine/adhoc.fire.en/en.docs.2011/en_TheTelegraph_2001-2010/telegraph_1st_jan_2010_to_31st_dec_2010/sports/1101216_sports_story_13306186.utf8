	Calcutta: Three players  Sayantan Das, Chandrasish Majumdar and S Prasannaa  emerged as joint leaders with six points apiece after the sixth round of 22nd The Telegraph Schools Chess meet on Wednesday. With five more rounds remaining, some fierce battles, for the top slot, are on the cards, in the next few days.         
	The 11-round Swiss meet is being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chyawanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club.         
	Top seed and defending champion Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School overcame a cramped position in the opening, with the black pieces, against Aubhropratim Manna of Don Bosco, Park Circus, to penetrate his opponents defenses decisively in the endgame.         
	On the second board, Prince Bajaj of Delhi Public School Ghaziabad was held to a draw by NR Vignesh of Maharshi Vidya Mandir of Tamil Nadu in a queen and pawn versus Queen and pawn ending.         
	With both players having less than five minutes on the clock, a nervous Vignesh claimed a draw but his claim was turned down by the arbiter on technical grounds.         
	Vignesh, however, held his own in the remaining few seconds, and salvaged a draw.         
	Chandrasish Majumdar of St Xaviers Collegiate School won a pawn in the French Defence against Kaustav Kundu of South Point and kept up the pressure on his opponent, who succumbed after 40 moves.         
	S. Prasannaa of Velammal Matriculation H.S School made short work of Sayan Majumder of Indira Gandhi Memorial H.S School in a Scotch game. Sayan could not defend against the combined onslaught of Prasannaas attack on the kingside and threw in the towel after 34 moves.         
	Former Asian under-8 champion Mitrabha Guha of South Point, went down tamely against Ardhya Sekhar Bagchi of Calcutta Boys School as he lost a piece in the middlegame after which it was all over for the nine-year-old.         
	The other former Asian under-8 girls champion, Khushi Dharewa, too, went down, though after tough resistance, against Ved Prakash in a rook versus bishop and two pawn ending.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods ends tied fourth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods ends tied fourth
                      
	Pebble Beach: Northern Irelands Graeme McDowell won the US Open, holding steady as Pebble Beach buffeted a bevy of golfs big names to claim his first major championship.         
	McDowell became the first European since Englands Tony Jacklin in 1970 to lift the trophy  and he beat another European  unheralded Frenchman Gregory Havret  by one shot. McDowell carded a three-over par 74 to claim the title Sunday with an even par total of 284. Havret posted a one-over 72 for 285.         
	South Africas Ernie Els finished third with a 73 for 286. Woods and Masters champion Phil Mickelson shared fourth place on 287. To play steady and to withstand some tough holes the way Graeme did and to come out on top, he played some great golf, said Mickelson, who missed out on a chance to seize the world No. 1 ranking from Woods.         
	No one was hit harder than overnight leder Dustin Johnson. His three-shot lead evaporated with a triple-bogey seven at the second hole.         
	That was followed by a double bogey and a bogey as he collapsed to an 82 that left him tied for eighth.         
	Havret, playing in his first US open, kept his poise admirably. But McDowell clung to a one-stroke lead over the last four holes and Havret couldnt find a birdie that he needed at the last.

	Port of Spain: South Africa paceman Morne Morkel ripped through the West Indian top order with three quick wickets before the hosts steadied the ship to reach 65 for three at lunch on the third day of the first Test.         
	Replying to South Africas 352 allout, West Indies lost Chris Gayle (6), Travis Dowlin (4) and Brendan Nash (1) to be 12 for three before the Guyanese pair Narsingh Deonarine and his mentor Shivnarine Chanderpaul batted through to the first interval.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian GP on Oct. 30 next year
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indian GP on Oct. 30 next year
                                
	Paris: Formula One will stretch to a record 20 races next year with India making its Grand Prix debut in late October although no new teams will be coming in, the sports governing body said on Wednesday.         
	The Indian round, at a circuit being built near New Delhi, is due to be the 18th of the championship on October 30 subject to the facility passing a final inspection by the International Automobile Federation (FIA).         
	The governing body said in a statement after a meeting of its world motor sport council that the 2011 season will start in Bahrain on March 13 and end in Brazil on November 27 with Abu Dhabi becoming the penultimate race on November 13.         
	The current season has a record-equalling 19 races, with South Korea the 2010 newcomers.         
	However, the slim hopes of the starting grid being expanded to a full capacity of 13 teams, assuming all of the existing ones remain, were snuffed out.         
	The FIA said a number of parties had expressed an interest but it was considered that none of the candidates met the requirements to be granted an entry into the championship. Consequently, the allocation of the 13th team will not be granted.         
	Many of the expected main contenders had already withdrawn for financial reasons but Spanish-based Epsilon Euzkadi and a joint effort involving Italys Durango and Canadas former world champion Jacques Villeneuve had remained in the running.         
	A 20 race calendar has long been a desire of the sports commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone but has met resistance from teams in the past due to the extra burden imposed on mechanics and travelling employees.         
	Cost cutting measures have further reduced the number of staff attending races, while some test teams have been disbanded due to the ban on testing during the season.         
	The world motor sport council also announced steps to enable the governing body to punish Formula One drivers and other competitors in FIA series who commit motoring offences on public roads.         
	McLarens 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton was fined A$500 ($458.7) after being stopped by police for reckless driving in a Melbourne street at this years Australian Grand Prix.         
	Competitors at FIA events must act as ambassadors for the sport, be aware their conduct on the road must be exemplary and respect road safety rules, declared the FIA statement.         
	It said the international sporting code would be amended to enable the governing body to withdraw a drivers international super licence in the most serious cases.         
	Also in the meeting, FIA decided not to impose any further sanction on Ferrari for breaking rules on team orders at the German Grand Prix, the head of Italys motorsports federation said.         
	Angelo Sticchi Damiani said FIAs World Motor Sport Council only upheld the $100,000 fine that was imposed on July 25 at Hockenheim when Ferrari driver Felipe Massa let teammate Fernando Alonso overtake him to win the race.         
	The council could have stripped Massa of the victory or docked the team points or imposed a further fine.         
	Speaking to reporters after the three-hour hearing, Sticchi Damiani said the council proposed that the rule banning team orders should be eliminated.         
	Massa led for 49 of 67 laps in Germany before allowing Alonso to pass him following Ferrari radio messages.         
	Had Alonso been stripped of the race victory, he would have fallen 66 points behind current leader Lewis Hamilton in the drivers standings.         
	But with six races left in the season, including Sundays Italian Grand Prix in Monza, Alonso remains 41 points behind Hamilton  who leads with 182 points.         
	Ferrari boss Stefano Domenicali and team lawyers attended the Paris hearing.         
	Domenicali has maintained Ferrari didnt give explicit orders to Massa at the German race, although the Brazilian driver received a message from race engineer Rob Smedley saying Alonso was faster than him.         
	The radio message was seen as a clear order to let his teammate pass him, but Massa said after the race it was his decision to slow down.         
	In my opinion this was not a case of team orders: my engineer kept me constantly informed on what was going on behind me, especially when I was struggling a bit on the hard tires, Massa said.

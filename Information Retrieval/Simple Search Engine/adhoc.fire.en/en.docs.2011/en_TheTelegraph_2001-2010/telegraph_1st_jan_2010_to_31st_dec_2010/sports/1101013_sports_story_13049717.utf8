The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wary boxers aim for gold
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wary boxers aim for gold
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Standing on the brink of history, the chief boxing coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu is a highly cautious man. On Wednesday, three Indians would figure in the finals for the first time in Commonwealth Games, but the defeat of Vijender Singh under controversial circumstances has left the entire Indian team jittery.         
	So bitter is the experience of the home team, on negative points awarded to Englands Anthony Ogogo against Vijender on Monday night, that Sandhu has instructed all three finalists  Suranjoy Singh (52kg), Manoj Kumar (64kg) and Paramjeet Samota (+91kg)  not to take any risk and go for as many points as possible from the beginning.         
	The position is such that we may consider ourselves 0-2 points down before every bout, said the veteran coach. My clear message for the boxers would be to play with aggression and take as many points as possible.         
	The Indian contingent is somewhat convinced that quite a few boxers of the home team were victims of poor scoring.         
	At least three more of our boxers should have been in the final. It is very disappointing that Vijender, Amandeep (Singh) and Dinesh (Kumar) did not reach the title round. Even the scoring against Jai Bhagwan was surprising, said one of the officials.         
	The story that is making the rounds in the boxing circle is, that the technical officials who have come from other countries are unhappy with the Organising Committee (OC) for not treating them properly during the Games. A few Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) officials are believed to have pleaded with the OC for better facilities for the technical delegates.         
	In the 52kg final, Suranjoy, considered the most popular pugilist with the crowd after Vijender, is pitted against Benson Njangiru of Kenya and is the hot favourite to win the gold medal. A winner of the Presidents Cup and Asian championships, the Manipuri is perhaps the most talented boxer after Akhil Kumar and Vijender Singh.         
	In the light-welterweight final, Manoj Kumar will fight Englishman Bradley Saunders, a bronze medallist in the 2007 World championships. The English boxers have remained successful in the current meet as five of them have made the final.         
	Paramjeet Samota will figure in the +91kg final against Abdul Haq Tariq of Trinidad. Samota is the gold winner in the Commonwealth championships, and is expected to win the top spot.         
	So far India have won only two gold medals through Ali Qamar (2002) and Akhil Kumar (2006) in the Commonwealth Games. Wednesday could be a historic day for Indian boxing.

	Calcutta: Sania Mirzas first round exit from the Pattaya Open last week severely affected her singles ranking as she slipped 18 spots, to 77, in the latest Womens Tennis Association ranking chart released Monday. She also lost three spots, to be 36, in doubles.         
	In the Association of Tennis Professional chart, Somdev Dev Varmans ranking remained unchanged at 141 in singles while Leander Paes (7) and Mahesh Bhupathi (8) were also static in doubles.

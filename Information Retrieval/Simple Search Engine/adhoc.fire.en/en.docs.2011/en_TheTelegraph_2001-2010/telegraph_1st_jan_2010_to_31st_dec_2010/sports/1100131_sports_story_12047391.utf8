  - World No.1 ups the ante in final set to win in 2 hours and 7 minutes; Bryans retain doubles title             Serena Williams with the Australian Open trophy, in Melbourne, on Saturday. (Reuters)                           
	Melbourne: Serena Williams defeated Belgiums Justine Henin 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 on Saturday to win the Australian Open for the fifth time after a match of unrelenting tension between the two best players of their generation.         
	The American weathered the storm, after Henin sent the match into a deciding third set, to wrap up victory after two hours and seven minutes and retain the title she won last year.         
	Both players were suffering from nerves at the start, then battling exhaustion at the end, but still managed to provide the packed Melbourne Park centre court crowd with some exquisite shotmaking and intense drama in their first Grand Slam final meeting.         
	It was a great final and it could have gone either way, Serena said, after receiving the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup from Margaret Court, who has won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles.         
	Serena, wearing a citrus-coloured outfit, thumped down 12 aces and 32 winners while Henin provided a reminder of the form that earned her seven Grand Slam titles, including the 2004 Australian Open, with 28 winners of her own.         
	Despite the loss, it was a triumph of sorts for Henin, who only returned to the professional circuit this month after quitting the game in May 2008.         
	The 27-year-old needed an invitation to get into the tournament because she does not have an official ranking yet, but rode a wave of emotion and support to become only the second wild card to make a Grand Slam final.         
	Henins compatriot Kim Clijsters won last years US Open after making her own fairytale comeback, beating Serena in the semi-finals.         
	Its been a very emotional couple of weeks for me, Henin said.         
	Id like to congratulate Serena, shes a real champion. I thought it would never happen again and, finally, I could really come back on the court and enjoy the tournament.         
	Wearing an aqua-blue shirt and traditional white skirt, Henin looked in danger of being overpowered by the world No.1 when Serena won the opening set in 51 minutes.         
	However, the Belgian reeled off four games in a row to snatch the second set as the American started showing signs of fatigue.         
	Serena had also played in womens doubles, which she won with her sister Venus, and was wearing bandages on both legs but just when it seemed she was fading, she regained her composure as Henin started to wilt.         
	The American won the last four games on the trot, then sealed her win with a backhand deep into the court that Henin was unable to retrieve.         
	I thought I just gotta man up, this is my chance, no matter what, Ive got one more set and I just gotta get through it and I did, Serena said after the match.         
	I thought I was just giving it to her at that point... I literally said to myself I need to man up and keep playing better.         
	The win gave Serena her 12th Grand Slam singles title. She joined compatriot Billie Jean King, who was watching from the stands, in equal sixth place on the list of female Grand Slam singles champions.         
	Serena also became the first woman to win five Australian Open titles since the game turned professional in 1968, and the first to successfully defend her title since Jennifer Capriati won in 2001 and 2002.         
	Serena almost missed the championship after landing in hot water following her foul-mouthed attack on a lineswoman during her loss to Clijsters at last years US Open.         
	She escaped a suspension after the Grand Slam Committee opted to fine her, but remains on a two-year probation.         
	Meanwhile, American twins Bob and Mike Bryan won their fourth Australian Open mens doubles title, beating Daniel Nestor of Canada and Serbian Nenad Zimonjic 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3 on Saturday.         
	The top-seeded Bryans faced two break points in the ninth game before winning the opening set when Zimonjic hit a backhand long.         
	Zimonjic and Nestor were down 5-2 in the tiebreaker before winning five straight points to take the second set.         
	In the decider, the Bryans got a service break in the fourth game, went up 4-1 and celebrated their win with a brotherly hug at the net.         
	The US pair have now won the title here four of the past five years and were losing finalists the two previous years. They have eight Grand Slam mens doubles titles.         
	As if it wasnt confusing enough to tell the identical Bryan brothers apart, this time all four players on court were wearing red shirts and white shorts.         
	Nestor and Zimonjic took over the No. 1 doubles ranking from the Bryans in 2008, the only year of the past five the Americans have not ended as the top-ranked pair.         
	Nestor and Zimonjic have an 8-4 record against the Bryans, including last years Wimbledon final. The Bryans regained the No. 1 ranking at the end of last year.           (AGENCIES)

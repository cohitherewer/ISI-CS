            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) continued to suffer legal embarrassment when the Bombay High Court (BHC) on Wednesday rejected its appeal to lift the stay order on the termination of Kings XI Punjabs IPL franchise rights.         
	A two-judge division bench of the BHC upheld the interim order passed by its appellate judge on December 8, saying that the basis for terminating the franchise, owned by KPH Dream Cricket Pvt. Ltd., was erroneous and flawed.         
	It is abundantly clear that the BCCI wanted to terminate the contract on the basis of what was factually incorrect. Termination was anything but fair and was wholly arbitrary, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Anoop Mohata said while dismissing the appeal.         
	The judges, however, retained the conditions imposed on the franchise by the single-judge bench while granting the interim relief.         
	As per the conditions, Kings XI would have to furnish a bank guarantee of $18 million for players fee and $3.5 million as security money to the BCCI towards notional loss in case the final verdict in the case upheld the termination.

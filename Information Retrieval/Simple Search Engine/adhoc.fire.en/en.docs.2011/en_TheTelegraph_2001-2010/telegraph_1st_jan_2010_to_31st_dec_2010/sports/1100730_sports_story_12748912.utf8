                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin: Raina showed tremendous character
            A CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar after his double century, on Thursday                           
	Sachin Tendulkar was all praise for Suresh Rainas maiden Test century on Thursday. At the press conference, he also spoke about the physical challenge of batting for 516 minutes after having fielded for more than five sessions.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Which innings was more important in the context of the match, yours or Rainas?         
	Both our innings were important, especially when youre chasing a total of 600-plus its equally important to build partnerships as well as occupy the crease as long as you can. And we could achieve both the targets. Now, we are in a good position since we occupied the crease and scored as well. All in all, it was an important knock for Raina as well...         
	Message to Raina         
	I told him, I know you are under a bit of pressure, you are feeling a bit nervous, but this moment will never ever come again in your life... Its natural to be nervous, everyone goes through it... But just enjoy whatever comes your way. Everyone will always remember this knock of yours irrespective of your future achievements.         
	Rainas innings         
	Raina showed tremendous character and produced a terrific all-round game... He was solid in defence, played magnificent shots... He came in to bat at a tricky time (241 for four), but went on to produce a remarkable innings... A special one... The way he batted was fantastic. It didnt appear that he was playing his first Test. Having played 98 ODIs also helped Cant ask for anything more.         
	If he was happy with Rainas performance         
	Im very pleased... Many guys doubted whether Raina would be a good Test player, but he proved he is... Id asked him to enjoy himself... Told him (this morning) that a hundred on Test debut would always remain special... This will always be the highlight of your career. You will have many more hundreds, you will achieve many more things in life, but this will always be something special... Im very happy for him         
	Batting with a debutant         
	Its important to make them feel comfortable, and understand their mindset. The fact that Raina played 98 ODIs before his Test debut helped a lot. I had played with him, so I knew exactly what to expect of him. So its equally important for me to understand the debutants mindset... If the same player has played with you for some time, it helps. Those things helped Raina... He has played against Sri Lanka for quite some time, he knows the bowling attack He might be a debutant but the interaction is more or less the same when batting with say a Dravid or a Laxman         
	Guiding Raina during the partnership         
	A big partnership was needed at that stage So one had to be more careful and 100 per cent sure of what one was getting into. Before you decided to play a big shot, one had to be 100 per cent confident, and he has got tremendous confidence. I just allowed him to play his game. He has the ability to play big shots, and he was cleverly selecting them. So I didnt interfere much. Whenever I felt that a particular adjustment was required, I told him, but I just let him be...         
	Getting to his fifth double century         
	Im enjoying... I dont count the number of runs that Im scoring. Its nice to be scoring runs. I have enjoyed as much being in the middle as it has been in the past. Its fantastic.         
	If the triple century was on his mind         
	Ive always gone out and played People look at records, not me. I would want to score as many runs as possible. Whenever it comes, it comes... It is never too late. I will keep trying, but that is not the end of the world to me. There are many more things to cricket and that is where the focus is Its not on records. If it has to come, it will come.         
	If theres been any change in his style         
	With age, your thought process changes... Youre more experienced and have had more exposure... You know more about the game, but the process of learning never stops. I dont count the runs, Im just enjoying myself.         
	The conditions         
	Its been challenging... Of course the conditions are tough. Yesterday (Wednesday) when I got into the dressing room, I had a long ice bath. I was in the ice tub for a while... Then I did some stretching, had an early dinner and was in bed by 8.30... Just relaxed as much as possible. Because I went off to bed early, was up early morning, sort of relaxed a bit... When you are off the field, time flies in between. But thats what Test cricket is all about... For almost all four days, I have been on the field. Its been demanding on the body but its held up pretty well.         
	The wicket         
	Its the best wicket in the world, from a batsmans point of view, a batsmans paradise... But, yes, there wasnt enough in it for the bowlers... It has been tough on them. Its not (result oriented)

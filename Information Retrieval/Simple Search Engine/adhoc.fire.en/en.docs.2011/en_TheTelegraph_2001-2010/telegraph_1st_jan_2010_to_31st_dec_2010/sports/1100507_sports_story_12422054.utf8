The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Holmes leads, Woods pars first five holes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Holmes leads, Woods pars first five holes
                      
	Ponte Vedra Beach: Long-hitting American JB Holmes set the early pace at the Players Championship on Thursday as late starter Tiger Woods parred his first five holes.         
	Holmes took advantage of surprisingly calm conditions to fire a flawless, six-under-par 66 in the opening round of the tournament widely considered the fifth major by the players.         
	Britains Luke Donald rolled in a six-foot birdie putt at the last for a 67 to share second place with Americans Jason Bohn, Ben Crane and Heath Slocum. Masters champion Phil Mickelson, who could replace Woods as the world No.1 for the first time if he wins this week, opened with a 70 at the TPC Sawgrass.         
	With hardly a breath of wind on a hot and humid day, Holmes reached the turn in three-under 33 before picking up further shots at the 14th, 16th and treacherous par-three 17th.         
	It was a fun day, one of those rounds where everything was going pretty good, the 28-year-old told reporters. I wasnt in too much trouble at any point... one of those rounds where its not easy but it kind of felt pretty easy.         
	American left-hander Mickelson, who would take over at the top if he wins on Sunday and Woods finishes outside the top five, was reasonably satisfied after scrambling his way to a 70.         
	Shooting 70 today isnt the round that you want, the world No.2 said after recording four birdies and two bogeys.         
	Woods, who missed the cut at last weeks Quail Hollow Championship after a surprisingly inept performance, made a reasonably solid start after being warmly applauded on the first tee. He parred the opening hole after hitting a superb second shot from pine straw well left of the fairway and narrowly missed a birdie opportunity at the par-five second.         
	Woods, champion here in 2001, struck a good tee shot to 15 feet at the par-three third but again missed the birdie putt and did well to save par at the fourth. He received several early words of encouragement from the fans at Sawgrass.         
	As he walked off the second tee, a woman in the gallery called out: Tiger, remember your dads with you, referring to the late Earl Woods. The world No.1 turned his head towards her and smiled.

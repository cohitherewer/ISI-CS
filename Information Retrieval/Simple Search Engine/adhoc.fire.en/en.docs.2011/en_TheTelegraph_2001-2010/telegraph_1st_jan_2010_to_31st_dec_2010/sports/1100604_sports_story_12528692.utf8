The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1970s: A Clockwork Oranje
                                                                                                                       7                                      1970s: A Clockwork Oranje
                    Johan Cruyff, the Flying Dutchman, in full flight during a   match against Sweden in 1974    The rise of the Netherlands as the football super power remained the talking point throughout the 70s. They could never win the World Cup, losing the finals in 1974 and 1978 but the Dutch espoused a new concept  Total Football  that took the world by storm.         
	Total Football meant the ability for any player to play in virtually any position --- the specialist was to be replaced by the generalist. Such a concept of the game required many top class players, which the Dutch, uniquely, had. The fact that in 1974, 13 players were drawn from only two club sides; six from Ajax, and seven from Feyenoord, gave the Dutch team the much-needed cohesiveness. They were nicknamed Clockwork Oranje for their precision passing.         
	Yet, the hosts reigned supreme in back-to-back World Cups during this period. West Germany won their first Cup in 20 years at home, followed by Argentina finally realising their dream in Buenos Aires four years later. Both were deserving winners with some exceptionally talented players in their ranks.         
	The West Germany team of 1974 was far stronger than their predecessors in 1970. Not only was Franz Beckenbauer still at the peak of his game, but Gerd Muller, who had been the top scorer in 1970, developed into an even more complete striker. Nicknamed Der Bomber, Muller was one of the main architects of German triumph in 1974.         
	The World Cup in Argentina was an eventful one. First, the England manager Donald Revie deserted the side midway through the qualifiers leaving the team stranded; and then Johan Cruyff refused to be a part of the Dutch team. Scotland made the final rounds only to be hit by scandal when one of their players, Willie Johnstone, was caught taking drugs, and was sent home. To make things worse, Argentinas 6-0 win over Peru, a result that eliminated Brazil, was looked upon with great suspicion.         
	But then, Argentina were an inspiring side under the great motivator and manager Cesar Luis Menotti and had two excellent players with a strong supporting class. Mario Kempes, as tall as most central defenders, had an impressive heading ability, coupled with excellent ball control and speed. Along with him, Osvaldo Ardiles played some great football to see Argentina through.         
	THE FLYING DUTCHMAN         
	After Pele and Beckenbauer, no other player could stretch the imagination of the soccer fans like Johan Cruyff of the Netherlands. In his 12-year international career, the Dutchman was a phenomenon, perhaps the most complete footballer the world had ever seen. Possessor of a ferocious shot, Cruyff seemed to score effortlessly from almost any position. Willowy and fast, Cruyff moved around the pitch in a manner designed to pull opponents out of position thereby opening up opportunities for his colleagues. Pity, he ended on the losing side in the 1974 World Cup final.               
	MEMORABLE MATCH         
	The 1978 final was a memorable match for hosts Argentina, who ended their 48-year wait to win the World Cup with a 3-1 extra-time victory. The Netherlands, on the other hand, lost their second consecutive final despite being widely considered as the better team in the final. The Dutch were at the receiving end of Argentine gamesmanship from the very beginning. They were made to wait for five minutes before being allowed to enter the ground; the Argentines then complained about the plaster on the right hand of an injured Rene van der Kerkhof and when the match finally started, the hosts committed too many fouls.               
	TRIVIA         
	World champions in 1966, Englands decline as footballs superpower was dramatic. They failed to reach the finals in both 1974 and 1978. In 1974, they failed to get past a determined Poland at Wembley that too after Derby manager Brian Clough had called Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski a clown before the match. Tomaszewski played exceptionally to deny England a place in the final rounds in Germany.

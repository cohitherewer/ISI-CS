The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani bites the dust
                                                                                                                       7                                      Advani bites the dust
                      
	Leeds: Pankaj Advanis hopes of winning the World Professional Billiards title for the second consecutive time went up in smoke after compatriot Dhruv Sitwala registered a hard fought 723-608 win over the reigning champion in the quarter finals on Saturday.         
	Advani suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands of Sitwala, who compiled three century breaks (118, 109 and 161) in his 32 visits to the table.         
	Advani failed to score even a single century break during his two hour stay at the table with his highest break accounting for 91.         
	Dhruv played very confidently and with consistency. He went ahead 360 points with only 30 minutes left in the clock. (agencies)

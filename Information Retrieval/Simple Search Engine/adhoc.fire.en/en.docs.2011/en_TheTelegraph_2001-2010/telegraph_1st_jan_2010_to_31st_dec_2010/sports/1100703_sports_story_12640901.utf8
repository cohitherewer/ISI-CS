	London: Spains Rafael Nadal reached his fourth Wimbledon final with a 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-4 win over Britains Andy Murray on Friday. The second seed, who won the title in 2008 but missed the tournament last year through injury, will face Czech Tomas Berdych in Sundays final after the 12th seed overcame Serbias Novak Djokovic 6-3, 7-6 (9), 6-3.         
	Leander Paes and his Zimbabwean partner Cara Black advanced to the final of the mixed doubles by defeating the Czech combo of Lukas Dlouhy and Iveta Benesova 6-3, 6-3. After pocketing the first game, Paes and Black continued to dominate the proceedings and clinched the next game with an identical 6-3 scoreline.         
	Second-seeded Paes and Black now play winner of the other semi-final clash in which South African-American pair of Wesley Moodie and Lisa Raymond take on the Brazilian-Australian combination of Marcelo Melo and Rennae Stubbs.         
	Nadal took the first set with a single break when Murray sent a crosscourt forehand wide leaving the Scot banging his fist against his side in frustration.         
	In an enthralling second set, Murray had set point on his serve at 6-5 in the tiebreak but Nadal saved it with a fantastic drop volley before extending his match lead.         
	Murray started brightly in the third set breaking Nadal to love to the delight of the partisan Centre Court crowd but their joy did not last long as Nadal broke back in the eighth game and broke again to seal victory when Murray lashed a volley long.         
	For all his temper tantrums on the court, Djokovic was calm and gracious off it after losing.         
	I didnt deserve to win today, simple as that. I congratulate my opponent for he was the best player, the Serbian third seed told.         
	You know, I have to move on. I hope next time, if I have this opportunity, Ill play better.         
	Djokovic received a code violation for racket abuse after slamming it into his chair in a show of frustration when losing the second set.         
	He sarcastically applauded the umpire for the decision having already had words with him over a line judges decision to call his lob out at 6-5 down in the second-set tiebreak.         
	Djokovic called for Hawk-Eye, which showed the ball, was in, but the 23-year-old was furious at having to play the point again although he eventually won it with a sublime backhand down the line, roaring his approval.         
	I thought at that moment the referee was wrong, Djokovic, who matched his 2007 run to the semi-finals, said. I continued on playing. Yeah, maybe it would be a turning point if I won that second set tiebreaker.         
	However, a double fault handed 12th seed Berdych a two-set lead. Another double fault proved even more costly as the 2008 Australian Open champion handed Berdych a break for 5-3 in the third set and the Czech duly served out the match to reach his first Grand Slam final.         
	He played a great match and a great tournament, Djokovic said. In important moments I served some double faults. I was a little bit unfortunate in some points. But definitely didnt take my chances and he used it, so he deserved to win.         
	Djokovic had suffered from breathing problems in earlier rounds of the tournament but said while there had been no such issue out on Centre Court he had not felt great.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Arindam flirts with danger
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Arindam Bhattacharya is flirting with trouble these days. After the mid-air fracas of Tuesday night, the Churchill Brothers goalkeeper first incited and then jostled with irate Mohun Bagan fans after their I-league match at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.         
	The goalkeeper could have sustained serious injuries had some officials not intervened to rescue him from the fans who were baying for his blood.         
	It all started after referee S. Suresh blew the final whistle. Frustrated that Bagan had failed to log full points  the lively match ended in a 2-2 draw  fans were furious with the choice of Okolie Odafe for the Man of the Match award.         
	How can our (Jose Ramirez) Barreto not get the award. Its all fixed, trouble was brewing in the stands.         
	Soon stones and bottles were raining onto the pitch and one hit Ogba Kalu on his waist. As Kalu fell down, writhing in pain, Bhattacharya picked out the miscreant and rushed up the stands to settle a score.         
	Around 70 fans mobbed him, hurling at him the choicest expletives, but Arindam stood his ground.         
	Inside the tunnel an animated Odafe was shouting at the police. What are you guys here for? Odafe was upset. My goalkeeper is being beaten up by them. Cant you see?         
	Soon police intervened and dispersed the crowd with a mild lathi charge. We cant do anything if someone instigates the crowd. We made sure things didnt go out of hand, Rajesh Kumar Singh, CO First Batallion, said.         
	By evening, Arindam had calmed down. I could have died. I shouldnt have reacted like that. But at that moment I just lost my cool. What they (the mob) did wasnt right either.         
	I am not repentant. If it happens again I will do the same thing, he said.         
	Arindam should know how to control his temper. He is getting into trouble every now and then and thats not doing him any good.         
	At the post-match conference, though, Churchill coach Carlos Pareira made no mention of Arindams violent reaction. He had been more disturbed by the crowd violence.         
	This violence is killing Calcutta football. We will definitely lodge a complaint. Kalu could have died today. In the future, if matches are played at Barasat we will think twice, he said.         
	Theres no security at the ground. Barasat is not safe.         
	The Indian Football Association sources said the match commissioner might not report the Arindam incident since he hadnt seen it. We are asking the officials what actually happened and will send a report to the All India Football Federation, the source said.         
	The Barasat Stadium, though, may not host a match in the near future.         
	This is not the first time that the ground has witnessed crowd violence and, now, we will think twice before scheduling a match here. Frankly, there is a security threat at the ground, the source added.         
	Meanwhile, Odafe dedicated his two goals to the Almighty. I prayed to him to give me the strength. I am happy to have scored today, he said.         
	Odafe said the event of the last few days had an effect on the team.         
	But not for a moment did we lose faith. I have full faith in God, he said.         
	And Churchill have faith in their talismanic captain.

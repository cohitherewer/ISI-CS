	Lemont: Looking like a matinee idol from a bygone era, Ryan Moore sauntered into the third-round lead at the BMW Championship, on Saturday, shooting a breezy 66 for an eight-under-par total of 205, one stroke better than three players: Dustin Johnson (68), Charlie Wi (70) and Matt Kuchar (70).         
	The shakeup Moore caused at the top, and some jostling in the middle of the field, set up some fascinating possibilities for a wild Sunday finish at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club. Players, on the brink of elimination, will be trying to get into the top 30 in points to secure a spot in the Tour Championship in two weeks, and those near the top will be shooting to control their own title hopes in a bid to win the FedEx Cup.         
	Moore, 28, said he was concerned about one thing only. Im here to win the Western Open, he said, calling the PGA Tours third-oldest event by its former title.         
	Woods, who shot 68 to move up 18 spots into a tie for 22nd, was projected to finish outside the top 30 if he were to tread water on Sunday. If he does fail to make the field for Atlanta, it will be the first time since 1996, his first year on tour, that he does not qualify.         
	Meanwhile, US captain Corey Pavin said, on Sunday, that Tiger Woods is not guaranteed to play in a maximum five matches against Europe in next months Ryder Cup.         
	The No.1 was chosen as one of Pavins four wild-card picks last week, and will be playing in his sixth Ryder Cup.         
	I am going to treat every player the same. The objective is to try to win the Ryder Cup and if in my judgment I think Tiger is to play five matches, or should play four or three, then that is what I will do  thats my call as captain, Pavin said.

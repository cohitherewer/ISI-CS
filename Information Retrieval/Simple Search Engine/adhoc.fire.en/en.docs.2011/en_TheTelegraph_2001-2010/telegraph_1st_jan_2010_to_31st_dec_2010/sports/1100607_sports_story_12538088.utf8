  - Coach Dunga not to risk key men before opener as team gear up for Group of Death             Kaka chests one during a training session, in Johannesburg                           
	Johannesburg: Brazil will be without goalkeeper Julio Cesar when they face Tanzania in their final warm-up before the World Cup. Coach Dunga may rest other starters to protect them ahead of the opening match. Brazil have had some injury scares since arriving in South Africa and there are fears the final match could cause more problems for the five-time World Champions.         
	The determination and enthusiasm needs to be the same but its not a decisive match, Brazil captain Lucio said Sunday. We can avoid some risky plays when needed.         
	Goalkeeper Julio Cesar injured his back in Brazils match against Zimbabwe on Wednesday, and a day later starting left back Michel Bastos hurt his right ankle at practice. Brazilian doctors said the injuries are not serious, but Julio Cesar wont even make the trip for Mondays match in Dar es Salaam. Michel Bastos will go, but he may be omitted from the starting line-up.         
	Right now, its about getting prepared, not competing, Dunga said. Its about putting into action what we have been training. Nobody is going at 100 percent.         
	Several high-profile players from other teams have already received serious injuries ahead of the World Cup, including England captain Rio Ferdinand, Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba and Netherlands midfielder Arjen Robben.         
	If you enter the field fearing about getting injured, thats when you are going to get hurt, Lucio said. We cant think about that too much.         
	Brazil had a light training session before traveling to Tanzania on Sunday. All players participated, but Julio Cesar practised separately and in reduced intensity. He stayed in Johannesburg to undergo physiotherapy treatment at the squads training camp.         
	The match against Tanzania will give Dunga his last chance to test his squad before the World Cup opener against North Korea on June 15 in Johannesburg.         
	Without a doubt, we will need to enter this match with a lot of determination, Lucio said. Its getting closer and closer to the first match. We need do start doing well now to be prepared for the opener.         
	Brazil comfortably beat Zimbabwe 3-0 in Harare despite a sloppy start that allowed the African side to threaten the Brazilian goal, but the team picked up the pace to easily earn the victory.         
	The No. 1 team in FIFA rankings entering the World Cup, Brazil decided to play only two matches before the tournament, picking nations that are not playing in the World Cup. Zimbabwe is ranked 110th and Tanzania is 108th.         
	Dunga said it was important to chose African teams because Brazils second Group G opponent will be Ivory Coast.         
	Against Zimbabwe, Dunga played most of his starters from the beginning.           (AGENCIES)

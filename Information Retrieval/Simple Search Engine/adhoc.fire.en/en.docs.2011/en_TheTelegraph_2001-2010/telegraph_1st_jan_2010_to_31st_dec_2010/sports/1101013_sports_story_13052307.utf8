                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian athletes remain   on track
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The first gold came in 1958. The second came on October 11, 2010. It was a wait of 52 years! And the third came in the next 24 hours!         
	Indian athletics has never seen two consecutive golden days in a long time.         
	If Monday was discusing about three women, Tuesday was about a 4x400metre relay team and one mans intuition.         
	Relay coach R.S.Sidhu took a huge gamble when he gave comeback-woman Manjeet Kaur a rare chance to race.         
	In the relay heat we started with Jona Murmu, Chitra Suman, Ashwini Akkunji and Siny Jose. But today (Tuesday) morning, I had a feeling that I should go ahead with Manjeet and Mandeep Kaur. It was a big gamble and it paid off, Sidhu said at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, here on Tuesday         
	And boy! It did paid off big time.         
	Manjit ran the race of her life and Mandeep complemented that with another fantastic run. The quartet timed in 3:27.77, ahead of Nigeria (3:28.72) and England (3:29.51).         
	Manjeet was running second at the end of the first leg and Jose maintained it. Akkunji then took India to lead with a fast run in the third leg before Mandeep saw off a late surge from a Nigerian to cross the finishing line ahead of the rest.         
	Manjeet had a back injury after Athens 2004 and could not train much in the next two years. Last one and a half years, I trained her hard and had a feeling that she was getting into the groove. Even her Commonwealth Games selection was in doubt. But I knew she was a fighter and insisted on taking her aboard. See today, I have been vindicated and we have won a gold, Sidhu was talking fast.         
	Even the legendary Sebastian Coe was ecstatic: This may just have changed the direction of track and field (in India), he said. Not only track and field in India, but in Asia.         
	Sensational, added Coe.         
	I would like to thank the crowd for the support, Mandeep said. At one point I thought we would come second, but my team had the self-belief to do it. The baton (after the third lap) was passed in time to me.         
	Manjeet seemed to be in a daze: We have won! she could only murmur.         
	Australias Sally Pearson collapsed twice after running her heart out in the final leg. Pearson  who had her 100m sprint gold taken away, before winning the 100m hurdles on an emotional, six-day roller coaster  ran the final leg of the race, after being a late inclusion.         
	The medal surge began with the womens 4x100m relay team of S.Geetha, Srabani Nanda, P.K.Priya and H.M.Jyothi finishing third in a photo finish, with a timing of 45.25 seconds, just one-100th of a second behind second-placed Ghana (45.24 secs). England won gold in 44.19secs.         
	The mens quartet of Rahamatulla Molla, Krishnakumar Rane, Shammer Mon and Mohammed Abdul Qureshi smashed the national record with a timing of 38.89secs.         
	Then triple jumper Renjith Maheswary broke his own national record by clearing 17.07m. His earlier national record was 17.04m.         
	In javelin, Kashinath Naik cleared 74.29m to take home the bronze. The gold and silver were won by Jarrod Bannister (81.72m) of Australia and Stuart Farquhar (78.15m) of New Zealand, respectively.         
	I am not satisfied as I could do better, Naik said later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rose paired with Tiger
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rose paired with Tiger
                      
	Scotland: Briton Justin Rose was given the chance to show off his inspired form before the biggest galleries for the first two rounds of the British Open at St Andrews after he was paired with Tiger Woods.         
	Rose, who burst to prominence when he finished tied for fourth as a 17-year-old amateur in the 1998 Open at Royal Birkdale, has won two PGA Tour events in the last month and he, Woods and Colombian Camilo Villegas tee off in Thursdays headline grouping.         
	Woods has won the Open three times  twice by handsome margins on the famed links of the Old Course  and comes into the event as the favourite despite failing to win a tournament since his return to the game in April after a self-imposed exile following a string of revelations about his private life.         
	American Stewart Cink will start the defence of his title in the events 150th anniversary year alongside former champion Ernie Els and Englands world number eight Ian Poulter, two groups ahead of Woods.         
	Tom Watson, the five-times champion who came within a whisker of another Open win before losing to Cink in a playoff at Turnberry last year, is paired with Japanese teenager Ryo Ishikawa and Irelands twice champion Padraig Harrington in the grouping after Woods.         
	World No.2 Phil Mickelson starts his campaign for a first Open crown with home favourite Colin Montgomerie and South African Retief Goosen.         
	Participation of Englands Lee Westwood, ranked three in the world, who is chasing a first major after several near-misses, remains in some doubt as he struggles with a calf problem.

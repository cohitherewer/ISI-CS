                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB to approach the ICC
                      
	Lahore: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt, on Friday, said the board will soon approach the International Cricket Council (ICC) to arrange a few charity matches against India to raise funds for the flood victims in Pakistan.         
	The floods have claimed about 2000 lives so far in the worst floods in 80 years in Pakistan.         
	Butt said they have contacted the Board of Control for Cricket in India and others for the purpose and have already planned such a match against South Africa on October 25 in Dubai where the two countries will be engaged in a full series.         
	Butt said that he would soon meet the ICC officials to discuss the possibility of having bilateral series with India at neutral venues.         
	I am hopeful that at my next meeting with the ICC officials I would be able to convince them for a series between the two countries.         
	I will meet with the ICC officials very soon during which I will surely discuss the Indo-Pak series at a neutral venue either in England or UAE to generate funds for flood victims and I am optimistic that our call would be considered, he said.

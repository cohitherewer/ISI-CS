The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian hopes take a hit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian hopes take a hit
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: Indias semi-final hopes virtually went up in smoke after they were thrashed 5-2 by Spain in the Hero Honda hockey World Cup, at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Thursday.         
	With just three points from as many matches, the hosts chances of making further progress in the tournament are very slim. While England, with nine points, seem virtually through from Pool B, Australia and Spain are behind them with six points each.         
	Although the wildly cheering capacity crowd returned home frustrated, the result didnt come as a surprise for those with an understanding of how things stand. Going by the strength of the teams in the pool it would almost be a miracle for India to make the last four.         
	India coach Jose Brasa, who is Spanish himself, admitted his team were out of contention for a place in the semis. We have no chance. As I said before, our main aim now should be to finish among the top five. Now we will fight to finish fifth this time.         
	India have never made the semis since their only title triumph under Ajitpal Singh, 35 years ago in Kuala Lumpur. Being the hosts, this time they were expected to do better but on Thursday they were far from it.         
	Despite the vociferous crowd support, the Indians were a fumbling lot in the first half. If Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur were found wanting upfront, the defence was truly pathetic. Neither Sandeep Singh nor Dhananjay Mahadik were in their elements and the team conceded soft goals in the first half.         
	The first goal by Albert Sala in the 16th minute completely caught the Indian defenders on the wrong foot. Sala, who dribbled his way through, met no resistance. The second goal, that came a minute before the half-time hooter, was the result of yet another defensive lapse with Pol Amot making the most of it after coming in from the right.         
	On Wednesday Brasa had said his team were capable of taking care of Spain who have come to India with a depleted squad. In reality, the Indians were a truly beaten lot in every department of the game.         
	India displayed some spirit for a brief period in the second half. Sandeep hit the target with a fluent penalty corner and Gurwinder Singh Chandi ran in to score another. In between, Pau Quemada (2) and Roc Oliva scored three more to make it a rout.         
	Its not that India never had a chance. In the first half, Prabhjot Singh wasted an easy opportunity while the Spanish keeper Francisco Cortes came up with a couple of good saves in the second.         
	I am really disappointed, a crestfallen Brasa said after the match. It was a bad defeat. We made some childish mistakes and conceded some poor goals.         
	According to the coach, it was the second goal by Spain that hurt the most. It was a big mistake by our defenders. Amot was allowed to go unchecked. It completely changed the course of the match and gave them the upper hand.         
	The coach was mildly critical of Sandeep for not scoring more goals from the five penalty corners that India earned but also praised the Spanish keeper. He had played against Sandeep before, so had studied him well.         
	Brasa said he could have allowed Diwakar Ram to take the penalty corners but the Spaniard was not happy with the drag-flickers form. In the end, all I can say is that we have improved a lot but we have to play more against the top teams. There is no other way to climb up the ladder in international hockey.

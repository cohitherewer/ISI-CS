	Yenagoa: A footballer in Nigeria has died after collapsing during a topflight league match. Nigerian Premier League club Ocean Boys confirmed defender Emmanuel Ogoli died after he collapsed in the 39th minute of Sundays home game against Niger Tornadoes in Yenagoa, in southern Nigeria.         
	Ogoli was rushed from the stadium in an ambulance as the game continued.He was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         
	Team spokesman Eddy Ohis said: We think its heart failure, but were not sure. Ohis said Ocean Boys players went to the hospital after the match to find the body. He said the team has requested an autopsy. The autopsy report of the player is expected later this week.         
	Ocean Boys is coached by former Barcelona and Nigeria midfielder Emmanuel Amunike.         
	Meanwhile, Ocean Boys doctor, Erefa Inengibo says the left back had no health problems before his tragic death. Many are attributing the unfortunate incident to undetected heart related issues but Inengibo said rigorous medical test were carried out on all the registered players of the club before the start of the current season and that none, including the late Ogoli failed such tests.         
	Captain of the team, Emmanuel Enize said they were in shock as Ogoli was a jolly good fellow full of life and humour. We are in a shock! Ogoli was loved by all. We were all joking and laughing before the game, so to lose him the way we did is quite unbelievable, he said.         
	Goalkeeper, Femi Thomas was perhaps the worst hit as he struggled to choke back the tears. Death is wicked. Why did Emma have to go now? We will miss him but life goes on. May his soul rest in peace, he wept.           (AGENCIES)

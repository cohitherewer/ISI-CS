The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Majola got a bonus from Modi 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Majola got a bonus from Modi 
                      
	Johannesburg: Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola will pay back more than rand 1million, believed to have been paid to him as a bonus from funds provided by the then Indian Premier League (IPL) supremo Lalit Modi for agreeing to host the second edition of the event in South Africa last year.         
	Majola offered to pay back the money in an urgent telephonic conference with the executive committee of Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Wednesday as the body prepared to release its financial statements next week, reported a South African daily.         
	It added that the payment would be indicated as a miscellaneous loan that has been repaid.         
	The move came after an extensive investigation into irregularities in payment of bonuses by cash-flushed IPL.         
	After external auditors Deloitte reported irregularities at CSA, the body has initiated an internal investigation to establish how rand 4.7 million was earlier divided between Majola, Don McIntosh, chief organiser of the tournament and former head of finance at CSA, and Kass Naidoo, CSAs commercial director.         
	McIntosh recently resigned from his position.         
	The report said the payments were believed to have been made by Modi, who is currently under pressure as investigations continue in India into his handling of the IPL, which was hurriedly moved to South Africa after security concerns in India because of elections being held at the same time.         
	CSA benefited by about rand 10 million from the IPL II played in South Africa.         
	The newspaper also reported that it had it on good authority that the bonuses were not authorised or declared, and that neither the executive committee nor the CSAs financial and remuneration committees had any knowledge of it. However, Majola denied this fact.         
	Majola described the investigation as a witch-hunt saying: There is nothing sinister about the bonuses and I have already paid tax on it. There is just uncertainty over money which was not paid by CSA.         
	If Graeme Smith gets his salary cheque from the IPL, he does not need to explain it to CSA. Why should I? Majola said.           (PTI)

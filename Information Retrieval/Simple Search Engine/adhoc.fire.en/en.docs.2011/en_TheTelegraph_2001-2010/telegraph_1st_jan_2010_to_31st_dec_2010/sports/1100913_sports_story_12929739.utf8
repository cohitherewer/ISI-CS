            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Better  that is common inference about East Bengal, as compared to city rivals Mohun Bagan, Chirag United, at the onset of the season. The red and gold brigade will, then, have to a reputation to protect when take on Mohammedan Sporting in a CFL Premier Division tie on Monday.         
	Considered the citys best bet in the upcoming Federation Cup, the match will also serve as a test for Trevor Morgan to fine-tune his armoury.         
	On paper, Mohammedan Sporting face an Everest to climb as East Bengal possess better players in all most all positions. However, much will depend on how Penn Orji manages himself.         
	The Nigerian has been the fulcrum of Trevor James Morgans plans and will again be a key component. The strike-duo of Ikene Ekenwa and Budhiram Tudu will also bank on useful deliveries from Naoba Singh and Reisangmei Vashum to do the damage.         
	For East Bengal Tolgay Ozebe has a minor injury problem.         
	Morgan, having won all the CFL ties do far, is reluctant to change the winning combination. We have been playing well I hope the boys will repeat that performance. I dont have much of an idea about Mohammedan Sporting but I expect a good challenge tomorrow, Morgan said.         
	For Mohammedan Sporting, it may all boil down to how good they are collectively. For goals, Syed Naeemuddins side will look up Dipendu Biswas, a veteran of many battles and who is in a good form. However, captain and defender David has an injury and his unavailability may complicate things for his side.         
	Time to see, if the better is the best.

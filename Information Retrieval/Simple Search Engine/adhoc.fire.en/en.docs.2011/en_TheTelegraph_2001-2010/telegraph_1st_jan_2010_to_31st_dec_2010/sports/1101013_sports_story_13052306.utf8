    - Maestro dedicates double hundred to daughter Sara, who turned 13 Tuesday           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar in Bangalore, on Tuesday                                 
	Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar, the toast of India, spoke to the media in general, at the Chinnaswamy, on Tuesday evening. Later, at the Royal Gardenia, he took a few questions exclusively from The Telegraph.         
	The following are excerpts         
	Mood in the dressing room on the fourth evening         
	(Enthusiastically) Theres excitement, but dont take anything for granted... I think its going to be a wonderful day of cricket... One is looking forward to tomorrow (Wednesday)... It will be a big day as the Test is at a critical stage.         
	If theres an ideal target to chase on the last day         
	Cant put a figure, but the smaller it is, the better.         
	Whether the team is disappointed at having lost five wickets so quickly in the morning         
	Yes... Those wickets were lost in a space of 40-45 minutes, but weve fought back well, thanks to the bowlers.         
	State of the Chinnaswamy wicket         
	It has got slower and the cracks have widened.         
	Innings of 214, his sixth double         
	One tries to score as many as possible, but one may not always succeed... Im happy I was able to contribute.         
	Dedicated to...         
	Sara, my daughter, who turned 13 today.         
	If hed listened to son Arjuns advice when he reached his hundred with a six, off Nathan Hauritz         
	That (advice bit) was a joke and should be seen that way.         
	Having broken records en route to the double         
	To repeat what Ive been saying, I dont play for records, but its nice to set them.         
	Work put in by the support staff         
	Im thankful to them... To everybody... (Masseur) Mane Kaka and the rest...         
	Eleven of his 49 Test hundreds being against Australia         
	(Grins) I wasnt aware, dont count the hundreds that way... Its good to get runs against top teams and I enjoy playing Australia.         
	Fans demand that he get a triple         
	Look, I focus on my game and on what I need to do... I dont worry about what X or Y or Z is saying. Rather, I worry about making a contribution.         
	Superb run in 2010 and this series in particular         
	Havent done anything different, except that Im getting many more balls to face (during the throw-downs) from Gary (Kirsten, the coach)... Gary and the bowling machine seem to be competing with each other... Gary doesnt get tired.         
	The Sachin Tendulkar approach         
	Try to get better each day... Getting better never stops. I never compromise on what I need to be doing. Also, I enjoy the game.         
	If theres a next level         
	I cant say what is the next level, but its about raising the bar and trying to consistently contribute.         
	Sunil Gavaskars comment that the secret of his success is actually being a student, not a master         
	One keeps learning everyday...         
	Mentoring the Murali Vijays         
	I like interacting with players... Its not about being a senior or a junior... Its by talking to the players that one gets to learn quite a bit.         
	Vijays maiden Test hundred, which came about with him at the other end         
	The first hundred always remains special... Im happy for Vijay... The younger players have been working very hard and its nice when they get rewarded.         
	Reservations over the Umpire Decision Review System         
	I need to be convinced that it will be right... Id quite liked the hot-spot (instead)... It will be interesting if we get close to 100 per cent of the decisions being correct.         
	Finally, is hes been following Indias stellar show in the XIX Commonwealth Games         
	(Enthusiastically) Know whats happening, yes... Of course, Im happy... Its great news for sport in India... Whatever shows the country in good light delights me... Could be something in sport or an achievement in some other field.

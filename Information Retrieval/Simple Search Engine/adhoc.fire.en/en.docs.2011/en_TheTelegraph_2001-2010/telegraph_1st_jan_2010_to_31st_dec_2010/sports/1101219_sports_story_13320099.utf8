	Hyderabad: Indias challenge came to a premature halt in the Indian Open Grand Prix badminton tournament with both P Kashyap and PV Sindhu crashing out in the semi-finals of their respective singles event here Saturday.         
	Commonwealth gold medallist Kashyap was no match for top seed Dionysius Hayom Rumbaka of Indonesia in the mens singles.         
	Third seed Kashyap, who rose seven places to 23rd in the recent world rankings, surrendered 19-21, 13-21 in just 37 minutes before Rumbaka, who is four rungs higher than the Indian in the chart.         
	In the title clash, Rumbaka will meet Suppanyu Avihingsanon of Thailand, who stunned fourth seed Alamsyah Yunus 21-14 23-21 of Indonesia in the other last four match. However, Sindhu gave a tough fight to her fifth seeded Indonesian opponent Fransiska Ratnasari in the semi-finals of the womens singles event before going down 21-7, 17-21, 15-21.         
	Ratnasari will take on Chinese Zhou Hui, who defeated Ana Rovita of Indonesia 15-21, 21-14, 21-14 in the other last four encounter.         
	Meanwhile, it was curtains for India in the mixed doubles too as the combination of Tarun Kona and Ashwini Ponnappa lost in straight games 12-21, 18-21 to Chinese pair of Liu Peixuan and Jinhua Tang in the semi-finals.         
	The Chinese duo will now lock horns against Teik Chai Gan and Hui Lin Ng in the title clash on Sunday.         
	Gan and Ng defeated Singapores Chayut Triyachart and Yu Yan Vanessa Neo 21-17, 21-17 in another semi-final clash.         
	On Friday, Kashyap and Sindhu had notched up contrasting wins. While Kashyap had bounced back from a game down to defeat Indonesian Tommy Sugiarto 18-21 21-17 21-18 in the quarter finals, Sindhu took just 21 minutes to get across compatriot Anita Ohlan 21-10 21-15.

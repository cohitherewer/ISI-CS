The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni, Kohli do it in style 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni, Kohli do it in style 
  - tri-series 152-run fourth wicket partnership tilts scales after openers fall cheaply             Virat Kohli en route to 91 in Dhaka on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Dhaka: Mahendra Singh Dhoni led from the front with a crafty unbeaten 101 as India recovered from early jolt to register comprehensive six-wicket win over Bangladesh in the Idea Cup Tri-Nation tournament here Thursday.         
	Chasing a target of 297, India were precariously placed at 51 for three before Dhoni combined with Virat Kohli (91) and Suresh Raina (51 no, 43 balls) to steer the team to victory with 15 balls to spare.         
	Dhoni not only notched up his seventh ODI century but paced his innings brilliantly to share a 152-run fourth-wicket stand with Kohli to put India on course of the victory.         
	Dhoni, who was let off on 61 struck nine fours in his 107-ball knock. He got admirable support from young Kohli, who hit seven fours during his 102-ball knock.         
	India, however, were dealt with some early blows by the Bangladeshi bowlers as openers Gautam Gambhir (18), Virender Sehwag (1) and Yuvraj Singh (1)  all feel cheaply inside the first nine overs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.         
	Suresh Raina, who hit five fours and a six during his unbeaten knock, hit the winning runs  a boundary  to take India to 297 for four to the stunned silence of 25,000-odd Bangladesh supporters. Young Kohli, who hit his fourth ODI fifty in his 17th match, was unlucky to miss out on his second hundred by nine runs as he was caught and bowled by Bangladesh captain Sakib al Hasan in the 35th over. For Bangladesh, Sayed Rasel, Rubel Hossain and Sakib all got a wicket.         
	Earlier, Bangladesh posted the competitive target, their highest ODI score against India, riding on opener Imrul Kayes 70 and identical quickfire 60s from Tamim Iqbal and Mahamadullah after their captain Sakib-al Hasan won the toss and surprisingly elected to bat.         
	With this win, India recorded their first victory of the tournament as well of the year and are in second spot behind Sri Lanka in the points after all the three sides have played two matches each.         
	Dhonis men now play Sri Lanka on Sunday, while Bangladesh, who are yet to open their account, play Sri Lanka on Friday in a must-win match.         
	When skipper Dhoni joined Kohli, the first thing that the duo did was to eliminate the risks. They mostly scored in singles and twos. However they didnt miss an opportunity to dispatch the loose deliveries to the fence.         
	They added first 50 runs in 67 deliveries.         
	The next 50 came in 52 deliveries.         
	Bangladesh missed a chance to press for a win as captain Sakib dropped his Indian counterpart in the 33rd over when on 61 which eventually proved costly. By the time Kohli was out, India needed 94 from 15 overs.

                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC rejects Butt plea
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has rejected Salman Butts application to defer the hearing into the spotfixing allegations against him and two other cricketers from his country.         
	Thus, the hearing will take place as scheduled from January 6-11 in Doha.         
	Butt, along with Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, were suspended by the ICC in September.         
	Michael Beloff, chairman of the ICC anticorruption tribunal, heard an application from Butts new legal representation for an adjournment of the full hearing and ruled against the adjournment.         
	Mr Beloff, the chairman of the ICC anticorruption tribunal, following a lengthy telephone hearing and having received written submissions, has ruled that Mr Butts application is denied and as such, the full hearing will take place as scheduled from 611 January 2011 in Doha, Qatar, an ICC statement said.         
	It was only Butt who wanted a delay in the hearing and both Asif and Aamer were keen that hearing takes place as soon as possible. Butt wanted Scotland Yard to complete its separate investigation into the issue before facing the ICC hearing.         
	Meanwhile, there seems to be no end to Butt woes with barrister Aitzaz Ahsan now confirming that his law firm is not representing the suspended Pakistan Test captain .

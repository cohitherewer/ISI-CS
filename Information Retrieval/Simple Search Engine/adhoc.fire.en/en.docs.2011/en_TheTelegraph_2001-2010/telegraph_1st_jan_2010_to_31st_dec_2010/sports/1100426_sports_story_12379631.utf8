                                                                                                                       7                                      CL T20 from Sept. 10-26
                      
	Mumbai: The Champions League governing council to quote announced Sunday that the Twenty20 tournament would be held in South Africa this year.         
	The Airtel Champions League Twenty20 will be held in South Africa from September 10 to 26, said a statement. The governing council accepted Cricket South Africa (CSA)s offer to host the tournament in a meeting held here Saturday.         
	Lalit Modi did not participate in the CL T20 meeting and it was seen as a snub to the Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner, who might be forced out of the job in the IPL governing council meeting Monday.         
	Modi is facing charges of financial irregularities but has remained defiant.         
	South Africa is considered an ideal CLT20 host after successfully staging the IPL and ICC World Twenty20 tournaments in recent years, as well as the strong support shown for its domestic Pro20 Series competition, the release quoted Modi as saying.           (PTI)

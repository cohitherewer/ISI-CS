The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Problem stems from Pawar carte blanche to Lalit Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Problem stems from Pawar carte blanche to Lalit Modi
    - Row between suspended IPL chairman and BCCI set to get messier             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                  Shashank Manohar, Sharad Pawar and Lalit Modi          
	Calcutta: With the row between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Lalit Kumar Modi set to become more nasty, an influential section within the institution is becoming increasingly critical of Sharad Pawar, who gave the suspended administrator unlimited powers when he was the president.         
	Pawar, a Union minister who recently became the International Cricket Council chief, was the BCCIs head between November 2005-September 2008. He continues to be at the helm of the Mumbai Cricket Association, through which he entered the sport.         
	The root of the current problem is that Pawar gave Modi absolute powers in the last year of his presidency, when the Indian Premier League (IPL) became a reality... It all started there...         
	Modi used to run to Pawar for everything and, perhaps out of exasperation, he asked him to do things his way. Once unlimited powers are given, officially or otherwise, its next to impossible to withdraw them, somebody very senior in the BCCI told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, he added: Its because of the carte blanche given to Modi that he didnt bother to take the IPLs governing council into confidence... Never bothered to consult it... The council kept quiet because most, if not all, of its members knew of Modis arrangement with Pawar...         
	Its not a strong argument, but nothing better can be expected in an amateurish set-up with feudal tendencies. For example, most in the BCCI have been known to address Pawar as Saheb.         
	Former captains Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri, by the way, are the three ex-cricketers on the governing council.         
	Shashank Manohar became its member only on succeeding Pawar as the BCCI president. It took him a while to sense that something was amiss, but he did take the first step in the clean-up act by calling for fresh bids for the two new franchises.         
	That was on March 7 this year.         
	Five-six weeks later, the skeletons began coming out of the IPLs designer closet and a full-blown scandal erupted.         
	Had Manohar not intervened, and stopped a rigged exercise, its possible that nothing would have ever come out. Or, surfaced after the multi-million dollar property had probably suffered irreparable damage.         
	Already, there are a slew of corruption charges against Modi, who has been suspended from all posts, including those of chairman-commissioner of the IPL.         
	In the saddle till September 2011, Manohar has made it amply clear that the BCCI cant be seen as a corrupt body. Also, that hes obliged to expose those tarnishing its image.         
	As for Modi, he has moved the Bombay High Court for a stay on his summons by the reconstituted disciplinary committee of the BCCI.         
	While the plea has been listed for hearing on July 14, Modi has been summoned by Chirayu Amin, Arun Jaitley and Jyotiraditya Scindia on July 16.         
	The story, though, isnt going to end so soon.

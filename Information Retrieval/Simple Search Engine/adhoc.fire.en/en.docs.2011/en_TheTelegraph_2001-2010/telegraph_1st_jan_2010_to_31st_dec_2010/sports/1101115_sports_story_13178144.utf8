	Melbourne: An unflustered Stuart Appleby overtook the faltering Adam Bland and Daniel Gaunt to upstage champion Tiger Woods and win the Australian Masters at Victoria Golf Club by one shot on Sunday.         
	The 39-year-old Australian shot a six-under 65 to record a 10-under 274 and hold off the challenge of the overnight leader Bland (73) and Gaunt (71), who made a double bogey five on the par-three 16th shortly after he had seized the outright lead.         
	Woods, who was paid a reported $3 million appearance fee finished fourth after he shot his best round of the week, and equal best of the year, with a 65 to end on seven-under 277.         
	The 34-year-old American had started the day 10 shots behind Bland, before a scintillating finish in which he snared an eagle two at the par-four 15th, a birdie on the par-five 17th and an eagle three on the par-five 18th that resulted in a huge roar from the gallery packed tightly around the final green.         
	Appleby made six birdies, including one on the final hole to give himself a two-shot cushion over Bland and Gaunt, in a flawless round and ensured he snatched the $270,000 ($266,000) winners purse from his fellow Australians.         
	Bland had held a share of the lead since the first round but he was unable to maintain his consistency on Sunday.           (REUTERS)

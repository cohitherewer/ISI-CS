The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev: Was fighting for the country
                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev: Was fighting for the country
            JAYDEEP BASU                                Somdev Dev Varman with his singles gold medal,   in Guangzhou, on Tuesday. (PTI)      
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman and Leander Paes have one thing in common. Whenever they put on India colours, the transformation is incredible. They rise above their potential and at times, punch above their weight.         
	Tuesday was one such day for Somdev at the Aoti Tennis Stadium in Guangzhou when he demolished world No. 44 and top seed Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan 6-1, 6-2 in 82 minutes. In the process, he became the first Indian to win the mens singles gold medal in the Asian Games.         
	This was Somdevs second gold medal in the Games after having won the doubles gold with Sanam Singh on Monday.         
	Playing for India gives me a different feeling, Somdev told The Telegraph from Guangzhou.         
	It happened also when I played in the Commonwealth Games last month.         
	After all, it wasnt a battle to win an individual honour. I was fighting for the country.         
	Asked whom he would like to dedicate the medal to, Somdev promptly said: To the nation.         
	I won it for India and I would like to dedicate the gold medal to the people of India.         
	The 25-year-old is the fourth player after Leander Paes (Hiroshima 1994), Mahesh Bhupathi (Bangkok, 1998) and Prahlad Srinath (Bangkok 1998) to win a tennis singles medal at the Asian Games. None of his predecessors, however, could match Somdevs feat of winning the yellow metal.         
	With Somdevs victory, India finished the tennis competition with five medals  two gold, one silver and two bronze medals.         
	In Doha (2006), India had won two gold (mens doubles, mixed doubles) and two silver medals (womens singles and team).         
	His best moment, Somdev said, came after the final was over.         
	I was truly thrilled to see the tricolour going up and the national anthem being played. Such occasions always gives me an unbelievable feeling, said the world No. 106.         
	Never for a moment during the Games, Somdev said, had he felt tired about playing so many matches in a packed programme.         
	In the final I was totally at ease and had no problems in countering my rival (Istomin). I knew he was man of a great reputation but was confident of winning if I had played my natural game.         
	Somdev admitted that he did not think about winning the gold medal when he landed in China. After winning the Commonwealth Games medal, I was confident of doing well. All I wanted was to give my best but didnt know that I would end up with two gold medals, he said before signing off.

            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: All-rounder Sayan Sekhar Mondals double century, in a CK Nayudu Trophy (under-22) tie against Orissa, at the Kalyani Stadium, came a day after the Bengal squad for the Ranji Trophy was selected.

	I didnt expect anything I never expect. When its not in my hand, why should I? questioned Sayan when asked if he rued missing a chance.         
	Senior Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman too had a hand in his success. I had a few sessions with Raman Though he didnt talk about my batting, he had some advice for my bowling and that helped, Sayan, who considers himself to be a batting all-rounder, said.         
	Brief scores         
	Bengal 481/6 decl. (Sayan Sekhar Mondal 211, Sudip Chaterjee 121). Orissa 32/2 (Sayan Sekhar Mondal 1/0). Match to continue.

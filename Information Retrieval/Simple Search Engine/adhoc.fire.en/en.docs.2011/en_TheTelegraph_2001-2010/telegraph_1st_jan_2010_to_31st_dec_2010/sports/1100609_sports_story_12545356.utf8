The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ready to fire: The young guns
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ready to fire: The young guns
            Billy Witz                                    Denmarks Nicklas Bendtner is one of the Young Turks eager to make a mark on the world stage		      
	Every four years, young players use the platform of the World Cup to become household names. Heres a look at a contender from each group to emerge in South Africa.         
	Javier Hernndez (Mexico, 22)         
	Eighteen months ago, Hernndez was struggling to get on the field for Chivas de Guadalajara, questioning whether he should give up on his career. Now, after taking the Mexican league by storm, Hernndez, 22, has joined the vanguard of promising young Mexicans who have many thinking the country could advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since 1986. Known as Chicharito, or Little Pea, Hernndez has the type of game  athletic, strong in the air and decisive in front of the goal  that translates well on the international stage. At least that is the feeling of Manchester United Manager Alex Ferguson, who recently scooped up Hernndez for next season.         
	Lee Chung-yong (South Korea, 21)         
	It might have looked like a gamble last summer when Bolton Wanderers in England spent close to $3 million on a transfer of Lee, then a 20-year-old prospect with F.C. Seoul. But Lee became one of Boltons best players  and its biggest bargain  with his precise passing and dazzling runs down the flank. Lee is among a generation of South Korean players changing the countrys soccer reputation of having limited players who can be muscled out of a game.         
	Samir Handanovic (Slovenia, 25)         
	Handanovic, an athletic, 6-foot-5 goalkeeper, played a major role in clinching Slovenias trip to South Africa. Slovenia, which plays conservatively, allowed only four goals during qualifying  second in Europe behind the Netherlands two. Handanovic, who plays for Udinese in Italy, was dazzling in Slovenias 1-0 win over Russia in the second leg of their playoff. In that game, he made two outstanding stops in the final moments to clinch his teams World Cup berth. If he repeats that performance against England, Handanovic will have plenty of suitors from the Premier League.         
	Mesut Ozil (Germany, 21)         
	A consequence of Germanys losing its captain, Michael Ballack, to torn ligaments in his ankle is that the ball should find its way to Ozils feet more often. Ozil is the type of creative dribbler and playmaker that is rare for a team defined by its pragmatism. Ozil, who had 19 assists for Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga, has appeared in only eight games for Germany, the country he chose to play for despite overtures from Turkey, where his grandparents were born.         
	Nicklas Bendtner (Denmark, 22)         
	Bendtner has been bothered by a groin injury and has struggled to find consistency for his English club, Arsenal, but he has been at his best in big games. He scored five goals in five Champions League games last season and delivered two key goals  one at home, the other on the road  in qualifiers against Portugal. If Bendtner is at his best, Denmark  with its sound back line  could be tough to beat.         
	Marek Hamsik (Slovakia, 22)         
	Slovakia is making its first World Cup appearance, led by midfielder Hamsik, who has been a rising star in the Italian League at Napoli. He has fashioned his game after the former Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved, the longtime Juventus playmaker. Hamsik is so reverred in Naples that shortly after thieves stole his Rolex during a carjacking last year, Hamsik had the watch returned. Such good will may not last if Hamsik does anything to harm Italys chances of making it through group play when the teams meet June 24.         
	Gervais Yao Kouassi (Ivory Coast, 23)         
	Known as Gervinho and carrying a Brazilian flair, this forward usually operates in the shadow of Didier Drogba, Ivory Coasts powerful star forward. But with Drogba possibly sidelined for at least part of tournament with an arm injury, Gervinhos skilled dribbling will be counted on even more to create opportunities for Ivory Coast in a difficult group. He has reportedly drawn interest from Tottenham and Arsenal in England. If he shines against the likes of Brazil and Portugal, Gervinho, who helped put Lille of Frances Ligue 1 on the verge of a Champions League berth, may have more offers.         
	Alexis Snchez (Chile, 21)         
	Snchez will have the spotlight early in the tournament while striker Humberto Suazo is recovering from an injury. Snchez, nicknamed El Ni Maravilla (Wonder Boy), has already played for two of South Americas more prominent clubs  Chiles Colo Colo and Argentinas River Plate  before spending the last two years in Italy at Udinese. He also starred for the Chile team that finished third in the 2007 U-20 World Cup. No team scored more away goals in South American qualifying than Chile, and if its all-hands-forward attack is clicking, Snchezs footprints should be all over it.

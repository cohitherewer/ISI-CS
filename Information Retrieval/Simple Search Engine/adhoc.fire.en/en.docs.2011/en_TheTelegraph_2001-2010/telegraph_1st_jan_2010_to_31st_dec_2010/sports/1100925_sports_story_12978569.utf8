            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Action during the Salgaocar-Lajong match, in Cuttack, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Cuttack: Three-time champions Salgaocar Sports Club of Goa escaped from the jaws of defeat, to hold Shillong Lajong Football Club to a 2-2 draw in their Group D quarter final league match of the 32nd Federation Cup, at Barabati Stadium, here Friday.         
	The exciting draw kept Salgaocars hope alive for a semi-final berth but closed the doors for Lajong.         
	The Goan outfit, who earlier beat Mumbai FC 2-0, now have four points from two outings and would meet 14-time Fed Cup winners Mohun Bagan in their last match on Saturday.         
	On the other hand, the draw, of course, fetched last years runners-up Lajong their first point. But that carries no meaning for them as they failed to reach the last four.         
	Facing a must-win situation after their 1-0 defeat to Mohun Bagan two days ago, Lajong got off to an inspiring start. PL Lalhimthara headed home a cross from the right flank to take the lead in the 14th minute.         
	However, Salgaocar which looked off-colour in the first half, changed gear after the change of ends and equalised through their captain Luciano Sobrosa.         
	The Brazilian mid-fielder nodded home the goal from an Anthony Barbosa cross in the 63rd minute.         
	Lajong again regained the lead in the 86th minute when Boithang Haokip deflected a James Gbilee cross into net. However, the Goan side struck back two minutes later when their Japanese mid-fielder scored from a goalmouth melee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No debut Test cap for Haider!
                                                                                                                       7                                      No debut Test cap for Haider!
                      
	Karachi: It has been revealed that Pakistan wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider was not given the ceremonial Test cap, when he made his debut against England at Edgbaston, landing the PCB and the team management in England in a fresh controversy.         
	Well placed sources said that the team management had neither given the Pakistan Test cap to Zulqarnain nor bothered to hold the usual ceremony whenever a player makes his debut. They added that for inexplicable reasons manager Yawar Saeed told Zulqarnain he would be given the cap later.         
	Interestingly, during the same tour and in the series, the management awarded Test caps to Umar Amin, Azhar Ali and Wahab Riaz and also held the traditional cap handing over ceremony for them when they made their debuts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutias ready for big guns in Doha
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhutias ready for big guns in Doha
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	Calcutta: India skipper Bhaichung Bhutia was not disheartened by the tough draw for the 2011 Asian Cup and said it will be an once-in-a-lifetime experience playing against teams like Australia, Korea and Bahrain.         
	India are placed in group C and begin their campaign against the Socceroos on January 10. Bob Houghtons men will then take on Bahrain on January 14 in their second match before facing South Korea on January 18.         
	We have to be competitive and for that our preparation has to be top class. We cant afford to be lax, Bhaichung told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Bhaichung said he was not surprised by the tough draw. Look, it was coming since all the teams are strong. It could have been Japan or Saudi Arabia also. So no point talking about it being a tough group.         
	Bhaichung said that to prepare for the Asian Cup, the national team should play higher-ranked teams in the next seven months.         
	That will give the experience of fighting it out against tougher outfits. I am sure our coach (Bob Houghton) has similar plans, he said.         
	Bhaichungs national and club teammate Rennedy Singh said Houghton had told them about the possibility of getting clubbed with tough teams like Australia and South Korea.         
	In Dubai, during a meeting he told us not to be surprised if we were drawn against big teams. So mentally we were ready.         
	Frankly for me its a great chance to see some big stars in action. When will we get a chance to play Australia again? I dont know. Players like Tim Cahill will be there and I will be playing against them, he said.         
	Rennedy, in fact, played against idol Shunsuke Nakamura when India met Japan during the 2006 World Cup qualifiers.         
	Yeah, that was a great experience. But I must admit we were not that well prepared in 2004. But this time, under Houghton, we have improved and the next seven months will be very vital, he said.         
	If Rennedy is waiting to play against Cahill, Mehrajuddin Wadoo is dying to play against Manchester United and South Korea star Park Ji-Sung.         
	I am really waiting to play against him. I know I will not get a chance again to rub shoulders with stars like Park. So it will be a big opportunity for me, (almost) like playing in the World Cup.         
	At the same time, we wont be starry eyed and just go there for the sake of going. We have done a lot of good work in the last three months and the next seven months will be very crucial for us.

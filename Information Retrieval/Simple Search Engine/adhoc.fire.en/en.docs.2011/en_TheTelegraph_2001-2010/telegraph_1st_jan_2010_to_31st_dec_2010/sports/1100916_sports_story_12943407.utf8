            OUR BUREAU            Joshimar and Mohammed Rafique after their teams victory, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Club are all set to sack veteran coach Syed Nayeemuddin after the clubs shock exit from Federation Cup qualifiers, losing to Oil India 1-3, at the Satindra Mohan Dev Stadium in Silchar, on Wednesday.         
	After being locked 1-1 at the end of regulation time, Jayanta Basumatary and Manas Manjit Chetia scored in the extra-time to oust the former champions.         
	While Jayanta scored in the 102nd minute, Manas Manjit scored in the dying moments.         
	Mohammedan Sporting were leading till the 83rd minute when HL Routa equalised for the winners. This was after veteran Dipendu Biswas scored from a Hatchibuddin Mullick cross in the 36th minute.         
	In Calcutta, the furious Mohammedan Sporting officials have decided that the former India captain and coach wont be given any further time to sort things out.         
	We are sacking the coach. Period. With this performance, you cant coach a side like Mohammedan Sporting.         
	It was humiliating to lose 0-5 against East Bengal and its even more depressing that we have lost in the first round of qualifiers. Our president Sultan Ahmed is out of the country. Once he is back on Saturday, we will decide the name of the new coach, clubs football secretary and Ahmeds younger brother Iqbal Ahmed told The Telegraph, on Wednesday.         
	Another senior official, who regularly accompanies the team on outstation assignments, said: Players were getting frustrated with his methods. He still lives in the past and swears by it. He has no idea about modern coaching methods. Worse, he is not ready to upgrade himself, he said on conditions of anonymity.         
	Nayeemuddin, on his part, didnt offer any excuses for his teams shoddy performance. Yes, we played badly. The ground condition was also bad. But yes, we did play badly, he said after the match.         
	Although, a section of the officials want Shabbir Ali back in the saddle, the former India striker is unlikely to quit Port Trust, where he is the coach, before the CFL Premier Division ends. However, Shabbir might be back at the helm during the second division I-League.         
	Biswajit Bhattacharya and Prashanta Banerjees names are doing the rounds.

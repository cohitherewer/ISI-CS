The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 10-wicket loss for Bangla
                                                                                                                       7                                      10-wicket loss for Bangla
                      
	Hamilton: An abysmal all-round display from Bangladesh meant that New Zealand romped to a 10-wicket victory in just 8.2 overs in the Twenty20 International at Seddon Park here Wednesday.         
	A mediocre bowling performance was not helped by an error-ridden fielding effort by the tourists. The match was, however, already lost by the visiting batsmen, who were dismissed for an embarrassing 78, according to Cricinfo.

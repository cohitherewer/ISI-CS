The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle serves triple treat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gayle serves triple treat
                      
	Galle: Chris Gayle tormented Sri Lanka with a career-best 333 as West Indies took control of the first Test before declaring on 580 for nine, Tuesday.         
	Gayle became the first West Indian to score a triple century on foreign soil and the fourth player to score two triple centuries, joining Australian great Don Bradman, Virender Sehwag and compatriot Brian Lara.         
	With the batsmen swiping away the Lankan attack with ease on the placid pitch, Windies looked set for a huge first innings total but the dismissal of Brendan Nash (64) sparked a collapse and the hosts hit back to claim six wickets for 21 runs. Lanka will resume the third day on 54 for one.         
	Jamaican Gayle caressed Ajantha Mendis to the extra cover boundary to bring up his triple century, and promptly dropped down on his knees in celebration while his teammates applauded him loudly from their balcony.         
	Just when it seemed that Gayle could surpass Laras record mark of 400, spinner Mendis brought Sri Lanka back into the match with a great spell of bowling in the final session and claimed five wickets for 13 runs off 46 balls. He broke a 167-run fourth wicket stand between Gayle and Nash by trapping the latter lbw.         
	Gayle looked in control until he suffered cramps on his right leg after passing his previous highest score of 313 and had to be assisted by a runner. He struggled to handle the spinners and eventually was bowled between bat and pad by Mendis when he failed to get to the pitch of the ball.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Diego, players decline Presidents invitation
            Messis feel they are unworthy            Maradona                     
	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona and his players declined an invitation from President Cristina Kirchner to be received at the presidential palace because they deemed themselves unworthy.         
	The President  who succeeded her husband Nestor as head of state in December 2007  also stated that she had tried to speak to Maradona following the 4-0 hammering by Germany in Saturdays quarter-final but the legend was too upset to talk.         
	You know that this president shows her true colours to the people in the difficult moments and not just the good ones, the 57-year-old told a rally in the northern suburb of San Miguel.         
	And I invited our squad to come to the Pink House (the presidential palace).         
	The players refused because they felt they did not deserve such an accolade but I believe they are wrong because they all deserved it. I will wait for them.         
	Yes, long live Argentina, she added.         
	On Saturday, when Germany beat Argentina, countrymen were very sad, she said.         
	But have patience (gather your strength) in Maradona, the squad and the country, even if the sadness will last. I called him (Maradona) after his press conference on Saturday but he was not able to talk because he was crying.         
	However, like most Argentines, some of whom gave the squad a warm welcome at the airport, she offered her unqualified support to Maradona.         
	I offer my support because nobody has ever given as much pleasure on the pitch than Diego Armando Maradona gave us, she said.         
	We are proud of what they did and we are finished crying because weve begun to prepare for 2014, the President added.         
	Her speech went down well with her audience who answered with joyous cries of: Ole, ole, ole, ole, Diegoooo, Diegooooooo!.         
	Maradona, who has serious financial worries owing the Italian taxman nearly 40million euros in unpaid taxes and interest accrued, hinted on his return to Argentina that he was going to step down.         
	 Thats it. My cycle has finished, Maradona reportedly said as he arrived at his home. I gave all I had.                 (AGENCIES)

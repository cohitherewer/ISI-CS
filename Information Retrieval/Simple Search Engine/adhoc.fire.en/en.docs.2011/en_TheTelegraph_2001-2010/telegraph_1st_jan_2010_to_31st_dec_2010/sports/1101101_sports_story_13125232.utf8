                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Snowberry wins on opening day 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: With four favourites delivering the goods in Sundays seven-event card, punters took it as an auspicious start to the winter season. However, pool hunters rued the victory of the three outsiders who were mainly responsible for the heavy dividends in jackpot and two treble events.          
	Competition was tough in most of the races, including the main event, the 1,200m Wandering Angel Cup in which trainer Arti Doctors 11-10 favourite Snowberry managed to beat Entrepreneur, a John Stephens trained runner. Stephens, however, had a brace of less-fancied winners  Horse Raddish and Blood Rayne  to his name during the afternoon.           
	Trainer Jasbir Singhs Black Dahlia, in the Azilian Handicap, caused the maximum damage to the pool hunters but the handicapper was a delighted man, in view of a four-horse blanket-finish in the race. Black Dahlia came with a late surge to narrowly scored over Andrology, Island Rhythm and the 11-10 favourite, Secret Love, from trainer Harvinder S. Baths stable. Earlier, Baths Ajayajeet had made the every post in the 1,100m Royal Double Handicap a winning one.

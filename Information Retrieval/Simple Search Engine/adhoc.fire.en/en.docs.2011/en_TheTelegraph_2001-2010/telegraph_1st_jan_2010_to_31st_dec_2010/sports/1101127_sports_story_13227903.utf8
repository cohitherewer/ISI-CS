The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Can CSA afford Kirsten? 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Can CSA afford Kirsten?

	Calcutta/Johannesburg: South Africa is keen to avail Gary Kirstens services after his contract with India expires next year, but Cricket South Africa might not be able to afford him in the wake of a sponsorship row, according to a report.         
	Kirstens contract with India is till the 2011 World Cup in the sub-continent and according to the Afrikaans weekly Rapport, even though the CSA is interested in him, the Board might have to do way with him as long-time sponsor Standard Bank has stopped its sponsorship.         
	Ironically, the bank, taking financial strain and facing retrenchments of staff, announced the end of its sponsorship on the same day the CSA had set up a panel to find a replacement for current coach Corrie van Zyl, who will return to his position as head of CSAs High Performance Programme, in Pretoria, after the World Cup.         
	Rapport said it had reliably learnt that CSA had already been in discussion with Kirsten but is likely to be paid much less in comparison to what he gets in India, unless another major sponsor comes in.         
	Having led India to the top of the world Test rankings in December last year, Kirsten is the current favourite to take over as the new Proteas coach, even though he said that he has not committed to anyone yet.

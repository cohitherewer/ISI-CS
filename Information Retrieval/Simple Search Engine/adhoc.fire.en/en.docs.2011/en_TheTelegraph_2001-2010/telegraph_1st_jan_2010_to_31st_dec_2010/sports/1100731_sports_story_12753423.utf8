	Nottingham: Birthday boy James Anderson took five for 49 as England ripped through Pakistan on a day laden with wickets for the pace bowlers at Trent Bridge.         
	Mohammad Asif (five for 77) was the first to make the most of the conditions in an England collapse from an overnight 331 for four to 354 all out  losing their last six wickets for 17 runs.         
	But under persistent heavy cloud cover on day two of this npower Test series, Pakistan were always likely to struggle in reply.         
	Anderson and Steve Finn (three for 20) did not miss their cue, as the tourists stumbled to 47 for six on the way to 147 for nine when bad light brought an early close despite the use of floodlights.         
	Captain Salman Butt went in the 45 minutes before lunch, poking past his front pad to edge an Anderson outswinger behind to go for just a single.         
	Anderson produced a near unplayable ball to make Imran Farhat the first victim of the afternoon  bowled by one that was angled into the left-hander from round the wicket only to nip away off the seam and hit off-stump.         
	Finn made short work of Umar Amin, fencing the first of three catches to Graeme Swann at second slip from the last ball of the Middlesex fast bowlers first over. Umar Akmal went in mirror-image fashion to the same combination. Kamran Akmal was Finns third wicket for one run when he obligingly hung out his bat for a gully catch.         
	Previously, No.3 Azhar Ali had foregone his decision review system option when he was given out caught behind off Anderson.

	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir, who is seen as a future captain of Team India, spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes on Wednesday evening, shortly before receiving an award from the countrys President, Pratibha Patil.         
	The 28-year-old Gambhir, a World Sport Group athlete, spoke on a number of issues, including the spot-fixing scandal in the UK. He was candid.               
	Following are excerpts         
	Q Are you worried that, after the events of the past few weeks, a dropped catch or a run out involving you could actually be viewed with suspicion?         
	A (Grins) Everything depends on an individual and his conscience... Why would I be worried when my conscience is clear? One must have the passion to play for the country, not bookies... A player has to give his everything for the team and country, nothing else should come into play... My job is to give that 100 per cent and give my best shot... I cant worry about keeping everybody happy, nor can I keep everybodys mouth shut... When my conscience is clear, I dont need to lose sleep over what some may say. For me, its doing the right things and being on the right path.         
	Your take on the spot-fixing scandal featuring the Pakistan cricketers...         
	Look, as Ive said, individuals have to decide on what they should be doing... Surely, all the passion and energy has to go towards the cause of the team and country... To betray ones country has to be the biggest crime... For a sportsman, the ultimate is to represent his country... How can he even think of betraying it? I just cant understand... If somebodys conscience allows the selling of ones soul, then I have nothing to say.         
	What was your first reaction when the News of the World sting operation was made public?         
	I was shocked... It has sowed a doubt in the minds of people... Could this match have been fixed or could that one have been fixed? Millions of youngsters look up to us players and we have a responsibility to do the right things, to be proper role models. Cricket must be as clean as it can be... We should only look to play hard, but fair... Thats it.         
	India was hit by a match-fixing scandal 10 years ago... You were, then, aspiring to play for the country... What were your thoughts then?         
	Dont think I was too bothered... I was wholly focused on not losing my passion for the game and working hard to realise my dream... Few get the opportunity to represent their country and theyve got to respect that... Make the country proud, dont shame it, please.         
	What if a shady character sends you gifts, as was done with Irfan Pathan, four years ago?         
	Irfan did the right thing, informing the appropriate people... Look, bookies will approach those players they think they can (deal with)... Thats my reading...         
	Has anybody approached you?         
	No.         
	Do you have some sympathy for young Mohammed Aamer?         
	Generally, my sympathies are with every player, purely because of the effort put in to reach a particular level... In this case, however, I cant sympathise with somebody just because hes 18... If you betray your country and dent the image of a great sport, then youve got to be punished.         
	The way forward...         
	Its for the individuals to decide what they want to do... I dont, however, think anybody can say that such things (match-fixing/spot-fixing) wont ever happen again.         
	Is there a need for better education?         
	No... Are people told that committing a murder is a crime? So, why is it necessary to tell players that they shouldnt be betraying their country? Not necessary at all... Players arent infants that they have to be educated on something so obvious. With age, one gets to know what is good and what is bad, isnt it?         
	Moving away from the fixing issue... The last India-Australia Test series, at home in 2008-09, saw you cement your place in the XI. With a fresh series just over a week away, what are your thoughts?         
	That its going to be hard fought... No series against Australia is ever easy, for the Australians will do everything not to lose... Whatever the conditions and the situation, they give that 100 per cent... If you do well, then your confidence grows, because its such a competitive team and plays hard cricket.         
	Just what does it mean to do well against Australia?         
	Look, what matters the most is doing well for India, not against a certain opposition... Moreover, lets not forget there are other good teams, too... South Africa, Sri Lanka at home... Englands really improved... If I say I want to (specifically) do well against Australia, then Ill be putting myself under extra pressure.         
	Surely, a three-Test series would have given both teams a fairer chance...         
	I agree... In a two-match affair, if you lose the first Test, then you cant win the series... At best, you can look to draw it. Id say the margin of error gets smaller if only two matches are scheduled. Youve got to be on the button on all the days.         
	A right knee injury kept you out of the last two Tests, in Sri Lanka. Are you absolutely fine now?         
	Hope so, yes... Thats why Im playing the three-day game in Chandigarh (captaining the Board Presidents XI against Australia) from Saturday... I completed my rehab at the NCA, in Bangalore...         
	Do the somewhat frequent injuries leave you worried?         
	Leave me frustrated... Dont forget one gets more nervous while making a comeback... I havent played for two months and, so, I wont be taking to the Australia series with a lot of cricket under my belt. It takes time to get into rhythm. (After a pause) Id like to play as much as possible, which is why injuries leave me frustrated.         
	Couldnt you play in Delhi?         
	No, because of all the rain.         
	Rankings dont drive you, but from No.1 youve slipped to No.13 in Tests. You must be disappointed...         
	Youre right, rankings dont drive me... Id be far from happy if I was No.1, but the team wasnt... That were still No.1 (in Tests) is reason enough to be happy... Even when I was No.1, what gave more joy was being in form and contributing to the team. Whats important is producing quality cricket and trying to make a difference... I dont take the India cap for granted.         
	Youd like to reclaim the No.1 position, isnt it?         
	Id like India to remain No.1 for as long as possible.         
	[In 32 Tests, by the way, Gambhir has an average of 52-plus.]         
	At one time, the 2011 World Cup was some distance away Today, its a matter of five months. Your take?         
	Oh, theres a lot of cricket left to be played... We have three big series coming up  Australia and New Zealand at home, then in South Africa... Should we do well, well carry that confidence forward into the World Cup.         
	The final one... Have you been in touch with your India opening mate, Virender Sehwag?         
	(Laughs) Yes... The other night, I went over to his house for dinner... We didnt talk much cricket, though... When theres a break, its best for it to remain that way!

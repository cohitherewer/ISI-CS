	Durban: Spain captain Iker Casillas believes that his squads teamwork and commitment to attractive football are the reasons why it has made it to the World Cup semi-finals, while teams led by superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have not.         
	Casillas captains the European champions in a national record 53rd match  Wednesdays semi-final meeting with Germany. We know that the Germany match is the most important in our history, Casillas said ahead of Wednesdays game at Moses Mabhida Stadium. Even more than the Euro 2008 final in Austria.         
	The image of Casillas raising the trophy after that 1-0 victory over Germany is ingrained in Spanish football history since they ended 44 years without a major triumph for the perennial dark horse.         
	With a little patience weve been able to win the respect of world football, said Casillas, who saw the decision to entrust an attractive, possession-based game begin under former coach Inaki Saez.         
	The past two or three years Spaniards have been winning titles at the club level and with the national team and thats been important for Spanish football.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Intra-team rivalries flavour of the season
                                                                                                                       7                                        Intra-team rivalries flavour of the season
            Tom Cary                      Hamilton and Button                             
	The countdown to one of the most eagerly awaited Formula One seasons in living memory begins in earnest this coming week.         
	From the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart to Ferraris factory in Maranello to Vodafones UK headquarters in Newbury, the biggest teams will be rolling out their 2010 machines and the best drivers pontificating on their chances of success.         
	Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher  the bookies favourites for the title, in that order  will no doubt say they are feeling excited and confident about the challenges ahead. Hot air, the lot of it. With the exception of Schumacher, who is stepping out of retirement at the age of 41, they said much the same last year and look where it got them.         
	The reality is that until the first group test in Valencia, which starts on Monday, there is simply no way of knowing which team has best adapted to this years major rule change; the ban on in-race refuelling, which means teams must carry a mountain of gas from the start to last them through to the finish.         
	Amongst the platitudes, though, there will be some fascinating insights into how this season could pan out, mainly from the point of view of intra-team rivalries.         
	Jenson Button, Felipe Massa and Nico Rosberg  teammates to Hamilton, Alonso and Schumacher respectively  are fifth, sixth and seventh favourites with the bookies. This despite the fact that the first is the reigning world champion, the second has been with Ferrari four years longer than Alonso and nearly took the 2008 world title, and the third is 17 years younger than his compatriot.         
	Egos will undoubtedly collide at some, if not all, of these teams over the months ahead and their body language this coming week will be intriguing to watch. Button, for one, sees himself on an entirely even keel with Hamilton. He told us this week he is a lot more confident as both a driver and a person than he was in 2009.         
	I deserved to be world champion, he said, but there are still areas that I can improve on, which is great news for me. Not so good for everyone else but great news for me.         
	McLaren have had two world champions in their team before, the highly acrimonious partnership between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna eventually ending in tears. It begs the question: can two Alpha males really exist in one team?         
	I think were quite different people from those two, although strangely enough, our helmet colours are the same, Button said. Look, of course were going to be fierce rivals. But if were fighting for sixth or seventh, in reality who cares? If were fighting for first, thats what counts. And the only way well be fighting for first is if we work together.         
	A nice sentiment and one that will no doubt be repeated across Europe over the coming days. Whether the fireworks can remain under wraps remains to be seen.

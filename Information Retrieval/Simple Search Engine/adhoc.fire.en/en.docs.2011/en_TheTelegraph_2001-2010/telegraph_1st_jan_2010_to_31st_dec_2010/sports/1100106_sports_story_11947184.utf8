	Brisbane: Kim Clijsters career comeback continued to gather momentum Tuesday with a 6-0, 6-3 win over Australias Alicia Molik at the Brisbane International.         
	Top-seeded Clijsters won the first eight games in the second-round match until Molik, playing her first top-tier tournament since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, held serve.         
	In mens doubles first round action, Leander Paes along with partner Lukas Dlouhy defeated the Austro-American pairing of Carsten Ball and Sam Querrey 7-5, 6-3 to advance.         
	Having Clijsters and Henin on the opposite ends of the draw sets up the possibility of an intriguing all-Belgian final in Brisbane in the lead up to the Australian Open. Ana Ivanovic struggled in a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 win over Timea Bacsinszky in a late match to reach the quarter finals.         
	On the mens side, third-seeded Gael Monfils edged American Taylor Dent 7-6 (1), 6-7 (5), 6-2 in a night match that didnt feature a service break until the fifth game of the third set.         
	James Blake continued his dominance over fifth-seeded Sam Querrey, improving to 6-1 in head-to-heads with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over his fellow American.         
	In other first-round matches, Marcos Baghdatis beat Mardy Fish 7-5, 7-5 and will next face fourth-seeded Tomas Berdych, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Australian qualifier Nick Lindahl.

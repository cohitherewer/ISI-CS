The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mueller feels ecstatic
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mueller feels ecstatic
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Thomas Mueller has said he never believed he would win the Golden Boot before the World Cup began.         
	The 20-year-old German forward, who made his international debut in March, scored five times at the World Cup to clinch the award.         
	David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlan also scored five goals, but the Bayern Munich mans three assists saw him edge out the trio.         
	This is just incredible for a newcomer to the World Cup. If anyone had told me Id end on eight scorer points, Id have said they were kidding me, Mueller said.         
	Its an honour of course, but at the end of the day, Id rather have had the World Cup itself.         
	Muellers performances in helping Germany reach the semi-finals in South Africa also won him the Best Young Player award.         
	Its a huge honour to be part of a group including the likes of Pele, Franz Beckenbauer, Michael Owen and the most recent winner, Lukas Podolski, added Mueller.         
	For me, personally, its a terrific confirmation of the work Ive put in over the last year.         
	Im delighted that my great run has continued here, and Ive really enjoyed it too. The honour will be with me for all time, and its a wonderful memento too.         
	Uruguays Forlan won the Golden Ball award after lighting up the Cup with some wonderful goals that helped his team become South Americas only semi-finalist.         
	Forlan took 23.4 per cent in the Golden Ball poll organised by world soccer body Fifa and voted for by journalists.         
	Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder was second with 21.8 per cent and Spains David Villa third on 16.9 per cent.         
	As well as winning the World Cup, Spain also took the Fifa Fair Play Award. Their captain Iker Casillas won the Golden Glove prize for best goalkeeper.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Alemao blasts Colaco
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The battle of words between Churchill Brothers and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) heated up on Saturday when club patron Churchill Alemao accused AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco of overstepping his limit.         
	Last Wednesday, Alemao was show caused by the AIFF for criticising the standard of refereeing in the I-League and for pointing out that the AIFF was one of the few national associations without a full fledged department for the referees appointments.         
	In his reply to the AIFF, Alemao questioned Colacos authority to issue him a letter and also asked him how the AIFF secretary tore off the invitation cards sent to him by the club for the AFC Cup match in Goa recently.         
	We are pained to read in newspapers about the comments made by you regarding Indian officials (referees and their assistants) Colaco had written in a strongly worded show cause to Alemao, asking for a reply within seven days.         
	The I-League champions, who have made it to the quarter finals of the AFC Cup, have sent a copy of the letter to the AIFF president Praful Patel.

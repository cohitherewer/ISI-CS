                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI rubbishes talk
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has, in a strongly worded media release, rubbished any talk of an understanding being reached with those espousing Lalit Kumar Modis cause.         
	On Thursday afternoon, chief executive officer Ratnakar Shetty said: Mr. Arun Jaitley and Mr. Ram Jethmalani met yesterday (Wednesday) night for some other matter not connected to BCCI. The statement made by Mr. Mohammed Abdi, General Counsel and Constituted Attorney of Mr. L. K. Modi, regarding some understanding being reached is totally false and BCCI denies the same.

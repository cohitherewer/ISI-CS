	Jaipur: A raised wooden structure, erected on the north-west stands of the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, collapsed during the India-New Zealand ODI Wednesday causing panic among spectators. The incident, that took place a few minutes after the New Zealand innings got over, left a few people with minor injuries.         
	Luckily for us, no one was seriously hurt, said an official of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA). Our appeal to the fans through the public address system to stay calm also helped, he added.         
	Shortly after the incident, the RCA felicitated Asian Games medal-winners from the state on the side of the north west stands.

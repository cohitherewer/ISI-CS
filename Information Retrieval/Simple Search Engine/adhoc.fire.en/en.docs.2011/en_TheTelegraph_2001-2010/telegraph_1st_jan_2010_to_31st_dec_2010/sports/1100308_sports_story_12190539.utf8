The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dav wants Hodge as opener
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dav wants Hodge as opener
    - KKR coach picks the Mumbai Indians as favourites           A STAFF REPORTER                Brad Hodge,Manoj Tiwari                                  
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team management is thinking to play Australian batsman Brad Hodge as one of their openers in the absence of Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum during the first few matches of the third edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Hodge, who joined the KKRs training session on Sunday evening, looked in fine touch, as he seemed to be pretty comfortable during the nets at Eden Gardens.         
	Hodgey (his nickname) is a fine addition to our squad. He looked good at the practice session today (Sunday). Along with David Hussey, he has been one of the key players for Victoria in their KFC Big Bash T20 triumph. Also his performance in this edition of Sheffield Shield has been really good. We are looking at him as one of the possible opening option, KKR coach Dav Whatmore said at a media conference on the day.         
	Hodge had scored 276 runs in four innings for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield. In the KFC T20 Big Bash, he scored 171 runs in seven innings.         
	Whatmore also feels that Hodge wouldnt look out of place although he has now retired from first-class cricket.         
	Hodges opening partner, in all likelihood, will be Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary. Saurashtras Chirag Pathak is also an option.         
	Will Hodge be demoted once Gayle and McCullum join the team? No thats not what we think. If Hodgey does well at the top of the order, he will certainly continue playing at that position. I firmly believe that the person who is in form should be persisted with in a particular position, Whatmore said.         
	On a different note, Whatmore feels that Ishant Sharmas one-on-one session with Wasim Akram would be of immense help for the youngster.         
	If Ishant benefits from Akrams advice, it will not only be of help for the KKR but also for the national team, the coach said.         
	The coach was, however, on the defensive when asked whether fielding was an area of concern for his team. The question was asked referring to the dropping of catches during the practice matches.         
	As we are nearing the start of the tournament, we are gradually improving. We have identified the areas we need to work upon and those areas are being addressed. It is a continuous process. Not that if we are taking catches means that we stop working hard on our fielding. We have to work hard on each and every aspect of the game, Whatmore said.         
	Asked which team is the favourite, Whatmore said: On paper, the Mumbai Indians look to be a good side.         
	The Knights matches will be held on three pitches out of the nine that have been laid at the Eden Gardens. The pitches that will be used are pitch No. 4, 5 and 6. Pitch No. 5 is the centre strip where the recently concluded Test match between India and South Africa was played.         
	Whatmore, in fact, praised the pitches. The Test match strip still looks a good one. Also, the pitch No. 6, which has been newly laid, looks to be a true strip.         
	Even curator Prabir Mukherjee, who was lauded for presenting a good strip during the India-South Africa Test said that the pitches will be ideal to suit T20 cricket.         
	We are preparing a pitch that will be devoid of any moisture. It will definitely have a good carry, but there wont be any lateral movement for sure. The bowlers who hit the deck hard will benefit but not those who rely on swing.         
	If we keep moisture and the ball starts moving around in the evening, there will be low-scoring matches. T20 is all about entertainment and I cant rob the crowd from that. 180-200 will be par for the course, Mukherjee said.

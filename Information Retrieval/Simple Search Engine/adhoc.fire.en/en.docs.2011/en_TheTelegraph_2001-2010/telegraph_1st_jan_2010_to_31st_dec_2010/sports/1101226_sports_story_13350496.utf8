The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Essien gets a heros welcome 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Essien gets a heros welcome 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	When Michael Essien was growing up, he was told that only street boys played football. In Ghana  a country that places huge value on education  the barefoot games, on scraggy, rock-strewn pitches in his hometown were seen as a distraction from the serious business of studying.         
	 My mum said I had to go to school first, said Essien, recalling his youth in his quiet, unassuming way. People used to say that it was only street boys who played football. It meant you were no good at school  and that was important to me.         
	But as Essiens Chelsea prepare to face Arsenal on Monday, the street boy is hoping to show why he is such a vital member of a Chelsea team fighting to regain their form after a troubled few weeks.         
	I am really looking forward to it, he said of the forthcoming duel against Arsne Wengers men. It should be a great game. They are a great team, and difficult to play against. Its always difficult to go there. But we will do our best and take the fight to them.         
	Certainly, manager Carlo Ancelotti will be hoping that Essiens fighting spirit will reinvigorate his ailing side.         
	Chelsea have dropped to fourth in the Premier League and are struggling to regain their early season form, having lost three and drawn three of their last six matches. In their first five games the side managed to score 21 goals, but have only managed to find the net twice in their five recent games.         
	 Weve had a very bad patch, he admitted. Obviously, we have a long way to go. But we are trying to change things around. I dont think there is any problem [inside the club]. These things happen in football, but we have to accept this and try to win  thats what counts.         
	And certainly, the return of Essien after a three-match suspension  gained following a red card from a reckless two-footed challenged on Fulhams Clint Dempsey  will add some fire to Chelseas lukewarm recent performances.         
	The 28-year-old midfielder, softly spoken and endearingly shy off the pitch, is a force to be reckoned with on the field  earning him the nickname The Bison.

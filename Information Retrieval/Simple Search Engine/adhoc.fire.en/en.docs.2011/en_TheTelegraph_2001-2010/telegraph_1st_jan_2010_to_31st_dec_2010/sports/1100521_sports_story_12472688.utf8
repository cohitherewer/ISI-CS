	After four years of maintaining his innocence about doping charges that ruined his reputation and caused him to be stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title, American cyclist Floyd Landis has sent e-mail messages to several cycling officials in the US and Europe in which he admits using performance-enhancing drugs for most of his career.         
	Two of those officials said that Landiss messages provided a detailed description of doping that began in 2002, Landiss first year alongside then-teammate Lance Armstrong. Both were riding for the successful but now-defunct United States Postal Service team. The two officials who received the e-mail did not want their names published, citing ongoing investigations, including by federal authorities, into the content of the e-mail.         
	In the messages, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Landis accused other top American cyclists on the Postal Service team, including Armstrong, of using performance-enhancing drugs and methods. Other cyclists named were current United States road racing national champion George Hincapie, three-time Tour of California champion Levi Leipheimer and five-time United States time trial champion David Zabriskie.         
	None of those riders, who are all competing at this weeks Tour of California, were available for comment Wednesday.         
	Jonathan Vaughters, team manager of Zabriskies Garmin-Transitions team, said that Zabriskie was upset after learning of Landiss accusations late Wednesday.         
	I dont know what is in the head of Floyd Landis, what his motivations are, but I think Dave just wants to get on with this race, Vaughters said of Zabriskie, who is in the overall lead of the Tour of California, with four stages to go. Dave can win this race. He can win this race clean, under any level of scrutiny.         
	Steve Johnson, chief executive of USA Cycling and the main recipient of Landiss e-mail messages, did not return several calls for this article on Wednesday.         
	Landis also did not return phone calls, but told a sports channel that he had no documentation to prove most of his claims against former teammates. I want to clear my conscience, said Landis, who races with the lower level OUCH-Bahati Foundation Pro Cycling team. I dont want to be part of the problem anymore.         
	Landis provided detailed information about his own doping practices, saying he consistently used the blood-booster EPO to increase his endurance, testosterone, human growth hormone and blood transfusions.         
	He said he took female hormones and tried insulin once during the years he rode for the Postal Service and Swiss-based Phonak teams. He spent $90,000 a year on his doping regimen, he said.         
	For Pat McQuaid, president of the International Cycling Union, Landiss accusations do not taint Armstrongs reputation one bit.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

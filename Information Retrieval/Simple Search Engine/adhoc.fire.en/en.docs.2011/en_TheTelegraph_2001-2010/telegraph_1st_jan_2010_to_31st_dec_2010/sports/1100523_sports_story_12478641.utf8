            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: When the hand that makes the rule bends it, more often than not expect trouble. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) realised that on Saturday when they faced the wrath of East Bengal officials who alleged the association of double standards.         
	The controversy was regarding the decision to cover the pitch and the bowlers run-up after the first days play of CAB two-day league quarter final between Mohun Bagan and Kumartuli, at the Eden, saw an early end due to rain.         
	According to the CABs rule book, except for the semi-finals, final or relegation play-off matches, there is no provision for providing pitch covers during league matches.         
	As a result, miffed East Bengal officials, led by cricket secretary Tapan Das, lodged a verbal protest with the CAB and heated arguments followed.         
	However, both the parties had different tales to narrate at the end of the meeting.         
	On East Bengals behalf, Das said: We came to protest about the incident. When we had asked for pitch covers during our match against Kalighat (on Wednesday/Thursday), the umpires had refused citing rules. Then how was it possible today? However, since the CAB has accepted their mistake, the matter is over now.         
	CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra, on the other hand, reasoned that the CAB was not at fault and it was just a case of misunderstanding. They (East Bengal) misunderstood the situation. When they had requested for pitch covers, it was after the match had begun and so it wasnt allowed. But in this match, both Mohun Bagan and Kumartuli had requested for the cover before the toss So its a different issue, Mitra said.         
	When asked if such a situation could have been avoided, Mitra said: May be if we had discussed the matter with all the eight quarter finalists, like we did during the CAB knock-out matches, we could have avoided this controversy.         
	Coming to the match, Mohun Bagan were 82 for one after 20.1 overs when play was stopped.         
	The other quarter final match, between Town Club and BNR, at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, will be replayed after it was cancelled due to rain.         
	Brief scores         
	Mohun Bagan 82/1 vs Kumartuli. Match to continue.

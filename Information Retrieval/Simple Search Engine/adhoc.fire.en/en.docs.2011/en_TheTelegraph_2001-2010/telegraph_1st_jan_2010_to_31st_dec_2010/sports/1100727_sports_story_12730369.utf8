The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka put India on the mat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lanka put India on the mat
    - Centurions Sangakkara, Paranavitana feast on toothless attack             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Colombo: In the lead-up to the second Test, taking 20 Sri Lanka wickets had been Team Indias No.1 worry. By stumps on the opening day, at the SSC, the immediate concern was prising out 10 wickets!         
	With the first Test centurions, captain Kumar Sangakkara (130 not out) and opener Tharanga Paranavitana (100), again registering three-figure knocks, India were in an all too familiar position in Sri Lanka.         
	On the mat, that is.         
	If the non-availability of Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir came as bad news before the toss, on Monday, worse followed, at the ceremonial moment: Mahendra Singh Dhoni failed to call correctly one more time.         
	To succeed at the SSC, its imperative to bat first and post an intimidating total at a fast clip. From an Indian perspective, that will have to wait, at least, till the next Test series.         
	Dhoni, incidentally, has won the toss only six times in 15 Tests.         
	At the close, having already taken the lead in the Micromax Cup, Sri Lanka were a formidable 312 for two, with senior-most pro Mahela Jayawardene keeping the classy Sangakkara company on 13.         
	Yet again, Indias bowling got exposed with a capital E. In fact, in recent years, one cant recall a more timid attack, the problems compounded by the failure of Harbhajan Singh, the most experienced, to open his account in the series.         
	Harbhajan did try variations, but Sangakkara, in particular, is in great nick and he did his bit to make the off-spinner lose confidence.         
	One can, in the circumstances, sympathise with Dhoni.         
	Another two sessions of domination by Sri Lanka, on Day II, and India will be on their way to losing the No.1 ranking in Tests.         
	Sri Lankas total was built around two partnerships  99 for the first between Paranavitana and Tillekaratne Dilshan (54), then a massive 174 for the second involving the left-handed centurions.         
	Dilshan, who would surely have given himself a kick in the back, if possible, rued having failed to make the most of an excellent start. Not just a hundred, on this wicket, I shouldve aimed for a double, he told The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra.         
	The disappointment showed.         
	Indias bowlers did slow things down in the last session, which produced the least runs (77, as opposed to 128 and 107 in the first two, respectively), but had only Paranavitanas wicket to show for their effort.         
	Abhimanyu Mithun, playing his second Test, was a trifle unlucky at times. As for the much more experienced Ishant Sharma, he ought to have exploited the bounce on offer, especially early on.         
	When conditions arent the most conducive, bowlers often need to gamble. There was nothing to suggest such an approach had even been contemplated.         
	All the smart moves came from Sri Lanka  the way Paranavitana composed his innings and the manner in which Sangakkara didnt allow the bowlers to make any impression.         
	The opener had a 35-run headstart, yet his captain reached his hundred (23rd overall) just a few deliveries after him.         
	Both hundreds of the 28-year-old have been at Indias expense.         
	Well start the game as underdogs... Indias still No.1 and were at No.4... Theyre expected to win, not us, Sri Lankas assistant coach, Stuart Law, a former Australia batsman, had said on Sunday evening.         
	Well, Sri Lankas certainly rewriting the definition of an underdog. Pity that no more than a handful were present at the SSC.         
	Sri Lanka, incidentally, have fielded a totally new attack. Dilhara Fernando, Dammika Prasad and Ajantha Mendis have made a comeback, while Suraj Randiv is a debutant.         
	Meanwhile, according to manager Ranjib Biswal, Dhoni, whose back required some attention towards the end of the day, is fine.         
	Footnote: Blood tests on Yuvraj have not shown up traces of either swine flu or dengue. Thats comforting news, a well-placed source pointed out.

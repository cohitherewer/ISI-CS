	Calcutta: A star-studded Air India soared above defending champions Indian Oil to lift the 115th edition of the Beighton Cup, at the Sports Authority of India complex, here on Wednesday.         
	Air India dazzled in their maiden show in the prestigious tournament and displayed similar form on the final day to outclass Indian Oil, registering a 2-1 victory.         
	Air India struck both the goals in the first-half through Birendra Lakra (12th) and Vikram Pillay (34th). Indian Oil, however, fought back after the changeover as they reduced the margin through VR Raghunath in the 48th minute.         
	Indian Oil, in fact, begun the match promisingly earning two penalty corners within the first 10 minutes. With former India forward Prabhjot Singh looking for early inroads, the defending champions looked the better team.         
	Prabhjot almost converted the second penalty corner but for some brilliant work by Air India custodian Adrian DSouza.         
	However, Indian Oil weathered the early storm and regrouped to display a better brand of hockey. With their midfield play, they maintained a better possession of the ball. Repeated forays into rival half finally bore fruit in the 12th minute when Lakra found a brilliant field goal.         
	Boasting three players from the Asian Games squad  Vikram Pillay, Arjun Halappa and Gurbaj Singh  Air India took firm control of the match after that.         
	Before Indian Oil could settle down, the Dhanraj Pillay-coached side doubled the lead through Vikram, who was also adjudged Player of the Tournament.         
	In an intense second-half, Indian Oil suddenly found some hope when Raghunath banged the board from the teams third penalty corner.         
	Raghunath, however, was unfortunate 12 minutes later when his thundering drag flick beat keeper DSouza but found the right post in its way.         
	Dhanraj Pillay said that the match was tough. As the scoreline suggested it was not an easy win for us. But in the end, I think our experience saw us through. The likes of Halappa, Gurbaj and Vikram had a superb game.         
	Pillay said Beighton Cup is one tournament which every hockey player in the country wants to play. I have some cherished memories about this presitigious tournament.         
	Asked if he would once again like to be the brand ambassador of Bengal hockey  he was so some years back  the former India hockey captain said he was game.         
	Last time I could not do much. But this time if I am offered, I will definitely try to do something.         
	Earlier, last years runners-up, South Central Railway, settled for a third place, defeating Punjab Sports Club 5-1. Amit Srivas (49th, 53rd), Janardhan Gupta (32nd), Mayank James (64th) and B Horo (69th) scored for South Central Railway. Pawan Bassi struck the solitary goal for the Punjab outfit.         
	Apart from being the runners-up, Indian Oil also lifted the Fair Play Trophy.

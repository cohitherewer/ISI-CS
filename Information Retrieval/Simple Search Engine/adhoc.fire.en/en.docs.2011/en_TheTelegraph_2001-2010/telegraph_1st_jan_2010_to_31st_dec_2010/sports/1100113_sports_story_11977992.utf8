                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger will bounce back, says Jeev
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh firmly believes Tiger Woods would be back on top in three months time.         
	Talking to newspersons after he was named the brand ambassador of the US based sports goods company Callaway, Jeev said Woods was too good a player to remain in oblivion for long.         
	Asked to comment Woods personal problems, Jeev said: I cannot comment on his (Woods) personal life. But he is a fantastic player. I think in the next three months, hell be back with a bang. He will surely go on top once he makes a comeback.         
	Jeev also said he was looking forward to play in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.         
	I know 2016 is still a long way to go, but I am happy that golf has been included in that Olympics, said the Chandigarh-based professional. I am willing to play there. If Tim Watson can play at the age of 65, then why cant I last till 55?

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A string of injuries may have robbed Chirag United from the services of some of their key players, but the Subrata Bhattacharjee-coached side didnt fluff in their 3-0 hiding of Mohammedan AC on Friday. The last years runners up, who are above defending champions Mohun Bagan in the league table, made a comeback after losing to Peerless SC in their last CFL premier division encounter.         
	While Mohammedan centred their attacks through skipper Saidee, Chirags foray into the opponents goal was channelled through Joshimar Da Silva.         
	Though Chirag created ample goal-scoring opportunities, it was substitute Gouranga Biswas who orchestrated the first goal for his side. The winger collected a pass from Chika Wali and raced through the left channel and as he cut inside, the Mohammedan keeper darted out to deny him a shot at goal.         
	But Gouranga passed it to Nascimento Silveira who tapped it home with his left foot. Mohammed Rafique produced the second for Chirag when he ran almost 30 yards and beat the keeper by curling the ball in. Even though Chirag dominated the entire second half, they seemed to go for the jugular in the last 10 minutes.         
	Last seasons top scorer Joshimar scored the third goal just six minutes before the final whistle. With Fridays win, Chirag have 17 points from nine games, while Mohammedan FC have six from 10 outings.         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Abhijit Mandal, Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, Nascimento Silveira, Lal Kamal Bhowmick (Sukhen Dey, 75), Joshimar Da Silva, Subash Chakraborty (Gouranga Biswas, 65), Mohd Rafique, Arnab Mandal, Melvin Rodrigues, Chika Wali, Munna Mallick (Sabir Ali, 50).

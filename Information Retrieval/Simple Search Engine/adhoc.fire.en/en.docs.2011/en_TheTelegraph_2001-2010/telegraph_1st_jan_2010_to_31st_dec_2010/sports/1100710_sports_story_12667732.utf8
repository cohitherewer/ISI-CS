The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dutch fear Spanish flair
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dutch fear Spanish flair
  - Popular vote is with Spain, but Dutch coach believes team can sweep the stakes
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: The Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk has more than one problem to grapple with on the eve of Sundays World Cup final against Spain at Soccer City.         
	There is already a huge hype over a possible Spanish triumph in the final, especially after their dazzling display against Germany. Most experts, including Germany coach Joachim Loew, have predicted a difficult outing for the Dutch who will be looking to stop the Spanish armada in their bud to lift the Cup for the first time.         
	To add to the Netherlands discomfort, a section of past Dutch masters, and that includes Johan Cruyff, has decided to put its money on Spain.         
	Marwijk, though, has managed to remain calm under pressure. After returning from Cape Town, where they defeated Uruguay in the semi-final, the Dutch team checked into a hotel in the Parktown area here and hardly stepped foot outside the premises.         
	The coach allowed the boys two days rest, resuming training only on Friday when the team went to the Wits Rugby Stadium for a behind closed-doors practice session.         
	The Dutch fans present here, however, are upbeat. They hang around the team hotel to get a glimpse of the stars and follow the team when the Arjen Robbens leave for training.         
	Despite all the talk of Spain being the favourites, Marwijk kept a brave face and said his team were not afraid of anyone.         
	We know Spain play attractive football and that they did very well against Germany, Van Marwijk said. But that doesnt mean we are afraid of them.         
	Both the Netherlands and Spain are bidding for their first World Cup title.         
	At the moment, I think Spain play a little more attractively than we do. Altogether, we would like to do the same. They have a few more advantages right now. There are no secrets for us with Spain. We are not afraid, said the 58-year-old coach.         
	It is a pity that the Netherlands, the only team to have won all their matches so far at the current World Cup, are not being fully backed by their former players.         
	Spain are favourites to win the World Cup, Cruyff said after the finalists were decided. Against Germany, they dazzled us and played football as they know best.         
	They (the Germans) play a kind of football that, without a doubt, would have been enough to beat any other team. Germany knew what they were going through, just like Holland are probably thinking now. Even Ronald de Boer a former Dutch international, was sceptical about his teams chances.         
	In a brief interaction with The Telegraph, De Boer said: I am not sure what is going to happen. Spain are a brilliant side, playing very well. Our team have to give everything if they are to have any hope of success.         
	Marwijk has chosen to ignore the negative comments.         
	We have our feet on the ground and the focus on the match, he said. What happened before my time, with all due respect, I dont look at it. I do things my way, we play good football and, sometimes, beautiful football, but we are neither arrogant nor over-confident.         
	Meanwhile, Arjen Robben said does not really care how the Dutch win as long as he can lift the trophy         
	 quot;Id rather play an extremely ugly game and win, instead of a beautiful one and lose, quot; Robben said.

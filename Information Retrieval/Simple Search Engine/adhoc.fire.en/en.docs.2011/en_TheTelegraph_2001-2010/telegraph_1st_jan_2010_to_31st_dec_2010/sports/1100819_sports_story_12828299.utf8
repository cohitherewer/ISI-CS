	Calcutta: Arti Doctor-trained Romantic Impact, an easy winner in his last outing, cashed in on his form to score another victory in the 1,400m Brown Wolf Cup, the main event in the Wednesdays six-event card. Apprentice Babu Singh partnered the five-year-old to a pillar-to-post victory over Samarkhand and Aemilia while the even-money favourite, Mothers Pride, finished a poor fourth in a field on five runners.

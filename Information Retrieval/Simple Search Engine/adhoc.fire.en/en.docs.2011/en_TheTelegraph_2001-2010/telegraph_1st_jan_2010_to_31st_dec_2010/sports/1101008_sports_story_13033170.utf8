The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar is above all awards, says Kapil
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tendulkar is above all awards, says Kapil
            A STAFF REPORTER            Kapil Dev in the city, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar may have got his maiden International Cricket Council award on Wednesday, but his one time teammate and World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev believes that the maestro is above all awards.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of a promotional, Kapil said: Sachin is above all awards. He does not require any more recognition. No award can make him greater than he already is. His contribution to the sport is unquestionable.         
	Referring to Indias thrilling one-wicket victory against Australia, in Mohali, the former all-rounder said that he prefers a Test win hundred times more to a one-day International or Twenty20 victory. I am hundred times more happy with the Test win, than I would be for an ODI or T20 win, Kapil said.         
	The man with 434 Test wickets to his credit batted for the longer version of the game as he added: If there are only 4 Tests in a year, as compared to 50 ODIs and T20s, where is the scope for Test to retain its place? It is important the team play a good amount of Test cricket.         
	He partly blamed the media for Tests losing popularity.         
	Asked to choose between Indias Test win against Australia, and Indias successes in the Commonwealth Games, Kapil said: Each victory has its own importance. No one can or should compare Every sport should grow, and become popular.         
	He, however, admitted to being very tensed during the last few overs of the Mohali Test. I watched the match with bated breath. It was a nail-biting finish. I was very tensed while watching.         
	Asked if betting should be legalised to discourage fixing, Kapil said: Match-fixing should not occur. That is what I feel. I know match-fixing is not desirable in any format of the game, but I do not have much knowledge about what the government is thinking or if legalising can change anything. Fixing is just unfortunate.         
	He, however, did not sound too happy with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as he averted any question related to the Board. I have nothing to say regarding the BCCI. I am still related to cricket. If you ask me to come and teach, I will do so, without taking anyones permission, was all Kapil had to say.

	Calcutta: The venue for East Bengal election could not be decided at a meeting held at the club tent, on Thursday. The election, which will take place on January 30, was supposed to take place at Sakhawat Memorial School. But the current office bearers opposed the move and have suggested St Xaviers College, Presidency College, Town Hall or Netaji Indoor Stadium as an alternative venue.         
	Special officer General Shankar Roychowdhury has told the current office bearers to decide the venue by Sunday. Roychowdhury also said that this time the voters would have to carry an identity proof along with the club membership card to cast their votes.

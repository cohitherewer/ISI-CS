	Calcutta/ St Johns: West Indies off-spinner Shane Shillingford has been banned from bowling in international cricket because of an illegal action, the sports governing body ruled on Tuesday.         
	The 27-year-old was reported by on-field umpires Steve Davis and Richard Kettleborough after the Galle Test, against Sri Lanka, last month. Shillingford can appeal to ICCs Bowling Review Group against the finding of the independent analysis.         
	Meanwhile, in spite of the ICC sanction, the Shillingford was picked in the preliminary 30-member list for next years World Cup.         
	THE probables: Lionel Baker, Adrian Barath, Carlton Baugh Jr, Sulieman Benn, Dave Bernard Jr, Tino Best, Devendra Bishoo, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Jonathan Carter, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Kirk Edwards, Chris Gayle, Ryan Hinds, Jason Holder, Anthony Martin, Nikita Miller, Nelon Pascal, Kieron Pollard, Kieran Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Andre Russell, Darren Sammy, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shane Shillingford, Devon Smith, Gavin Tonge, Devon Thomas.

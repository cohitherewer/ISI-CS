The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Age problem haunts CAB
                                                                                                                       7                                      Age problem haunts CAB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The problem was there last year and it is back to haunt the Cricket Association of Bengal this year too. And it is bigger this time.         
	Of the 48 Under-16 players, who underwent medical tests, 27 were found to be clinically overage. That means that more than 50 per cent of the players, who were in CABs plans for the Vijay Merchant Trophy, have been ruled out.         
	Last year too, nine players from Bengals Under-16 squad were found to be overage.         
	Speaking on the issue, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: This is something which is beyond our control. We just check the birth certificates before the domestic tournaments since we cant afford medical tests for everyone. But when checked medically (according to the BCCI guidelines) these boys fail the test.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB is working on the construction of a cricket museum, on the lines of the one at Lords, at the Eden. CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya is personally overlooking the matter and plans are on to get it completed before the 2011 World Cup.

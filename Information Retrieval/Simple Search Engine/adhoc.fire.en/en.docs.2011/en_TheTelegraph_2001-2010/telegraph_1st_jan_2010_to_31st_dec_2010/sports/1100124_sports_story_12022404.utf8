	Abu Dhabi: Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur turned in a matching 72 to surge two places at tied 54 even as Jyoti Randhawa and SSP Chowrasia missed the cut after the third round of Abu Dhabi Open golf tournament here Saturday.         
	Playing his back nine first, Jeev birdied the 10th and 18th hole with a lone bogey at the 16th to make the turn at one-under.         
	On resumption, the Chandigarh golfer picked up a birdie on the first but a ninth hole double bogey undid his good work as he finished the day at level-par.         
	Shivs day was no different as his brilliant back nine was followed by a disappointing front nine.         
	Three-under at the turn with the help of birdies at the 10th, 15th and 16th hole, Shiv stumbled upon a rough patch on his front nine.         
	After a bogey at the second hole, Shiv recovered with a birdie at the sixth but a bogey and a double bogey in the last two holes spoilt his day.         
	At the top, German Martin Kaymer blasted a five-under 67 to grab the lead, while Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy also carded an identical 67 to lie tied second.         
	Kaymer is on course to win his second title here after taking a one-stroke lead in Saturdays third round.         
	Kaymer, who won the title two years ago, fired his third successive five-under-par 67 to finish on 201, 15 under.         
	The 25-year-old Kaymer, who is seeking the fifth European Tour title of his career, is competing with two metal plates in his left foot  the legacy of a go-kart crash last year which put him out of action for more than two months.         
	I know how this feels because two years ago I was leading as well, he told reporters. I was leading by six and tomorrow I am only leading by one so it will be nice to shoot another 67.         
	I really like this golf course in general and especially coming off such a long break, five to six weeks when I was in America, you arrive feeling motivated and cant wait to play golf again, Kaymer added.         
	McIlroy had three birdies in four holes on the front nine and was delighted to pick up another stroke at the last to move within one shot of Kaymer.         
	Today was great and I thought the scoring was very good considering it was quite windy but I am really pleased with a 67, said the Northern Irishman.         
	I didnt make too many mistakes and Ive put myself in a great position... it should be a good battle tomorrow.         
	Poulter spoiled a run of three straight birdies when he bogeyed the fifth. But he recovered by picking up more strokes at the eighth, 15th and 18th.         
	It was nice to birdie two, three and four but a shame to give one back on five and from there I kept hitting good golf shots, kept giving myself chances, said the Englishman.         
	I am happy and it should be good fun tomorrow afternoon with Rory and Martin.         
	Earlier, the start of play was delayed by more than two hours due to fog.           (PTI)

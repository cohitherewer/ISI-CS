	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwarys solid 59 helped Bengal beat Jharkhand by 15 runs in the East Zone T20 meet in Cuttack on Thursday.         
	Bengal won their first match against Assam by eight wickets. They have two more matches left, against Tripura and Orissa.         
	Batting first, Bengal made 132 for five in their 20 overs. Jharkhand were restricted to 117. Sreevats Goswami and Wriddhiman Sahas early dismissals reduced Bengal to 22 for two but Arindam Das and the Bengal captain then got together to add 98 runs for the third wicket. Das contributed 42.         
	Tiwary played a fantastic innings... It was not the kind of wicket where you could go and score runs easily, coach Woorkeri Raman said.         
	In reply, Jharkhand started off well but the regular fall of wickets put paid to their hopes. R. Kumar scored 43 but failed to receive much support from any of his teammates.         
	Meanwhile, Assam beat Tripura by 6 wickets in a East zone T20 match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Cuttack, on Friday.

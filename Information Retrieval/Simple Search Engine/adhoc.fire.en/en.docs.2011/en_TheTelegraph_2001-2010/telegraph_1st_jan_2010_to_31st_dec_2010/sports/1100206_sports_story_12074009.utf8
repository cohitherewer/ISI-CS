                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Ordained One for Stakes 
            HONKY DORY                        
	Mumbai: All the 10 events in Saturdays card, are studded with trophies but the 1,400m Kunigal Stud Breeders Produce Stakes promises a tough competition for the winners purse of over Rs 20 lakh. Of the nine horse in the fray, the race appears to be a close contest between Ordained One, Star Empire and Tender Romance - all convincing winners in their previous outings.           
	However, Ordained One seems to have improved substantially and the S. Ganapathy-trained horse may hold the other two at bay in the hands of jockey B. Prakash.

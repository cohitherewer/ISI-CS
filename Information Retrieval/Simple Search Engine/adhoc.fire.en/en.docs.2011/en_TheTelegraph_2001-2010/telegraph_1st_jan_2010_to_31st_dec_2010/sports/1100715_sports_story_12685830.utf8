The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal aim to end drought
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bengal aim to end drought
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal coach Shabbir Ali might just be interested with this piece of information  since its inception in 1941, Bengal have won the Santosh Trophy whenever they have been the host.         
	The Indian Football Association (IFA) has organised the national football championship on eight occasions (the last one being in 1987), and the home team have always had the last laugh.         
	The 29-time champions and 41-time finalists will be eager to end their 10-year trophy drought as the tourney kicks off with a triple-header on Thursday.         
	With the teams divided into eight clusters, its still a couple of weeks before the defending champions Goa, runners-up Bengal, last years semi-finalists Services and Tamil Nadu will be seen in action when the quarter finals start. Since the advent of the I-League, a tournament like Santosh Trophy bears little or no significance.         
	Earlier, Santosh Trophy used to be a pre-season tournament where the players would be eager to perform in order to get a good deal from a club. Now, with the transfer window being open round the year, it really doesnt matter much. And, as if to prove that this school of thought is spot on, the IFA has also played their part by being lackadaisical in their approach.         
	In fact, nowadays, the officials of the top clubs are sceptical about releasing their players for the Santosh Trophy since an injury to a player will only complex matters for them.         
	That is specifically the reason why Shabbir Ali has treaded a cautious path by selecting mostly junior players in the probables list who are eager to prove a point along with some established seniors who still have the burning desire to do well for their state.         
	It is a fact that Bengals decade-long trophy drought started once it was decided that only local players will play for their respective states. The moment Bhaichung Bhutias, Jo-Paul Ancheris and I.M. Vijayans were not allowed to play Santosh Trophy, Bengals performance graph took a nosedive. However, it will be a different ballgame this time as the home advantage is likely to work in their favour. Also, with some big names sweating it out in Portugal (for a camp of the national team), most of the top sides will have depleted squads.         
	On Thursday, the Vijith Shetty-led Maharashtra will take on former Mohun Bagan stopper Sanjiv Marias Chandigarh, in a Cluster II match. In another match of the same Cluster, Andhra Pradesh will take on Tripura.         
	Clusters (I-VIII)         
	Cluster I: Karnataka, Meghalaya, Jharkhand; Cluster II: Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura; Cluster III: Punjab, Gujarat, Nagaland, Pondicherry; Cluster IV: Manipur, Jammu amp; Kashmir, Rajasthan; Cluster V: Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh; Cluster VI: Sikkim, Haryana, Chattisgarh; Cluster VII: Kerala, Uttarakhand, Asam, Himachal Pradesh; Cluster VIII: Railways, Mizoram, Orissa, Chattisgarh.

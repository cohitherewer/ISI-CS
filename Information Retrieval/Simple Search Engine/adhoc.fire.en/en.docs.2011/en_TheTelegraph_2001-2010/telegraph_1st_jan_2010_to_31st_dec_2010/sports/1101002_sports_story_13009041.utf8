The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer swings it in Indias favour 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zaheer swings it in Indias favour 
            SUDIPTO GUPTA                      
	Mohali: It doesnt really matter whether the knife drops on the apple or the apple drops on the knife -- both yield the same result. Mahendra Singh Dhoni amp; Co. dropped themselves on the knife, in disguise of Shane Watson, and paid the price for it.         
	Watson came into the first Test at Mohali with a good practice match against the Board Presidents XI, and, on Friday, made the most of two dropped chances to register his second Test hundred. The burly Australian opener slammed an unbeaten 101 to take the visitors to 224 for five at the end of the first days play. Tim Paine remained unbeaten on 1 after Dhoni grassed a sitter.         
	Watson, who is yet to be dismissed in this tour, slammed eight boundaries. For those interested in facts, Watsons first Test century came through a single from a dropped catch just like the two lives that helped him get to his second Test ton on Friday.         
	That the scoreline doesnt read 224 for three was due to Zaheer Khan reversing Indias fortune towards the fag end of the day. The left-arm pacer was devastating in his last spell as his reverse swing snared two Australian wickets, leaving the match evenly poised.         
	Zaheer first trapped Michael Hussey with one that moved out late as the ball crashed on to the Australians pads. The second victim of his reverse swing, Marcus North (0), was undone by what according to Watson was the best delivery of the day.         
	While North thought it safe to leave the ball which was moving in from off-stump, Zaheer believed that the cherry evaded the stumps on its way to the keeper. To Zaheers wonder and Norths surprise, it was found that a sublime kiss of the ball had dislodged the bails!         
	Husseys 76-ball ordeal produced a meagre 17.         
	Amidst a series of dropped catches and the misfortune of losing Ishant Sharmas services, the only consolation for Dhonis men was their success in stifling the scoring rate. And that was not through a negative line, but by some tight bowling from the Indian spinners. Pragyan Ojha leaked just 39 runs from his 31 overs, while Harbhajan Singh picked up the wicket of Michael Clarke giving away 69 off his 29 overs.         
	However, Ricky Ponting, for whom India has been the land of unfulfilled promises, had an impressive day until his needless run out. Pontings flair was on display and even Harbhajan didnt manage to bother the Aussie skipper much. His well-made innings of 71, comprising 10 hits to the fence, was stalled when Suresh Rainas direct throw found him short of the crease.         
	And, in what might be the first of many verbal duels, Zaheers taunt at Ponting after his dismissal heated up things in the middle. As Ponting turned back to give the Indian pacer a mouthful, the umpires intervened.         
	Earlier, the day began with despair and joy for India. Virender Sehwag committed the crime of dropping Watson off Zaheer in the second ball of the day. But Zaheer struck by removing Simon Katich (6) in the fifth over.         
	The early bite in the pitch provided some uneven bounce, never threatening enough though. Ishant was tidier in his first spell, mixing things up appreciably. Dhoni even granted a change of ends to Ishant, hoping for a change of luck.         
	Unfortunately, the lanky speedster lost his rhythm, dishing out four no balls in one over. In all, the Delhi pacer served up eight no balls out of 10 at the end of the first days play. Ishants luck worsened when he limped off the ground with an injured knee in the 37 th over.

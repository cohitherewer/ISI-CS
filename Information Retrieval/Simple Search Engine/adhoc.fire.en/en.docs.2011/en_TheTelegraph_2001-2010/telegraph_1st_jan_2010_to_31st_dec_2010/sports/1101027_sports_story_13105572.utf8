The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dress rehearsal before I-League
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dress rehearsal before I-League
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The 123rd edition of the Durand Cup beginning Wednesday at the Ambedkar Stadium could well turn out to be a test event for several clubs on the eve of the I-League.         
	Among the 12 teams in the fray in the quarter final league, seven are I-League sides, who would be eager to test their strength at the national level before the league kicks off on November 27.         
	While East Bengal and Chirag United are the two teams from Calcutta, Goas Churchill Brothers and Salgaocar, Pune FC, JCT and Air India are the other I-League sides in the 12-day competition. Dempo were also to take part but withdrew at the last moment.         
	Gone are the days when Durand Cup was considered the countrys most prestigious meet with the month long tournament attracting near capacity crowd almost every evening.         
	For the past few years, it is struggling to stay afloat, as the teams have now shifted their focus more on the I-League and the Federation Cup.         
	Similar to the last few years, this time, too, the teams here would be without their top players, who are currently busy in the national camps for the Asian Cup and the Asian Games. Fearing lack of spectators interest, the organisers have decided to do away with the ticketing system.         
	Last year, both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal played in Durand, yet our gate sale was so low that it couldnt even cover up the printing cost for tickets, said a tournament official.         
	This time we have taken a decision to throw the gate open for the crowd.         
	Though Churchill Brothers are the defending champions, the tournament committee is pinning its hopes on 16-time winners East Bengal to be the crowd pullers. Having won 16 matches on the trot, the red and yellow brigade are placed with Air India and Salgaocar in group D. Chirag are in group B along with Pune FC and qualifiers Indian Air Force.         
	On the opening day, a depleted Churchill will take on MEG Bangalore. With eight of their players in the national camps, the Goa side will once again be heavily dependent on their Nigerian striker Odafe Okolie to deliver the goods.

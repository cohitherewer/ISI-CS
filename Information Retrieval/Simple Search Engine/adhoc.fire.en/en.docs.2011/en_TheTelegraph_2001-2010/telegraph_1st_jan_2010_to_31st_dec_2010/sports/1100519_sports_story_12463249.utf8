The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting praises Clarke
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting praises Clarke

	Sydney: Australia Test skipper Ricky Ponting has praised Michael Clarkes Twenty20 captaincy despite the players own assessment that his position in the team was in doubt after poor form with the bat in the Caribbean.         
	Clarke led Australia to the final at the World T20, but finished the tournament with a high score of 27 and the lowest average among Australias specialist batsmen.         
	Hes had a bit of exposure now, a few one-day games that I havent been a part of and, obviously, a lot of the Twenty20 games in the last 12 or 18 months that hes stepped in and captained. Hes done a terrific job, Ponting, who retired from the shorter format last year in a bid to prolong his career, told reporters.         
	Every time that Ive seen Michael in a leadership role, hes done exceptionally well. So, really good signs there for the future of Australian cricket going forward.         
	Clarke is regarded as Pontings successor in One-Day Internationals and Test cricket, and told reporters that he expected selectors to have a look at his captaincy and place in the team after Australias loss to archrivals England.         
	Ponting will lead Australia when they attempt to wrest back the Ashes from England at home at the end of the year and is hoping the team can arrange Test matches against India before that series to get more practice in the longer format.         
	Top-ranked India had suggested sacrificing some ODIs in favour of Tests as part of a mooted tour in October. Australia have reacted positively to the offer, knowing they only have two Tests arranged against Pakistan in July before their five-Test series against England kicks off in November.

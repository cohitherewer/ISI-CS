The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jose: Oezil can give Real a lot
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jose: Oezil can give Real a lot
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Jose Mourinho has backed Mesut Oezil to be a key player for Real Madrid for a decade. The Germany midfielder completed his move to the Bernabeu from Werder Bremen on Tuesday for a fee believed to be in the region of $15 million (around 12.4m).         
	Hes a player who can play for Real Madrid for 10 years, Real coach Mourinho said after his side drew 1-1 with Standard Liege in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday.         
	His contract was running out so we could get him at a lot less than his actual market value.         
	With Kakas injury, Oezil and Sergio (Canales) are two players who can give us a lot.         
	The young German with Turkish roots was, of course, very excited to be joining the best team in the world.         
	I spoke to my advisers and looked at the options but I always wanted to join the best team in the world, and to play under the best coach in the world, Jose Mourinho, Oezil said at a news conference at the Bernabeu.         
	I chatted with him and he convinced me. What we spoke about will remain between him and me but thats why I am here.         
	The arrival of the 21-year-old Oezil has sparked another round of speculation surrounding the future of Rafael van der Vaart.         
	The Holland midfielder scored Madrids goal on Tuesday, but did not celebrate  a fact some took to mean he was on his way out of the club.         
	But Mourinho said: For us it was just a training match. The result was not very important. I dont give any importance to the fact that Van der Vaart did not celebrate his goal. I didnt (celebrate) either. It was a friendly.         
	For me, Van der Vaart is still as important as before Oezils transfer. As always, I will listen to the wishes of the players.         
	Mourinho declared himself happy with his business in the transfer market this summer.         
	It has been a low-key recruitment drive as compared to last year, with Oezil very much the headline name on a list which also includes Canales, Sami Khedira, Ricardo Carvalho, Pedro Leon and Angel di Maria.         
	In a market that is affected by the bad economic situation, without making a signing like Kaka or Cristiano (Ronaldo), the club has invested enough, he said.         
	One player seemingly not making the move to Madrid this summer is Romelu Lukaku, the 17-year-old Anderlecht striker who has caught Mourinhos attention.         
	His father is very intelligent and will not let his son go now, said Mourinho. We will see next season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach wants Murali magic
                                                                                                                       7                                      Coach wants Murali magic
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss Wednesday said his players were hoping that Muttiah Muralidharan bows out of the longer version with a victory by producing another memorable performance on the final day of the first Test.         
	It was the first time I saw him show a bit of emotion, after he took five wickets, throwing his arms in the air. So, I am sure he is very happy with the way things have gone for him so far. We all hope that he can finish it off just as well (on Thursday), Bayliss said at the post-match news conference after stumps on day four.         
	Muralidharan has already taken six wickets in the match, including a five-for in Indias first innings, to be just two scalps short of the 800 Test wickets mark.         
	Bayliss said that even for the final match of his Test career, Muralidharans focus on his game was as intense as it has been all these years but added that he respected the offies decision to retire         
	Its obviously his call. Hes made the decision, Bayliss said. Obviously he knows how his body feels. Personally I feel hes made the right call. Before this match he bowled as many balls at nets as hes done before for all the previous Tests. He obviously didnt want to take it easy. He wanted to do well.         
	The Australian conceded that the home conditions had helped Lankans seize control in the first Test but maintained that his boys had also played better cricket.   
	DAY 4 HIGHLIGHTS  
	 Virender Sehwag rsquo;s (109) century was his 20th in Test cricket, 19th as an opener, 19th in the first innings, ninth away from home, fourth vs Sri Lanka, and third in the year 2010.  
	 When on 109, Virender Sehwag became the ninth player to score 1,000 runs against Sri Lanka in Tests. He is also the fifth Indian to do so. Sehwag now has 1,000-plus runs against Australia, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka.   
	When he claimed his third wicket, Muralidharan became the first bowler to take 100 wickets against India in Tests.   
	 It was the 67th instance when Muralidharan claimed a five-wicket haul in Test matches and the seventh such instance against India. Forty of the previous 66 instances have resulted in wins for Sri Lanka.   
	 When on 12 (second innings) Rahul Dravid became the second player to score 9,000-plus runs at No. 3. Only Ricky Ponting with 9,447 has scored more runs in this position.  
	 Of the previous 31 matches where India has been forced to follow on, they have won once, lost 22 and drawn eight .

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal coach Shabbir Ali was a disappointed man at the end of his teams 1-2 defeat at the hands of Tamil Nadu, in the Santosh Trophy, on Wednesday.         
	 What can you say when your team create chances only to miss them and the defence breaks down? Shabbir said.         
	He also denied that the electrical fault at the stadium, which distracted the players, was the sole reason for the their loss. That can be one of the reasons, but we are to blame ourselves for the loss, he said.         
	He was also worried with the fact that they will have to face Goa in the semis. Things will now be difficult. We are also unsure about striker Shankar Oraons status as he suffered a knee injury, Shabbir said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was very emotional, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      I was very emotional, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	They had to win the match and Mahendra Singh Dhoni ensured that the Chennai Super Kings did it in style. Dhonis thundering unbeaten 29-ball 54 gave the Super Kings a six-wicket victory over the Kings XI Punjab, at Dharamshala, on Sunday, and saw them seal a berth in the semi-finals of the third edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, the Super Kings captain praised Suresh Raina and S. Badrinath for setting the stage for the win.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Dhoni: It was a tough match You cant always perform in a tight situation but Im happy we clicked today. Everyone contributed towards this victory. Raina and Badrinath batted excellently to set the stage for us. Then, after the winning runs were scored, it was a very emotional moment for me When your franchise spends such money on the players and the team, you should at least make it to the semi-finals. With the kind of team we have, we should have qualified for the semis much earlier. So, I was really emotional after we earned the last-four berth. I think the crowd started supporting me towards the end because they wanted to see more sixes! Its like a lottery from here on With the tournament entering the knockout stage, it could be anybodys game. One bad over can take away the match from you. But we do have some good players like Raina and (Matthew) Hayden who can turn the course of a match.         
	Sangakkara: The last over cost us the match They required 16 from the last over and it was a pretty difficult job. But we failed to keep the ball in the right areas, didnt get the yorkers right So, basically we lacked discipline. All through the tournament, we have been good in patches It has been a season of ups and downs and one thing is sure  weve been lacking in consistency.

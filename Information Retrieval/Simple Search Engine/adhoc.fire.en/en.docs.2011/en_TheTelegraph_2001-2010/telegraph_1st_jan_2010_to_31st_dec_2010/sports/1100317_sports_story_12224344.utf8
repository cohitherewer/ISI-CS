	New Delhi: East Bengal will have a tough task at hand as they take a strong Lebanese side Al Nejmeh without striker Bhaichung Bhutia in an AFC Cup match in Beirut Wednesday.         
	The red-and-gold brigade, trying to come out of the disappointment of their 1-4 thrashing at home at the hands of Al Ittihad of Syria, suffered a jolt as national captain Bhutia could not accompany the side due to a muscle tear on his right leg.         
	A loss will severely dent the hopes of East Bengal of finishing among top two sides from the four-team group to make it to the knock-out round of 16. (PTI)

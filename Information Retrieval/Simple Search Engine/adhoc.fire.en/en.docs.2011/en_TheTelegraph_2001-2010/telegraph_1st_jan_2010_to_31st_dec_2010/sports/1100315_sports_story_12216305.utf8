The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Heat on Bangladesh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Heat on Bangladesh
                      
	Chittagong: England put themselves on course for victory in the first Test against Bangladesh on Sunday after building a huge 434-run lead on the third day, despite losing five wickets in quick succession.         
	The tourists ended the day on 131 for the loss of five wickets in their second innings after opting to bat again instead of enforcing a follow-on despite having a 303-run first innings lead.         
	Off-spinner Graeme Swann completed his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests to help England, who had declared their first innings on 599 for six, bowl out Bangladesh for 296.         
	Mahmudullah had England captain Alastair Cook caught by Aftab Ahmed at fine leg boundary for 39 runs. Shakib then dismissed Jonathan Trott, who was smartly caught by Zunaed Siddique at square leg for 14.         
	Kevin Pietersen, off the mark on his second ball with a four, batted aggressively until Shakib had him lbw for 32 runs. The former captain struck five fours and a six in his 24-ball innings.         
	Razzak then removed Michael Carberry (34) and Paul Collingwood (three) in successive overs to give the home side something to cheer with in an otherwise lopsided match so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru back to scare Lankans
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru back to scare Lankans
    - Tri-Series Final Toss-up between Tyagi and Sreesanth for third seamers slot           INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Virat Kohli in Dhaka on Tuesday. (AP)                                 
	Dhaka: Virender Sehwags batting has been an enigma the Sri Lankans, like most other teams, have failed to unravel. His carefree approach and the tried and tested method of see the ball, hit the ball has pulverised the islanders in the past couple of months.         
	Not without reason has his no-show over the last three days kept the rumour mills working overtime. Even assurances from manager Arshad Ayub werent enough to calm the doubting Thomases.         
	On Tuesday, at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in nearby Mirpur, Sehwag set to rest all misgivings about his fitness. He was the first to alight from the team bus for an optional session in the afternoon.         
	Showing no signs of discomfort but slightly perturbed by the unwanted media focus, he said: I was just taking rest I got a break for the last two games and decided to stay at the hotel. I am absolutely fresh and looking forward to the final.         
	Except for Sachin Tendulkar, no batsman in the recent past has had so much influence on the outcome of a match as Sehwag. It is thus not too difficult to see why Ian Chappell has called him the new Bradman.         
	Sehwag was candid, too. I know Im a good player. Im backing myselfNot doing anything special, but giving myself a little more time.         
	Indias best bet in the Idea Cup final Wednesday batted for more than half-an-hour at nets before participating in other drills. Another solid start at the top with Gautam Gambhir will, no doubt, go a long way towards ruining Lankas chances.         
	It will not just be Sehwag. Virat Kohli, too, has made the Lankans sit up and take notice. The solidity he provides in the middle-order saw Team India script three successive victories in the lead-up to the title clash.         
	Kumar Sangakkara admitted Kohli can make a difference. Yeah, hes batting well and weve just got to avoid bowling to his strengths... Bowl more to the field that we set, he said.         
	The Indians will be back to their full strength with Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khans inclusion. The only bone of contention will be whether to play Sreesanth or Sudeep Tyagi. While the latter has impressed in the two games he has played here, the former has been wayward and expensive.         
	Sehwag said they were better placed to win the trophy. Were hoping to do well. We have been playing them for the past couple of months and are better placed.         
	The dew factor looms large even though the matches have been advanced by half-an-hour. No doubt, the teams will have to devise plans to offset the advantage conceded by losing the toss. Sangakkara has a plan in place and hopes it will work. Im sure it can be done Nothing is impossible. If you get a good total and bowl a disciplined line in the evening, you can win, the Lanka captain said.         
	Sehwag was pragmatic too. Yes, the toss is important, but weve got to play well. If we play good all-round cricket, the toss will have no bearing on the outcome, the India vice-captain said.         
	Sangakkara will be feeling the pressure too, especially after the reverses against India in both the Tests and one-dayers. The batting will revolve around Tillekaratne Dilshan, though the Indians claim to have sorted him out. The experienced Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara cant be ruled out too.         
	Their bowling, however, has been a worrying factor. Except for Chanaka Welegedara in the first match and Suraj Randiv, none of the bowlers have impressed. That against an in-form Indian line-up could go a long way towards deciding the result of the match. The momentum, in all probability, is with India.

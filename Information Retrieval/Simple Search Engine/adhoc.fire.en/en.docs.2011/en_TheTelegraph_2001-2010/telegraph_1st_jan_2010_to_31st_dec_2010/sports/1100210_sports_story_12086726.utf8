The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas finish it in four days
                                                                                                                       7                                      Proteas finish it in four days
            SUDIPTO GUPTA                      
	Nagpur: How often do our convictions convict us? Whatever be the answer, one thing is for sure, when that happens, even the champions are pulled down to the pits and as the target seems to fade into the horizon, we are left wandering as to what exactly led to the misfire.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co.s defeat against the South Africans by an innings and six runs, in the first Test of the Jaypee Infratech Cup, in neighbouring Jamtha, on Tuesday, could serve as an example.         
	This Test series versus the Proteas was the brainchild of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It was organised in order to give India a chance to ensure a longer stay at the top of the Test rankings table.         
	But one wonders whether they picked the wrong opponent. Because unless the current No.1 side emulate the challengers and manage a victory in the second Test at Eden Gardens, South Africa will be No.1.         
	On Tuesday morning, the last bit of hope withered away when Murali Vijay (32) and Subramaniam Badrinath (6) bit the dust even before lunch.         
	Vijays fall was almost self-destruction. He was caught by Morne Morkel at fine-leg off Paul Harris, while trying a needless extravagant sweep.         
	Badrinath was undone by the angle created by left-arm pacer Wayne Parnell from round the wicket, and was pouched by wicket-keeper Mark Boucher, who was back in the thick of things after missing half of the day on Monday with a back strain.         
	Parnells ploy of going round the wicket, in fact, troubled the Indians all through the day. He induced an edge from Sachin Tendulkar (100) when he was on 45, but Jacques Kallis dropped the chance.         
	Dhoni and Sachin, however, had kept the hardcore optimists awake with some restrained batting.         
	The duos 70-run partnership came to an end when Sachin fell in the most unfortunate manner. While trying a paddle sweep off Harris, just after he had reached his 46th Test century (91st international century), the cherry hit his pad and arm guard before going on to hit the stumps.         
	Harriss seemingly ordinary left-arm spin did the trick for the visitors on the day. Pitching his deliveries continuously on the rough outside the leg stump, Harris won the battle of patience against Dhoni, who used his legs for fending the ball for the better part of the duel.         
	After that, it was just a matter of time before the South Africans embraced a deserving victory.         
	However, debutant and Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha (36), Harbhajan Singh (39) and Zaheer Khan (33) did their best to delay the inevitable. While Saha was patient in his 101-ball knock, the other two went the slam-bang way, hitting ten boundaries and three sixes between them.         
	Saha, who was dropped from the squad for the second Test, said after the match: Ive no comments about the selection issue. Ive never thought about those things.         
	Man of the Match Hashim Amla, who was instrumental in the victory with his unbeaten 253 in the first innings, said: A double century is always special and it came at an important time of my career. It wasnt easy at all against the Indian spinners.         
	Four days in Nagpur have thrown up four important questions for Team India. Why did Zaheer and Ishant fail to get the reverse swing going while Steyn and Morkel did it like wizards?         
	Why couldnt Harbhajan even match the skills of Harris? Why did the sum of 22 individual innings fail to surpass the total put up by eight South Africans? And, why has the No.1 side in the world looked so pathetic with only two key players missing?         
	We all hope Dhoni and his men will not let us ask the same questions at the Eden.

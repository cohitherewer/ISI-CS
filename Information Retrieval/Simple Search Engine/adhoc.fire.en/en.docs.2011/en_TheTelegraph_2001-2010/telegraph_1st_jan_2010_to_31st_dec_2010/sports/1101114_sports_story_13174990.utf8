	Abu Dhabi: Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull stepped up the pressure on championship leader Fernando Alonso by taking pole position Saturday for the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.         
	With an unprecedented four drivers still in contention for the title ahead of the last race Sunday, Alonso still put himself in good position to clinch the championship by finishing third in qualifying. McLarens Lewis Hamilton  a longshot for the title  was second, while Alonsos closest challenger Mark Webber of Red Bull was a disappointing fifth after struggling with his grip all day.         
	Vettel clocked 1 minute, 39.394 seconds at the Yas Marina circuit, making him 0.31 seconds quicker than Hamilton. Alonso was 0.398 seconds back in his Ferrari, with last years champion and Hamiltons teammate Jenson Button in fourth, 0.429 seconds back. Webber was 0.531 seconds back of his teammate.         
	Alonso has an eight-point lead over Webber in the championship standings, while Vettel is 15 points behind and Hamilton 24 points back.         
	The 23-year-old Vettel held up one finger and stuck out his tongue after taking his 10th pole of the year. He now has a chance to repeat last years performance, when he led a one-two Red Bull finish in the Gulf.         
	Obviously, we start from pole. It couldnt be better, Vettel said. At the practice, we didnt look too good, but we went out last and we did it. It was a very good job by everyone, the whole team.         
	Alonso can finish as low as third or fourth if Webber doesnt win the race, and he can also win by finishing out of the points as long as Webber doesnt finish in the top five, Vettel is third or lower and Hamilton fails to win. Alonso, whose fast time came with minutes left in qualifying, called his position great but said a lot can happen during Sundays race. Still, he was happy to finish ahead of Webber.

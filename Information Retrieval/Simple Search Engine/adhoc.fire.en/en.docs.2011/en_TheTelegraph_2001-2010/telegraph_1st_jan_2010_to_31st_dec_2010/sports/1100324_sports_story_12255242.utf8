  - Chennai Super Kings feel Dhoni absence as they crash to 36-run defeat               Royal Challengers Bangalores Rahul Dravid celebrates with teammates, in Bangalore, on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Bangalore: Robin Uthappa cracked a dazzling half-century and R. Vinay Kumar scalped four wickets to help the Royal Challengers Bangalore beat the Chennai Super Kings by 36 runs in their Indian Premier League match on Tuesday.         
	Put into bat first, Bangalore found their hero in Uthappa who blasted 68 runs off 38 balls to see the franchise post a competitive 171 for five after a slow start. They then restricted Chennai to 135 for seven to stretch their winning streak to three games.         
	Chennai sorely missed captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni who is out with an injury to his arm. Pacer Vinay Kumar was the wrecker-in-chief and was ably supported by skipper Anil Kumble and Praveen Kumar, who picked one apiece, as they brought about Chennais downfall at the M Chinnaswamy stadium.         
	Earlier, Uthappa starred in a 19-ball 52-run stand with Mark Boucher to take the Royal Challengers past the 150-mark. Struggling at 119 for five after 17 overs, the Royal Challengers amassed 52 from the last three overs, thanks to Uthappas blitzkrieg.         
	In the 19th over, the Karnataka batsman launched a brutal attack on Lakshmipathy Balaji, clobbering the Tamil Nadu pacer for three successive sixes to set the stands on fire.         
	His awe-inspiring innings was studded with three fours and six sixes.         
	Chasing 172 to win, the Super Kings had a shaky start when they lost opener Parthiv Patel (1) to Praveen Kumar on the last ball of the first over.         
	However, Matthew Hayden (32) and George Bailey (18) steadied the ship with a crucial 55-run partnership for the first wicket. But with Praveen and Dale Steyn bowling a tight line, the duo could not free their arms.         
	Kumble bowled brilliantly to further suffocate the duo as the Super Kings hobbled to 29 for one in six overs.         
	Still needing 143 off 84 balls, Hayden took recourse to his Mongoose bat and belted three successive fours off Jacques Kallis in the eighth over. The euphoria, however, was short-lived as the Super Kings lost both batsmen in the 10th over.         
	While Hayden was run out by Rahul Dravid, Bailey edged one to Mark Boucher as the Super Kings were reduced to 59 for three in 9.4 overs.         
	Vinay Kumar struck again in his next over, removing skipper Suresh Raina (9) with his third ball. After hitting a six off the first ball, Raina miscued one to third man and Kallis made no mistake.         
	Kumble then dismissed Murali Vijay (3) in his fourth over; the Tamil Nadu batsman giving a simple catch to Eoin Morgan at deep mid-wicket as Chennai found themselves staring down the barrel at 74 for five in 12.3 overs.         
	S. Badrinath tried to break free with a 17-ball 31 but soon perished as Vinay Kumar took his third wicket.           (PTI)

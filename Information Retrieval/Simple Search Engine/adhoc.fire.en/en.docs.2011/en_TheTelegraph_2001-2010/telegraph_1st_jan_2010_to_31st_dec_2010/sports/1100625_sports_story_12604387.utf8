                                                                                                                       7                                      Budget cap must increase: Mallya
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	The following is what the franchisees had to say after meeting the BCCI brass (alphabetically):         
	T. Keshav (Kochi): No timeframe has been fixed for these (issues over players auction and the tournament format), but we hope it will be resolved as soon as possible...         
	Vijay Mallya (RCB): Majority of the franchises wanted the budget cap to be increased (from $7m) to $9m and that all the players should be put up on the auction table. We were also in favour of the matches being played on the current home and away format... Thats between him and the BCCI (on Modis absence).         
	PB Vanchi (DareDevils): Theres no union. The BCCI can talk to us individually.         
	Ness Wadia (Kings XI Punjab): If you ask me if I missed Modi, I would say yes. It was different...We have been together for three years, he was a family friend. He was hung before trial by the press... We have applied to sell...

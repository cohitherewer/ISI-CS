The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev goes down fighting
                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev goes down fighting
                      
	Ohio: Somdev Dev Varman bowed out of the ATP Western and Southern Financial Group Masters after losing in a three-set thriller versus Robby Ginepri. The Indian qualifier lost 7-6(7-3), 6-7(4-7), 2-6 to the local wild card in a high-on-adrenaline two-hour-and-34 minute first round match at the $2,430,000 hard court event.         
	This is the second time on the trot that the highest-ranked Indian singles player has made a first-round exit in an ATP Masters series event. Last week, Somdev had entered the Toronto Masters as lucky loser only to lose to Gael Monfils in his opening match in the main draw.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, meanwhile, advance to the second round in doubles with their respective partners after getting a bye in the first round.         
	Andy Roddick needed three sets to beat 46th-ranked Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-4, 6-7, 6-1, while fellow American Taylor Dent upset Feliciano Lopez to advance to the second round.         
	Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka defeated Spaniard Nicolas Almagro 6-3, 6-3 and will play the winner of the all-French match between Michael Llodra and Julien Benneteau.         
	The top four seeds  Nadal, Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic will all be playing on Wednesday. (Agencies)

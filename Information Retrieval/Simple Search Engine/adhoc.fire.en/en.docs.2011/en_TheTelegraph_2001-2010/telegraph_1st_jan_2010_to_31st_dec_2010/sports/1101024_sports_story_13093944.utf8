The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Has been a tough tour, says Clarke
                                                                                                                       7                                        Has been a tough tour, says Clarke
  - I thoughT we played pretty well in Visakhapatnam: Aussie captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Michael Clarke during a media conference, on Saturday. (PTI)                                         
	Margao: Australia captain Michael Clarke is desperate to set things right and end the tour on a winning note on Sunday. Speaking to the media on Saturday afternoon, he accepted it has been a tough tour.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The weather         
	I hope the sun comes out. We came to the ground yesterday (Friday). The pitch looked really good, (but) the ground was a little bit wet. Hoping the rain goes away and theres sunshine and we get a full game tomorrow. All the boys are looking forward to the match. Its obvious we have to win the game to square the series         
	Thoughts before the match         
	Tomorrow is an important game for us. All the boys would like to have a win and draw the series. All are disappointed we did not win the other night. I thought we played pretty well. All the guys are focused on Sundays game.         
	On the current series         
	It has been a tough tour. We have not got the results we would have liked, in the one one-day match as well as the Test series. We are looking forward to win tomorrow, and draw the series. I think we have one more night in bed before our flight (home). Hope the sun comes out and we have a match Sunday.         
	His performance         
	My performance in the Test series was not anywhere near what I would have liked. I am disappointed with my own performance. It was very satisfying to make a hundred the other night.         
	Obviously, I have been working pretty hard in the nets but just could not find a way to make runs in the Tests. I am happy to turn things around... (Its) always wonderful to play cricket in India. To make another century here would be a great feeling. Hope I get one more century tomorrow if the game goes ahead.         
	With two key players sent home, the team for the final tie         
	We havent had too much training today... We will have a look at the wicket to see what the conditions are before selecting the players. 11 out of the 12 players are getting a game. All the guys trained hard Friday and are excited about the opportunity.         
	Favourite pastime after being forced indoors...         
	Everybody is different. Today a lot of guys have been to the gym. Lots of guys have brought their play stations to play computer games. I would be sending a few tweets. We are all excited and would be ready for the game tomorrow.

	New Delhi: Despite suffering a second successive defeat in five days, the Indian coach Bob Houghton appeared satisfied with his teams display against Thailand.         
	It was the best team we have played against in the last couple of years, said the British coach. The game was very equal but they took their chances. My boys were spirited, kept the discipline and worked very hard. Its not easy when you are down. I commend my boys for that, he said.         
	Justifying why he played Mahesh Gawli at the left back position, Houghton said: He (Gawli) has not yet settled in at the left back position. He still wants to play as a central defender. But I convinced him to play here. He played better here than in Bangkok.         
	I have tried (Rahim) Nabi, (N.S.) Manju and Mohanraj during the Portugal camp. But I thought Gawli is technically the best out of all. However, it remains a problem area.

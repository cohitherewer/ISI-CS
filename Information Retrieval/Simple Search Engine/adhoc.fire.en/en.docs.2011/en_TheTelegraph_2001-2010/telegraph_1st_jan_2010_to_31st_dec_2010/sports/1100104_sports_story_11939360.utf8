The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI to ICC: Pitch was poor, but not unfit
                                                                                                                       7                                        BCCI to ICC: Pitch was poor, but not unfit
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES            Tillekaratne Dilshan after getting hit at the Kotla during the fifth and final ODI against India                           
	Calcutta/Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA)s argument to last Sundays fiasco at the Kotla has been that, out of the 141-odd balls bowled in the ODI versus Sri Lanka, merely seven behaved awkwardly.         
	The BCCI brass met in Mumbai, on Sunday, to draft their reply to the International Cricket Council (ICC)s show cause notice so that the venue evades an international ban and gets away with a fine.         
	BCCI president Shashank Manohar and DDCA president Arun Jaitley were among those present to draft the reply. The fifth and final one-dayer of the series was abandoned after the wicket was found to be too dangerous. According to sources, the BCCI, in its response, would stress on the point that the pitch may have been poor, but was not unfit.         
	Jaitley, who besides being a top-notch politician, is one of the countrys leading lawyers, took it upon himself to present DDCAs case to the BCCI. It should also be noted that Jaitley is a vice-president of the BCCI, and so his roles have merged in this episode.         
	That the BCCI would be looking to present it as poor and not unfit became evident once the punishment for the two ratings were known. For a poor rating, the punishment for a first-time offender is a warning and/or fine not exceeding $15,000.         
	An unfit rating would invite a suspension of the venues international status between 12 and 24 months. The Kotla is to host four matches in the 2011 World Cup, the first of which (South Africa versus the West Indies) is scheduled for February 24. The last, India against The Netherlands, is on March 9.         
	Accordingly, the BCCI is preparing a dossier on the entire episode and would base their arguments on the fact that play continued till the 23.3 overs before the officials abandoned the game. It is also understood that the DDCA had consulted independent persons in preparing its report to the BCCI.         
	Incidentally, DDCA vice-president and former Test opener Chetan Chauhan had used the same argument  only seven balls behaved awkwardly to claim that the match officials made a haste in abandoning the match.         
	Once the ICC receives the BCCIs response, Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle and ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson would decide on the penalty.

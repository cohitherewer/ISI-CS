                                                                                                                       7                                      Momentum will be the key: Sachin 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its the one missing from his cupboard and this time is as good as any to finally win the ODI World Cup. Sachin Tendulkar knows this and has been looking forward to the event that is being held in the subcontinent in 2011, from February 19 to April 2.         
	The Little Master sees enough positives to be optimistic about Indias chances but added that the team needed to ensure there was no dip in the intensity level going into the tournament.         
	Weve been performing well as a side and I think its important that the India team carry its momentum into the tournament next year, Sachin says on this weeks ICC Cricket World audio show.         
	I think our pre-tournament preparation will be key and, at the same time, pre-tournament recovery is also important so that were raring to go once the event has started, Sachin added.         
	Sachin did not name any favourites for the title, because he believes it all depends on how one performs on the field on matchday.         
	I think its difficult to say which team will do well in the tournament next year as its about who performs well on that given day, the man with the record for ODI centuries said. Whoever does well will carry the confidence with them through the tournament once theyve won a few matches.         
	It (World Cup) makes it a totally different ball game, added the 37-year-old who has played in five World Cups.         
	Sachin has not lost any of his hunger for runs and can be excpected to go all out to bring home the Cup to India a second time. And whats more, the darling of Indian cricket can do it in front of home crowds.

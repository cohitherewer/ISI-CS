	Spanish stars Cesc Fabregas and Carles Puyol will be fit to play Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Durban on Wednesday, according to the team doctor. Barcelonas veteran stopper Puyol left the pitch in the 84th minute of the 1-0 victory over Paraguay in the World Cup quarter-final on Saturday suffering from blurred vision after being hit in the face with the ball.         
	Fabregas, meanwhile, fell heavily on a shoulder after being brought down by the Paraguay goalkeeper, Justo Villar. Both players will be fit for the semi-final, team doctor Oscar Luis Celada said.         
	Puyol should be able to retain his place in the starting XI while Fabregas will be on the substitutes bench. Raul Albiol is Spains only absentee for the match as he has injured his right leg.         
	Meanwhile Fernando Torres admitted that match against Germany will be like a final as he looks to repeat his countrys Euro 2008 success. The Liverpool striker scored the only goal of the final against Germany two years ago to help Spain lift their first major trophy for 44 years.         
	Torres has not been surprised by Germanys success in South Africa but also feels the best is still to come from Spain. He said: I am very proud. It is the first semi-final for Spain in World Cup history so this team is making history again. Hopefully the best will still be to come.We have a massive game against Germany. It will be like a final.

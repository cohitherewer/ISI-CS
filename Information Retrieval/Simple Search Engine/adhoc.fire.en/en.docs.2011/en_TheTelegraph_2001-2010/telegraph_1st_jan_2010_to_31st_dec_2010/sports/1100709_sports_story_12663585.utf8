	Durban: Newcomer Pedro Rodriguez showed his place in Spains World Cup team was well-merited by playing a big part in a 1-0 victory over Germany that put the European champions in the final.         
	The Barcelona forward said he was surprised to get the starting nod over regular striker Fernando Torres, but pulled himself together in his first internationa start to be one of the standout players on Wednesday.         
	I had no idea and, sure the decision surprised me a little bit, but I focused quickly and all of my teammates helped me feel comfortable on the field, Pedro said. I imagine the coach had his motives but everything worked out.         
	Pedro was instrumental in Spains attack, often throwing German defenders off-balance with his quick dribbling moves, while also offering a deep threat with his pace.         
	Pedro set up David Villa with a well-placed through ball in the sixth minute, but Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer blocked the strikers shot.         
	Neuer made another stop on Pedro in the 58th before some slick moves set up a corner in the 62nd.         
	However, inexperience may have been the culprit in the 82nd when Pedro wasted a great chance to double the lead. He received the ball from Torres on a counter attack but tried to set himself up for a goal instead of passing back to the Liverpool striker, who was wide open in front of the keeper after having just come on as a substitute moments earlier.         
	I made a bad decision. I should have played it to Torres. It was a shame, Pedro said. These are decisions that happen, you have to make them quickly.           (AGENCIES)

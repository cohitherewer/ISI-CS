The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stranger sent me costly gifts: Irfan 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Stranger sent me costly gifts: Irfan 
  - All-rounder had handed over the items to ACSU official
            OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES            Irfan Pathan                           
	The corruption scandal that has rocked international cricket is finding an echo in India as well with Irfan Pathan claiming on Friday that he was sent expensive gifts by a stranger, suspected to be a bookie, during the January-February 2006 tour to Pakistan.         
	Irfan said that the person, who had claimed himself to be a fan, met him twice, face to face, during the tour. But the all-rounder decided to avoid the person.         
	According to Irfan, though the man in question never made any approach regarding fixing, it was his suspicious behaviour which gave rise to the fears.         
	However, on the third occasion, the person didnt approach Irfan physically and instead sent expensive gifts to his Karachi hotel room along with a message that he wanted to meet him.         
	That made Irfan, who had struck a hattrick in the third Test (Karachi), suspicious. Though he didnt submit a written complaint to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Irfan had immediately reported the matter to the then assistant team manager  Group Captain (then Wing Commander) M. Baladitya.         
	Though Raj Singh Dungarpur, who is no more, was the team manager, much of the day-to-day administrative work was actually done by Baladitya.         
	I was in the team hotel (in Karachi) when a stranger approached me. He sent three expensive gifts to my room. He later sent me two more expensive gifts Things I couldnt afford, the 25-year-old, whose last Test appearance for India was in April 2008 against South Africa, told a television channel.         
	I thought it was wrong as I didnt know this person. I reported the matter to the assistant team manager who then alerted the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) officer, he recalled.         
	According to Irfan, the gifts were handed over to the ACSU on the very next day. The stuff were handed over to the ACSU official on that tour the next day The official was also briefed about the whole incident verbally, Irfan told The Telegraph from Mumbai.         
	Irfan added that he never saw the stranger again and is proud to have reported the matter to the concerned authorities promptly.

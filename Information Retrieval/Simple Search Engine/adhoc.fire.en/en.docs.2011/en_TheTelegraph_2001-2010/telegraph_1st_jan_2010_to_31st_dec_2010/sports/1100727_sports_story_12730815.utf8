The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two golds for junior boxers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Two golds for junior boxers
                      
	New Delhi: Inspired by Mike Tyson and Mohammed Ali, eight Indian junior boxers made quite an impression in their maiden international assignment, clinching a couple of gold, a silver and a bronze medal at the 25th Ahmed Comert Cup in Istanbul, Turkey.         
	The tournament, which was previously a girls-only event, opened itself for the boys for the first time, and the Indians made a splash by beating rivals from traditional powerhouses like Russia and Uzbekistan.         
	The team, which finished fourth in the overall standings, landed back in the capital this morning.         
	The gold medallists for India were Nambala Govardhan (57kg) and Dheeraj Kumar (52kg), while Surender Kumar Singh (50kg) settled for silver.         
	Gurleen Singh (63kg) had to be content with a bronze after losing in the semifinals.         
	The quartet of Shyam Kumar (46kg), Arjun Singh (48kg), Lokesh (60kg) and David Singh (54kg) could not fetch a medal but gained in experience.         
	Their coach M.S. Dhaka, who has been overseeing junior boxers since 1998, said the boys did exceptionally well considering that they were heading out of the country for the first time and were faced with quality competition.         
	I told these boys just box well and not worry about results. They showed tremendous character in not getting overawed by their more fancied rivals. The medals are actually a bonus, all I wanted was a good performance which all of them gave me, he said.         
	All the boys, in the age group of 15 to 16, draw their inspiration from the controversial Tyson.           (PTI)

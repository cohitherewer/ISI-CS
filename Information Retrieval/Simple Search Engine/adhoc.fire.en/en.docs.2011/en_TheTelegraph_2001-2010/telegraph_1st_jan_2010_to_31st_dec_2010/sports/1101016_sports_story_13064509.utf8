	London: Manchester United are unbeaten, one of only two teams, along with Fulham, yet to experience a defeat this season. But they have won just one of their last four games, beating Liverpool 3-2 at home. The other three, against Everton, Bolton and Sunderland, ended in draws.         
	If, following draws against Bolton and Sunderland, they fail to win against West Brom Albion on Saturday, it will be the first time they have failed to win in three consecutive games in the League since the opening three matches of the 2007-08 season, when they drew two and lost one  but won the title.         
	They remain in second place but with 14 points, four points behind leaders Chelsea. After seven games last season United were on top, but level on 18 points with Chelsea.         
	United are hoping Wayne Rooney could feature after missing the last two games, while they test Ryan Giggs and though Antonio Valencia is out Owen Hargreaves can make his long-awaited return. Albion still miss Marek Cech.         
	With the rumours of rift between him and manager Alex Ferguson doing the rounds, Rooney has to find his form back and deliver.         
	Albion are unbeaten in their last four Premier League games, their best run in the top division since December 2005.         
	If they avoid loss for a fifth successive game, it will represent their best ever unbeaten run in the Premier League and best in the top flight since October 1983.         
	Chelsea have won six of their seven games to lead the Premier League by four points, the biggest gap at the top in the Premier League since 2005  when Chelsea won all seven and led second-placed Charlton by six points.         
	Chelsea have conceded just two goals  both away from home, at West Ham and Manchester City  and face a Villa side yet to lose at home this season. Villa have won just one game in their last four in the League, against Wolves at Molineux.         
	Chelsea have won just once in their last 11 Premier League visits to Villa Park and John Terry, who withdrew from England duty in midweek with a back problem, could be available while England colleague Frank Lampard, also absent on Tuesday, is set to earn a recall after a seven-match absence. But Yossi Benayoun, Alex and Salomon Kalou are missing again.         
	Villa test Emile Heskey and with Gabriel Agbonlahor also missing, John Carew could start.         
	Last season these teams met three times, beginning with the home League clash where Didier Drogba gave Chelsea the lead before Richard Dunne and James Collins replied for Villa.         
	But in the return, at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea exacted stunning revenge by winning 7-1 with Frank Lampard scoring four. Five of Chelseas goals came in the second half.         
	Meanwhile, Arsenal have failed to win in their last three Premier League games and have lost their last two. A third defeat, following the reverses against West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea, would represent Arsenals worst run without a point since April 2007 when they lost to Everton, Liverpool and West Ham.

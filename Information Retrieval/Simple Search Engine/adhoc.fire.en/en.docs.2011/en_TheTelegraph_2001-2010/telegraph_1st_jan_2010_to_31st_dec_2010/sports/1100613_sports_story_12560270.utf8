	Chennai: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Saturday admitted that the team will miss the services of Yuvraj Singh in the Asia Cup, to be held in Sri Lanka, and hoped the southpaw would return to the national side soon.         
	Yuvraj, who has been struggling with his form, was dropped from the Sri Lanka-bound squad and Dhoni has no qualms in admitting that the youngsters have to handle the extra responsibility to fill the void in the middle order. Of course, we will miss him... If you see his performance in the last couple of years, he has been one of our main strengths in the middle order. The way he bats, hardly any batsman can in that manner, Dhoni said at a press conference here.         
	Definitely we will miss him, but at the same time it will be really great if some of the youngsters could fill in the space. But hopefully we will not miss him on the field, he added.         
	Fitness has been a problem with Yuvraj, who seemed to have gained weight of late and was seen fielding in the deep and not in his customary point position.         
	However, Dhoni has no doubt that the Punjab cricketer will soon make his way back to the India team. The kind of talent Yuvraj is, I dont think it will be difficult for him to come back. I am hoping that he will be back as soon as possible. I am a big fan of Yuvraj and it is a pleasure to have him in the side. He is one of the best batsmen in the world, Dhoni said.         
	Especially the way he bats in first and second powerplay situations has been remarkable. He is sort of a batsman who can play in both ways  aggressive as well as defensive, Dhoni added.         
	India open their campaign in the tournament by taking on Bangladesh on June 16 in Dambulla.         
	The skipper said that they are yet to plan anything for the four-nation competition and will decide their strategy only after arriving in the island nation.         
	It is very difficult to say anything till you see the conditions there. It is not easy to predict the playing combination of the side. We have couple of practice sessions and will also see how the wicket is. We will plan according to the conditions, he said while asked about the probable strategy in the tournament.         
	It is an important tournament. We will be playing one-day cricket after a long time. We will be playing in Dambulla. We are playing with almost the full strength but the conditions in Dambulla will be different because it is not a high scoring venue. It will be very important to keep that on the back of the mind. But we are not playing there for the first time, he said.         
	Asked about the condition of the teams fast bowling department, Dhoni said, We really dont have a fast bowling all-rounder for the last couple of years. We dont have fast bowlers who could bowl 10 overs and then contribute with the bat.

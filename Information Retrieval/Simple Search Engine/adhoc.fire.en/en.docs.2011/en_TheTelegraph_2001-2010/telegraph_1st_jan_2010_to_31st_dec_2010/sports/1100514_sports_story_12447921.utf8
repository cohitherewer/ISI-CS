The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sushil Kumar wins gold 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sushil Kumar wins gold 
                      
	New Delhi: Olympic bronze medallist Sushil Kumar lived up to his reputation as he bagged a gold in mens 66kg freestyle on the second day of the Senior Asian Wrestling Championships, here on Thursday.         
	Sushil produced an impressive performance to toy with Kim Dae Sung of Korea in straight periods 4-0, 2-0 at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Sports Complex.         
	With Sushil winning the yellow metal, Indias medal tally in the championships swelled to two gold. Narshing Yadav had won a gold in the 74kg freestyle on Thursday.         
	It feels good to be the Asian Champion. This win gives a boost to my confidence before important events like World Championship and the Commonwealth Games. It was a tough fight in the finals, but I was lucky to get the first grip, from where I never looked back, said Sushil after his win.         
	Other Indians, however, fell outside the medal bracket. (Agencies)

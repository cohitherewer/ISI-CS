	Kozhikode: Back in the Indian Test squad after recovering from a knee injury, Sreesanth on Monday said he was expecting an improved performance in the upcoming two-match series against Australia starting October 1 in Mohali.

	I am sure I will be able to perform well against Australia. I will give my full effort, Sreesanth said from Bangalore.         
	I have not played against Australia in Test matches. Australia is a top Test side and I am hoping for a good performance in the series, he said.         
	Sreesanth, who has been training hard and played for Kerala in the recently-concluded Moin-ud-Dowlah tournament in Hyderabad, thanked the selectors for reposing faith in him.         
	Asked whether he was expecting a recall into Indian team, he said, Not really, but I was training hard and had been bowling a lot.         
	Sreesanth had to return from the last Test series against Sri Lanka following an injury and since then has been training hard to regain fitness.         
	I have now fully recovered and I wish I can play in front of my home crowd in Kochi in the ODI match also,too he said .         
	He last played a Test  against Bangladesh  earlier this year in Chittagong, and in all, has played 17 Tests and picked up 60 wickets.           (AGENCIES)

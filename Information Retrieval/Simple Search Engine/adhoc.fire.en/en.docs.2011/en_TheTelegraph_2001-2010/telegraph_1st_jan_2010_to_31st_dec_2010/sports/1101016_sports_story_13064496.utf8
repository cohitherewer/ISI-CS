The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand draws with Kramnik
                                                                                                                       7                                        Anand draws with Kramnik

	Bilbao: World Champion Viswanathan Anand split the point with leader Vladimir Kramnik of Russia to remain second after the end of the fifth and penultimate round of Bilbao Final Masters chess tournament here Friday.         
	The draw took Kramnik near the title, as he retained his two points lead over the Indian ace, with just one round remaining in this category-22 double round robin tournament, between four players.         
	The Russian moved to an impressive nine points, aided by two wins and three draws thus far, while Anand took his tally to seven, with four draws and a sole win that came against Magnus Carlsen of Norway in the second round.         
	Carlsen, meanwhile, snatched the third place from Shirov after a hard-fought victory against the latter. Carlsen dumped Shirov in style, in the Arkhengelsk variation of the Ruy Lopez, in which the Spaniard is supposedly the best player in the world.         
	In the final round now, Anand will need a win to be in with a chance of catching up with Kramnik or even overtaking him, theoretically. In the final round, the Indian will have the advantage of white pieces when he meets Carlsen, while Kramnik will play with the less favourable colour against Shirov.         
	On expected lines, Anand did not have to trouble himself much against Kramnik. Playing the black side of a Queens Gambit, Anand went for the Vienna variation that Kramnik himself has used successfully on some occasions.         
	As it happened in the game, Anand did not mind giving Kramnik the Bishop pair advantage, early in the middle game and played non-chalantly to first close the centre and then operate on the two open files typical of the opening system.         
	Kramnik did not have many choices and his two points lead, in the football-like scoring system in use here, proved to be a big cushion for him, as he decided against any undue risk.         
	As a result, the pieces flew off the board in a hurry and Anand did not mind that either. First, a couple of minor pieces changed hands and then it was the turn of the queens followed by the rooks, and the players reached a drawn opposite coloured Bishop endgame in quick time. Peace was signed on the 37th move.           (AGENCIES)

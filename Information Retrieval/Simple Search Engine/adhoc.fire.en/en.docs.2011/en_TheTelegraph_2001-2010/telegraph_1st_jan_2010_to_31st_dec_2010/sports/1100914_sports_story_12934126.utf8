The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis Hamilton needs to cut out silly errors
                                                                                                                       7                                        Lewis Hamilton needs to cut out silly errors

	Monza: Lewis Hamilton returned to the McLaren motorhome desolate, with the helmet on and the visor down. It was the last place he expected to be with the Italian Grand Prix only one lap old.         
	None felt inclined to follow him into his billet. A padded cell might have been better.         
	This was a race he might have won. It looked he was destined to lose for much of the weekend. A poor set-up in qualifying began the momentum swing.         
	His lunge into the side of Felipe Massa going into the second chicane sealed his fate. A self-inflicted DNF (did not finish) is the ultimate kick in the gonads for a racing driver. For a championship leader it is akin to losing a winning lottery ticket.         
	A fortnight ago Hamiltons intuitive verve at the wheel brought him a thrilling victory at Spa-Francorchamps. Here that same urgent impulse to rip through the field brought him zip.         
	The requirement after a disappointing qualifying was, first, to finish. He is long enough in the seat now to know the importance of staying out of the contact zone in the early laps.         
	Perhaps this is how it must be with Hamilton, an instinctive racer compelled to chase the impossible through gaps that dont exist.         
	He appeared bewildered and said he didnt remember too much about the impact that led to the loss of his front right wheel.         
	 This season has been fatal for the obvious conclusion. One never quite knows how things will end despite the weight of evidence pointing to the likelihood of particular outcomes.         
	And so with five races left the mother of all dnouements beckons with Hamilton second in the drivers standings five points adrift of Mark Webber.         
	I had a good start and, ideally, I should have stayed there for a while. I tried to put my car up the inside and get third and maybe it was a little too much and I lost position. I dont know what I was thinking.         
	Thats the point. He was not thinking at all. Not a problem when the rhythm of a race is established and the automatic pilot is on. Criminal through the opening corners.         
	Hamilton was clearly juiced to the gunnels after passing Mark Webber. He couldnt help himself when closing on Massa. What can I do? I tried my best and some things just dont go your way, he added.         
	Notionally at least, this was a race that was set up for McLaren. Hamiltons teammate Jenson Button demonstrated the benefit of experience and maturity to claim 18 points.         
	Had the team been a tad sharper in the pit stop, where Button shipped eight tenths of a second to race winner Fernando Alonso, Button would have hit the bulls eye here.         
	This was Hamiltons third DNF of the season but the first of his own making. Occasions like this are perhaps reminders to us not to expect too much.         
	Button, Alonso and Mark Webber, who quietly resumed the championship lead, by five points to Hamilton, after finishing sixth, have passed through the gate marked manhood.

	Urban development minister Asoke Bhattacharya hinted on Tuesday that the state government will grant land to table tennis player Poulami Ghatak, who had won silver and bronze medals in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games. She had recently criticised the government and called for parity in doling out of awards for the medal winners.      
	Poulami had applied for land on April 1 this year. But due to some official reasons, the land could not be allotted. However, I expect the problem will be solved in the next meeting, Bhattacharya said.

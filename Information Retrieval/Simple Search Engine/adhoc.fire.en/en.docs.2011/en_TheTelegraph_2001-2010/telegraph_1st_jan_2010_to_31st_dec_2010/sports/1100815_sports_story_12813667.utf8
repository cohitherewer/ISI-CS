The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blues for West Brom
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blues for West Brom
                            
	London: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba scored a hat trick to lead the defending champions to a 6-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Saturdays opening day of the English Premier League season.         
	Florent Malouda put Chelsea ahead before Drogba hit a 45th-minute free kick and a close-range finish to move into sixth place on Chelseas list of all-time leading scorers. Frank Lampard passed into the net before Drogba hit a deflected shot in at the near post and Malouda scored again in the last minute.         
	Blackpool enjoyed a dream return to English footballs top flight when they lit up the opening day by thrashing Wigan Athletic 4-0 on Saturday.         
	Marlon Harewood, one of a rash of midweek signings for the club that has languished in the lower divisions since 1971, scored twice as travelling fans clad in Blackpools traditional orange colours celebrated a result beyond their wildest dreams.         
	Free-spending Manchester Citys assault on silverware began with a 0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur, the side who pipped them to fourth spot last season, thanks to a sensational goalkeeping performance by Joe Hart.         
	Aston Villa responded to the shock resignation of manager Martin Neill with a 3-0 win over West Ham United with winger James Milner, playing despite a looming move to Manchester City, scoring his sides third goal.         
	Blackburn Rovers beat Everton 1-0 and Wolverhampton Wanderers were also home winners, beating Stoke City 2-1.         
	Ten-man Birmingham City grabbed a later equaliser to draw 2-2 at Sunderland and Fulham and Bolton Wanderers finished goalless.         
	Favourites for relegation and with their dated Bloomfield Road ground still undergoing a makeover, Blackpool stole top billing as the worlds most-hyped league opened for business.         
	Their rout of Wigan put them top of the embryonic table and had manager Ian Holloway praising his players to the hilt.         
	This is a great group of lads and we had a great day, Holloway, who gained promotion via the playoffs last season, said.         
	I had to throw in three boys who had literally just met each other. If we stay together we may cut it and have half a chance to stay above three teams at the end of the season.         
	Manchester City paraded another 70 million worth of signings at a drizzly White Hart Lane but it was Hart who excelled.         
	Selected ahead of Shay Given, he made six stunning saves to keep Tottenham at bay before City, who gave debuts to midfielders Yaya Toure and David Silva and defender Aleksandar Kolarov, improved after the break.         
	I was happy to make the saves and be part of a good performance, Hart said.         
	All I wanted to do was play for Man City but Ive got to keep on my toes because Shay is a great keeper and next week I might be out of the team again.         
	Blackpools preparations had been somewhat ramshackle but Wigan threw down the welcome mat as the visitors cruised into a deserved 3-0 lead by halftime.         
	Gary Taylor-Fletcher side-footed Blackpool ahead before former Villa and West Ham frontman Harewood struck twice.         
	Wigan, jeered off at halftime, had a goal disallowed after the break and their afternoon got worse when Alex Baptiste made it 4-0.         
	While Blackpool will be happy to finish 17th this season, Tottenham and Manchester City will be hoping for a title tilt and the evidence at White Hart Lane was encouraging.         
	Spurs were the more cohesive side before halftime as they clicked straight into their passing rhythm. City have spent more than $156 million since finishing fifth but it was Hart who saved them.         
	His first reflex stop to block Jermain Defoes close-range volley was superb and minutes later he tumbled to his right to save a dipping volley from Tom Huddlestone.         
	City improved after the break and Shaun Wright-Phillips was sent clear by a scooped pass from Toure but he was denied by Assou-Ekotto.         
	Citys workaholic skipper Carlos Tevez also had a shot deflected wide and Tottenhams Gareth Bale wasted the best chance when he scuffed a shot wide with the goal gaping.

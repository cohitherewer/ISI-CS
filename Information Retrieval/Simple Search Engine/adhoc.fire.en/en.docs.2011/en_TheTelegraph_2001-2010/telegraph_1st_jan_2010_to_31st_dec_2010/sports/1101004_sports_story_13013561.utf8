  - Tireless athletes are aiming for podium finish
            ANSHUMAN ROY    
	New Delhi: Enough of shams and scams. The XIX Commonwealth Games has got too much of bad press and now time has come for the real thing. After all, its because of athletes that a game sustains and not because of some petty officials and their idea of seeing the world.         
	These athletes have worked tirelessly for the last two years and are now hoping to make a mark. A podium finish will be a good enough reward for all the hard work.         
	As the reigning national table tennis champion and Indias medal hope Poulami Ghatak puts it: Two years of hard work will go down the drain if we only talk about the controversies.         
	India, playing the host for the first time, are hoping to finish at least second and for that they have to depend a lot on shooting. In the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, out the 22 medals at stake, India got 16. So expectations are really high. Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, Ronjan Sodhi and Gagan Narang are the favourites to win gold in their respective events. The focus will be definitely on World champion Sodhi who has replaced Rajyavardhan Rathore in the double trap event.         
	After shooting, its boxing where India should win a handful of medals. Jitender Kumar and Akhil Kumar are the outright favourites in their respective weights and nothing short of gold will satisfy the home crowd.         
	I always fight well under pressure. Whats the big deal if we will be fighting in front of the home crowd. The cheering will definitely give us a boost, said Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Kumar.         
	If Vijender is all about confidence, world champion Sushil Kumar is diametrically opposite. The Najafgarh wrestler, who is also a die-hard Lionel Messi fan, is shy and soft-spoken but take him to the mat and he will do the talking.         
	I have an Olympic medal, a world championship title. Only thing missing is the Commonwealth Games gold, he stated. His rivals must be shivering listening to this.         
	In the run-up to the Commonwealth Games, Indian wrestlers won 19 gold medals in last years Commonwealth Senior Championship in Jalandhar and seven medals (two gold, one silver and four bronze) at the Senior Asian Wrestling Championship in New Delhi earlier this year.         
	In badminton, there is one and only Saina Nehwal who is seen as the best thing to happen in Indias women badminton history. She is the hot favourite to win the gold and lead India to the top in the teams event.         
	In athletics, Indias best bet is Tintu Luka in the 800m race. With none of the stars coming  Caster Semanya is the latest to have pulled out of the Games  Luka has a very good chance of winning a medal. How the 21-year-old P. T. Usha protege handles the pressure remains to be seen.         
	It goes without saying that in tennis India will win at least two gold medals. The Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi duo will once again be the favourites to win the gold in doubles and Somdev Dev Varman is also a contender for the yellow metal thanks to a host of pullouts.         
	So, get ready for the real action to begin from Tuesday onwards.

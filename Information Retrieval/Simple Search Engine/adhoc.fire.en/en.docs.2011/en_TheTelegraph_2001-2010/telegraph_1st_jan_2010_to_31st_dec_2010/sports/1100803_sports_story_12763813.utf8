	Wellington: Acclaimed New Zealand sportsman Eric Tindill, a double international who was the worlds oldest surviving Test cricketer and an All Black, died aged 99, a family spokesman said Monday.         
	Not only did he play cricket and rugby at Test level, Tindill also achieved the unique distinction of being the only person to umpire a cricket Test match and referee a rugby Test.         
	He died in his home town of Nelson.         
	Tindill, a wicketkeeper, became the worlds oldest surviving Test cricketer last year with the passing of Englishman Francis McKinnon, who lived to 98.         
	He played five Tests for New Zealand and had the honour of catching Sir Don Bradman at Adelaide in 1937-38, in the only match the Australian batting great played against New Zealand.         
	Tindill played 16 times for the All Blacks but his sole rugby Test was when New Zealand were beaten by England 0-13 in London in 1936.         
	As a match official, Tindill refereed the All Blacks first two Tests against the touring British Lions in 1955 and three years later umpired a New Zealand cricket Test against England.

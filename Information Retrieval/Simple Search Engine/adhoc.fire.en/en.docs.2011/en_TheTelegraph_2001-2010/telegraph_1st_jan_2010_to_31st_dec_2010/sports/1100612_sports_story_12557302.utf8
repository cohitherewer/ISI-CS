The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team will be more confident   in the next game: SA coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team will be more confident   in the next game: SA coach
                            
	Johannesburg: Now all the stress of playing the opening match of the World Cup has gone, South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Pereira believes his side will have no fear in their remaining Group A matches.         
	I believe the ice has been broken. The first game is always a lot of pressure for both teams, the Brazilian, taking part in his sixth World Cup, told reporters after a pulsating 1-1 draw against Mexico on Friday at the striking Soccer City stadium.         
	Both teams tried to win and I believe in the next game the team will be more confident, he said, referring to his sides match against Uruguay on June 16 in Pretoria. They later face France on June 22 in Bloemfontein.         
	I think this group is very tough. The team that makes four points will qualify. We feel we are in this group stage until the very end, he added.         
	If Pereiras team was nervous during the game they certainly did not show it beforehand, singing and dancing in unison as they exited their bus in the confines of the enormous arena that resembles a cooking pot.         
	Its a form of encouragement, to put the stress out. They love to sing, like the rugby players in New Zealand, Pereira said, smiling like a proud parent.         
	Mexico coach Javier Aguirre was disappointed as his side left with just one point.         
	Both sides are going away with a bitter taste and we are now forced to beat France, he told a news conference after the eyes of the world saw the tournaments opening game in the Soccer City stadium.         
	We are quite confident that we can win the next two matches, the former Mexico international added. Next up is France in Polokwane on June 17 followed by Uruguay in Rustenburg five days later.         
	Aguirres team had 58 per cent of possession but without a top class finisher in their starting line-up they failed to produce the knock out blows and could have lost in the dying moments when Bafana Bafana striker Katlego Mphela hit the post.         
	The goalkeeper on the South African side was absolutely great, he said.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani falters in final
                                                                                                                       7                                        Advani falters in final
                  Pankaj Advani                     
	New Delhi: Ace Indian cueist Pankaj Advanis hopes of winning the IBSF World Snooker title for the second time in his career came crashing down on Thursday after he failed to overcome a spirited challenge from Dechawat Pomajaeng of Thailand in the final at Damascus.         
	Advani, who won the billiards singles gold in Asian Games last month, failed to lift the coveted trophy that he last won in 2003 in China, after he lost 7-10 in the best-of-19 frames final, divided into two sessions. Advani lost 37-67, 71-47, 69-35, 138-00, 12-85, 15-68, 13-63, 27-68, 57-56, 61-15, 15-71, 35-75, 32-58, 71-25, 62-33, 0-130, 08-92.         
	In the first session of the final, the Thai cueist led 5-4 and in the second, he stretched his lead to 10-7 to seal the issue in his favour.         
	The seven-time world champion Advani fought like a terrier to overcome severe pressure from the Thai opponent but in the end his efforts proved short of adding another milestone to his already illustrious career.         
	The final was a gruelling affair as Dechawat won the first frame with ease but Advani bounced back to draw even in the second. He then went on to win the next two frames, constructing a century break of 138 in the fourth.         
	The Thai opponent then reigned supreme on the green baize and won next four frames, reducing Advani to a mere spectator. Under pressure, Advani wilted in the end and only managed to win one more frame.

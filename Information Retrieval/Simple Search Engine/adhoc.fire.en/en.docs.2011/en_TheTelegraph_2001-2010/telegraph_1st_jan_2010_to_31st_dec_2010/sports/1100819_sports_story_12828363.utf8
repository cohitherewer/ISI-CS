The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith aims to prolong his career
                                                                                                                       7                                        Smith aims to prolong his career
                  A grab of The Telegraph report which appeared on Wednesday                     
	Johannesburg: Graeme Smith will step down as captain of South Africas one-day International and Twenty20 teams in order to prolong his career, he said on Wednesday.         
	The 29-year-old told a news conference in Johannesburg that he was relinquishing the Twenty20 captaincy with immediate effect but would lead the ODI side through to next years World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	I am going into my ninth season of international cricket  eight of which have been as captain, said Smith.         
	It is my intention to play for another five or six years and I know in my heart that I can only do that if I give up some of my current responsibilities.         
	The opening batsman took over the captaincy from Shaun Pollock in 2003 after South Africas early exit from the World Cup they hosted and has led the team in 123 ODIs, winning 75 of them. Smith said he would still be available for South Africa in all formats of the game.         
	There is no obvious succesor to Smith.         
	Jacques Kallis has led South Africa in 10 ODIs but is a reluctant captain, while wicketkeeper Mark Bouchers place is in jeopardy heading into the World Cup.         
	Off-spinner Johan Botha led South Africa to an impressive series victory in Australia in 2009 but has struggled to maintain a permanent place in the team after being reported for an illegal bowling action.         
	There are several players emerging within the squad to take on leadership roles. Making the announcement now will allow the time and development necessary to ensure a smooth transition, Smith said.         
	I remain passionate about the captaincy and after the World Cup I will continue to lead the Test team with pride.         
	I see myself playing for a long time still and hope to really add value as a batsman after these six months, to maintain the high standards of performance I have set.         
	Smith led South Africa in the 2007 edition of the ODI World Cup and in three World Twenty20s.         
	The team failed to reach the final of any of those events, although they reached the semi-final stage twice.         
	Speculation was rife that he would step down in May this year, after South Africa finished bottom of their Super Eights group at the World T20 in the Caribbean.         
	Gerald Majola, CEO of Cricket South Africa (CSA), who was present at the press conference, felt Smith had given the administrators enough time.         
	He is leaving us when there are youngsters who can take up a leadership role, he is not leaving us in the lurch.         
	Majola said CSA have been working on a succession plan for a while and they will announce the new Twenty20 captain next month.         
	The frontrunners for the job are Johan Botha in the ODIs and AB de Villiers for T20s. (Agencies)

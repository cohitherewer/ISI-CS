The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paraguay, NZ eye next level
                                                                                                                       7                                      Paraguay, NZ eye next level
                      
	Polokwane: An aggressive Paraguay and the emboldened New Zealand meet in their final Group F match on Thursday looking for the path forward in their World Cup journey.         
	Paraguay lead with four points and a win is vital if they are to top the group for a smoother path to a first ever quarter final.         
	Winning the group will likely set up a last-16 match against Denmark or Japan instead of the higher-ranked and more dangerous Dutch.         
	Striker Roque Santa Cruz said La Albirroja are thinking, if we keep performing as well as we expect... and keep working as hard as we are now, anything is possible.         
	New Zealand have two points and must beat Paraguay  or get a better result than what Italy muster against Slovakia in the simultaneous match  to reach the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time.         
	Likely TEAMS         
	Paraguay (4-3-3): 1-Justo Villar, 6-Carlos Bonet, 21-Antolin Alcaraz, 14-Paulo Da Silva, 3-Claudio Morel, 13-Enrique Vera, 15-Victor Caceres, 16-Cristian Riveros, 9-Roque Santa Cruz, 18-Nelson Valdez, 19-Lucas Barrios         
	New Zealand (4-3-3): 1-Mark Paston, 4-Winston Reid, 6-Ryan Nelsen, 5-Ivan Vicelich, 19-Tommy Smith, 3-Tony Lochhead, 11-Leo Bertos, 7-Simon Elliot, 9-Shane Smeltz, 10-Chris Killen, 14-Rory Fallon         
	Referee: Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)           (AGENCIES)

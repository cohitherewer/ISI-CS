                                                                                                                       7                                        Graemes cap yet to be traced
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Graeme Smith                           
	Durban: Graeme Smith, the South Africa captain, has still not found his Test cap, which he wore for 89 matches.         
	Contrary to the general belief that it got misplaced on a flight from Johannesburg last week, it actually went missing during the luggage vans journey from Centurion to here.         
	The van brought all the luggage and Graemes cap was in his kit bag... It still hasnt been traced, a Cricket South Africa official told The Telegraph, on Sunday.         
	And, so, Smith was seen in a floppy hat on the opening day of the second Test.

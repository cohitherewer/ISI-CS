                                                                                                                       7                                      Ishant injury a worry for the hosts
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mohali: While injuries to Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag on the eve of the Mohali Test worried the Indian camp, India were paralysed by a completely different headache on the opening day of the first Test here on Friday.         
	A knee injury to Ishant Sharma has cast serious doubts on his further participation in the match.         
	The speedster, who started the day impressively, faded out later and then limped off the ground in the 37 th over without completing it.         
	He was later taken to a local hospital for an MRI scan.         
	However, conflicting reports about the seriousness of the injury have led to confusion. While the Indian team co-ordinator, Mayank Parikh, said they were yet to get the report, a source close to the team said the injury wasnt serious and Ishant would play on Saturday.         
	The MRI scan was done today But we will only get the report tomorrow (Saturday) morning. So, its difficult to comment on Ishants status at the moment, Parikh said.         
	Ishant gave away eight no balls and conceded 49 runs in 7.4 overs. That the lanky pacer was in pain was evident when he left the ground in the 37th over with Virender Sehwag finishing the over.

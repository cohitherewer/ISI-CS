	New Delhi: World champion marksman Manavjit Singh Sandhu lived up to his top billing and clinched the trap gold at the ISSF World Cup in Acapulco, Mexico.         
	Manavjit qualified for the final round after shooting 122 with a series of 25, 24, 24, 25, 24 and was a point behind qualification-round leader Daniele Resca of Italy.         
	The 34-year-old Indian missed two birds in the final but held his nerve to hit the remaining 16 targets to grab the gold with a point margin. His final score was 145 (122+23).         
	Manavjit had recently won gold at the Commonwealth Shooting Championships in Delhi.         
	I did not realise that I was going to win until the last shots. It has been a very close competition. I just won by a single target. I shot aggressively up until the end and eventually made it to the top, Manavjit said from Acapulco.         
	It was a long trip here from India but it was worth it. I am planning to take part in most of the ISSF World Cup stages, this year, added the 2006 World Championship gold medallist.         
	Another Indian, Anirudh Singh also impressed by entering his first ever World Cup final with a score of 122. On Day I of qualification, Anirudh had shot a perfect 75/75. In the two remaining rounds, he shot 24 and 23 to qualify for the finals with a score of 122.         
	Anirudh registered a total score of 143 which had him at fourth with Pellielo Giovanni of Italy. In the shoot-off, Anirudh defeated the Beijing Olympic silver medallist by 2 hits to 1.

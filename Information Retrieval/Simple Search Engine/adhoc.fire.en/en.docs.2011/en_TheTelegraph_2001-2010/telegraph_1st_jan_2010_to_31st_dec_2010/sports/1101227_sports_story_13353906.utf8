	Melbourne: What a load of Christmas presents for England! Half of Australias batsmen gave their wickets away on the opening day of the fourth Test, gift-wrapped, and with it their chance of regaining the Ashes.         
	Australia were sent in and bowled out for only 98 by James Anderson (four for 44), Chris Tremlett (four for 26) and Tim Bresnan, who replaced Steve Finn and bowled steady fast-medium. It was Australias lowest total against England since 1968  and an astonishing capitulation after the home side had levelled the series at 1-1 in Perth.         
	But above all it was headless-chicken batting by Australia that gave the series away. Conditions were easier in the second half of the day when the sun came out over the Melbourne Cricket Ground, but they were not completely different. It was more a case of Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook batting with good techniques and sense.         
	Shane Watson, Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey were dismissed by fine balls from Englands seamers, who were superlatively disciplined. But Australias other batsmen kept making the same mistake, one after the other, in a display that would have made their batting coach Justin Langer weep.         
	Phil Hughes, Michael Clarke, Steve Smith and Brad Haddin chased the ball, played loose offside-drives and edged catches. Even though England missed two hard chances  Paul Collingwood at third slip and Kevin Pietersen at gully  they still accepted ten chances offered behind the wicket: Santas reindeer wouldnt be so generous.         
	It was all very reminiscent of Boxing Day in 1986 when Australia batted first  and, again, like headless chickens. England went on to win by an innings, and to retain the Ashes 2-1.         
	On that day 24 years ago it was Gladstone Small and Ian Botham who bowled outswing and watched the Australians bat artlessly. This time it was Anderson and Bresnan bowling outswing, while Tremlett  the tallest bowler on show  floored Watson and Ponting with his bounce and seam: the first ball moved into Watson, the second away from Ponting, who could not blame the broken little finger of his left hand for the dismissal.         
	Tremlett has not bowled a bad spell since coming in as Stuart Broads replacement. He was probably the last selection for this tour but an inspired one.         
	He has been consistently accurate and hostile, a rare combination. At 29, he might have a couple of years at the top still in him.         
	Anderson could not have asked for better conditions. It was cloudy during Australias innings, and rain for 50 minutes either side of lunch maintained the moisture in the pitch. But it was not an obvious bowl-first pitch: Strauss took a bit of a gamble, one which was based on the accuracy of Englands seamers through the series.         
	In his opening spell of seven overs Anderson did not take a wicket: instead he had those two hard chances dropped behind the wicket. On his return though, just before lunch, he took the critical wicket of Hussey, half-driving at a length ball that left him.         
	Bresnan brought with him fast-medium steadiness as well as a hint of swing, Steadiness is not what Hughes can be accused of: he could not be more different from the man he has replaced Simon Katich. If Broads injury has hurt England a little, Katichs Achilles injury has devastated Australia because they can no longer make a sound start.         
	Englands opening batsmen had played at the MCG in the state game against Victoria a fortnight ago: their reconnaissance was not wasted as they knocked off Australias total by themselves. No loose drives by Strauss and Alastair Cook.         
	Cook, who had his 26th birthday on Christmas Day, was first to 50  enjoying the waywardness of Australias seam attack  while Strauss soon followed, after reaching 6,000 Test runs.         
	A crowd of 84,000 watched the first day. Not so many Australian supporters will attend the second.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

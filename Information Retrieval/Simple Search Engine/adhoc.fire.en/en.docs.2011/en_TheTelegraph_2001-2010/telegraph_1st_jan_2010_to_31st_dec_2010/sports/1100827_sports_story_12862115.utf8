The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwals feat amazing: Tendulkar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Atwals feat amazing: Tendulkar
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar has never met Arjun Atwal, but they actually share a bond: The 37-year-olds are members of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).         
	While Atwal is in the permanent category, Sachin is an honorary life member.         
	Sachin, therefore, had an additional reason to rejoice over Atwals superb win on the US PGA Tour, the first by an Indian, on Sunday/Monday.         
	Atwal, it may be recalled, finished right at the top in the Greensboro-hosted Wyndham Championship. Besides collecting his fattest cheque, $918,000, he regained his Tour card.         
	Four rounds of golf can make all the difference.         
	In one word, Atwals achievement has been brilliant... Amazing, really... He has shown that an Indian has it in him to win on a truly big stage and, like the other countrymen, Ive been delighted, Sachin told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Sachin added: Its great when any Indian succeeds at the international level, but a first remains special ... I know Atwal essentially is a Calcutta boy and perfected his swing at the RCGC...         
	[In an exclusive message texted from Orlando, where hes based, Atwal said: Ive always admired Sachin for his humility... For a superstar, hes so well grounded. From a distance, I find that so remarkable.]         
	Atwal has interacted with quite a few in the Sachin-league, some possibly even bigger, but didnt exactly find them humble.         
	Crickets No.1 accumulator of runs and records was awarded the honorary life membership in 1999, but hasnt had the time to play at the iconic facility.         
	Sachin explained: It has always been rushed (in Calcutta)... At some point, Ill find time to play at the RCGC... In fact, at some stage, I wish to take up golf in a big way... Id really like to.         
	Sir Ian Botham, Kapil Dev and Brian Lara, for example, have.         
	But for a groin strain, suffered during the Test series in Sri Lanka, Sachin wouldve been in Dambulla, preparing for Saturdays tri-series final, against the hosts. Instead, hes now fine-tuning the Mumbai Indians strategy in the lead up to the T20 Champions League.         
	With Sachin leading from the front, the Mumbai Indians finished runners-up (to the Chennai Super Kings) in the last IPL, thereby qualifying for the Champions League, to be played in South Africa.         
	Sachin will again be seen in the India cap during the tour by Australia. Thats some weeks away, though.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warning to the French government
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warning to the French government
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Johannesburg: Fifa president Sepp Blatter warned the French government on Tuesday not to interfere in the affairs of its soccer association or the sports governing body could suspend Frances football federation.         
	Blatters threat came a day after French Football Federation (FFF) president Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned in the wake of Frances World Cup fiasco.         
	French Sports Minister Roselyne Bachelot had said last week Escalettess resignation was unavoidable.         
	In France they have made an affaire dEtat with football, but football remains in the hands of the federation, Blatter told reporters on Tuesday.         
	French football can rely on Fifa in case of political interference even if it is at presidential level, it is a clear message. We will help the national association and if cannot be solved by consultation then the only thing we have is to suspend the federation.         
	Frances group stage exit, marred by the players decision to boycott a training session in support of expelled striker Nicolas Anelka, has sparked soul-searching and high-level meetings in the country.         
	Such was the national angst in France that President Nicolas Sarkozy urged a soccer shake-up and met former team captain Thierry Henry.         
	The debate will continue with the news on Tuesday that both coach Raymond Domenech and Escalettes would be heard by a parliamentary commission of the National Assembly on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, Guy Chambily, a member of the FFF federal council, has called for a complete overhaul of the organisation following Frances World Cup debacle.         
	Chambily insists the resignation of Escalettes is not enough and the position of anyone who supported Domenech should come into question.

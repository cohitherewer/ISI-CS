The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zulqarnain asylum decision tomorrow
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zulqarnain asylum decision tomorrow
                      
	Karachi: Zulqarnain Haider will find out on Friday if the authorities in the United Kingdom are willing to grant him asylum.         
	The Pakistan wicket-keeper, who deserted the national team midway through a series in Dubai last month, has been summoned for a hearing with the home department in London on Friday regarding his application for asylum in the UK.         
	Zulqarnain will know his fate on Friday in all probability, one source said.         
	The source said that the wicket-keeper had also contacted his lawyers in London and requested them to represent him at the meeting.         
	The law firm had earlier this week made it clear that it no longer was representing the Pakistan player since he had failed to show up for important meetings and not bothered to return calls to them as well.         
	Home department officials in London declined to comment on the Pakistan players application status pointing out that they were not allowed to discuss any applicants issue with anyone. But they confirmed that his application was under process.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Ryder: Excellent Indian bowling
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Jesse Ryder believes that the reason behind New Zealands collapse on Saturday was not because of lapses from the Black Caps batsmen, but it was rather the Indian bowlers well exploitation of conditions and accuracy which triggered the downfall.         
	Indians bowled excellently We lost three quick wickets in the first session and that shifted the balance, said Ryder, who accumulated 70 well-made runs for his team.         
	Then after Virender Sehwags fireworks and Gautam Gambhirs patient knock, the visitors did manage two late wickets on the day to not let India snatch the entire momentum.         
	We were on the backfoot when Sehwag was batting So, it really helped us when we got those late wickets. We will have cash in on those two wickets when we take the ground tomorrow (Sunday), Ryder said.         
	Asked if he thought that Sehwag attempted an unnecessary shot when on 96, Ryder said: But that is the way he always plays He played his entire innings today in the same manner. So I dont think that Sehwag was dismissed in a bizarre manner, neither were we surprised with it. As far as we are concerned, we are happy that we got his wicket.

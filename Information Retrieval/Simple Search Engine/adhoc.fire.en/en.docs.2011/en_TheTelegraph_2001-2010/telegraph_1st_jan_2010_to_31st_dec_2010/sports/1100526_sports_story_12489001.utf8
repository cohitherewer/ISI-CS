The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Move to end impasse over John Howard 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Move to end impasse over John Howard 
    - David Morgan, Sharad Pawar set to meet in Dubai           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          John Howard      
	London: David Morgan, the outgoing International Cricket Council (ICC) president, is set to meet his to-be-successor, Sharad Pawar, in the next couple of days to try and end the impasse over John Howards nomination as the next vice-president.         
	Theyre expected to have a one-on-one in Dubai, where the ICC is headquartered.         
	As first reported by The Telegraph last month, the former Australia Prime Ministers nomination has run into big trouble, causing him and Cricket Australia (CA) acute embarrassment.         
	The next vice-president will head the ICC from the summer of 2012, once Pawars two-year term ends.         
	Joint nominee of CA and New Zealand Cricket (NZC), Howard has had to struggle from the very beginning. First, he was locked in a fight with Sir John Anderson, one-time chairman of NZC, and then this deadlock.         
	According to top sources, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), it seems, isnt at all unhappy with the ongoing impasse.         
	Pawar, who takes over next month, doesnt really want another politician to be his No.2... That, too, somebody with Howards profile... The turn of events suits him just fine, is how one source put it.         
	Apparently, therefore, the BCCI is backing Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU). Both CSA and the ZCU have taken the lead in objecting to Howards nomination. While a bit of history is involved, the reasons for doing so are largely political.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but CSA is understood to have strongly objected to Morgans appeal that Howards nomination be endorsed by the ICCs executive board.         
	That, in normal circumstances, wouldve been a formality. But, obviously, many issues have come into play. Most notably the BCCIs stand.         
	Obviously, the BCCI has upset many, but nobody really wishes to antagonise the sports richest body.         
	Another source indicated that a way out could be to call for a fresh nomination. One assumes Sir John wouldnt be keen and, so, a move may well be initiated to persuade Alan Issac, the NZC chairman, to make himself available.         
	Issac wasnt keen, when the process started late last year, which is why NZC put forward Sir Johns candidature for a joint Australia-New Zealand nomination.         
	Pawar and the BCCI wouldnt have a problem with Issac. Ditto where South Africa and Zimbabwe are concerned.         
	The picture is expected to be somewhat clear by the weekend... Much time has, of course, already been lost, pointed out yet another source.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendonboost for KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brendonboost for KKR
  - David Hussey down with a stomach bug       A STAFF REPORTER            Brendon McCullum                                 
	Calcutta: New Zealand wicket-keeper batsman and the franchises captain in edition No.2, Brendon McCullum, joined the Kolkata Knight Riders squad late on Thursday for the remainder of the third edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	The explosive New Zealander is all set to participate in the Knights training session on Saturday. It is still not clear whether McCullum will be given the nod by KKR for Sundays return leg match against the Kings XI Punjab at the Eden.         
	David Hussey was suffering from a stomach bug on Friday and if he fails to recover in time then McCullum can straightaway be slotted into one of the four places for foreign players.         
	Its nothing serious. Its very humid out here. Lets hope he (Hussey) will be training tomorrow, a KKR official informed on Friday.         
	However, there might be a selection dilemma in case Hussey doesnt recover in time.         
	In case Hussey is fit and available, Sourav Ganguly and Dav Whatmore will be faced with problems aplenty in selecting the right combination.         
	Angelo Mathews with his all-round abilities and Shane Bond with his pace are almost certain to retain their places in the playing XI.         
	Both Bond and Mathews bowled well under pressure against the Deccan Chargers on Thursday night. Bond returned figures of one for 28 in four overs.         
	However, the best part about his bowling was the clever mix of slower deliveries towards the end of the Chargers innings.         
	Neither can Mathewss selection be questioned as he is the only genuine pace-bowling all-rounder in the side.         
	It then boils down to Chris Gayle and Hussey. Gayle, who has scored 123 runs from four matches so far, hasnt really been in his element after the unbeaten 75 against Mumbai Indians in his first appearance this season.         
	A strike rate of 123 is pretty poor by his standards. However, it is always risky to bench a player like Gayle who, on his day, is a proven match-winner.         
	Hussey, on the other hand, is a vital cog in a middle-order, which has often failed to deliver in crunch situations. Although not one of the biggest hitters of the ball, Hussey can anchor the innings well, which gives the big-hitting players like Gayle and Sourav a chance to attack.         
	With Sourav doing well as an opener it suddenly becomes a problem accommodating the maverick New Zealander, whose unbeaten 158 (73 balls) in the opening match of IPL I against Royal Challengers Bangalore wont be forgotten in a hurry.         
	Also, with no additional burden in the form of captaincy, McCullum would like to make amends for his poor show last season when he managed 285 runs from 13 matches with a mediocre average of 23.         
	There was no practice session scheduled on Friday and Sourav left for home in the afternoon while some of the players were busy shooting for promotionals.

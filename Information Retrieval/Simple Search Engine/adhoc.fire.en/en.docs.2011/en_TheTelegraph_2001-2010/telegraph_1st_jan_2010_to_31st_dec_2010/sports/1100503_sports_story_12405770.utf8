The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sports ministry limits tenure of NSF heads
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sports ministry limits tenure of NSF heads
            OUR BUREAU                      
	In a bid to crack down on National Sports Federation (NSF) heads who have been occupying the posts for too long, the sports ministry Sunday said NSF chiefs in office for more than a decade will have to step down after their current term expires.         
	The ministry has modified a 1975 regulation that means Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief Suresh Kalmadi and several NSF chiefs including V.K. Malhotra (archery), Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa (cycling), V.K. Verma (badminton), captain Satish K Sharma (aero club) and B.S. Adityan (volleyball) cannot seek a re-election after their present term expires.         
	The move is also being interpreted as a fallout of sports minister M.S. Gills ongoing feud with Kalmadi, who has been at the helm since 1996.         
	The ministry said it has decided to restore the modified tenure clause, which was kept in abeyance by former sports minister Uma Bharti in 2001, to encourage professional management, good governance, transparency, accountability, democratic elections, etc. in NSFs, including the IOA.         
	The original 1975 regulation introduced by the Indira Gandhi government had capped the tenure of the president, the secretary and the treasurer at not more than two consecutive terms of four years each.         
	The modified clause caps the tenure of the president of an NSF, including the IOA, to 12 years with or without break. For the secretary and the treasurer, it shall not be more than two successive tenures of four years each.         
	There will be a retirement age of 70 years for all the members and office bearers, the ministry said. Most of the NSFs have politicians at the top, while bureaucrats and businessmen too have been found clinging onto the top posts for long.         
	The ministry said all previous efforts to limit the tenure met stiff resistance from NSFs, who cited the autonomy provided to them in the Olympic Charter. The ministry, on its part, cited a 2009 Delhi High Court observation that the tenure clause is not a violation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) charter.         
	Reckoning that the modified clause brings NSF tenure regulation in line with that of IOC, the ministry said: The above mentioned tenure limit shall come into operation with immediate effect for all elections conducted henceforth.         
	However, in the case of existing office bearers who are attracting the above restrictions, but were duly elected to their posts, and are currently serving their tenure, the tenure limit will be enforceable only after the expiry of the current tenure.         
	The NSF chiefs, on the other hand, threatened that they would move Supreme Court to thwart the move.         
	It is a ridiculous decision. These guidelines first came out during emergency in 1975 and court had issued notice asking under what law the government was to implement them, said VK Malhotra.         
	They were never implemented and after 35 years they have been brought in now, that too in a year when India is hosting the Commonwealth Games, Malhotra added.         
	In the name of good governance if the minister wants us above 70 years of age to retire then why was he (M. S. Gill) still minister? he asked.         
	However, Gill said that it was a good move.         
	 I passed this order in confidence that it will serve the best interest of the sportspersons of the country and it will give an impetus to transparent and professional management of Indian sports in the new century, the sports minister said.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar closed the gap on Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara to just two ratings points at the top of the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Rankings for Batsmen, following his 50th Test century, in the Centurion Test, which finished on Monday.         
	With two Tests of the three-match series still remaining, Tendulkar has an excellent opportunity to overtake Sangakkara in the top spot.         
	However, the icon will face tough competition from Jacques Kallis. Kalliss double century, the first of his career, has helped him to gain a place to the third spot, pushing India opener Virender Sehwag in the process into the fourth position.         
	Kalliss innings has also strengthened his position as the leading all-rounder in Tests with a huge 78 ratings points advantage over New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori, who is in the second spot.

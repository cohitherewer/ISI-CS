The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Domenech refused to take the blame
                                                                                                                       7                                      Domenech refused to take the blame
                      
	Paris: Lawmakers involved in a closed-door hearing about Frances World Cup fiasco grumbled that coach Raymond Domenech refused to take any responsibility for his teams misbehaviour and offered no real explanations on Wednesday.         
	Lawmakers said Domenech, who was retiring, tried to pin blame on the press during the parliamentary hearing. Prominent lawmaker Jean-Francois Cope said his testimony wasnt very dignified.         
	Many had kinder words for French Football Federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes, who plans to resign this week, and who also testified at the hearing held by the National Assemblys commission on culture and education.         
	The hearing went ahead despite a warning from Fifa about French government meddling in football affairs.         
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter said the national team risks suspension if President Nicolas Sarkozy or political leaders interfere in the running of the federation. Lawmakers replied that it wasnt Blatters place to tell them how to do their jobs.         
	It isnt Fifas role to threaten French lawmakers; were in a democracy and parliamentarians have the right to hear anyone they want, said lawmaker Eric Ciotti.         
	This isnt just about football, its about France: Its our honour thats at stake, added lawmaker Jacques Remiller.         
	Remiller said the whole hearing was disappointing and not convincing at all.         
	There will have to be more resignations at the federation, because the problems are deeply, deeply rooted, he said.         
	France, who won the 1998 World Cup and were runner-up four years ago, failed to win a game. Worse than that, players went on strike at training after forward Nicolas Anelka was sent home for insulting Domenech.         
	Domenech added yet more dismay by refusing to shake hands with rival coach Carlos Alberto Parreira after Frances 2-1 loss to host South Africa. Lawmakers said Domenech blamed a French newspaper, which printed details of Anelkas expletive-laden tirade, for the disarray.

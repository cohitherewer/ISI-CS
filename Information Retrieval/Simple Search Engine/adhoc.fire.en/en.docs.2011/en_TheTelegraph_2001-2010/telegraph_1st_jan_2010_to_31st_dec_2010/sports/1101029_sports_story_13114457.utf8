The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ministry scuttles IOA plan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ministry scuttles IOA plan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) plan to send a huge contingent for the Asian Games in China, beginning November 12, has been scuttled by the ministry of sports.         
	According to sources in the ministry, IOA has been asked to prune the number of sportspersons by at least 100 members. It has also been directed to reduce the number of officials who are associated with different squads.         
	Initially, the IOA proposed to clear a contingent of 718 sportspersons and 208 officials for the Asian Games, said a ministry official. We have now asked them to take 611 sportspersons and 182 officials, he added.         
	The ministry has also not approved IOAs suggestion of India participating in 37 disciplines in Guangzhou. Instead, the ministry has cleared Indias participation in 35 disciplines. It pointed out that Indias participation in events like roller skating and dragon boat would be of no merit.         
	The government has cleared participation in triathlon and beach volleyball but will not bear any expenses for the squads because of their unsatisfactory performances in the recent months.         
	There, however, was good news for the IOA because the government has agreed to bear the cost for squads taking part in 33 disciplines that include football, basketball, handball, ten pin bowling, fencing and rugby, sports which have not been doing well recently.         
	In the 2006 Doha Asian Games, the sports ministry only agreed to bear the cost of sending teams in 24 disciplines while seven other teams had to go on their own.         
	Just like for the Commonwealth Games, the athletics squad will once again be the largest among the Indians in China. While the Athletics Federation of India has chosen 40 men and 31 women athletes, 26 officials will accompany them.         
	The swimming squad has been heavily cut. In the Commonwealth Games, the Swimming Federation of India (SFI) fielded a 53-member team but only Prasanta Karmakar managed to win a bronze in para swimming. This time, the SFI has decided to send nine male swimmers in all to China.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans terrible run since last month continued as they just managed to hold on to a 2-2 draw against Railway FC after trailing twice in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. This also turned out to be the last match for Satyajit Chatterjee as Bagan coach. He resigned soon after.         
	Till the 70th minute, Bagan were down 1-2. Japanese Ryuji Sueoka who scored the equaliser from a Barreto assist after Tomba Singh took the corner.         
	Earlier, in the 57th minute, Swarnava Barua scored off a rebound when Palash Mondals spot-kick was saved in the first attempt by goalkeeper Shilton Paul. It was a match where Bagan missed a lot of chances. Even Barreto missed sitters on at least three occasions, and was jeered by the crowd.         
	Although he combined well with Sueoka, poor finish led to Bagans downfall. Once Barretos header went over the bar and on another occasion, his shot sailed over the horizontal when he had the opposition goalkeeper at his mercy.         
	Railway FC first surged ahead in the 13th minute, courtesy Dinesh Swar, who nodded home a Swarnava cross. However, Bagan neutralised the strike within 10 minutes, when Barreto scored from the spot.         
	A Zenith Genius cross found Sueoka, who was brought down by Railway custodian Sudipto Banerjee. Sudipto, however, effected a couple of good saves and was adjudged the Man of the Match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shane keen to resume rivalry

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar, in Mumbai, on Friday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Shane Warne is keen to resume his rivalry with Sachin Tendulkar when he leads Rajasthan Royals against the latters Mumbai Indians in an Indian Premier League (IPL) clash here on Saturday.         
	Sachin has been the greatest batsman in my 20 years of international cricket. He has been the greatest challenge to bowl to and I am hoping to resume that, Warne, whose team lifted the trophy in the inaugural season in 2008, said on the eve of the match at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	Warne has not forgotten how, at this very venue, Tendulkar went after him hammer and tongs in the lead up to the 1997-98 series against Mark Taylors Australia, which India won 2-1.         
	He has won some battles, and I have won some. We are good friends, but as soon as we are out in the middle, I am trying to get him out and hes trying to hit me for a six.         
	So, I suppose that is something that the fans like to watch and they have seen it for a long time. Particularly out here they have seen him win most of the times and hit me halfway out of the stands and I wish to put it right tomorrow.         
	Warne, though, had the last laugh when the two met in IPLs edition No.2 in South Africa, getting out to the master leg-spinner in the second clash between the two teams, the first having been washed out by rain.         
	Much water has flown down the Ganges since then. Besides Ravindra Jadeja, who has been suspended for a year, the Royals would be without South African Johan Botha and Warnes compatriots Shane Watson and Adam Voges.         
	Similarly, the hosts would miss West Indians Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard, major purchases in the player auction this year.         
	Pollard has been in good form recently and he is an excellent finisher. We would have liked to have him for the tie but we have players to fill in, Mumbai Indians coach Robin Singh said.         
	Apart from Tendulkar, Mukesh Ambanis Reliance-owned team can depend on Sanath Jayasuriya for batting firepower while Indias pace spearhead Zaheer Khan, promoted to the vice-captaincy, will lead the bowling.         
	But the pace attack would miss Sri Lanka pacer Dilhara Fernando who has been ruled out with injury.

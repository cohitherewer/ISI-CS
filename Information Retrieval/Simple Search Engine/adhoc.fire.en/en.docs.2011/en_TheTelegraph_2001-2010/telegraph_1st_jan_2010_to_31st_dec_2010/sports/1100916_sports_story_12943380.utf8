	British athletes worried about the security threat in New Delhi will be reassured by the presence of more than 20 Metropolitan Police officers for the duration of the Games.         
	The officers, some of whom have already arrived in the Indian capital to monitor the final security preparations, will look after the interests of all four home nations as well, the smaller teams of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.         
	They will work in the athletes village and at all the 11 Games venues, though their primary role will be to liase with their Indian counterparts about security arrangements and raise any concerns about the safety of British competitors.         
	None of them will be armed.         
	They will be in addition to the team of close-protection officers who will travel to India with the Prince of Wales for the opening ceremony. Bodyguards will also accompany Prince Edward, who is vice-patron of the Commonwealth Games Federation.         
	Although it is nothing new for teams to bring their own security advisers to the Commonwealth Games, the large number of British police officers reflects the seriousness with which the safety of home athletes is being taken following the Mumbai terrorist attack two years ago and the bombings this year in Pune and Bangalore.         
	The advice of the Foreign Office to travellers to India is that there is a high threat from terrorism throughout India.         
	Recent attacks have targeted public places including those visited by foreigners.         
	Although there is no credible intelligence about a specific terrorist threat to the Games, the British High Commission and Scotland Yard recently warned of the likelihood of attacks on soft targets during the build-up to the Games.         
	The British High Commission has also joined forces with the high commissions of Australia, Canada and New Zealand to pool security resources.         
	Police from all four countries will work together throughout the Games and exchange information and intelligence on security. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has provided each of them with extra accreditation passes to give their police officers full access to Games venues.         
	Delhi Police have also set up an international security liaison group to share any intelligence about possible terrorist activity.         
	The group, which comprises senior Indian police officials and security experts from the four countries, will meet daily during the Games at its control room in the Claridges Hotel in central Delhi.         
	The Indian authorities have sought to reassure visiting nations about the safety of their athletes by providing a massive police and military presence at the athletes village, the venues and at the citys main tourist sites and market places.

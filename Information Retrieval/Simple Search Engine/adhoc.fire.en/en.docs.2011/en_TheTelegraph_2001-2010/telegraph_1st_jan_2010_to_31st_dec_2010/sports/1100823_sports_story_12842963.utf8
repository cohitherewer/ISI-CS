                                                                                                                       7                                      NZ tie is now like semi-final: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men required a win on Sunday to ensure a place in tri-series final. However, against Sri Lanka, in Dambulla, they succumbed to their worst defeat, by virtue of balls to spare.         
	Also, the fact that few of the Indians fell prey to dubious decisions by the umpires didnt help Dhonis cause.         
	The India-New Zealand match on Wednesday will be a virtual semi-final with the winners joining the Lankans in the summit clash.         
	Dhoni, at the post-match presentation ceremony, admitted that they were outplayed in the match. He added that not getting a proper start inspite of winning the toss cost them dearly.         
	Dhonis counterpart Kumar Sangakkara praised his bowlers and said that his team had variety in their bowling attack. He also lauded Man of the Match Thisara Perera for his impressive performance.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sangakkara: Had I won the toss, we, too, would have batted first. There was a bit in the wicket all through the day. Our bowlers utilised that and put up a great performance to give us the victory. We have got variety in our bowling attack. (Lasith) Malinga is a dangerous combination with his pace, swing and yorkers He is a constant threat to the opponent batsmen. (Nuwan) Kulasekara and Angelo (Mathews) are impeccable with their line and length, and supports that well with swing. And Thisara did exactly what we needed him to do He has always been important for the team. Promoting Mahela (Jayawardene) to open the innings was a conscious decision since he has always been good opening the innings in ODIs and T20s. He is the best batsman we have and so it is important to let him bat freely. He also enjoys himself batting up front. So it is apt for him to open the innings. My decision to come up to the wicket while keeping was due to the fact that the Indians, or for that matter any batsman, under these circumstances would step out to negate the movement. We didnt want the Indians to have that freedom. But then, it was our bowlers who played the most important part. They ensured that the batsmen were tied down.         
	Dhoni: We won the toss but didnt get the start we needed. Losing so many wickets early is not the ideal way to begin. Our batsmen never managed to put up a challenging total on board for the bowlers to challenge the Lankans. But the Sri Lankans bowlers bowled superbly to help their team to victory. Because of this loss, Wednesdays match against New Zealand is now like a semi-final. Its simple We need to win to proceed to the final, else we pack our bags and go home. It was nice to see Yuvraj (Singh) get some runs. However, he didnt get able support at the other end. He has always been crucial to our plans and it is a good sign for the team if he is scoring runs.         
	Perera: Im very happy with my performance since this (5/28) is my best bowling performance in an ODI. I hope that I will be able continue with this form. I have been working hard at the nets and so it is nice to be rewarded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Red Bull loses its fizz
                                                                                                                       7                                      Red Bull loses its fizz

	You might have expected their respective moods to be as dark as the rain clouds that spewed forth for most of the day over the Gilles Villeneuve circuit but Red Bulls drivers, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, gave a passable impression on Thursday of having moved on from their Turkish tiff.         
	A throng of about 50 bedraggled journalists huddled beneath a couple of umbrellas in the cramped confines of the Montreal paddock to see whether sparks were still flying between the pair in the wake of their bust-up two weeks ago.         
	It turned out to be something of a damp squib. Webber, up first and as phlegmatic as ever, assured us he was absolutely cool and totally over the incident in Istanbul in which he collided with his teammate as the pair vied for the lead.         
	And Vettel smiled serenely when asked repeatedly whether he felt he had something to apologise for. What happened, happened, said the German. You cant change it now.         
	Of course, you would not have expected them to say anything different. Since Vettel got out of his car in Turkey waving his finger around his temple as if to suggest Webber was crazy, and the Australian countered by suggesting the team might be favouring their golden German goose, they both had the party line well and truly drilled home.         
	Accordingly, they acted like chastised schoolchildren, smiling as if to admit they had both been a bit naughty, but defiant at the same time.         
	Neither apologised to the other, although Vettel denied he was like his compatriot, Michael Schumacher, who found it so hard to say sorry.         
	They have done that already. Vettel and Webber took the entire team out for a morale-boosting meal in Montreal on Wednesday and you suspect they are back to where they were before, which is to say they do not get along brilliantly but nor do they dislike each other so much that they are likely to do it again.         
	As Vettel said, once was stupid, twice would be really stupid.         
	In fact, the major narrative of the past fortnight in F1  intrigue at both Red Bull and McLaren  may have covered up the real story, which is that McLaren were so much closer to Red Bull than expected in Istanbul.         
	The Woking-based team are expected to prosper again on the streets of Montreal this weekend.         
	Although Lewis Hamilton said on Thursday that McLaren had not made a significant step forward to close the gap, the fast-straight/slow-corner characteristics of the Gilles Villeneuve circuit should play into his teams hands.         
	That is certainly the way the son of the man after whom the circuit was named, sees it.         
	It is a circuit requiring low downforce and with low speed corners, which I think will suit McLaren, 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve said.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

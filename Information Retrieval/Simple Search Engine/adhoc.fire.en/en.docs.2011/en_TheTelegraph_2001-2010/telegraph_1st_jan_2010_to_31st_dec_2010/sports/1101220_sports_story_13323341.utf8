The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India in trouble, despite Tendulkar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Team India in trouble, despite Tendulkar
  - Visitors staring at defeat after finishing Day IV on 454/8; Captain Dhoni falls for 90             Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on way to his 90, on Sunday                           
	Centurion: Sachin Tendulkar created history on Sunday when he notched up his 50th Test century but India found themselves staring at defeat, on the fourth day of the first Test, against South Africa.         
	Tendulkar (107 batting) played a sublime innings and shared a 172-run stand for the seventh wicket with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (90) to lead a spirited fightback for India, before the visitors slumped to 454 for eight when stumps were drawn early due to rain.         
	With an entire final day remaining, Indias chances of saving the match depends on Tendulkar and how the elements play a role in the high-profile series opener. But it appears almost impossible for India to save the game with just two wickets remaining.         
	Tendulkar and Dhoni joined forces when India were reduced to 277 for six and an innings defeat was threatening the visitors. However, the duo were never in discomfort while facing the South African bowlers throughout their innings and kept adding runs at a brisk pace.         
	Tendulkar reached the historic moment with a single off Dale Steyn, a perfectly placed drive that pierced through cover and extra cover midway into the final session.         
	But the joy of the iconic batsman reaching the milestone did not last long as just four overs later Dhoni perished to a rising delivery from Steyn. The Indian captain was caught in an awkward position and fended it to Boucher, who took a neat catch diving to his right.         
	Once the big partnership between Tendulkar and Dhoni, India lost Harbhajan Singh too. The off-spinner could score just one run from two balls.         
	With Tendulkar and Dhoni handling the South Africans pretty well, India cruised to 394 for six at the tea break. The duo, who added 117 runs from 28.1 overs in the post-lunch session.         
	Tendulkar, who came in at the fall of nightwatchman Ishant Sharma in the morning session, stood rock solid while Dhoni was at times more aggressive than his senior partner.         
	Dhoni gave Steyn some special treatment by hitting the South African speedster for a flurry of boundaries and that came after the home side had taken the second new ball.         
	South Africa took the new ball after 2.1 overs in the post-lunch session but the Indians were undeterred as they punished Morne Morkel with three fours in a single over.         
	Tendulkar reached his fifty off 94 balls cracking a four  a slap through extra cover  off Steyn. Dhoni looked his fluent self as he hit three boundaries off Jacques Kallis. He raced to his 20th Test fifty in quick time, off just 41 balls, with the help of nine fours.         
	Surprisingly, the Indian duo did not take much chance against left-arm spinner Paul Harris. Earlier, India lost the wickets Rahul Dravid (43), VVS Laxman (8) and Suresh Raina (5) and nightwatchman Ishant Sharma (23) in the morning session and trailed by 207 runs as they reached 277 for six at lunch.         
	Resuming at 190 for two, the visitors added just 87 runs from the 33.4 overs they faced in the morning session which started half an hour before the scheduled time to compensate for loss of time on the first day.         
	Dravid and Ishant started cautiously and runs came in trickles initially. Dravid dug deep, playing the balls on merit. Ishant, at times, took his chances and hit three fours  two off Lonwabo Tsotsobe and one off Steyn. He added 16 runs to his overnight seven before getting out.         
	Dravid became only the third player in history to score 12,000 Test runs when he reach 43. Dravid, who went into the first Test needing 57 to touch 12,000 runs, had scored 14 in the first innings. The 37-year-old is third in the all-time list behind Tendulkar and Australian captain Ricky Ponting.         
	During Indias first innings, Dravid had become the third highest Test run-getter, surpassing former West Indian captain Brian Lara.           (AGENCIES)

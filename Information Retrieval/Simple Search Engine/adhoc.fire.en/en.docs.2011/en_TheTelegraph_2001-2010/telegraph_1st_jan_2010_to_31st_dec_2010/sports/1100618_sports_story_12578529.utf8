	Dublin: Tim Paines defiant 81 and James Hopes brilliant spell (five for 14) ensured a 39-run win for Australia against Ireland in an ODI match at the Clontarf Cricket Club ground here on Thursday. Australia scored modest 231 for nine and then bowled out Australia for 192 in 42 overs.         
	Opting to bat, the Australian opener faced 122 balls hitting two sixes and five fours in the process. Paine was at the wicket for all but the final six overs of the innings.

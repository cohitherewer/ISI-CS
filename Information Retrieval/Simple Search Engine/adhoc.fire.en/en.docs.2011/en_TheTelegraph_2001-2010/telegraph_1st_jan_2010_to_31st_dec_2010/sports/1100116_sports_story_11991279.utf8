The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda skips zonal nets for KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dinda skips zonal nets for KKR
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Bengal speedster Ashok Dinda on Friday apologised for attending the Kolkata Knight Riders camp while skipping practice with the East Zone squad for the Duleep Trophy.         
	Dinda, who was back from Dhaka on Thursday, reported at the zonal camp being held at the JU (Salt Lake) ground and excused himself from training citing tiredness. However, within an hour, he was found bowling at the KKR nets at the CC amp;FC ground.         
	A practice match was arranged between the players with bowlers on one side and the batsmen on the other side. Dinda, in fact, bowled a full quota of four overs.         
	The entire episode left those associated with the zonal side red-faced. More so because East Zone convenor Bikash Baruah didnt allow the likes of Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Manoj Tiwary and Sourashish Lahiri to attend the KKR camp.         
	East Zone manager Moloy Chakrabarty (Tripura Cricket Association) when contacted said: Dinda came in the morning and said he was tired. We released him in good faith. Then, we came to know that he was bowling at the KKR nets. This is a breach of trust. I have informed the matter to the East Zone convenor (Baruah) and now its his call.         
	Baruah, on his part, was livid. Dinda called up and admitted that he had bowled at the KKR nets. When I asked him as to why he did so, he apologised. However, if the manager sends an official report, I will have no option but to showcause him.         
	I have also spoken to BCCI vice-president Arindam Ganguly (also the TCA president) and Orissa Cricket Association general secretary Ashirwad Behera and sought their opinion in this regard. Being an India player, he should have behaved more responsibly, Baruah said.         
	Meanwhile, Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla will miss Easts tie against Central starting from Tuesday. Shuklas quadriceps strain, which forced him to opt out of two Ranji Trophy encounters (vs Karnataka and Saurashtra), has recurred again.         
	I am terribly disappointed. The physio today told me that I need to take 8-10 days of complete rest. I hope that if we win against Central, I will be able to play in the semi-final against South Zone in Indore from January 26, Shukla said.         
	East Zone selection committee chairman Raja Venkat as well as Bengals selection committee chairman Sambaran Banerjee said that they were not planning to send anyone as Shuklas replacement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman is at career-best 9th
                                                                                                                       7                                        Laxman is at career-best 9th
            A STAFF REPORTER            Zaheer Khan has moved up to career-best No. 4                           
	Calcutta: The match-winning innings of 96 in the Durban Test has catapulted VVS Laxman to a career-best ninth in the batting chart while pacer Zaheer Khan moved to a career-best mark of No.4 in the bowling list in the latest ICC rankings.         
	According to an ICC release, Laxmans effort in the second innings played a pivotal role in Indias 87-run win, which helped India level the three-match series 1-1, and also pushed him six places up. It is for the first time that Laxman has entered into the top-10 zone.         
	The Hyderabad batsman is now the third Indian batsman inside the top-10 with Sachin Tendulkar sitting in the second position and Virender Sehwag occupying the fourth spot.         
	Zaheer Khan recorded figures of three for 36 and three for 57 in Durban and has been rewarded with a jump of three places which puts him along side James Anderson of England.         
	Off spinner Harbhajan Singh has also improved his ranking by two places and is now in eighth position after match figures of six for 80.         
	Pacer Sreesanth jumped six places to 27th position after match figures of four for 86. In contrast, South Africas top-four batsmen failed to retain their places.         
	Jacques Kallis slipped to fifth (down by two places), AB de Villiers to sixth (down by one place), Hashim Amla to 12th (down by three places) and Graeme Smith to 14th (down by three places).         
	For South Africa, the only consolation is that Dale Steyn has strengthened his No.1 ranking by opening up 83 points advantage over his closest rival, Graeme Swann of England.

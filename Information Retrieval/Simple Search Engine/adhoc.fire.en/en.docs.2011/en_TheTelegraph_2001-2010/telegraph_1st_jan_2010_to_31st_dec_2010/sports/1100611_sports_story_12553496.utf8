        GUEST COLUMN - P. K. BANERJEE                                                     
	With the World Cup beginning on Friday, I find the sports pages of all local newspapers are full of stories on what they call the Greatest Show on Earth. I enjoy reading these stories every morning as it gives me the opportunity to know about the teams and their preparations.        
	Looking at the coverage of the World Cup, I, sometimes, wonder how things have changed over the years. During our playing days in the 50s and 60s, we rarely got to know so much on the World Cup. The media coverage was limited and since there was no television in India, we never had a chance to watch great players like Pele or Bobby Charlton in action.         
	Football also has undergone a sea change over the years. The other day I was amused to read a news item that England coach Fabio Capello has agreed to allow his players to meet their wives and girlfriends during the course of the World Cup. Brazil coach Dunga and Argentinas Diego Maradona, I believe, are also following similar policies.         
	To me, the idea seems to be a revolutionary one. During our days, the footballers were never allowed to mix up with their wives and girlfriends during an important tournament. I was an active coach at both the club and the international level for more than 30 years but never gave permission to the boys to move out of their rooms during the night time. The ideas of the modern day coaches and managers, I understand, have undergone a lot of changes over the years.         
	Back to football, I have a feeling the World Cup in South Africa could be the best ever in history. Though Brazil and Spain are considered frontrunners, I still think there are no clear favourites in this World Cup.         
	]While Brazil are perennial favourites because of their superb track record, Spain have too many talented players in their squad. At the same time, Spain won the Euro Cup in 2008 and did very well in the qualifiers.         
	Yet, will one of us be too much surprised if teams like Argentina, Germany, Italy or England manage to make the final rounds in the next one month? Believe me, I have a strong feeling that an African team like Ivory Coast or Nigeria may storm into the last four at the expense of fancied teams from Europe and Latin America. We should not forget how South Korea marched into the semi-finals when the World Cup was held in the Asian continent for the first time in 2002.         
	Over the years, every World Cup has given us a new star. If Pele was the star attraction in 1958, players like Geoff Hurst and Eusebio stole the limelight in 1966. This time the spotlight will mainly be on Argentinas Lionel Messi, Brazils Kaka and Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo. Though all of them are great players, I would rather prefer to watch some new faces dominating the World Cup. I have nothing against Kaka, Messi or Ronaldo but we have already watched them too many times in club football.        
	I am aware that traditionally stronger football nations have always dominated the World Cup since its inception in 1930. Except for England and France, the rest of the winners have won the Cup more than once. Yet, I am waiting for the day when an unknown nation will pip all other mighty teams to take the World Cup home. That day football will become a truly global sport.        
	Last but not the least  the All India Football Federation (AIFF), I have been told, has chalked out a plan for India to qualify for the World Cup final rounds in 2018. Since I have no knowledge of what the project is all about, I should not comment on it. However, given the current standard of Indian football, I dont think we are in a position to make the team qualify in the next eight years.         
	For the moment, in my humble opinion, our main objective would be to find a place among the top 10 Asian nations. To aim for the World Cup straightaway is not exactly a practical idea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai bow out   of Ranji
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mumbai bow out   of Ranji
                            
	Jaipur: Rajasthan knocked out defending champions Mumbai, on Monday, to enter the semi-finals of the Ranji Trophy.         
	They will now meet Tamil Nadu in the semis, which will be played at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium, from January 3-6.         
	Having already batted Mumbai out with a healthy 232-run lead by the penultimate day, it was just a case of going through the motions on the final day.         
	Former India U-19 captain Ashok Menaria completed his maiden first-class century. Menaria scored 121, an innings that was studded with eight boundaries and five towering sixes.         
	He was the last man out but only after Rajasthan has batted for another couple of hours and taken their total to a mammoth 589. Rajasthan, thus, ensured a place in the semis with a huge 337-run first innings lead.         
	Mumbai scored 290 for one in their inconsequential second innings where Rohit Sharma (68, 72 balls, 11x4) opened with Sahil Kukreja (100 not out, 155 balls, 11x4, 1x6).         
	But Ajinkya Rahane provided some entertainment scoring an unbeaten 102 off only 69 deliveries with 12 boundaries and three sixes.         
	The two teams had crossed swords with each other a number of times in the past, including on seven occasions in the summit clash in a 10-year span, but Rajasthan had never got past Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy before this match.         
	In Indore, Karnataka got the better of Madhya Pradesh by five wickets to book a semi-final berth.         
	After wrapping up Madhya Pradesh quickly on the fourth morning, Karnataka successfully chased down the target of 177 courtesy an unbeaten half century by Amit Verma (68, 125 balls, 10x4). Verma was also Karnatakas top-scorer in the first innings.         
	Karnataka will meet Baroda in the semi-finals, which will be played in Vadodara.         
	Resuming on 312 for seven, Madhya Pradesh could added another 25 runs before being bowled out for 337.         
	In Rohtak, Rajagopal Sathish hit a brilliant century as Tamil Nadu beat Haryana by virtue of better run-rate to enter the semis.         
	In another fog-hit day, Tamil Nadu finished the proceedings at 285 for six in 79 overs, courtesy Sathishs hundred (106, 15x4, 131 balls) and his 91-run fifth wicket stand with skipper Dinesh Karthik (57, 95 balls, 8x4).         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Indore: Madhya Pradesh 200 amp; 337. Karnataka 361 amp; 180/5 (Amit Verma 68n..). Karnataka won by 5 wkts

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gavaskar hits out at media 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gavaskar hits out at media
  - How can I help Kochi when I dont even know the investors                    Sunil Gavaskar                     
	New Delhi: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has lashed out at the Indian media over speculation about his links with the Kochi team and him being dropped from the Indian Premier League (IPL) governing council. He said that Indian media terms anyone guilty until proven innocent.         
	How can I help Kochi when I dont even know the investors, Gavaskar told a TV channel in a written reply.         
	The media both print and electronic have already made up their minds and the angle which they are going to take. My reaction to any query only serves to give their programme or article credibility. It does not in any way change their line of attack. In the eyes of the Indian media, you are guilty till you are proved innocent, Gavaskar stated.         
	The legendary opener also clarified that as far as his knowledge goes, he will be doing commentary during the upcoming India versus New Zealand series.         
	[To put the record straight, The Telegraph would like to make it clear that it has never mentioned that Gavaskar was dropped from the IPL governing council. Also, it has never been suggested that he would henceforth not be doing TV commentary for the home series.]         
	Although he accepted that Rendezvous approached him to guide their team, he didnt give his nod as there were some internal issues within the franchise that were yet to be resolved.         
	Gavaskar also dismissed rumours about remuneration and having helped the Kochi consortium despite being a member of the governing council.         
	Apart from asking if I am available, there has been no talk about any remuneration. As said earlier, since they have internal issues to resolve there is no point talking about the next step.         
	How could I help the consortium since I did not even know who were the other investors apart from Gaikwads? In what way is it a conflict of interest when to win a franchise it was a sealed bid and the highest two were going to get the franchise of their choice? he asked.         
	Gavaskar also said that he declined to be on the governing council simply because I think that former players on it need to be remunerated for the expertise, experience, inputs and time they give to it and the credibility they bring to the GC. The IPL is a commercial enterprise after all.         
	On the contrary, he blamed it as a popular perception that he was dropped from the governing council.         
	The day after the AGM of the BCCI, I was called in Chandigarh by the secretary on behalf of the BCCI president and asked if I was willing to be on the governing council in a honorary capacity and I declined to do so. However by that time everybody and his aunt had already decided that I was sacked, dumped dropped, expelled whatever.           (PTI)

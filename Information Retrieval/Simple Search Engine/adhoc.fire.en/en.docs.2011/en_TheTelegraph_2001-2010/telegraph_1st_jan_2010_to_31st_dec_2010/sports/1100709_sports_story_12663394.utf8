                  Frank Lampards disallowed goal during Englands match against Germany                     
	Johannesburg: The refereeing system will change for the next World Cup with goalline technology and extra officials being considered, Fifa said on Thursday.         
	I would say that it is the final World Cup with the current refereeing system, Jerome Valcke, general secretary of world soccers governing body, told a news broadcaster.         
	Fifas past resistance to change appears to be shifting after some wrong calls in the World Cup, most notably Frank Lampards disallowed effort for England against Germany that crossed the goalline, and Carlos Tevezs offside goal for Argentina versus Mexico.         
	Tevezs goal was replayed on stadium big screens, heightening fury among Mexican players and fans.         
	Valcke said the failure to award Lampards effort was a bad day for organisers.         
	We are talking about a single goal not seen by the referee, which is why we are talking about new technology, he said.         
	But again lets see if this system will help or whether giving the referee an additional four eyes will give him the comfort and make his duty easier to perform         
	The use of two extra linesmen to check the goalline and penalty area was trialled in the Europa League last season and is to be used in the upcoming Champions League, from the final qualifying round, and Euro 2012 qualifiers.         
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter has apologised for the mistakes in South Africa and said it would be nonsense not to look again at the merits of goalline technology such as the Hawk-Eye system used in tennis and cricket.         
	Valcke said the increased speed of modern soccer had hastened the need for reform.         
	The game is different and the referees are older than all the players, he said. The game is so fast, the ball is flying so quickly, we have to help them and we have to do something and thats why I say it is the last World Cup under the current system.         
	The Fifa official said soccers lawmaking body, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), was unlikely to hold serious discussions on the matter at their next meeting later this month, but rather when they sit again in October.         
	The willingness to once again discuss goalline technology signifies a change of heart on part of Fifa after it met the initial outcry over refereeing errors at this World Cup with a studied silence.         
	When Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot met newspersons following the England-Germany match, he was bombarded with queries over the governing bodys take on goalline technology.         
	Maingot, however, despite much provocation, managed to stick to his standard not-in-a-position-to-speak stand on the subject.         
	Fifa does not comment on referees decisions, was all he had to say throughout the conference.         
	When it comes to refereeing decisions, we dont comment on those.         
	The problem was deemed to be Blatters opposition to the use of video technology.         
	In March, in a meeting of IFAB, Blatter dismissed all proposals to introduce changes. But events in South Africa appear to have finally convinced the Fifa president about the need to take a second look at technology.

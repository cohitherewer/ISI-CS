                                                                                                                       7                                        Pronoy, Tushin star in Delhi win
            A STAFF REPORTER            Pronoy Roy                                   
	Calcutta: A brilliant save in the tie-breaker by substitute goalkeeper Pronoy Roy and a miss by Chhattisgarh midfielder Subir Maji ensured Delhis passage into the quarter finals of the Santosh Trophy, beating Chhattisgarh 6-5 (tie-breaker 4-3) in a pre quarter final match, at the Howrah Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	It was a match that Delhi should have won in regulation time as they led 2-0 till the 65th minute. A couple of defensive errors and poor judgement by goalkeeper Pronoy saw Chhattisgarh level proceedings in the next 15 minutes.         
	After a listless 30 minutes of extra-time, Delhi keeper Pronoy did the star turn, as he dived to his left to save Wasim Rajas in the tie-breakers. And the next Chhattisgarh shot, by Subir Maji, sailed over.         
	Delhis Monu Choudhary, Vikas Rawat, Bhuvan Joshi and Tushin Mashangva were on target. Delhi will play hosts Bengal on Friday in their first quarter final group league match.         
	It was Tushin  younger brother of former Mohun Bagan and Churchill Brothers right back Zenith Genius Mashangva  who scored both the goals for Delhi in the regulation time. The first one came in the 39th minute, when Tushin, from a goalmouth melee, back-heeled into the net.         
	The second goal came in the 47th minute when Tushins intelligently taken header foxed Chhattisgarh custodian Partha Dey, who had come out of his charge.

	Calcutta: Trainer Harvinder Singh Baths Secret Whispers may surprise his fancied rivals in 1,100m Stay In Shape Cup, on Wednesday.           
	The Bees Prospector-Tactful son is not only the youngest horse in the field of seven, he is also well in at the weights. Apprentice Shezad Khans riding allowance is expected to further boost his winning chances. The challenge to the four-year-old colt may come from Fire Within (C. Alford-up), who is known to relish the monsoon race track, and Red Indian, a western India-migrant.

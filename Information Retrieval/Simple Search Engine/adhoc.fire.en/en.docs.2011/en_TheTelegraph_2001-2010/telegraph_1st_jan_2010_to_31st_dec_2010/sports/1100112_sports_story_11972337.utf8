            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: There was confusion over Virender Sehwags fitness after the vice-captain wasnt seen accompanying the team to the stadium on Monday. But manager Arshad Ayub dismissed such talk.         
	Viru is fine. Theres nothing wrong with him. Hopefully, hell be there for the final, he said.         
	But why hopefully if he is fit? No, no its just one way of saying I can assure you theres nothing wrong, the former India spinner said.

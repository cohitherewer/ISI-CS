	New Delhi: Rifle shooter Gagan Narang had initially taken to shooting as a pastime, not in pursuit of excellence. But on Saturday, after winning his fourth gold medal in the Commonwealth Games and with two more expected, the MBA degree holder from Hyderabad is set to become one of Indias best sportspersons in the Games history.         
	With four gold medals so far, Narang is now a serious challenger to Australian swimmer Alicia Coutts for the David Dixon award for the best athlete of the Games. Alicia has five gold medals to her credit in the current Games  three individual and two on relays.         
	Narang, however, would compete in two more events and has a chance to overcome the Aussie golden girl. In the last Games, the honour went to pistol shooter Samresh Jung for winning five gold.                   
	According to those who know him well, the successful journey of the handsome Air-India executive, to a world of fame can largely be attributed to his strong mental make-up, which helps him keep his cool and high levels of concentration in tough situations.                     
	Minutes after winning his fourth gold medal, Narang declared shooting as the number one sport in the country. If you go by the medals shooters win in international competitions and their performance, then shooting is the number one, Gagan said.                 
	Unlike other disciplines, we cannot express our feelings in front of the media or fans, because shooting is like that. Nobody should think it was a cakewalk, its all about hard work, Gagan said.         
	Success, however, is not new for Narang, now ranked third in the world in 10m rifle. Narang already has a bronze from the World Championship in August, in Munich, a gold at the World Cup finals (2008), two World Cup gold medals (2009, 2006) and three World Cup bronze (2008, 09, 10).         
	Asked what the secret of his success was, Narang smiled and said: I dont talk about my inner feelings and my satisfaction. I have, and will always let my gun do the talking, he said.

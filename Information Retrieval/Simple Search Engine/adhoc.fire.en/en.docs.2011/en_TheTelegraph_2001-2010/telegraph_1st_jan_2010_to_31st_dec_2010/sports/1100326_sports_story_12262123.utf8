The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL players deserve better pay
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL players deserve better pay
                      
	Mumbai: Former India captain Kapil Dev sees nothing wrong with the way money is being showered on the players in Indian Premier League (IPL) and said that the cricketers deserve even better pay.         
	What is wrong if sportspersons get more money? If someone is paying Rs 1700 crore just to buy an IPL team and spends just Rs 35 crore on players, is it fair? At least 10 per cent of the money should be spent on players, Kapil said Thursday.         
	If I had my way, I would have ensured that Rs 100 crore w as spent on players instead of the now hiked Rs 70 crore, Kapil said when asked for his view on the decision of the IPL governing council to increase the salary cap for players to $7million from $5million. He also thought that crammed schedule for the players was a matter of concern because it results in more injuries.

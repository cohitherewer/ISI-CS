	New Delhi: The local leagues in Calcutta and Goa are set to lose their appeal very soon as the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is planning a total clamp down on the I-League clubs participation in state-level tournaments.         
	Addressing a meeting of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials and representatives of the I-League clubs in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam said he wanted a complete divorce of professional and amateur football.         
	Hammam has formed a committee with himself as its chairman to revamp the I-League. Praful Patel (AIFF president) has been made vice-chairman, said an AIFF official. The recommendations of the AFC panel are not binding and would have to be ratified by the AIFF to come into effect.

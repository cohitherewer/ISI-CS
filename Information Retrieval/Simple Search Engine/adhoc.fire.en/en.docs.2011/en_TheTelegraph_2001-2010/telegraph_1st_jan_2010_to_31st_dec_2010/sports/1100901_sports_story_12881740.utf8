	New York: Two-time Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova reached the second round at the US Open by getting past 39-year-old Kimiko Date Krumm 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, on Tuesday. The 11th-seeded Kuznetsova hit 11 aces, helping make up for five double-faults and a total of 35 unforced errors. She won the 2004 US Open and was the runner-up in 2007. She also won the 2009 French Open.         
	Fourth-seeded Jelena Jankovic came back to avoid a big upset in the first round, edging 18-year-old Simona Halep of Romania 4-6, 6-4, 7-5,.         
	Halep served for the match while leading 5-4 in the third set, and she came within two points of victory. But Jankovic broke her there, and took the final three games.         
	Jankovic made 48 unforced errors, 12 more than Halep, in a match that lasted more than two hours.         
	In the mens singles, Marcos Baghdatis became the highest seed to fall so far, when seasoned Frenchman Arnaud Clement beat him in a five-set thriller.         
	The Cypriot 16th seed led by two sets to one and then by 3-1 in the fifth set but eventually went down 6-3, 2-6, 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 to the 32-year-old Clement, who clinched his first win since Wimbledon. In the battle of the two former Australian Open finalists, Baghdatis recovered from a poor start to storm through the second and third sets for the loss of just three games.         
	But Clement snatched the fourth and then came from 3-1 down to seal victory and a meeting with either American Robby Ginepri or Eduardo Schwank of Argentina.         
	On Monday, one magical point from Roger Federer capped an exhilarating first day, as a host of former champions each took their turn in the spotlight. Five of the former champions were on court playing matches while another, Martina Navratilova, was the guest of honour during a glitzy opening night celebration recognising people who had overcome adversity.         
	Indians had a mixed day with Sania Mirza winning her fourth match on the trot to cruise to the second round at Flushing Meadows, but it was an early exit for Somdev Dev Varman.         
	Sania, who entered the womens singles draw as a qualifier, scored an easy 6-3, 6-2 win over fellow qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito of Portugal in the first-round match.         
	Somdev, who earned a direct entry into a Grand Slam for the first time, went down fighting to South Africas Kevin Anderson 3-6, 4-6, 3-6 in his first round in the mens singles event.         
	It took Sania one hour and 17 minutes to dispatch her rival and set up a second round clash with Russian 20th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. For me, the fact that I am still capable of going on court and winning four matches in a row gives me a lot of confidence that I still have the ability, the No. 1 female Indian player said after her win.         
	Belgiums super-mom Kim Clijsters and Americans Venus Williams and Andy Roddick, all joined Federer by winning their first round matches at Arthur Ashe Stadium in straight sets.         
	It was a stifling hot day in New York but they all made light work of their opponents, with Federer stealing the show with an outrageous between-the-legs winner during his 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 romp against Argentine baseliner Brian Dabul.         
	Only one former champion failed to make it past the first day. Australias Lleyton Hewitt fell to unheralded Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 at the Louis Armstrong stadium.         
	Monday also marked a return of sorts for Roddick and Williams, who have both been battling niggling injuries for the past two months. They may not move as fast as they once did but they can both still wallop the ball and they know how to scratch out a win, Roddick celebrating his 28th birthday by blasting aside Frances Stephane Robert 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 and Williams outclassing Italian Roberta Vinci 6-4, 6-1.

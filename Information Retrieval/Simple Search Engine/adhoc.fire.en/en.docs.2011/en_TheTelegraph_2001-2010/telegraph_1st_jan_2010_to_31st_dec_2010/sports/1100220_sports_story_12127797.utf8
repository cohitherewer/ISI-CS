The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney   returns to roots
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rooney   returns to roots

	London: Although Wayne Rooney is now being feted as one of the greats of the game after his Champions League master class at the San Siro, the adulation will come to a shuddering halt at Goodison Park on Saturday.         
	When he walks on to the pitch when Manchester United take the field versus Everton, the man who electrified Goodison Park as a 16-year-old will get a different kind of welcome from the home fans.         
	It is almost six years since Rooney left Everton to join United but, judging by the pages of a Liverpool daily in recent days, the scars left by his betrayal have yet to heal.         
	They have lost to The Toffees in the league only once in the last 15 years but will have to work for their points against a side who did them a favour earlier this month by beating Chelsea 2-1 as they seek to close the Blues one-point Premier League lead.  
	United manager Alex Ferguson might be tempted to give Rooney a break, but he needs his goals as badly as ever with United trying to catch Chelsea in the Premier League title race.         
	Rooney has started the last 15 league and cup games, scoring 13 times, and Ferguson is likely to stick with his tactic of fielding the striker alongside two wide players  leaving Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen on the bench.         
	There has been an improvement in his game over the last two months, Ferguson said. Confidence has a lot to do with that but its also his ability as a player.         
	Chelsea visit Wolverhampton Wanderers later Saturday when a repeat of their 4-0 Stamford Bridge success in November would be very welcome return to winning ways.         
	Third-placed Arsenal, who conceded what skipper Cesc Fabregas called two schoolboy goals in their 2-1 Champions League defeat at Porto on Wednesday, cannot afford any similar slip-ups against Sunderland if they are to maintain their slim title hopes.         
	And if the Gunners needed extra motivation at the Emirates Stadium, the players need only note that their rivals last Premier League victory was the 0-1 defeat to Arsene Wengers boys in mid-November.         
	Wenger is looking to draft a few players back into his side to pick up the team. He may recall first-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia after Lukasz Fabianski made a mess of his opportunity to impress against Porto, scoring an own goal and needlessly giving away the free kick that led to the second.

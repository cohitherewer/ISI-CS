The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dropped for no valid reason, says Evra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dropped for no valid reason, says Evra
                      
	Bloemfontein: Les Bleus Patrice Evra says coach Raymond Domenech denied him the chance to apologise to French fans for the teams World Cup debacle, and took him out of the team for no valid reason.         
	France were knocked out of the World Cup Tuesday after losing 2-1 in their final group game to South Africa, and Evra said what hurts even more is that this apology should have been made yesterday, but my coach stopped me doing it as a captain.         
	Clearly emotional and struggling to contain his anger, Evra said France will know the truth. I will say everything I went through as captain.         
	Domenech stripped Evra of the France captaincy and dropped him to the bench for the match against the hosts and handed the armband to Alou Diarra instead.         
	And, according to an English daily, he ended his troubled reign as France coach in controversial fashion by refusing to shake Carlos Alberto Parreiras hand at the final whistle. The 58-year-old refused to expand on why he had not accepted the traditional handshake from Parreira. I have no intention of replying to this question, he said.         
	However, Parreira, who guided Brazil to the 1994 title, did try to explain the snub.         
	I believe it was because I had criticised his team after they qualified, but I really dont remember, he said.         
	As to the disastrous campaign, which just got over, Domenech said: Im sad for all the fans and everyone who supports the French team. Its the hard and harsh reality of our situation. So I have a genuine sense of sadness.

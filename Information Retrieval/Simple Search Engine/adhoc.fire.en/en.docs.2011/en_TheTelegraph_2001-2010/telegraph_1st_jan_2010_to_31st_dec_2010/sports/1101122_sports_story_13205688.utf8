The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England are ready for a culture shock
                                                                                                                       7                                        England are ready for a culture shock
  - Brisbane has proved a hot and hostile place for tourists       Scyld Berry            Strauss                                 
	It is the heat that hits you first. When you wake up in subtropical Brisbane in summer, your window and curtains are hot long before 6am. Queensland time is an hour earlier than in the other eastern states, so dawn will arrive at 4.45 am during the first Test.         
	Brisbanes cricket ground is the least English, the most American, in Australia. Englands team bus on Thursday morning will drive to the ground past armed cops and bottle shops fortified like jails, and pull up  soon after 8am  on a four-lane highway that turns into five. Welcome to Vulture Street: the address suggests that the visitor will be preyed upon.         
	Even the name of the ground is not English, or even Strine. Woolloongabba is an Aboriginal word, of disputed meaning, not familiar like the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where English cricketers have played their best in Australia, or Hobart, Englands base for the last week, which is Torbay in a gale.         
	The Gabba has no pavilion, no trees, no bell to tinkle five minutes before the start, nothing soft and English. But cavernous, windowless, functional dressing-rooms at the bottom of a concrete stand, and a buzzer to startle you into action and on to the field.         
	Whether England teams have been shocked by the difference in climate or culture, or by the bowling of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, their Test matches in Brisbane have ended as often as not in disaster. Translated to an environment like Florida, English cricket has often withered  until now.         
	And the Brisbane Test has usually been the first of an Ashes series. This is no conspiracy by Australias administrators to hit the Poms hard, but nature dictating: after Christmas the place is even hotter, steamier and stormier.         
	Still, once the tone of the series has been set, it has very rarely been reversed. The last time that the team which won in Brisbane did not go on to win the series was 56 years ago.         
	History also tells us that whenever England have scored more than 270 in their first innings at the Gabba, they have won or drawn; and whenever they have scored less, they have lost. But neither of these precedents is going to be a guiding principle, given the extraordinary weather that prevails.

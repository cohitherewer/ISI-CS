The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warner, too, was   a target
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warner, too, was   a target
                            
	Melbourne: Explosive New South Wales (NSW) batsman David Warner is the latest to join the list of Australian cricketers who had been approached by an illegal bookmaker.         
	Warner was approached by an Indian bookie during the inaugural Champions League Twenty20, in India, last year, but the dashing left-hander immediately reported the matter to NSW team manager Marshall Rosen.         
	Warner is the fifth Australian cricketer, after all-rounder Shane Watson, wicketkeeper batsman Brad Haddin, and pace duo of Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson, to have been approached by an Indian bookie.         
	A group of guys approached David Warner and some other NSW players at the bar while they were watching a Champions League match on television, Rosen was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper.         
	I was the manager on the trip and he reported to me that the questions being asked and the behaviour wasnt like your typical Indian cricket fan. A seminar had been run before the tournament about gambling and match-fixing and what to do should something arise, he said.         
	Dave (Warner) did exactly what he was supposed to do. He reported it to me and the next day, I passed on the information to the gentleman who was running the anti-gambling program, Rosen added.           (PTI)

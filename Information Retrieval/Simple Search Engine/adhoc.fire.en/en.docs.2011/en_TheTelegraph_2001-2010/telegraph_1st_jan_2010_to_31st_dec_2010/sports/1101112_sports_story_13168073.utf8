The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir is best bet for openers slot: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir is best bet for openers slot: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Gautam Gambhirs failure to strike gold has been a major concern for Team India. But Mahendra Singh Dhoni supported the left-hander saying he should be given more time. At a media conference, on Thursday, Dhoni ruled out picking Murali Vijay ahead of Gambhir .               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Gautam Gambhirs form         
	Players do go out of form. It happens to everyone in cricket. Gambhir has set the benchmark so high that expectations from him have grown. With Gambhir, it is more about the pressure to perform than the fear of failure. I am sure he will come good with the bat sooner than later.         
	If Murali Vijay would be preferred to Gambhir         
	Gambhir is our best bet for the openers slot. Vijay has done well whenever he has been given the chance. But I think he will have to wait his turn.         
	On Suresh Raina         
	You cannot form an opinion regarding a player based on one match. We must give everyone a chance. It is easy to sit outside and make comments.         
	His own form         
	I am getting the starts but need to convert them into 50s and 100s.         
	The Hyderabad wicket         
	It is flat but will offer a bit of bounce, which will allow the batsman to play his shots.         
	Indias recent poor record in the second innings of Tests         
	Its a mental barrier and is about mindset. But we should not be too bothered about all that.  
	On India being at the receiving end of a few umpiring blunders in the last Test  
	You have two umpires who are supposed to take good decisions. If you see Laxmans decision (in Ahmedabad), I dont know what to say exactly about it. We need to improve the standard of umpiring.         
	The need of implementing the UDRS         
	The way its going, if they keep on committing the kind of mistakes they are making, whether we are willing or not willing, well have to go with the review system.

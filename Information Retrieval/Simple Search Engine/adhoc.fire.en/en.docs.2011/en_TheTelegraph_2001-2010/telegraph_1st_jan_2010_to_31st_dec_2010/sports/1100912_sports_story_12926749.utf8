The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Answer blowing in the wind
                                                                                                                       7                                        Answer blowing in the wind
  - At the main court, players have a common opponent
            CHRISTOPHER CLAREY            Caroline Wozniacki                           
	It was August 1997, shortly before the official opening of Arthur Ashe Stadium, the new Centre Court at the US Open, and the leading American players Pete Sampras and Jim Courier had just finished a practice session.         
	Sampras happily reported that the swirling winds that had been a bother in Louis Armstrong Stadium were not a problem in the new stadium. Whats not to like? Courier said that day of the stadium itself.         
	Thirteen years later  numerologists take note  swirling winds have been the talk of the tournament and remain a signature feature of Ashe Stadium, which is considered the most challenging environment of the four Centre Courts in Grand Slam tennis.         
	The Australian Open has Rod Laver Arena; Wimbledon has Centre Court and the French Open has the Philippe Chatrier Court.         
	Im not an architect, so I dont understand the dynamics in play with the design, but I can tell you as a player that the wind in Ashe is the most inconsistent wind of the four major stadiums, said Courier, a television commentator now.         
	That wind, stronger than usual this year in the aftermath of several storms, has had a major impact on the quality of play, with even veteran players struggling with their timing and service tosses.         
	I would say it was the most difficult conditions I have ever played in, Dominika Cibulkova had said after her straight-set defeat against Caroline Wozniacki.         
	Kaia Kanepi made 60 unforced errors and nine double faults in just two sets against Vera Zvonareva as the more experienced and versatile Zvonareva proved much more adept at altering her style to adjust to the gusts.         
	Kanepi, more or less on both ends, was trying to hit through it, said Mark Woodforde, the former Australian doubles star. Zvonareva, just the way she went about her business, was mixing things up just to work with the conditions.         
	Woodforde and his longtime doubles partner Todd Woodbridge played on all the worlds major courts for more than a decade as the most successful team of their era.         
	My view is this one is the hardest one, Woodbridge said. I think its probably because its a bit bigger, with 24,000 seats, so the wind just gets in there and keeps circling around until it gets to court level.         
	With 23,763 seats, Ashe Stadium is the largest tennis-dedicated stadium in the world, far bigger than its three Slam equivalents. When it was constructed, wind patterns were not on the agenda, said Jay Snyder, the Opens tournament director from 1994 to 2000.         
	We talked a lot about court orientations and where the sun is at this time of year and so forth, Snyder said. There wasnt discussion about wind that I can recall. I think it was the second year we were in there, and somebody said, Hey, its kind of windier in here than outside. Its the way the stadium is. Im not sure we can do much about it, because its open.         
	Players frequently comment that even if there is little wind outside the stadium, there is still a palpable breeze at court level.         
	Last year, when I played Serena Williams in the first round, I didnt even get a chance to warm up on Ashe at all before I played, and I was really surprised when I got out there, said the American Alexa Glatch. The court almost feels inclined.         
	It certainly hasnt looked easy in any medium this year. This year is more extreme than I can recall because weve had heat and brutal tropical winds, Courier said.

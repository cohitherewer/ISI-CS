The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal gun for the maximum
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal gun for the maximum
            A STAFF REPORTER            Snehasish Chakraborty                           
	Calcutta: Theres many a sip between the cup and the lip. Thats exactly the reason why Bengal coach Shabbir Ali doesnt want to leave anything on the chance factor.         
	As Bengal gear up to play their final quarter final group league encounter of the Santosh Trophy against Tamil Nadu, draw is the last thing on Shabbirs mind although a point will prove to be good enough for the hosts to make it to the last four stage.         
	Any team aspiring to win the national championship should never think of settling for a draw. Neither me nor my boys are thinking on those lines, a confident Shabbir said after teams training session on Tuesday morning.         
	Both Bengal and Tamil Nadu have four points each from two matches but the hosts are on top with a better goal difference, courtesy their 7-1 win over Mizoram.         
	The only chance of Bengal not making it to the last four is if they lose against Tamil Nadu and Delhi win their last league game against Mizoram.         
	Tamil Nadu are a very good side. We are not in a position to take them lightly. Also after a 7-1 win, there is bound to be expectations of another good show. We just cant let the momentum slip after a commanding performance against Mizoram. Come to think of it, Mizoram were a far better side than Delhi but we dominated them for the entire part of the match, Shabbir said.         
	Bengal are likely to field mostly an unchanged side. This means Shankar Oraon and Tarif Ahmed will be again starting upfront.         
	The Shankar-Tarif combination worked well for us in the last match. So its better that we should stick to the winning formula, the coach added.         
	Tarif has a minor niggle in the ankle. Tarif complained of an ankle sprain. But he practised today and I expect him to play tomorrow. If he cant make it, then Robin Singh and Shankar will start, Shabbir added.         
	However, stopper Arnab Mondal will miss the Tamil Nadu match due to a double booking. Anupam Sarkar will replace the Chirag United player at the heart of the defence.         
	Arnabs absence in the central defence can be a cause of concern for Bengal. Although Anupam is a seasoned campaigner but of late he hasnt played too many matches. He came in for five minutes during the Mizoram match but then Bengal were already up by six goals.         
	The key however will be how Bengals four men at the centre of the park perform.         
	Snehasish Chakraborty and Gauranga Datta were outstanding against Mizoram and one would hope that they display the same form against Tamil Nadu too.         
	The problem with Snehasish and Gauranga has been their consistency. Both have always flattered to deceive when their team needed most.         
	Especially Snehasish  who is brilliant one day and ordinary on another other day.         
	Jayanta Sen and Denson Devadas are two cool customers in the central midfield and will be responsible for feeding Tarif and Oraon.

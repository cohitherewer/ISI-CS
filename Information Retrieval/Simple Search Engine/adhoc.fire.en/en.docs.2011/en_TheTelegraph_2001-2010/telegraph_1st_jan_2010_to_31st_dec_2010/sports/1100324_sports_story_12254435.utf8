The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crucial tie for Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Crucial tie for Blues
                      
	London: Chelseas match at Portsmouth on Wednesday could be the turning point in the clubs challenge for the Premier League title  and coach Carlo Ancelottis future.         
	The Blues would usually be expected to pick up three easy points when they play their game in hand against the leagues last-placed side, but are in what Ancelotti called a difficult moment.         
	Chelsea were eliminated from the Champions League last week and have dropped to third place behind Manchester United and Arsenal after Sundays 1-1 draw against Blackburn took their record to four points from three matches.

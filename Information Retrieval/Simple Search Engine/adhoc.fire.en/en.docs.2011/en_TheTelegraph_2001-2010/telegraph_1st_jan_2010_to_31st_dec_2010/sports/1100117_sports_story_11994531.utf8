The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blues demolish Sunderland 7-2
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blues demolish Sunderland 7-2
                      
	London: Chelsea stormed to a 7-2 victory over Sunderland to remain a point clear at the top of the Premier League as champion Manchester United beat Burnley 3-0 on Saturday.         
	Frank Lampard and Nicolas Anelka both scored twice for Chelsea against injury-plagued Sunderland.         
	Second-place United took until the second-half to get going against Burnley, with Dimitar Berbatov, Wayne Rooney and Mame Biram Diouf eventually hitting second-half goals at Old Trafford.         
	But it was a frustrating day for Liverpool, which conceded a 90th-minute equaliser to draw 1-1 at Stoke, and Tottenham, which was held 0-0 by Hull.         
	Chelsea, though, delivered a masterclass in attacking football at Stamford Bridge to show it can prosper without African Cup of Nations quartet Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, John Obi Mikel and Salomon Kalou.         
	Anelka took just eight minutes to start the rout after rounding goalkeeper Marton Fulop. Florent Malouda added another in the 17th minute, shrugging off two challenges and striking into the bottom corner.         
	The third came five minutes later when Ashley Cole sprinted onto John Terry lofted ball and chipped Fulop. Lampard volleyed home from six meters (yards) before the break.         
	The Blues remained as ruthless in the second-half, with the unmarked Ballack heading in Joe Coles cross in the 52nd, Anelka slotting into an empty net from the edge in the 65th and Lampard nodding in a seventh in the 90th.         
	Sunderland managed two consolation goals through Bolo Zenden and Darren Bent.         
	Steve Bruces side has failed to win in their last eight league games. (AGENCIES)

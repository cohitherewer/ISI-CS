	Bulawayo: Rohit Sharmas maiden ODI century went in vain as a slipshod India slumped to an embarrassing six-wicket defeat against Zimbabwe in the first match of the tri-series here Friday.         
	Rohits well-paced 114 and Ravindra Jadejas unbeaten run-a-ball unbeaten 61 had guided India to a decent 285 for five but the lack of sting and firepower in their bowling attack allowed Zimbabwe to romp home with 10 balls to spare.         
	Chasing the formidable target, Brendan Taylor (81) and Hasan Masakadza (46) gave Zimbabwe a rollicking start and, down the order, debutant Craig Ervine (67 not out) dazzled as the hosts cruised to 289 for four in 48.2 overs.         
	Zimbabwes chase got off to a strong start with Taylor and Masakadza showing scant respect for their opponents and adding 88 runs in 13 overs.         
	Indias three pacemen  Ashok Dinda, Vinay Kumar and Umesh Yadav  were making their ODI debut at Bulawayo.         
	This was a unique occurrence in the history of ODIs when three debutants bowled from positions 1-3.         
	The last such instance, involving a Test playing nation occurred when Australians Max Walker, Gary Gilmour and Geoff Dymock bowled against New Zealand at Dunedin way back on 30 March 1974 36 years ago!         
	Taylor hit Vinay Kumar for two sixes and a four in the 10th over and the partnership was blooming with a 100-run mark in sight when Amit Mishras googly castled Masakadza.         
	Indian bowlers toiled for another 16 overs without any success before Jadeja trapped Graeme Lamb (27).         
	Taylor was looking good for a century but he fell to Vinay Kumar in the 35th over after a 103-ball knock that had four fours and two sixes in it.         
	Charles Coventry (32 off 25 balls) played well too, hitting Yusuf Pathan, Mishra and Vinay Kumar out of the ground before losing his stumps to the pacer.         
	Ervine, however, showed tremendous maturity in his debut match as he and skipper Elton Chigumbura (24 not out) completed the formality without any fuss.         
	Earlier electing to bat first, India were off to a smooth start with Murali Vijay (11) and Dinesh Karthik (22) forging a 56-run opening stand against the wayward Zimbabwean bowlers.         
	It was smooth sailing for the Indians till the ninth over when Vijay was run out which was a combination of Zimbabwe wicketkeeper Brendan Taylors brilliance and the openers laziness.         
	Vijay was ambling towards the batting crease when Taylor collected a Prosper Utseya throw in front of the wicket and flicked it back-handed onto the stumps.           (PTI)

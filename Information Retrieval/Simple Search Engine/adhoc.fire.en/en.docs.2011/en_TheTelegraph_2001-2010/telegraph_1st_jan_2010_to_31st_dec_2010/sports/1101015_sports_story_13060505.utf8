	New Delhi: Super Saina accomplished the mission she set out for. The packed stadium could not get enough of the 20-year-olds antics on court and neither could the media.         
	Saina Nehwal became the darling of the nation the moment Malaysias Mew Choo Wong committed an unforced error on match point.         
	The world No.3 had sealed Indias fate on the Commonwealth Games (CWG) medals tally. Her gold gave the country its 38th, one higher in count than England, and made sure India ended the CWG at the second spot, behind Australia.         
	Saina stretched to the wire, having saved a match point, after 70 tension-filled minutes, defeated Wong 19-21, 23-21, 21-13 in the last match of the 2010 CWG.         
	Even the generally solemn army personnel dropped their guard after this victory. Forgetting the ritualistic disciplined way of unfurling the national flag during the medal ceremony, they just unfurled the tricolour, their hearts overjoyed hearing the national anthem after the gold medal battle.         
	Earlier, Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa, who were simply not expected to win the gold, did the unexpected. The duo beat top-seeded Singaporean pair of Shinta Muria Sari and Lei Yao 21-6, 21-19 in the womens doubles. Their gold had brought in Indias 37th, to tie with England.         
	Thus, simply put, it was an exceptional day. Fourteen days earlier, who would have thought that badminton would play the deciding factor in Indias medal tally position!         
	It was not an easy beginning for Saina. Having lost the first game she made a flurry of unforced errors in the second. And then, she was match point down due to an unforced error, for the very first time in her career. I will give it my best was her mantra and it worked. Grabbing the second game on her second game point, the top seed came back with a bang in the decider.         
	Never letting Wong off the hook, Saina kept the world No. 19 under pressure through out. Soon, the score stood at 20-12. The crowd went wild! But, they would have to wait for one more point as Saina, in a hurry to win, missed an easy smash.         
	But, then, nothing could stop the jubilation. Having won the gold in front of a jam-packed stadium and television sets in the houses of millions over the country, Saina did her country proud for the umpteenth time.         
	In the doubles, Ashwini played superbly. She counteracted every thing the opponents threw at her, even when they only kept playing her, ignoring the prowling Jwala at the net. However, the match ultimately belonged to Jwala. She came up with such amazing smashes with such intensity when Ashwini was fumbling at the backcourt, that even the top seeds were taken aback.         
	Thus, ultimately, nothing could hold back three Indian women on the badminton courts on Thursday. They were simply, as someone in the crowd called out, the unstoppables.

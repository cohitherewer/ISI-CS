The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nigeria coach turns his back on Maradona
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nigeria coach turns his back on Maradona
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Nigeria coach Lars Lagerback created a controversy when he walked off the pitch without congratulating his Argentine counterpart Diego Maradona at the Ellis Park on Saturday.         
	The Swedish coach, it is believed, is upset by Maradonas claims on Friday that Nigeria may indulge into rough play against Argentina. Maradona even went to the extent of making a plea to Fifa asking them to ensure fair play in the match.         
	Lagerback, when asked, said: What Maradona has said does not matter.I have learned that it is not usually true what they say in the media and it is always like this before the big matches..I only know him as a player and he is entitled to his opinion on whatever issue.         
	On Saturday, after the match, Lagerback was bombarded with questions why he left the ground without going for the customary handshake with his Argentine counterpart.         
	Is it customary? Lagerback shot back. Well, I didnt know about it. I just forgot. When further pressed on the issue, the Super Eagles coach looked visibly angry.         
	I have already answered that question. There was nothing in it. I have all the respect for him. It is typical of the journalists to ask such questions again and again.         
	Lagerback felt Argentina was a good team but he wasnt sure whether they were ready to become the world champions. I cant say whether Argentina should win the Cup since I still hope that my team would win it. Yes, Argentina is a good team with some world class players,         
	Maradona, on the other hand, looked relaxed after pocketing three points in the crucial group B in which South Korea also have bagged three points.         
	The Argentine coach entered the media room with an apple in hand and the first thing he did was to congratulate the Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeema for his fine display. He did a tremendous job under the bar. My congratulations. He perfectly deserved to be the Man of the Match. But my team today played very well.         
	Maradona said his team would have won by at least half a dozen goals. We created seven chances. (Lionel) Messi showed why everyone calls him the best player in the world. Taking away the ball from his feet and a chocolate from his hand are the two most difficult jobs in the world.         
	The soccer legend, however, had no answer for why his strikers couldnt score more than one goal. For that I have to ask Messi and Higuain.         
	Asked whether he would be able to match Franz Beckenbauers feat of winning the World Cup both as a player and a coach, Maradona said: Well, I dont look like Beckenbauer at all. He was a great player. I, too, have played football to some extent.

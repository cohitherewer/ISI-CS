The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sutil is 7th fastest on third day
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sutil is 7th fastest on third day
                      
	Jerez: Force India driver Adrian Sutil was seventh fastest as weather finally relented to allow the side more than 300kms of testing at the Circuit de Jerez.         
	Sutil took over the VJM03 for the penultimate day of testing, and in hugely improved weather conditions, the German completed 69 laps of the Spanish track as he worked through a programme of long and short runs, weight distribution and race preparation.         
	Sutils best of 1:21.93sec put him seventh on the timesheet led by Mark Webber (1:19.299).         
	It was our first proper shot at dry running this test and it went pretty well, a satisfied Sutil later said. In the morning, we did a few short runs and some set-up work and then, in the afternoon, moved on to longer runs and getting more information on the new tyres.         
	At the end of the day, we wanted to do a further run but unfortunately, a red flag came out. So we didnt do as many laps as we would have liked over the whole day, he said.         
	The tyres at the moment are quite difficult to handle as the soft compound grains up very quickly in the low temperatures, Sutil said. (PTI)

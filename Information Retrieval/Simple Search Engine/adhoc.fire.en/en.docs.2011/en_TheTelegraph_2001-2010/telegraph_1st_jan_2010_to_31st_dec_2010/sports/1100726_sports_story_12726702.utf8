	Paris: Alberto Contador won his third Tour de France in four years on Sunday, heralding the arrival of a new cycling superstar as seven-time champion Lance Armstrong competed in the race for the last time.         
	Mark Cavendish of Britain claimed his fifth stage victory in this Tour and the 15th of his career in a sprint at the end of the 20th and final stage  a largely ceremonial 102.5-kilometre (63.7-mile) course from Longjumeau to the Champs-Elysees in Paris.         
	Contador, one of five men with wins in the Tour, the Giro dItalia and the Spanish Vuelta, suffered a lot on the 3,642-km course although it was tailor-made for him.         
	This year, I have had difficult moments, physically. I was not at my best every day, Contador said on the train taking the peloton to the start of Sundays final stage to the Champs Elysees.         
	But on those bad days, I have been able to hide the fact that I was not too well.         
	The 27-year-old Spaniard sealed his third title by holding off a dramatic challenge from his main rival, Andy Schleck of Luxembourg, in Saturdays individual time trial.         
	Schleck finished second, 39 seconds back, and Denis Menchov of Russia was third overall.         
	Contador exchanged hugs with his Astana teammates, who began chanting Ole, Ole on the famed Paris thoroughfare as the thousands of fans lining the route cheered.         
	Contador joins Greg LeMond, Louison Bobet and Philippe Thys as a three-time Tour champion. Armstrong is the most successful Tour rider with seven consecutive wins, between 1999 and 2005.         
	Armstrong completed his last Tour in 23rd place, 39:20 behind Contador, his former teammate and rival. It was a far cry from the Americans third-place finish in 2009 on his return from a four-year retirement.         
	Armstrongs last ride in his most beloved race began in controversy.         
	His RadioShack team were temporarily delayed from starting on Sunday for wearing improper jerseys, the race beginning about 15 minutes late as a result.         
	TV images showed Armstrong and his teammates putting on normal jerseys with their correct race numbers after they had tried to wear black jerseys with 28 on the back. The figure was chosen to honour the 28 million people fighting cancer, one of the themes of Armstrongs Livestrong Foundation.         
	But International Cycling Union officials said they had to change the jerseys and wear their official race numbers.           (AGENCIES)

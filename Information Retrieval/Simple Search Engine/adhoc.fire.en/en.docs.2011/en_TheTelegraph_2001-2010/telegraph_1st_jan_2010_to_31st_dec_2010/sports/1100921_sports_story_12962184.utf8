            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In complete awe of M.C.Mary Koms stupendous achievement in the 48 kg world women boxing championships in Barbados on Saturday, majority of the Indian boxing fraternity is convinced that the Manipuri girl is the best pugilist the country has ever produced.         
	Though a few feel the 2012 Olympics would be her acid test, top boxers and coaches believe Mary Kom has already done enough to cement her place in Indian sports Hall of Fame.         
	The best tribute to Mary Koms stunning fifth triumph in the world championships came from Vijender Singh, a bronze medallist in the Beijing Olympics. He described Mary Kom as the Kim Clijsters of Indian sports and blamed the media for not playing up her achievements.         
	Like the tennis star, Mary Kom also beat the best in the world after becoming a mother, Vijender said. While Clijsters photos were splashed across the sports pages here, Mary Kom didnt receive the same treatment even after winning the world championships five times, he said.         
	Yet, there are people in the boxing world, who are convinced that things would be difficult for the 27-year-old girl once womens boxing makes it debut in the Olympics. Womens boxing is a sport, which has developed in the last 10-15 years only, so the level of competition is relatively lower, claimed a senior coach, who did not wish to be named. Now that it has been included in the Olympics and Asian Games, the developed sporting nations would concentrate on the sport.         
	Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) secretary general P.K. Muralidhar Raja dismissed the theory. Seventy-two countries took part in the world championship this time. Another 20 nations are likely to send their womens boxers in the Olympics. So, how can you say Mary Kom won because of lack of competition? asked Raja.         
	G.S. Sandhu, the chief coach of Indian mens boxing team, expressed similar views. In mens boxing, the headhunters lure away the best talents to professional circuit but there is no such exodus in the womens section as womens professional boxing is still to take off in most part of the world. The best women boxers in the world were mostly present in Barbados, Sandhu said. In my long career, I have rarely come across a more focused boxer than Mary Kom, he added.         
	The question, however, remains whether Mary Kom, who will turn 29 in 2012, would be able to continue her run in the London Olympics. The latest world meet was a clear indication of China and Russias rapid rise. Success would not be easy to come by for Indian boxings Queen Mary.

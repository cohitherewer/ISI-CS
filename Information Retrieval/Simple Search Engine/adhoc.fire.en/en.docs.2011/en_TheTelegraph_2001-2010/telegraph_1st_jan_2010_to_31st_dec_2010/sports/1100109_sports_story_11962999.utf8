	Calcutta: East Bengals I-League match against Chirag United will be played at the Salt Lake Stadium after the police gave the green signal on security. Earlier, it was announced that the match would be played at the Barasat Stadium.         
	The match was originally scheduled for Thursday but due to security reasons was moved to the Barasat Stadium on Saturday.         
	East Bengal, fresh from their Federation Cup triumph, are on an upbeat mood and will definitely try to log home full points against Chirag.         
	Phillippe de Ridder will be without the services of Mehrajuddin Wadoo who has a double booking, while Uga Okpara is nursing a groin injury. Both had been in superb form during the Federation Cup.         
	De Ridder hinted that Okpara may finally make the cut. Yusif Yakubu, who is recovering from a rib cage injury, will start while Abel Hammond who didnt play in the Federation Cup, returns to action.

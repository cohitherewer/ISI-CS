                                                                                                                       7                                        Captain Kaif hits double century
                  Kaif after his double century on Thursday                     
	Amritsar: Central Zone captain Mohammed Kaif scored his maiden double century in first-class cricket to guide his team to a formidable 480 for eight declared against East on the third day of the Duleep Trophy match being held at the Gandhi Sports Complex.         
	At stumps, East were 64 for one with Arindam Das (33 batting) and Ishank Jaggi (1 batting) at the crease. The other opener, Dhiraj Jadhav, was dismissed by Sanjay Bangar for 28.         
	In case Central fail to bowl out East on the final day, the run-rate will come into picture. East will have to maintain a run-rate above 3.84, no matter how long they bat, in order to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	On Thursday, play started after lunch, with Kaif completing his double century. Naman Ojha (29) and Piyush Chawla (27) supported their skipper as he reached the mark and declared soon after.         
	Meanwhile, East Zone selection committee convenor Bikash Baruah has sought an explanation from captain Saurabh Tiwary, coach Subrata Das and manager Malay Chakrabarty as to why no Orissa player has been included in the playing XI, which consists of six from Bengal, three from Asam and two from Jharkhand.

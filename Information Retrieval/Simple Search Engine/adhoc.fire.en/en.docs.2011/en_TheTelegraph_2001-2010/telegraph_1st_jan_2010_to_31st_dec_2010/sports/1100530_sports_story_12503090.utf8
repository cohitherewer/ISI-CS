	Istanbul: Lewis Hamilton told fellow-Briton Nigel Mansell to get his facts straight on Saturday after being branded manufactured by the former Formula One world champion.         
	Speaking to an audience at Britains Hay literary festival on Friday, Mansell suggested the McLaren driver had enjoyed an easy path to the sport after securing backing from McLaren at an early age.         
	People have said to me what do I think of Lewis Hamilton? and Ive said Well its fantastic what hes achieved but hes been manufactured, the 1992 champion, who had to fund his own way into racing, was quoted as saying.         
	How many people from seven years of age have been given two and a half million (pounds) to go karting?         
	Hamilton, questioned about the comments after qualifying on the front row at the Turkish Grand Prix, was visibly taken aback.         
	Wow, gasped the 25-year-old, who became Formula Ones youngest champion in 2008.           (REUTERS)

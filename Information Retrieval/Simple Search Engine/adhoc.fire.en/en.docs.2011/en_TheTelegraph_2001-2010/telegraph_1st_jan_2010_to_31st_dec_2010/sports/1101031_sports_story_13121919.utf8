                                                                                                                       7                                      Graeme Smith   injures hand
                            
	Abu Dhabi: South African one-day and Test captain Graeme Smith is undergoing treatment after injuring his left hand, but escaped without a fracture, an official said Saturday.         
	The 29-year-old left-handed batsman was hit by Pakistani paceman Shoaib Akhtar during the first of five one-day Internationals, which South Africa comfortably won by eight wickets here, on Friday.         
	Smiths X-ray scans show that there are no fractures to his left hand, only soft tissue swelling and bony contusion. The team physiotherapist will reassess his injury in the next day or two, team manager Mohammed Moosajee said in a statement.         
	Smith had to walk off the field after scoring 18, on Friday. South Africa successfully chased a modest 204-run target to take a 1-0 lead in the series.         
	All-rounder Jacques Kallis, who was carried off the field because of severe cramping, will also be monitored closely in the next 24 hours, the manager said.           (AGENCIES)

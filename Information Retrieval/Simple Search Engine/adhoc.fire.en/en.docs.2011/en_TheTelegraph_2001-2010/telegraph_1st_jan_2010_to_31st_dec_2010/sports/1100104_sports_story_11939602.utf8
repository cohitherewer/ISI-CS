	Cape Town: Jacques Kallis defied England with another composed century to lift South Africa to 279 for six on the first day of the third Test on Sunday.         
	Kallis came to the crease with the hosts reeling at 46 for two, after being sent in, and they slumped to 127 for five, midway through the afternoon session. But the experienced all-rounder presented a straight bat to everything England threw at him to register his 33rd Test century. At the close, Kallis was unbeaten on 108, with Dale Steyn on 26.         
	Wicket-keeper Mark Boucher made a fluent 51. Steyn shared a crucial partnership with Kallis, before bad light forced early stumps. Six overs were still to be bowled.           (REUTERS)

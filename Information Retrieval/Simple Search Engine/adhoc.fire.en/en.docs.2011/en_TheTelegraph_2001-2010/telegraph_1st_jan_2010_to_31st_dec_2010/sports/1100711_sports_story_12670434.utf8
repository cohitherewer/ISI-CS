            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: South Africa is on the verge of pulling off the greatest show on earth and Sunday night will signal the end with Oranje and Furious Red, the vibrant colours of the two vibrant teams clashing on the ultimate stage.         
	The Netherlands and Spain are two of the brightest  and talented as well  nations never to have won the World Cup despite dazzling several times in the past. But come what may, a win for either will put a new name on the trophy in front of a capacity crowd of 90,000 at the colossal Soccer City stadium.         
	Though the general feeling is that Spain are likely to come on top having a far more talented bunch, no one will raise an eyebrow should Giovanni van Bronkhorst hold the trophy aloft in his last match for the Dutch.         
	After all, the Dutch will walk out at the Soccer City boasting the perfect record of winning all six games in the tournament so far.         
	Spain, lest you forget, lost their opening match against Switzerland yet they can hardly be called the weaker of the two sides that will march out on Sunday.         
	The Spanish have lost only twice in their last 53 matches and Vicente del Bosques side has the ability to cut open and find space through the best of defences in the world. Ask Germany for more details.         
	We have a date with history. We want to do it with perfection, said Del Bosque.         
	We know Dutch has been a great side always. They played some wonderful soccer but our boys are too determined not to let this opportunity go, the 61-year-old coach added.         
	Apart from a deadly striker like David Villa  vying for the Golden Boot and possibly also the Golden Ball  Spain have the brilliance of Xavi, Andreas Iniesta and in Xabi Alonso, they possess a wonderful passer of the ball and one who protects his back four, too.         
	After spending most of the World Cup period as sleeping giants, Spain stepped up the gear in the semi-finals and Germany, who scored four goals against Australia, England and Argentina, were simply not at fault to be at the wrong end of the Spanish stick.         
	Not that the Dutch are any inferior. So far, they have scored 12 goals in six games, almost double that Spain have managed. Bert van Marwijks side is significantly strong in midfield and attack.         
	It doesnt interest me who are favourites. I just dont care what the whole world is saying, said a defiant Marwijk.         
	On current form, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder could pose big threat to the Spanish defence but the normally exciting Robin van Persies lack of goals is a big worry for the Dutch coach.         
	Apart from that little worry, the Netherlands squad is completely fit with Gregory van der Wiel and Nigel de Jong, both of who were suspended for the semi-final against Uruguay, available for the final countdown.         
	A lot, however, will depend on Nigel de Jong and Marwijks son-in-law, Mark van Bommel in central midfield.         
	The pairs ability to disrupt the slick Spanish passing will be of critical importance to keep the European champions under tight lease.         
	The Spanish have outwitted everyone in this tournament without breaking a sweat. There is a strong belief that the Dutch camp could ask the duo to go physical to stop the finesse of Xavi and Iniesta in the Spanish midfield.         
	Any suggestion that Van Bommel has no artistry and is too much of a destructive player has upset the father-in-law.         
	Everybody has his own style of play, so has Bommel, the coach said. He is an important member of the team and plays his role very well out there. He shouldnt be criticised unnecessarily, the coach added.         
	Del Bosque has also got a full squad with Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who sat out against Germany, available.         
	The coach, however, is expected to field the same side which means both Fabregas and Fernando Torres can only come in as substitutes.         
	The key battle will be between Villa and Sneijder  tied at five goals apiece.         
	While Villa will probably come up against Van der Wiel, the Dutch striker is likely to be thwarted in front of the back four by Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets.         
	Spain, at least on paper, enjoy a definite edge, but like the Netherlands did to Brazil in the quarter finals and Spain had a taste of the same in the opener against Switzerland, the World Cup has proved immune to predictions.         
	The best option then is to take your seat and watch history unfold.

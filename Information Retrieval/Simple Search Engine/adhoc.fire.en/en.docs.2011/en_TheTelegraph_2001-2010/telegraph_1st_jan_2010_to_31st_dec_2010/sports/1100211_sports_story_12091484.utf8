The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tevez, Adebayor on target 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tevez, Adebayor on target 
  - Portsmouth snatch a point against Sunderland with an injury-time goal       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Manchester Citys Carlos Tevez scores against Bolton during their Premier League match on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                 
	Two very familiar names, Carlos Tevez and Emmanuel Adebayor, struck the goals to give Manchester City this slightly edgy victory against Bolton Wanderers, lifting them to within touching distance of fourth-placed Liverpool but it was a new boy, Adam Johnson, who really made a name for himself. Johnsons signing could prove a seminal one for City in the Sheikh Mansour era.         
	Brought in from Middlesbrough for 8.5m, Johnson is far from the type of marquee player that City have been associated with in this age of the gushing petro-dollar. Johnsons name doesnt trip off the tongue in Beijing.         
	The England Under-21 international is certainly no Kaka yet he is just the sort of shrewd recruit for a club now looking to put in the foundations before the glitzy roof. One for the future actually looks one for the here and now.         
	Johnson was recommended by Citys football administrator, Brian Marwood, who knows a thing or two about becoming an England winger. Citys development over the next few years could reflect Johnsons, climbing up the ranks, gaining in prominence. Evolution, not revolution, has always seemed the most sensible path for City to take.         
	Unlike Robinho, Johnson exudes a hunger for the cause. Intelligence too. His clever movement and passing shone throughout until he departed to a standing ovation and man-of-the-match honours.         
	Johnson started as the forward point of Mancinis diamond but the system was too narrow, too reliant for width on full-backs who lack the requisite pedigree. Only when Mancini switched Johnson to the right midway through the first half did City look a threat.         
	Almost immediately, Johnson embarked on a clever dribble down the flank, the surge demonstrating the full range of his qualities. First, Johnson paraded his pace, racing away from Jack Wilshere. Then he revealed the tricks in his locker, a couple of step-overs bringing a foul in the box from Paul Robinson.         
	As Mike Jones pointed to the spot, Tevez grabbed the ball. Jussi Jaaskelainen tried to unsettle Tevez by assuming the Suzanne Vega position, left of centre, inviting the City player to aim at the large untended area.         
	Tevez refused to take the bait and drilled the ball down the middle.         
	As well as congratulating Tevez, City players were quick to salute Johnson was his manager afterwards.         
	 quot;He is a young player who wants to do well, said Mancini. quot;He can play on both the left and the right and he can also play behind the strikers. He can continue to grow and I think he can be a very important player for this club.         
	Praise also flowed from the vanquished dressing-room. quot;Johnsons a terrific player and thats why all the top clubs were looking at him, said Owen Coyle, the Bolton manager. quot;He can jink one way and the other, hes right-footed, left-footed. Hell blossom here. Johnson said:         
	 quot;There was a bit of pressure on me but I was delighted with my performance and the teams. Citys display drew a less complimentary verdict from Coyle. quot;For a squad that took 200m to assemble, for long periods of the match we made them look ordinary, said Coyle.         
	One of the reasons for that was the elegant contribution of Jack Wilshere, who looks destined for England recognition one day.         
	Only 18, Wilshere played with his head up, at his own pace, threading through some magnificent passes that were wasted on the unimaginative Johan Elmander, the Swede who is living up to his countrys reputation for neutrality.         
	Wilshere was a joy to watch, gliding away from Patrick Vieira and Pablo Zabaleta at one point. As well as the artistic, the physics have clearly been part of Wilsheres education at London Colney. He certainly did not hold back in challenges on Vieira and Tevez.         
	Bolton had their chances. Fabrice Muambas shot caught Vincent Kompany and forced Shay Given into a scrambling save. Coyles side should have been given a spot-kick when Kolo Toure clearly impeded Elmander.         
	Reminded of Boltons threat, City went looking for the second.         
	Adebayor shot wide, Tevez sent a free-kick dipping on to the bar before Vieira, rolling back the years, lifted a sublime pass through for Adebayor to control on his chest and then thunder past Jaaskelainen.         
	Vieira was annoyed to be asked about his age again, stressing that quot;it was my first 90 minutes for quite a long time and gaining support from Mancini. quot;I played until I was 36 and I was still playing well, said Mancini.         
	 quot;I won the Scudetto at that age so I see no reason why Patrick cant carry on as well. Mancini confirmed Craig Bellamys knee problem has eased and he should be fit for Tuesdays game at Stoke.         
	The game finished on a slightly nasty note when Robinson flew in wildly on Shaun Wright-Phillips.         
	If the England winger was fortunate to escape injury, Robinson was incredibly lucky to escape expulsion.         
	Battling Portsmouth finally had something to cheer when Aruna Dindane snatched a point six minutes into stoppage time.         
	Sunderland led with a Darren Bent penalty after 12 minutes, Ricardo Rocha being sent off for the foul and manager Avram Grant following him into the stands at halftime for complaining.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germany have the edge

    - WORLD CUP HOCKEY SEMIS 
  -   The Dutch can upset calculations             JAYDEEP BASU            Taeke Taekema of the Netherlands                                 
	New Delhi: After 10 days of intense competition that featured 30 matches at the league stage in the Hero Honda World Cup hockey, defending champions Germany and Australia appear favourites to clash in the title round for the third successive time.         
	Yet, in the semi-finals on Thursday, both Germany and Australia would have to remain careful when they take on England and the Netherlands, respectively, at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium.         
	While England looked supremely confident in the league phase, the Dutch have an array of stars capable of upsetting all calculations at any point of a match.         
	Going by the form book, Germany are definitely the best team and have improved with every outing. Aiming for a third straight title, the Germans landed in Delhi with a relatively younger side that had only three players  Matthias Witthaus, Moritz Furste and Jan-Marco Montag  from the previous World Cup but were quick to adapt themselves to the conditions here.         
	Backed by the awesome record of reaching the semi-finals every time since the second World Cup, Germans are an immensely skilful and confident team as it was evident in the league match against the Netherlands.         
	So much so that Germany coach, Markus Weise appeared not too bothered about their semi-final opponents and said: I never had any preference about our semi-final rivals. My boys are good enough to play any team.         
	But then, England have been growing by leaps and bounds in the last one year.         
	Their resurgence started in the European Championships where they beat Germany in the final and in the current meet, they scored four straight wins including the one against mighty Australia.         
	However, England are slightly depleted because of injuries, mainly to their defender Richard Mantell, who looked in great form before being sidelined during the match against Pakistan.         
	The last time England made the final was in 1986 when they lost to Australia, led by Ric Charlesworth.         
	The legendary Aussie is also here in Delhi, this time as coach, determined to wipe out bitter memories of the two World Cups when Australia had to bow to Germany in the final.         
	Known as Kookaburras, the Australians have always remained the under-achievers despite their huge reputation as a top quality side.         
	In all these years, Australia could win the World Cup and the Olympic gold only once each despite coming close on many occasions.         
	The Aussie charge has been led by their drag-flicker Luke Doerner, the top scorer in the tournament along with Taeke Taekema of the Netherlands.         
	Skipper Jamie Dwyer, the FIH Player of the Year and Glenn Turner have also contributed to the Aussie might, who won four matches in a row in the pool matches after the shock defeat against England in the first outing.         
	Charlesworth, however, remained cautious. I am not looking too far ahead. The Dutch are not easy to beat but I am glad the boys are shaping very well, said the coach. Dutch coach, Michel can den Heuvel, on the other hand, is bracing up for a tough task on Thursday.         
	The Netherlands made the semi-finals the hard way as they managed to pip the South Koreans on better goal difference on the last day of the league matches.         
	But with highly skilful players like Teun de Nooijer, Ronald Brouwer and Taeke Taekema in their ranks, they have enough ammunition to send the Australians packing.         
	Thursdays matches         
	For 11th/12th positions: Pakistan vs Canada (3.35 pm)         
	Semi-finals: Germany vs England (6.05 pm); Australia vs the Netherlands (8.35 pm).

                                                                                                                       7                                                                                                        
	London: England coach Fabio Capello recalled Matthew Upson, as he named an experienced-looking squad, on Sunday, for the opening Euro 2012 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Switzerland. Although he opted to blood youngsters like Arsenals Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs  who keeps his place  in the match against Hungary, the Italian has named a familiar looking group, although Chelsea pair John Terry and Frank Lampard are missing with injuries. England play Bulgaria at Wembley next Friday and face Switzerland away on September 7.        
	 Zagreb: Tyson Gay is expecting one of the fastest races of the year, when he comes up against Nesta Carter of Jamaica at a Zagreb meet, on Wednesday, with both sprinters having set the lowest 100-meter time in 2010. The American ran 9.78 seconds in London on Aug. 13, and Carter matched that time at the Rieti Grand Prix in Italy, on Sunday.        
	Calcutta: Archer Mangal Singh Champia, the only archer to have represented India at the Beijing Olympics in the mens category, narrowly missed the cut for the three-member team at the Commonwealth Games to be held in the capital from October 3 to 14. Having lost out in the trials by just two points, his dream to represent the country at the CWG was shattered, but as a saving grace, he figured in the Asian Games team that has four members.        
	Perthshire: Indian golfer Jyoti Randhawa returned his worst card of the week, a three-over 75, but still managed to sign off a creditable tied 10th in the Johnnie Walker Championship. He ended his campaign with a total of four-under 284 after a disappointing final round which included four bogeys and just one birdie.    
	Compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh had an equally disappointing day as he carded a four-over 76 to end his campaign at tied 42.        
	Pune: Defending champion Pankaj Advani started his campaign on a winning note, defeating Amit Lath on straight frames on the opening day of the mens National Senior Billiards Championship. Geet Sethi also secured a comfortable 3-0 victory over D Raj Kumar in the best of five frames battle.        
	New Delhi: Indias Darpan overcame some stiff challenge from M Chojnowski of Poland before registering his second win in the World Chess Championship for Blinds and emerged joint second after the third round at Belgrade. Darpan, playing with white, showed tremendous control and opted for Pelican defence to take advantage of the strategic mistakes of his opponent. After the win, which came in 48th move, the Indian now has 2.5 points out of a possible three.

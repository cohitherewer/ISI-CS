The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Phil Mickelson is the master
                                                                                                                       7                                        Phil Mickelson is the master
    - OVERNIGHT LEADER WESTWOOD ENDS SECOND, WOODS TIED FOURTH           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE AGENCIES            Tiger Woods at the Augusta National Golf Club, on Sunday                                 
	Augusta: Phil Mickelson does not do dull. He does not do routine, and he does not do safe. This hammer-down, all-or-nothing approach may have cost him a major championship or two in the past. But on a perfect Sunday at Augusta National, with his wife, Amy, and their three children among the huge gallery at the 18th hole, it won him the Masters for the third time.         
	Riding a wave of emotion that began when Amy, who has been treated for breast cancer for the past year, was strong enough to come to the Masters this week, Mickelson shot a flawless final-round 67 for a 16-under-par total of 272 and became the fifth golfer to win his third green jacket.         
	Just for fun, and maybe for the memory, he rolled in one more birdie putt at the last hole for a three-stroke victory over Lee Westwood of England, who closed with a 71. He was four strokes ahead of Anthony Kim, who charged home with a 65, tied for the low round of the tournament.         
	Tiger Woods endured a roller-coaster day. He started out poorly with three bogeys in the first five holes before holing out from the fairway to eagle the seventh and then recording birdies at eight and nine.         
	After mixing bogeys at the 11th and 14th with a birdie at the 13th, he collected another eagle when he coaxed in a 15-footer at the par-five 15th before signing off with a six-foot birdie putt at the last.         
	I finished tied fourth (with KJ Choi), not what I wanted, said Woods, who came under intense scrutiny from the fans and media all week.         
	Asked when he was likely to return to the PGA Tour, he replied: Im going to take a little time off and kind of re-evaluate things.         
	After walking calmly on the edge of calamity, saving par from the woods, making birdies off the pine straw, the bunkers and the fairway, the 39-year-old Mickelson embraced his caddie, his wife and his children, waved to his fans, and nearly broke down when he thought about what it all meant.         
	At the jacket presentation ceremony next to the 18th green, Mickelson choked back tears.         
	Weve been through a lot this year, he said, his voice breaking. And it means a lot to share some joy together. Amys an incredible wife, an incredible mother, and shes been an inspiration to me, going through what shes been through.         
	This has been an incredible week, and its something well share and remember the rest of our lives. Its one of the best things weve gone through. To feel this kind of jubilation is something well never forget.         
	Unforgettable would be a fitting description for the day, and for how Mickelson went about his business Sunday on a hard, fast golf course. He did not bogey a hole. He did not lose his head in the maelstrom of noise that was erupting all over Amen Corner. He stared down Westwood, was never concerned about the birdie barrage from Kim and put together a how-to manual for playing a final round at Augusta.         
	 Perhaps one day, the historically minded Augusta National members will place a plaque somewhere near the trees in the pine straw to the right of the 13th hole, where Mickelson hit the type of shot that defines his style  a no-margin-for-error laser-guided 6-iron from 207 yards, through a 4-foot window in the pines, over the tributary of Raes Creek to a soft landing, 4 feet from the hole for eagle.         
	Not that he made the putt, once again showing that no shot is too hard, or too easy, for Mickelson. But the birdie did give him a little breathing room while the 24-year-old Kim was on one of his birdie-birdie-eagle-birdie tears beginning at the 13th hole.         
	Kim set the record for birdies in a round last year at Augusta, when he had 11. As inconceivable as that might seem, so was the six-birdie, one-eagle binge he went on Sunday. Coming when he was in a position to actually hang up a score that might scare someone, it was a masterpiece for any golfer, let alone a wounded one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis sends legal notice
                                                                                                                       7                                        Younis sends legal notice

	Islamabad: Former captain Younis Khan has sent a legal notice to British tabloid News of the World, which claimed in a report that he, like several Pakistan cricketers, had signed Mazhar and Azhar Majeed as his agents in the United Kingdom.         
	Reliable sources close to Younis said that the player instructed his lawyer Ahmed Qayyum to issue the notice to the tabloid for publishing the report.         
	Yes, the notice has been sent and in it, Younis has demanded that the newspaper publish a denial and also pay damages of $10,000 towards the flood relief fund for the millions of Pakistanis affected, a source said.         
	The brothers had approached Pakistan players to sign them during the 2006 tour and Younis had refused, the source added.         
	The source also claimed that Younis was one of the few Pakistan players, who had refused to sign the Majeed brothers as their agent in England.         
	In a separate development, Mohammed Asifs estranged girlfriend Veena Malik hit back at Dheeraj Dixit, an Indian freelance photographer, claiming she has substantial evidence to prove that he had approached the tainted Pakistan bowler for spot-fixing.         
	Veena, a Pakistani actress, called Dixit a bookmaker and a match-fixer and alleged that he exchanged match information with Asif.         
	Dixit had Monday alleged that it was Veena who approached him, claiming that she managed seven Pakistan cricketers and could strike a deal for fixing matches with their help.         
	Mr Dheeraj is denying any kind of contact with Mohammed Asif. I have telephonic details of Asif and Dixit where, in 15 days, the latter contacted Asif for 17 times. I have the details of all this, Veena said.         
	Meanwhile, former Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson has claimed that the current squad touring England may have been threatened by illegal bookmakers to get involved in the spot-fixing or else their families would be harmed.         
	Lawson said that people have been quick to judge the Pakistan cricketers, but what is happening might have nothing to do with money.         
	If these allegations of fixing are proved, it could be related to extortion, threats, and the well-being of their own family members. It would not surprise me if illegal bookmakers have told players that if they do not perform X and Y, their families will be kidnapped or harmed.         
	In my time as Pakistan coach, I gained some incredible insights into the workings of the country and the team, and Ill never forget the time the team captain called me up to his room on the eve of a match.         
	I went to his room and he was standing there with a very sombre-looking selector.         
	This selector said: We must pick [the player who had earlier approached me], I have been told that if he is not in the team tomorrow, my daughter will be kidnapped and I will not see her again.         
	Ijaz Butt, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, said the players being investigated would not be suspended without proof of wrongdoing.         
	There is a case going on over here with Scotland Yard, Ijaz told a cricket website.         
	This is only an allegation. There is still no charge or proof on that account. So at this stage there will be no action taken.         
	A Pakistan court, meanwhile, issued notices to the sports ministry and the PCB, asking them to file responses on the spot-fixing scandal by September 7.         
	Lahore High Court Chief Justice Khwaja Mohammed Sharif issued the notices while hearing a petition filed by advocate Chaudhry Ishtiaq Ahmed, who demanded exemplary punishment for the accused players, saying the allegations had tarnished the countrys image.

	London: Manchester United will become the first team to go through the Champions League group stage without conceding a goal if they can keep a clean sheet at home to free-scoring Valencia on Tuesday.         
	Their tight defence in European games has been in contrast to erratic domestic performances at the back and has often been down to promising displays by some of their younger players, who look likely to be given the responsibility once again.         
	United and Valencia have already qualified for the knockout round although top spot in Group C is still up for grabs.         
	The English club, who have 13 points from five games, will win the group if they do not lose to the Spaniards, who are on 10.         
	With United facing important Premier League matches against leaders Arsenal and champions Chelsea in the next fortnight, manager Alex Fergusons policy of giving his youngsters a run-around in Europe looks set to continue.         
	Six clubs currently hold the record for the fewest number of goals conceded in the Champions League group stage. Ajax Amsterdam, Chelsea, Juventus (twice), Liverpool, AC Milan and Villarreal share the honour with one goal.         
	Valencia, fifth in La Liga, travel to watertight United with one of the most potent strike forces, having scored 14 times in their five Champions League matches.         
	Meanwhile, Rubin Kazan travel to Barcelona for their final group stage match with a remarkable unbeaten record against the Spanish giants. Rubin have met the Spanish league leaders three times in the last two seasons and have notched one win and two draws.         
	The victory came in a shock 2-1 triumph at the home of the then European champions, in the group stages last October.         
	Barcelona have been in irresistible form. They top La Liga by two points from Real Madrid and have won their last seven consecutive matches in all competitions. They have not conceded a goal in their last four outings while scoring 19 times.

	New Delhi: In 1982, when India finished fifth in the World Cup hockey in Mumbai, there was uproar over their po or performance. Much water has flown down the Ganges since then, and under the present circumstances, a seventh place finish in the 12-nation meet would be regarded as an achievement by the home fans.         
	To do that, India, however, will have to get the better of Argentina at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium Friday. The Argentines are known for posing trouble whenever they meet the eight-time Olympic champions.         
	Although chief coach Jose Brasa has promised victory, Indias performance in the current tournament has so far remained dismal.

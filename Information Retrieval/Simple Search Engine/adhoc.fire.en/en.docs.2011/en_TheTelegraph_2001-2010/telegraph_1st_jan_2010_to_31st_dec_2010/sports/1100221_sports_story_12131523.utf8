The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Switching modes wont be difficult
                                                                                                                       7                                        Switching modes wont be difficult
  - We are still in search of a fast bowling all-rounder, says India captain
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Jaipur on Saturday. (AP)                           
	Jaipur: Switching to the one-day mode just three days after the end of a gruelling Test series is not a problem for the Indian team, said the captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. But he did reveal, at the news conference on Saturday, that if there was some more time between the Test series and one-day International series it would have certainly helped the team.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The wicket         
	It is a normal subcontinental wicket. The dew will also be a factor because it is still cold in the evening. So spinners would find it difficult in the later part of the match.         
	Whether the pitch will be helpful to the batsmen         
	Of course a lot depends on what happens on that particular day. Loads of runs have been scored whenever we have played here but, at the end of the day, you have to see what kind of start you, or the opposition, get and how exactly the wicket behaves on that particular day. You can see the batsmen playing their strokes if it is not on the slower side.         
	The security arrangements         
	Frankly speaking, if there are 200 policemen or even if it is raised to 400, it doesnt affect us. You see loads of policemen outside but when you enter the field, you see only the players and the umpires. The crowd inside the field always remains the same. And since it is for our own safety, I dont think it is a problem for us.         
	On whether he will allow Dinesh Karthik to keep the wickets         
	I am not a very good fielder, so, you wont see me do that. We will play with the best side. Karthik is a better fielder than me. So, when both of us are playing, it is better that I keep wickets and he fields. It is better for the overall strength of the team.         
	The all-rounders in the team         
	You can say we have quite a few batsmen who can bowl. We are still searching for a perfect all-rounder  a fast bowling all-rounder  because it balances the team combination. In this side, it is good that we have the likes of Virender Sehwag, Abhishek Nayar, Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina  who are batsmen who can bowl. In case one of your regular bowlers is struggling, a part-timer can always make up for it.         
	On Harbhajan Singhs absence         
	Harbhajan is a great spinner. He bowls well and plays a dual role  containing runs and taking wickets as well. Of course we will miss him.         
	Whether India need to improve their fielding         
	We are working a lot on our fielding. In today (Saturday)s practice session also we worked hard in this department. Fielding is one area where you dont see huge improvements easily. But we are just hoping that crucial catches are not dropped and gradually the ground fielding improves too.         
	If there should have been more gap between the Tests and the ODIs         
	Yes, you need a bit of time in between But if you see our squad, there are only three or four players who played in the Test series and are also a part of the ODI series. The rest of the players are pretty set when it comes to the mindset or the approach towards the game. I dont think it will be a big worry But if you have the time it does help. At the same time, if you dont have the time you should not complain because it is not the first time it is happening to us. We are quite ready and prepared for the game.         
	On the opponents         
	The South Africans are a very evenly balanced side. They have good fielders in the side, good bowlers and batsmen who can capitalise on the situation.         
	Graeme Smiths absence         
	It does affect every side. At the end of the day, you have to pick your eleven from your squad of 15 and there is nothing you can do about injuries because they are part of the sport. They (South Africans) will be a bit affected because he is rated among their top openers. Any player who will play in Smiths place will be under some pressure. But just like us, they also have the chance to test their bench strength.         
	Any special plans to contain Hashim Amla         
	We keep making strategies but there are times when it doesnt work. It was not that we didnt plan against Amla but he batted quite well in the series. You do plan things and execute them but the individual also changes his game accordingly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies make clean sweep
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies make clean sweep
                      
	Melbourne: Australia saved the best for the last, subjecting the West Indies to a 125-run humiliation in the fifth and final ODI for a clean sweep in the series.         
	According to cricinfo, after Ricky Ponting, James Hopes and Shane Watson set up a daunting 5 for 324, Doug Bollinger continued with his rampaging form against Chris Gayle and Co. to skittle them out for 199 in 36.5 overs.         
	The triumph is another firm mile gained in Australias relentless onslaught in all forms of the game as the team looks to go through the summer undefeated. Two T20 Internationals against the Windies is all that remains and it would be the visitors who would be fearing the worst.         
	Already they have equalled their effort of 00-01, the only other home season when they did not lose a Test or ODI.

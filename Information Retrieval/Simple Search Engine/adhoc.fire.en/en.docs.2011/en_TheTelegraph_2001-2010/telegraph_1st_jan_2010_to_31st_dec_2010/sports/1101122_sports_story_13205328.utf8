            OUR BUREAU                      
	Anil Kumble led his team to a near clean sweep outside the cricket field, on Sunday, when the former Indian skipper won the presidents post in the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) elections.         
	Kumble (559 votes), who was contesting Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar (519 votes), a Mysore royal, for the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) presidents post, won by a margin of 40 votes.         
	However, till late night there was confusion over the total number of seats won by Kumbles team as the number varied from 21 to 23 out of a total 24 posts.         
	Former fast bowler Jawagal Srinath won by a whopping margin against former ICC umpire A.V. Jayaprakash for the secretarys post.         
	Srinath bagged 644 votes against Jayaprakashs 399. Venkatesh Prasad won the vice-presidents seat.         
	Roger Binny, who was standing for re-election as one of the three vice-presidents and had the backing of Kumble and Co., also won with Sadanand Mayya.         
	Kumble had promised to turn the KSCA into a model association and end any discrimination if he comes to power. Sundays result was a testimony to the members faith in the former India skipper, who had already established himself as a true statesman while being at the helm of the Indian team.         
	Roger Binny felt the result would change the face of cricket in the state. Dubbing it a landmark victory, the hero of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, said: The win will change the perception of sportsmen entering into administration. Personally, for me, this is one of the sweetest victories in an election.         
	Prior to Sundays elections, Kumble had said his panels priority is only cricket, administration and infrastructure, not discriminating between the cities and mofussil areas         
	Binny corroborated Kumbles views on Sunday, when he said: Cricket and cricketers will get the foremost priority. Our main endeavour will be to improve the standard of cricket in Karnataka and develop a great infrastructure at the grassroots level.         
	The clubs, which will be represented by Rahul Dravid and Vijay Mallya, have also made it to the management committee.

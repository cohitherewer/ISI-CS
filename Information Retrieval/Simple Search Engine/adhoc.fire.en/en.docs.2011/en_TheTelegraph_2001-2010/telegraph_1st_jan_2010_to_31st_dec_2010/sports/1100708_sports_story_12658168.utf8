	Karachi: Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has demanded more consistency from his players as the team gears up for a Test series against Australia in England.         
	The key is for us to develop a habit of winning matches more regularly and consistently like other top teams including Australia and South Africa, Afridi told a channel from Birmingham. Afridi, who will lead Pakistan in the Test series against Australia starting July 13, said he was delighted that the team was finally back to winning matches.         
	I knew sooner or later we will win back to back matches because we have been performing well since the Twenty20 World Cup but missed out in close matches. I think now that we have regained our winning habit we must work harder to maintain it and make winning a habit, he added. The flamboyant all-rounder said he would keep reminding his players that there was a big difference between T20 and Test matches.         
	There is a difference and we have to be aware of this. But the good thing is that a win is a win in any form of the game and this series win should serve a confidence booster for us ahead of the Tests, he said.         
	They are a very experienced and successful Test side so we have to play really well to beat them. We need to grab the opportunities that come our way to pressurise them, he added. Afridi said the team would miss the services of senior players like Mohammad Yousuf and Younus Khan in England.

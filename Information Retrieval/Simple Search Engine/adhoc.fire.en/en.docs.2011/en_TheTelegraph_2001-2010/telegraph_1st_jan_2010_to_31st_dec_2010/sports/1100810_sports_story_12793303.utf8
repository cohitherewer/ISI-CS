The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss, Trott finish job without fuss
                                                                                                                       7                                      Strauss, Trott finish job without fuss
                      
	Birmingham: England beat Pakistan by nine wickets in the second Test at Edgbaston on Monday, overhauling a target of 118 with a minimum of fuss in the afternoon session of Day IV.         
	Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott were both unbeaten on 53 as England finished on 118 for one after 36.3 overs to take a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.         
	Mohammed Aamer (one for 31) was the only Pakistan bowler to take a wicket, bowling the struggling Alastair Cook for four early in the England chase to briefly ignite Pakistans hopes.         
	Earlier, Pakistan was bowled out for 296 after they began the day on 291 for nine. The tourists mounted a dramatic comeback on Sunday when they recovered from 82 for five, inspired by 88 from Zulqarnain Haider and 50 from Saeed Ajmal.         
	Pakistans last five batsmen contributed 214 runs, but the overnight pair of Mohammed Asif (14) and Umar Gul (13 not out) added just five during Mondays morning session.         
	The innings ended after the 11th ball of the day, when Asif was caught at gully by Kevin Pietersen off Stuart Broad, who finished with figures of two for 66.         
	Graeme Swann was Englands leading bowler, with Test-best figures of six for 65. There was an electrifying start to Englands chase, when Aamer ripped out Cooks stumps with the 16th ball of the innings.         
	Pakistans bowlers repeatedly passed the edge and in the eighth over, Strauss nicked a ball from spinner Ajmal behind, but Haider spilled a difficult chance.         
	However, Strauss and Trott gradually played themselves in, reaching 71 for one at lunch.         
	Strauss had another escape in the second over of the afternoon session, the 25th, when Ajmal again found his edge, only for the ball to fly off the tip of Haiders glove.

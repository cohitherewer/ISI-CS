            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Rahul Dravid en route to his 191, in Nagpur, on Sunday                           
	Nagpur: The criticisms have swirled around him for sometime now: that he is past his prime, and his reflexes seem to have deserted him; that, at 37, he should leave his place to some enterprising youngster; and that his painstaking methods for run accumulation are no longer suited to todays game.         
	 On Monday, Rahul Dravid showed that he may have shed a bit of his fluency and touch, but when it comes to utility and a sense of occasion, he remains unmatched. He missed out on a double century, but his straight bat gave India the assurance on the third day of the final Test.         
	 Dravid along with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (98) made sure that the disappointment of losing Sachin Tendulkar early never came in the way of India taking giant strides towards clinching a series victory.         
	A lead of 373 was enough to put pressure on New Zealand, and, at close, they still need another 349 to avoid an innings defeat with nine wickets remaining.         
	 If the visitors can survive the first session on Tuesday, they can harbour hopes of pushing this Test into the final day.         
	 Dravids 191 was his 31st Test hundred and first at the home of his wife Vijeta. He worked hard for his runs, frustrating the bowlers with his focus and concentration.         
	 The ardour and the zeal to succeed were, at times, painful to watch. But it was a typical demonstration of his enduring skill and indomitable will. His second century of the Airtel Cup, following the 104 in Ahmedabad, came when he whipped one past square leg for a couple.         
	 When he finally holed out to long on, after 573 minutes and having faced 396 balls, it was perhaps the fatigue factor that had finally got to him. Oh no, how could he do this! exclaimed Sunil Gavaskar as Dravid cursed himself for attempting to clear the field.         
	 The 193-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Dhoni once again displayed the potential of the strong middle-order. The confidence gained will, no doubt, be handy on the tour of South Africa.         
	 The Team India captain seemed determined to prove that his slump in form is only a passing phase. Coming into this Test, his highest in the last ten innings was 76, in Colombo in July. The start wasnt enterprising as an edge off Tim Southee went past slip.         
	 Dhoni lived dangerously and survived a superb attempt by Tim McIntosh to catch him in the deep on 42. He celebrated the reprieve by launching into McKay after lunch, a straight six and a boundary in one over.         
	 He, however, was restrained as he approached the nineties. Bothered by cramps towards the end of his innings, a limping Dhoni was the victim of a soft dismissal with just two runs short of what would have been his fifth Test century.         
	 The pair, however, succeeded in putting away to an extent the disillusionment surrounding Sachin.         
	 The maestro belied the promise that he had shown on the second afternoon. Not many, who had come in anticipation of witnessing a slice of history, had made their way into the stadium or settled down in their seats when Sachin departed.         
	 The maestro, who was only 43 runs away from his 50th Test hundred, lasted only six minutes and three balls before becoming debutant Andy McKays maiden victim. The pacer has been impressive and hostile in his spells and it was a good move by Vettori to give him the second new ball that was only two overs old on the third morning.         
	 Sachin was done in by the extra bounce and the angle, two balls after something similar and wider had taken the outside edge past gully for a boundary. This time, McKay squared him up as Sachin looked to defend, the nick going straight to the wicketkeeper. The shock, perhaps, forced Sachin to wait a while before walking back.         
	 Chris Martin got going again, this time, the inswinger finding a way into VVS Laxmans defence.         
	 Suresh Rainas temperament is increasingly coming under the scanner. His technique against the short ball will be tested to the hilt in South Africa. He offered a regulation bat-pad catch to forward short leg after playing a defensive shot to Vettoris first ball, which pitched on the footmarks and spun. He has just 26 runs from four innings in this current series.         
	 Perhaps, it is time for the selectors to take a look at the No.6 spot.

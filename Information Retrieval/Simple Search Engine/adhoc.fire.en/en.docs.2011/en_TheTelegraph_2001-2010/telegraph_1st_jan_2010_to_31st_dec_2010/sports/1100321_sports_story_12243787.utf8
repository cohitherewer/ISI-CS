The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It is quickly back to the drawing board for KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                      It is quickly back to the drawing board for KKR
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Ahmedabad: Every game has a story... One shouldnt get too emotional, though, was the line taken by the Kolkata Knight Riders coach, Dav Whatmore, after the 34-run thrashing from the Rajasthan Royals.         
	For the Knights, Saturdays story only adds to the gloom. From a high of wins in the first two matches to defeats in the next two. In just over a week, Shah Rukh Khans team has been forced right back to the drawing board.         
	The momentum has to be quickly regained, otherwise more trouble is in store.         
	Captain Sourav Ganguly, who was booed by a section of the Royals fans in Motera, couldnt have been more blunt when he said his team needed to improve in all departments, including being much more intense on the park.         
	That a Calcutta cricketer, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, walked away with the MoM award for a smartly compiled 45, made it worse for the Knights. Its a mystery why the franchise didnt rush to sign him once the Board declared an amnesty for those wanting to leave the rebel ICL.         
	Of course, it didnt help the Knights that Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain, woke up with fever and had to sit out what wouldve been his first game in IPL III.         
	Helpless, Gayle watched the Royals finally play regally to record their first win of the year. With the star a non-starter, Owais Shah kept his place.         
	There was a sense of relief, yes, but were a proud team and I felt so proud of my boys... Id challenged them and I got the response I wanted... I backed the players and they backed themselves, remarked a bubbly Shane Warne, the Royals captain, who scored one more point at Souravs expense.         
	Warne, who cocked a snook at Steve Waugh for suggesting that he should now realise the necessity of a full-time coach, added: We showed plenty of character...         
	Asked what made him open the bowling with Yusuf Pathan, Warne replied: I wanted to make him feel important... He hadnt done that well with the bat and I wanted him in the match...         
	Chasing 169 was always going to be tough, but the target wasnt unachievable. A logic-defying batting order, however, queered the pitch.         
	One failed to understand why Cheteshwar Pujara was sent at No.3 (instead of the captain himself) and why Shah, not the lively Angelo Mathews, came out when Brad Hodge got dismissed in the 15th over.         
	Arguably, the Sri Lankan is the most improved player in limited overs cricket, over the past year, and has to be sensibly used.         
	Made to wait till the last over, Mathews got run out without facing a ball!         
	Everybody consumed far too many deliveries, relegating to distant memory the stunning start provided by Ashok Dinda, when he trapped Michael Lumb leg-before on the very first ball of the afternoon.         
	With the target being big, the need of the innings was to clear the field. Shah did, twice, but the first six was as late as the 17th over.         
	Clearly, the Knights strangled themselves. Its poor cricket if you fall 34 short, with as many as five wickets (seven at the start of the final over) in hand.         
	In T20, the first six overs usually make a significant difference and, so, it was in Motera. While the Royals punished the Knights to reach 56 for two, the Knights failed to do any better than 38 for one.         
	Dinda, fielded by Sourav to add firepower, didnt let his captain down. Laxmi Ratan Shukla had to sit out. Pujara came in for Rohan Gavaskar. Late on Friday, though, The Telegraph had learnt that Harpreet Singh Bhatia would make his debut.         
	The Knights next game, against a formidable Mumbai Indians, is in Mumbai on Monday.

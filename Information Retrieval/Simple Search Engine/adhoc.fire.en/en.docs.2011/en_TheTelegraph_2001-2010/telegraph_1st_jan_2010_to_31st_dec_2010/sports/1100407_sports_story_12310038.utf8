The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DDCA hits out at Kumble
                                                                                                                       7                                      DDCA hits out at Kumble
                      
	New Delhi: The Delhi and Districts Cricket Association Tuesday hit back at Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble for describing the Kotla pitch as unfit for T20 cricket and asserted that it was the most sporting track in the ongoing Indian Premier League.         
	After his sides loss versus the Delhi DareDevils, Kumble had said that the Kotla pitch was not ideal for T20 cricket as it gave advantage to the team batting first.         
	I refute his (Kumble) allegation and still maintain that Kotla is the most sporting wicket in IPL. International Cricket Council chief curator Andy Atkinson had approved the playing facilities at the Kotla and certified it fit for T20 cricket, DDCA sports secretary Sunil Dev said in a statement.         
	An analysis of all matches at the different venues shows that actually it (Kotla) is the most sporting wicket in the country, he added, saying that no other team had complained about the pitch.           (PTI)

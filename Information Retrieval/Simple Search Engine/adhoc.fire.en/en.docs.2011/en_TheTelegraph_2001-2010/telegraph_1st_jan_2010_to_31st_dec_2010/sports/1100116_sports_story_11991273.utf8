	Chittagong:The wicket being prepared for the first Test, at the Z.A. Chowdhury Stadium, from Sunday, had a fairly green look on Friday, but its unlikely that much of the grass is going to remain.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the hosts dont exactly wish to take a chance against Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth and, so, the wicket may look very different on Day I.         
	While Shaiful Alam is the one directly responsible for the wicket here, its preparation is being overseen by a Sri Lankan, Gamini Silva, who is on contract with the Bangladesh Cricket Board till the 2011 World Cup.         
	Chittagong is a World Cup venue and will stage two matches  Bangladesh versus England and, then, against The Netherlands.         
	Shakib-al Hasan and Co. practised in the morning, while Team India had nets in the afternoon. The nearly three-hour session was as thorough as it could have been.         
	Leggie Amit Mishra was among the more enthusiastic, but theres little hope for him to make the XI  Pragyan Ojha, the left-armer, is expected to be the second spinner, after Harbhajan Singh.         
	The visitors line-up should be: Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan, Ojha, Zaheer, Sreesanth.         
	Meanwhile, the newly-appointed bowling consultant, Eric Simons, is expected to arrive here on Sunday.

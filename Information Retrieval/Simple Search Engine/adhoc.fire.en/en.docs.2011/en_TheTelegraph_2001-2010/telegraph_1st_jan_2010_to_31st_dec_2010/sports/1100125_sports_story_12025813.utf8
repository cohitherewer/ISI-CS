            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia under-19 is through to the semi-finals of the ICC under-19 World Cup after a 62-run win over Trans Tasman rivals New Zealand at Mainpower Oval in Rangiora on Sunday.         
	In another quarter final, an aggressive 79 from Banuka Rajapaksa carried Sri Lanka to an overwhelming 146-run victory over South Africa.         
	Sri Lanka will meet Australia in the second semi-final on Wednesday with giant-killers Pakistan playing the West Indies in the first semi-final Monday.         
	In Rangiora, Australia batted first against New Zealand and scored 232 for eight with skipper Mitchell Marsh top scoring with 53.         
	New Zealand launched a cautious reply, reaching 26 without loss in 10 overs before Jason Floras made the breakthrough when he bowled Harry Boam who had made just six from 27 balls faced. New Zealand were eventually all out for 170 in the 44th over, 62 runs short of their target.         
	Man of the Match Rajapaksa belted 10 fours as he top-scored for Sri Lanka with 79 off 78 balls and put on 91 in 16 overs for the third wicket with fellow left-hander Rumesh Buddika at Lincoln Green.         
	Danishka Gunathillike added an unbeaten 24 from 16 balls at the tail of the innings as Sri Lanka posted 293 for eight from their 50 overs. South Africa were two wickets down by the seventh over, when rain stopped play and a revised target of 292 in 49 overs was set.         
	After play resumed Josh Richards (46) and Colin Ackerman (21) put on 50 in 56 balls for the third wicket.         
	Summarised scores         
	 Sri Lanka 293/8 (B. Rajapaksa 79). South Africa 145 (Josh Richards 43; Charith Jyampathi 4/31). Sri Lanka won by 146 runs (D/L method).         
	 Australia 232/8 (Mitchell Marsh 53). New Zealand 170 (Craig Cachopa 34; Josh Hazlewood 2/24). Australia won by 62 runs.

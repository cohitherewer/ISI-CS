The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gunners thump Spurs
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gunners thump Spurs
                      
	London: Samir Nasri scored a pair of extra-time penalty kicks as Arsenal ousted north London rival Tottenham from the League Cup with a 4-1 victory, and Premier League side Everton was beaten in a shootout by third-tier Brentford, on Tuesday.         
	Tottenham substitute Robbie Keane had cancelled out Henri Lansburys first Arsenal goal to send the game into extra time, but the home side crumbled within 30 seconds of it starting.         
	After being fouled by Sebastien Bassong, Nasri converted from the penalty spot and the France midfielder beat Spurs goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa again five minutes later when Steven Caulker brought down Marouane Chamakh.         
	He had a superstition to think that when a penalty is made on you not to take it, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. But I tried to prove to him that thats solely based on fear. He realises now that it was a bad superstition.         
	Andrei Arshavin ended any hopes of a Tottenham comeback by firing low past Pletikosa in the 105th minute.         
	Everton, yet to win in the Premier League season, went out after Jermaine Beckford and Phil Jagielka missed penalties in a 4-3 shootout loss against Brentford.         
	Seamus Coleman had put Everton in front with his first goal for the club after six minutes, but Gary Alexander levelled for the League One club with a powerful header.         
	Bolton were the other Premier League casualty in the third round on Tuesday, with Owen Coyles side losing 1-0 at former club Burnley, which was relegated from the top flight last season.         
	In all-Premier League matches, Stoke beat Fulham 2-0 and West Ham won 2-1 at Sunderland. Elsewhere, Birmingham defeated MK Dons 3-1, Wolverhampton eliminated Notts County 4-2 in extra time, Ipswich won 2-1 at Millwall, Swansea triumphed 3-1 at Peterborough and Leicester beat Portsmouth 2-1.         
	With Spurs focused on their first Champions League campaign and the Premier League, only defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto survived from Saturdays 3-1 victory over Wolverhampton. As well as Pletikosa and Caulker, Brazilian midfielder Sandro Ranieri made his debut.         
	But such is the fierce local rivalry, Wenger veered from his usual policy of deploying a side packed with youngsters in English footballs second-tier knockout competition, with Tomas Rosicky captaining a strong side.         
	We got a few reproaches that we didnt take the competition seriously, that it was a derby that it was the start of the competition, Wenger said. To go out at the start would have been difficult for us.         
	Arsenal went in front after 15 minutes when a flowing move down the left flank was completed by Jack Wilsheres cross being prodded into the net by Lansbury  one of only two teenagers in the Arsenal team. Wenger had to celebrate from the directors box having received a one-match touchline ban for his tirade against a fourth official in Saturdays 1-1 draw at Sunderland.         
	From his high vantage point, Wenger saw his players overwhelm a Spurs side struggling to get hold of the ball.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Chirag United let Air India live to fight another day after going down 1-3 against the relegation-threatened Mumbai side in their seasons penultimate I-League match on Sunday.         
	But the abject capitulation had Chirag coach Anjan Nath fuming at his players who had no motivation.         
	The players had no motivation. You saw the Air India side, they were fighting to avoid relegation and so had the motivation to do well. They gave their 100 per cent, Nath was livid.         
	Our players knew that the team is safe. They are now busy signing (new contracts). They play for their own position, not that of the team. They dont think about taking the team further up, he added.         
	In another match, East Bengal were held to a 1-1 draw by JCT in Ludhiana. Also, Pune FC thrashed Sporting Clube de Goa 4-0 in a home tie.

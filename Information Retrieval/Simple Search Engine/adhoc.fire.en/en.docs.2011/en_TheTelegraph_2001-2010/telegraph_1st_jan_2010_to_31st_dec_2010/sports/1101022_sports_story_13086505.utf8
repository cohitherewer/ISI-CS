            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday termed as irresponsible, damaging and untrue the allegation that it would reveal the identity of a player who contacts its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit.         
	The International Cricket Council rejects accusations that it has ever or would ever reveal the identity of a player or anyone else who contacts the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) with information, ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat said in a media release.         
	Inaccurate comments have claimed that the ICC could leak such information into the public domain. This is an entirely untrue allegation Lorgat added.

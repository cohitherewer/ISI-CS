	Mason: Kim Clijsters survived three match points before a rain break to produce a remarkable comeback. After the weather cleared, she beat Maria Sharapova 2-6 7-6 6-2 and win the Cincinnati Open on Sunday.         
	Sharapova had three championship points at 5-3 in the second set before rain left her stranded at deuce, two points from victory, and ending up having 74 minutes to ponder the missed chances before play resumed.         
	Belgian Clijsters emerged from the break a different player, and steamrolled the Russian in the third set after winning the second set tiebreak from 3-0 down.         
	After holding serve following the rain-break, 27-year-old Clijsters broke Sharapova before holding again to take the game into a tiebreak.         
	She clawed her way back from the 3-0 deficit to take the tiebreak 7-4, and overcame Sharapova in the third game of the final set when the Russian double-faulted.         
	The Belgian failed to win on three title points, but held her nerve in the end to secure a $350,000 prize and her 38th WTA win. Clijsters has moved three spots to stand at No.4 in the latest WTA rankings.         
	You cant start a match when you come out of the locker room like that, you cant start it at 0-0. You have to be ready to go and you have to get yourself a little bit pumped up and fired up. Thats what I tried to do, said Clijsters.         
	 quot;To me, obviously being my first tournament that I played last year, it was already special. Its kind of just for everybody in my team. It was just nice to be back at the place where we started last year, she added.         
	Sharapova, who was thrashed by Belarusian Victoria Azarenka for the Stanford title earlier this month, could be in doubt for the Montreal event due to her injured heel.         
	She said on her website that she felt some pain in my foot late in the second set, which kind of scared me so I have been forced to pull out of Montreal. I am hoping I just need a few days of rest.         
	The three-time Grand Slam champion moved up three spots to No. 12 in the latest WTA rankings.           (AGENCIES)

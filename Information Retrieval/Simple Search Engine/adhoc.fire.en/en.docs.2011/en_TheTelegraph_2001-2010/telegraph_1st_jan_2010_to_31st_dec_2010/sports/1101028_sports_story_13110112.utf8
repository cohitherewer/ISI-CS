The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Late winner puts United in last 8
                                                                                                                       7                                        Late winner puts United in last 8

	London: Mexican substitute Javier Hernandez scored a last-minute winner to send holders Manchester United into the League Cup quarter-finals with a 3-2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on Tuesday.         
	After a scrappy and goalless first half, the visitors twice came back from a goal down against a youthful United side before Little Pea Hernandez skipped past defenders to settle the tie in the 90th minute.         
	When he came on, you just know that if he gets a chance he is going to take it, United manager Alex Ferguson, who replaced his entire starting line-up from the weekend, said.         
	Premier League West Bromwich Albion roared through to the last eight with a thumping 4-1 victory at former England manager Sven-Goran Erikssons Championship (second division) side Leicester City.         
	Wigan Athletic beat second division Swansea City 2-0 with Argentine striker Mauro Boselli scoring his first goal for the club since his signing from Estudiantes.         
	The run of fourth division Northampton Town, who knocked out Liverpool at Anfield on penalties, ended at second division Ipswich Town where they lost 3-1 despite opening the scoring with a looping Liam Davis shot.         
	Third division Brentford, who knocked out Everton on penalties in the previous round, took their second Premier League opponents to spot-kicks before losing 3-4 at Birmingham City.         
	The hosts, rocked by a 68th-minute Sam Wood volley, had escaped by the skin of their teeth, thanks to a Kevin Phillips equaliser deep into stoppage time. United, with a team Ferguson described as a glimpse into the future, were lacklustre in the first half before coming alive.         
	It was a very open game in the second half, both teams played very well, said Ferguson.           (REUTERS)

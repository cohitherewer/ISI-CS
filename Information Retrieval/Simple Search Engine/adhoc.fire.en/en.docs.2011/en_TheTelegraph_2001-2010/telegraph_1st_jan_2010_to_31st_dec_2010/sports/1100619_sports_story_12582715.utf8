	Calcutta: Hosts Bengal were denied of a victory against Orissa after conceding a goal during stoppage time in a quarter final league match of National U-19 Championship for the B. C. Roy Trophy.         
	The match ended in a 1-1 draw. Bengal went ahead in the 27th minute when skipper Prabir Das, who has been in splendid form in the tournament, scored. However, Prabir and his teammates were guilty of missing too many chances.         
	Just when it looked like Bengal were on the verge of logging full points, Somnath Naik scored the equaliser in the fourth minute of stoppage time.         
	In another quarter final tie, Chandigarh blanked Manipur 3-0. Gagandeep Singh was the star performer scoring hattrick.

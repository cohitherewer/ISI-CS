                                                                                                                       7                                        Afridi, Akmal face fines
                        Afridi and Akmal                     
	Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) inquiry committee has recommended hefty fines on senior players Shahid Afridi and Kamran Akmal, for breach of conduct during the teams disastrous tour of Australia.         
	Sources close to the inquiry committee, constituted by the PCB to probe into the teams poor performance in Australia, said that fines were recommended for Akmal and Afridi for violating the players code of conduct in Australia, and spoiling Pakistan crickets image.         
	The recommendations are for hefty fines on both players but PCB chairman Ijaz Butt has the authority to revise the fine amount or even decide against imposing the fines, one source said.         
	The probe panel, headed by PCB chief operating officer Wasim Bari, recommended fine on Afridi for his bizarre ball-tampering incident in the Perth ODI, while finding Akmal guilty of other breaches of discipline.         
	The source said, apart from the fine, the committee has also made recommendations like making it binding on every player to declare his assets annually and get clearance from the board about talking to the media.         
	The (proposed) clause (in players central contract) also makes it clear that no player is allowed to speak on policy decisions of the board, the source said.         
	PCB legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi, who is a member of the inquiry committee, confirmed that the chairman would have the final say.         
	The committee has finalised and submitted its report and made all recommendations unanimously but the chairman can decide to accept all recommendations or turn down some of them, Rizvi said.         
	He said since the inquiry committees report is a confidential document, he cannot reveal its details.         
	We have made recommendations which we feel are fair and just in the circumstances, he added.         
	The board said in a statement that the report is being discussed and the board would make its finding public soon.           (PTI)

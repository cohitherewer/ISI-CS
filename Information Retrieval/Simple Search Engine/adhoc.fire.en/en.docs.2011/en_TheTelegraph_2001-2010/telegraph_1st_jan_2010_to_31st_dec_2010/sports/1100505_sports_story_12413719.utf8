The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians aim to banish Bangla
                                                                                                                       7                                        Australians aim to banish Bangla
                  Brad Haddin warms up during a training session, in Bridgetown, on Tuesday                     
	Bridgetown: Determined to win the only trophy missing from their cupboard, the Australians face potential giant-killers Bangladesh in their second and final Group A match for a place in the Super Eight stage of the World Twenty20 here Wednesday.         
	With a morale-boosting win over defending champions Pakistan under their belt, Australia are aiming to shed the tag of being Twenty20 duds.         
	Captain Michael Clarke, leading Australia in a major international tournament for the first time, has claimed that the Aussies have improved a lot over the past one year and the results here would reflect that.         
	Theres extra motivation from within the squad, we want to perform better in Twenty20 cricket than we have in general. I think our form has improved over the last 12 months and weve started really well, Clarke has said.         
	The key is going to be adapting to conditions, and I think weve got a really good squad to do that.         
	But having lost by a run to Zimbabwe in a warm-up match, Clarke is well aware of the pitfalls of taking Bangladesh lightly. The Tigers, as Bangladesh are popularly known, have a history of upsetting big teams in big tournaments.         
	We certainly would not be taking Bangladesh lightly. Theyve got some wonderful Twenty20 players who are very aggressive with the bat, said a cautious Clarke.         
	On paper, however, Australia are hands down favourites.         
	A batting line-up studded with Twenty20 specialists, and a bowling attack that has the variety to unsettle any team, Australia seem to be finally finding their foothold in a format that they didnt take too seriously till a few years back.         
	The intimidating trio of David Warner, Shane Watson and David Hussey is capable of ripping apart any attack in the world and Bangladesh can hardly claim to have the bowling to keep them in check.         
	Bangladesh go into the match after losing their tournament opener against Pakistan, but they can take heart from the fact that their top batsmen, Mohammed Ashraful and Shakib-al Hasan, looked in good touch.         
	But their bowling is a major worry. Australia, on the other hand, have a quality line-up in both pace and spin departments.           (PTI)

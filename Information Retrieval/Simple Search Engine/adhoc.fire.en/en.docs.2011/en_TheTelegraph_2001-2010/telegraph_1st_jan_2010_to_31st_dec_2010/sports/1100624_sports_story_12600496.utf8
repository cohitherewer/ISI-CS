            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES            Germany Mesut Ozil celebrates after scoring against Ghana, in Johannesburg, on Wednesday. (AFP)                           
	Johannesburg/Nelspruit: Germany defeated Ghana by a Mesut Ozil goal while Australia overcame Serbia 2-1 in Group D matches on Wednesday. Despite losing, Ghana advanced to the second round along with Germany. Australia lost out on goal difference.         
	Germany topped the group with six points. They will now play England and Ghana will take on the US.         
	At the Soccer City Stadium, Germany scored in the 60th minute when Mesut Oezil rifled a left-footed shot high into the net from outside the penalty area to break the deadlock after both teams had wasted chances.         
	Ghana threatened in the 66th but German captain Philipp Lahm stretched to block Andre Ayews shot.         
	Tim Cahill and Brett Holman scored for Australia before Marko Pantelic reduced the margin for Serbia in the 84th minute.         
	Germany and Ghana played cautiously till the half time and didnt make much effort to go for the kill. After Germany displayed some initial urgency, Ghana reorganised their midfield and defence that enabled them to play more positive passes in the rival half.         
	The Ghana style of play perhaps made the Germans a bit jittery. To counter the move, they also played a waiting game for the rest of the half. Whenever Germany broke through, they made sure to have enough men in defence. Ghana were no different.         
	Though Germany had the lions share of ball possession early in the first half, Ghanaians remained compact and dynamic in their defence. In the 10th minute, Lukas Podolski had a try at the goal after running down from the left but goalkeeper Richard Kingston was quick to tip it over the bar.         
	Four minutes later, Kwadwo Asamoah provided a great pass for Asamoah Gyan but his shot was way off the target.         
	Four minutes before half time, Ghana had a close shave when Bastian Schweinsteigers free kick had the Ghana defence in trouble. The African side was definitely lucky that Per Mertesacker was not in the right place to make the most of a header.         
	Germany made two changes from team that played in previous match. Jerome Boateng received a call in the first eleven in place of Holger Badstuber while Cacau came in for suspended Miroslav Klose.         
	Jeromes half brother, Kevin Prince, now infamous for his tackle against Michael Ballack in the FA Cup final, was in the other side.         
	Princes presence generated some interest but he could hardly do anything in the first half. On the other side, John Mensah returned to lead Ghana.         
	Germany were pushed to a must-win situation despite their fine win over Australia in the first match. Their defeat against Serbia in the next outing had made the situation difficult for them.         
	In Nelspruit, Australias Cahill headed in a cross in the 69th minute and Holman found the net with a long-range shot four minutes later at the Mbombela Stadium.

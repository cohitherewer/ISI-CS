                                                                                                                       7                                        A cricketer to the core
            A STAFF REPORTER            SS Ray                           
	Calcutta: Former chief minister of Bengal Siddhartha Shankar Ray passed away on Saturday at the age of 90. Ray, who was the states chief minister from 1972-77, was a sports loving person with pronounced interest in cricket.         
	Ray, who was also a barrister, had defended Sourav Ganguly successfully in 2004 after the then India captain was served a two-Test ban by Match Referee Clive Lloyd for the teams slow over rate during a India-Pakistan one-day International, at the Eden.         
	In 2005, Ray, along with Soli Sorabjee, were also successful in getting Souravs six-ODI ban, imposed by Chris Borad, reduced to one-third.         
	Despite ill health, Ray attended a function, on September 26, organised to remember legendary administrator Dhiren Dey on his birth centenary year.         
	He was also a former president of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and it was during his tenure as the chief minister that the Netaji Indoor Stadium was built.         
	The citys sporting fraternity fondly remembered him as a keen follower of sports. The following are what some of them had to say:         
	Gopal Bose: He was a very down to earth person. I remember first seeing him from close quarters in 1975 We went to Darjeeling with a cricket team and he accompanied us. He never for once behaved like he was the chief minister and was always there to help us. To sum up his love for sports, cricket in particular, it will be apt to say that he was a cricketer to the core.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya: He was multi-talented person with keen interest in sports. He took special interest in cricket and was always there for us whenever we needed him. In fact, he went out of his way to help us regarding legal issues, whenever they cropped up. He was instrumental in getting Sourav Gangulys suspension lifted in 2004         
	Chuni Goswami: A perfect gentleman and I have fond memories of Manuda (Rays nickname). He used to tell me that he was a University Blue in three disciplines  cricket, football, and tennis  whereas I was in only two  football and cricket. I havent seen someone with so much natural talent. Just imagine  he was a lawyer, a chief minister and a sportsman. Last time we met was during the Dhiren Dey function in September. He fell down during the function but very quickly, mind you he was 90, regained his composure and in a lighter vein regaled the gathering with a childhood story  how he was taught to fall and get up by his horse riding coach!         
	Jaidip Mukerjea: He was a close relative of mine and I have fond memories of him. He was suffering a lot with his health He was very much interested in tennis and himself a good player. He used to help me out with the game when I was a kid. I last met him during Dhiren Deys birth centenary function. He also had a great sense of humour.         
	Gurbux Singh: I had brief interactions with him and during those interactions I found him to be man with complete focus.

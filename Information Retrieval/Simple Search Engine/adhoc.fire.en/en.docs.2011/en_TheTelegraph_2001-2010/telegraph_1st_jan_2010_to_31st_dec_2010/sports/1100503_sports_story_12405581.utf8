	London: The Premier League title will be decided on the final day after Chelsea won 2-0 at Liverpool and Manchester United defeated Sunderland 1-0 on Sunday to keep the gap between the top two to a point.         
	Chelsea struck first as an awful Steven Gerrard blunder set them on their way to an ultimately comfortable Anfield win that took them to 83 points and also ended whatever little hope Liverpool had of finishing fourth.         
	United responded as Nanis first-half goal proved enough to get past Sunderland and take them to 82.         
	In next Sundays final round of fixtures Chelsea host Wigan Athletic, who beat them last September, while United are at home to Stoke City. Chelseas superior goal difference of nine means that for United to retain their title they must win and hope the Londoners lose or draw.         
	Although Chelsea will look back on Sundays game as an unexpectedly easy victory, Liverpool were on top for the first half hour as Alberto Aquilani went close twice.         
	Chelsea had shown almost nothing in attack but were then gifted a goal by Gerrard.         
	The England midfielder, who was on the brink of moving to Chelsea five years ago, delivered a totally unnecessary long-distance back-pass that was easily intercepted by Didier Drogba. He rounded Pepe Reina with ease and rolled the ball into the empty net after 33 minutes.         
	The goal changed the complexion of the match and within nine minutes of the restart it was 2-0 as Frank Lampard swept in his remarkable 21st league goal of the season.         
	Liverpools extra-time exertions on Thursday against Atletico Madrid in the Europa League semi-final then kicked in as what had appeared an immensely dangerous penultimate fence for Chelsea was eventually cleared while barely breaking stride.         
	It was Chelseas first league win at Anfield since 2005 and leaves them firmly on course for the League and Cup double. They face Portsmouth at Wembley on May 15 in the final.         
	We deserved to win. We did a fantastic job because there was a lot of pressure on us in this game, said coach Carlo Ancelotti, who looks set to win silverware in his first season in charge.         
	Now the team are fit and in good physical condition, good mentality, ahead of next weeks game. I always said the title would be decided at the end of the season.         
	Lampard added: We were at a bit of a low point a couple of months ago but we dug ourselves out of it and pushed on to be on the brink of doing the double.         
	United, who had not lost to Sunderland in the league for 13 years, took a while to subdue them on Sunday before Nani drove in a nicely-angled shot after 28 minutes.         
	Dimitar Berbatov disappointed again, missing two great chances, while Michael Carrick had a shot cleared off the line, leaving United to survive a nervy second half as Sunderland probed for an equaliser, although without really threatening to find one.         
	In Sundays other game, Europa League finalists Fulham claimed their first home league win over West Ham United since 1966 with a 3-2 success.         
	We missed an awful lot of chances, 1-0 is not a healthy score away from home, United manager Alex Ferguson said. They probably felt they were comfortable but we got there though, thats the important thing.         
	Looking ahead to next Sunday and Uniteds bid for an unprecedented fourth successive title he added: All we can do is win our game in front of our fans. Wigan will have a go and you never know what happens in football, its a crazy game.         
	We are clutching straws a bit but the important thing is to win our game and enjoy it in front of our fans.         
	If it were to happen it would be an incredible achievement, I think it wont be done again, four in a row.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look to carry form 
                                                                                                                       7                                      United look to carry form 
                      
	London: Manchester United will stay hot on the heels of Chelsea in the Premier League title race and plunge Portsmouth into deeper trouble if they beat the bottom-placed club on Saturday.         
	Uniteds dismantling of third-placed Arsenal with a 3-1 victory last weekend coupled with leaders Chelseas draw against Hull in midweek, has put the champions within two points of the summit.         
	And manager Alex Fergusons team could be back on top by Sunday if they beat debt-ridden Pompey and Arsenal manage to win at Chelsea.         
	It is kick-on time for us now, Ferguson said.         
	The Arsenal win was massive for us because they are in great form. Each game that comes along on the run towards the finishing tape becomes more important. It doesnt matter who it is, we want three points from everyone now.         
	Taking three points from Pompey shouldnt be a problem, although they upset Liverpool last month at Fratton Park.         
	Ferguson isnt relishing adding to Pompey manager Avram Grants problems as he grapples with the south-coast clubs cash crisis.         
	I cant for the love of me understand how hes coping with that, Ferguson said.         
	 Hes a football man, thats the problem for Avram. Being a football man he wants to be in football, but hes got back in (the game) in circumstances few managers would attempt... but hes got stuck in and hopefully he survives.         
	Portsmouth couldnt be facing United at a worse time with Nani producing some devastating performances and Wayne Rooney in the goal-scoring form of his life.         
	Hopefully we are now seeing (Rooney) mature into the centre forward we always thought he would be, Ferguson said.         
	Nani had failed to convince at Old Trafford after arriving from Sporting Lisbon for more money than it took to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from the same club.         
	But having stuck by the 23-year-old Nani, the Portuguese winger is finally blossoming  something Ferguson insists is not connected with Ronaldos departure for Real Madrid.         
	I dont think he was overshadowed by Ronaldo..         
	Nani was young when he came here. Some players can adjust to coming to another country and joining Manchester United very easily. (AGENCIES)

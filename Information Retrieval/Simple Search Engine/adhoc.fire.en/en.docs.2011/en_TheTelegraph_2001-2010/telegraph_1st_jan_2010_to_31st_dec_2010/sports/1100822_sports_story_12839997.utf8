    - Wyndham Championship Jeev Milkha at tied 10th spot                 Arjun Atwal during the second round of the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	Greensboro: Arjun Atwal followed up his opening-round 61 with a three-under 67 on Friday to assume a share of the lead at the halfway point of the Wyndham Championship.         
	The Indian was tied with American Brandt Snedeker (65) at 12-under 128, one stroke ahead of Americans Lucas Glover, John Rollins and Kevin Streelman on a day that dawned cloudy but soon gave way to brilliant sunshine.         
	Another Indian, Jeev Milkha Singh (68), shared the 10th spot after the second round. Jeev managed three birdies against a bogey for a total of eight-under 132.         
	I didnt hit it as good as yesterday but they say that its hard to back up a really low number with another one, said Atwal, who picked up four birdies on the front nine, before playing the back nine in a pedestrian one-over.         
	I missed a couple of fairways today. Thats why I made a couple of bogeys (but) other than that Im pretty happy.         
	In red-hot form this week, Atwal played out a flawless front nine, picking up birdies on the third, fourth, eighth and ninth to be four-under at the turn.         
	The back-nine was a slight disappointment as he stumbled to bogeys on the 10th and 14th before making some amends by sending down a birdie on the 15th hole.         
	Atwal, 37, does not have exempt status on tour, so the quickest way to regain his card is by winning.         
	Im definitely going to be thinking about winning, he said. If I get in contention on the back nine on Sunday, I wont be scared. Hopefully my swing holds up.         
	Co-leader Snedeker won in Greensboro three years ago, the final year the tournament was held at Forest Oaks before moving to its current venue at Sedgefield Country Club.         
	The courses are different (but) theyre the same kind of grass and greens, very similar to what I grew up on, said the 29-year-old Tennessean.         
	The only thing off today was my putting. I missed four putts inside eight feet, which is very unlike me. Besides that I played fantastic.         
	Snedeker was not the only player who had trouble adjusting to the extremely slow greens, although they were not quite as heavy for Fridays second round as they were the previous day.         
	Glover improved his position with a 65. The clock is ticking for last years US Open champion to impress Corey Pavin enough to earn a captains pick on the American team to defend the Ryder Cup against Europe in October.         
	Corey knows how bad I want to play and make the team and to do that I have got to relax and play golf and shoot good scores, said Glover.         
	If I play good the next three weeks and prove to him that Im playing well, then I feel like the year-and-a-half Ive had, Ill make it.         
	Glover narrowly failed to be among the eight players who made the team automatically, finishing 10th in the final standings last week.         
	Anthony Kim, who barely failed to make the team after finishing ninth in the standings, did not help his cause for a captains pick when he missed the cut, which fell at three-under 137.         
	Kim, who missed the cut by five strokes, described his performance as borderline embarrassing.         
	Others to bow out early included Fred Couples, Davis Love III, Mike Weir and last years champion, Ryan Moore.         
	Weirs early exit means he has no chance of qualifying for the Fed Ex Cup play-offs that start next week. The top 125 players on a points list are eligible but the Canadian is ranked 126th.

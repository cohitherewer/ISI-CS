The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashwin in, Yusuf recalled
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ashwin in, Yusuf recalled
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Prolific Indian opener Gautam Gambhir has been ruled out of Indias first two ODIs against South Africa due to a groin injury.         
	Gambhir, who got hit on his left forearm while batting in the first innings, had a swelling. But it has been learnt that groin injury had been troubling him for quite some time, and the selection committee under the chairmanship of Krishnamachari Srikkanth decided to rest the star batsman as they selected the 15-member squad here Tuesday.         
	Harbhajan Singh will be unavailable due to personal reasons, while Yuvraj Singh was not considered for selection due to a ligament tear in his left hand.         
	The selection committee which met at the team hotel in the evening, decided to recall hard-hitting Baroda all-rounder Yusuf Pathan, Tamil Nadu off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, Uttar Pradesh pacer Praveen Kumar and Mumbai all-rounder Abhishek Nayar.         
	Apart from Gambhir, Yuvraj and Harbhajan, Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda, who was a part of the squad for the tri-series in Bangladesh, was dropped.         
	Yusuf was rewarded for his brilliant show for West Zone in the Duleep Trophy final against South where he scored a hundred in the first innings and an unbeaten double hundred (210 .. off 190 balls) to guide his team to a successful world record chase of 536. His off-breaks could also come in handy.         
	Ashwin was one player who was a certainty after Harbhajan opted out.         
	[That Ashwin was set to get a look-in was reported by The Telegraph on Monday.]         
	What tilted the scales in Ashwins favour is his big-hitting ability. Ashwin had earlier been included in the Indian squad for the two T20 internationals against Sri Lanka last year. He has 103 wickets and 1085 runs in 28 first-class matches.         
	Mumbai all-rounder Abhishek Nayar, who played three ODIs last year during Indias tour of the West Indies and Champions Trophy, is back in the squad after a fine century for Board Presidents XI against the visiting South Africans in a two-day practice match.

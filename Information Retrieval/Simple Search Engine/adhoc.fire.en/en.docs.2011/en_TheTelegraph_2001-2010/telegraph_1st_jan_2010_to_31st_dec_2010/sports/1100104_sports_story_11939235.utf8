            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: If India win all their matches in the tri-nation tournament in Bangladesh, which starts Monday, and Pakistan win their five-match series against Australia handsomely, Mahendra Singh Dhonis team will rise to the top of the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship table.         
	India, who are already in possession of the coveted Mace for being the world No.1 in Test cricket, could add the ODI Shield to the trophy cabinet by the end of January, according to an International Cricket Council release on Sunday.         
	But Indias title win in Bangladesh would not be enough. Pakistan will have to beat Ricky Pontings men by a margin of 4-1 or worse to knock the Aussies off the top spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag face a tall order vs Dempo
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag face a tall order vs Dempo
                      
	Margao: Back at the top of the table after beating East Bengal, Dempo SC will now be looking to consolidate their position when they meet Chirag United in the 21th round of the I-League, at Nehru Stadium here, on Friday.         
	Dempo returned to the top after their victory over East Bengal in their last league encounter, displacing Mahindra United.         
	However, the Goan giants, who have 38 points from 20 matches, are only a point above second placed Mahindra and need to be consistent in their remaining matches if they harbour any hopes of winning the title.         
	Dempos midfield, which has been consistent, will be strengthened by the return of Climax Lawrence who did not play against East Bengal in the last match.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco is hoping that his boys will keep the form they displayed against East Bengal.         
	Now that we are back at the top (of the table), we need to be more consistent in our remaining matches to win the title, said a confident Colaco, adding that Chirag are a tricky opponent who can surprise on their day.         
	We have to be cautious initially before we open up the game, said Colaco.         
	Chirag, who have collected two points from their last three matches, lie fourth and seven points behind Dempo. Their slender title hopes thus rest entirely on this tie as only five matches remain after this round.         
	The Calcutta Club did hold Colacos side to a draw earlier in the season and so will be confident of a good show.         
	Chirag will miss the services of goalkeeper Sandip Nandy. (PTI)

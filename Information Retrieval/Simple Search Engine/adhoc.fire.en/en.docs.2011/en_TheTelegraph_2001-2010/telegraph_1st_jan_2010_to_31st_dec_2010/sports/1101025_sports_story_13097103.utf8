The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Korean cruise for Alonso
                                                                                                                       7                                        Korean cruise for Alonso

	Yeongam: Ferraris Fernando Alonso took over the Formula One championship lead by winning Sundays extraordinary Korean Grand Prix while rival team Red Bull had neither driver finish.         
	Red Bulls Mark Webber led the championship entering the race but spun out soon after racing belatedly began, while teammate Sebastian Vettel led from pole position until 10 laps from the finish when his engine failed.         
	The incident-strewn race began behind a safety car but was red flagged after only two laps due to persistent rain and standing water on the track. After resuming, the safety car remained out until lap 18 while water was cleared. The race went the distance but finished in darkness at 6 p.m. local time.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton finished second to keep his title chances alive and Ferraris Felipe Massa was third.         
	With two races remaining in the season, Alonso moved to 231 points, ahead of Webber on 220 and Hamilton on 210. Vettel remained on 206 points and his championship chances look all but over.         
	Vitantonio Liuzzi recorded his best result of the season by finishing sixth as Force India garnered eight points.         
	It was a tremendous finish for Liuzzi after starting as low as 17th on the grid. Before this, a seventh place finish at the Australian GP was the best result for the Italian.         
	However, Adrian Sutil returned empty handed after failing to finish for the second consecutive time, following an accident. He was the first non-finisher of the nine as he spun on Lap 29 and then ran wide in Turn One and lost a place to Jamie Alguersuari. He then hit Kamui Kobayashi and brought about his own retirement on the 47th lap with damaged front suspension.         
	The DNF result pushed Sutil to 11th in the drivers championship as Williams Rubens Barrichello replaced him by finishing seventh. Both are tied at 47 points. Liuzzi has moved up to the 13th spot with 21 points.         
	Sutil and Toro Rossos Sebastien Buemi will carry five-place grid penalties into the Brazilian Grand Prix after being blamed for causing crashes here.         
	This is the first wet race that I won, so I am even more happy, Alonso said, while downplaying his championship lead. Nothing changes. It was bad luck for Mark and Sebastian but anything can happen in the next two races.         
	Reigning champion Jenson Button dropped out of title contention after finishing 12th.         
	Two laps after the cars were finally released from behind the safety car, Webber ran slightly wide at a corner, putting his tires on the slippery ripple strip and slid across the track into a wall.         
	Webbers car drifted back across the track, and Mercedes Nico Rosberg could not avoid hitting the Red Bull, ending the race for both drivers.

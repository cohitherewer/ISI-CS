The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Race against time for Gambhir...
                                                                                                                       7                                      Race against time for Gambhir...
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir has only a 50-50 chance of playing in the crucial second Test against South Africa, in Durban, from Sunday.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, reserve opener Murali Vijay has been asked to mentally prepare himself to face the hosts pace battery on a wicket which is expected to follow the Kingsmead tradition.         
	Gambhir was hit on the left hand in Centurion and the swelling hasnt subsided.         
	Whats confirmed (as of late Saturday) is that Suresh Raina will be dropped and Cheteshwar Pujara given an opportunity overseas for the first time.         
	Raina has had an awful run in the last five Tests and, with India 0-1 down in the three-match series, the need is for somebody who is hungry and not short on confidence.         
	Zaheer Khan, as expected, is going to be back in the XI. Hes fit, so Jaydev Unadkat has to sit in the dressing room.         
	INDIA: Gautam Gambhir/Murali Vijay, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Cheteshwar Pujara, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Sreesanth.         
	Match starts: 2 pm (IST).

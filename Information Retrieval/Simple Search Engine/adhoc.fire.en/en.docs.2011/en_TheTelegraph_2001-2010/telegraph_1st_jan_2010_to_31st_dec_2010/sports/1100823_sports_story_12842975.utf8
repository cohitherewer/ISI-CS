	Madrid: Lionel Messi scored a hattrick to lead Barcelona to a 4-0 victory over Sevilla on Saturday and a 5-3 aggregate win in the Spanish Super Cup.         
	The Argentine forward had a quiet World Cup in South Africa in June and July but looked more comfortable back among his club mates at the Nou Camp.         
	Messi grabbed two well-taken first-half goals after Sevillas Abdoulay Konko had put the ball in his own net early on, and rounded off the night with a third at the end.         
	Weve won another important title after turning round what was a difficult (first leg) result. We now have the first trophy of the season, Messi said.         
	Having lost the first leg 3-1 in Seville last week with a second-string side, Barcelona fielded an almost full-strength team to win La Ligas traditional curtain raiser for a record ninth time.         
	It only took the hosts 13 minutes to open the scoring when Pedro squirmed his way into the area and crossed low for Konko to bundle the ball into his own net.         
	Xavis superb 24th-minute pass then put Messi through on goal and the World Player of the Year doubled the lead.         
	Dani Alves tore down the right and fed Messi, who scored from a tight angle at the near post just before halftime, and Sevilla appeared to switch their attentions to Tuesdays Champions League playoff from then on.         
	Sevilla slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Portugals Braga last week. During the second period the home crowds chants for favourite Andres Iniesta to be given a run out were answered and Spains match-winner in the 1-0 World Cup final win over Netherlands was given a rousing reception when he came on.         
	Iniesta was quickly followed by new 40 million euros signing from Valencia David Villa, who was keen to impress on his debut and almost opened his account with a fierce shot parried by Andres Palop.         
	Adriano Correia was also given his debut and it was Iniesta who laid on the ball for Messi to crash home the fourth.         
	In Milan, Inter Milans Samuel Eto scored twice to help get Rafael Benitezs era at the treble winners off to a perfect start with a 3-1 triumph over AS Roma in the Italian Super Cup at the San Siro on Saturday.         
	The Cameroon international struck in the 71st and 80th minutes after Goran Pandev had cancelled out John Arne Riises opener for Roma in the first half.           (REUTERS)

	Karachi: ICC president David Morgan wants a resumption of India-Pakistan bilateral cricketing ties because he feels the on-field rivalry between the two countries is as big as the Ashes. Morgan said he wants to help revive cricket ties between the two countries, which were suspended in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008.    
	One of the things I am working on is trying to persuade the BCCI that they should play more bilateral matches against Pakistan as opposed to just in ICC events, Morgan a daily.         
	Karachi: Younis Khan has come out in support of underfire Pakistan skipper Mohammed Yousuf, saying playing against Australia in their own den is no mean task. Pakistan were blanked 0-3 by Australia in the Test series which concluded Monday with their crushing 241-run defeat in Hobart. I think the board should continue with him. People are criticising him but I think a tour to Australia is tough for any captain and all teams tend to turn defensive while playing in Australia, he said.        
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has initiated a preliminary inquiry into the statements given by Akmal brothers  Kamran and Umar  to the Australian media that allegedly showed the team and PCB affairs in poor light.

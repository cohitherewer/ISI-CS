The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB suspends Haider contract
                                                                                                                       7                                        PCB suspends Haider contract
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Zulqarnain Haider                           
	Karachi/London: Support shrunk for troubled Pakistan cricketer Zulqarnain Haider in his own nation as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Wednesday suspended his contract and the government refused to support his efforts of seeking asylum in the United Kingdom after sensationally deserting the team in Dubai.         
	The PCB also constituted a three-member committee to look into the incident of his fleeing from Dubai to London after claiming to have received death threats from match-fixers.         
	Haider mysteriously left for London hours before the fifth one-dayer, against South Africa, without informing either the Board or the team management.         
	He is now seeking asylum in UK, claiming that he received death threats during the series from match-fixers.         
	Haider, on Wednesday, was interviewed by border force and home department officials in London over his application to apply for political asylum in the United Kingdom.         
	Haider told Geo News from London that he had been asked routine questions about why he had applied for asylum.         
	They asked me routine questions and it was straightforward interview. They have now asked me to appear again on December 10 for another interview, he said.         
	Todays interview was the first part of a process where my application would be considered, he added.         
	A senior Board official said the stipend contract was suspended because Haider had violated the terms and conditions of his contract as a Pakistan player.         
	A PCB statement also said that the Board is trying to get in touch with Haider but attempts to contact him have so far remained unsuccessful.         
	The fact-finding committee includes Subhan Ahmed, team manager Intikhab Alam and security manger Major Khawaja Najam. All the three members are in Dubai as part of the current team management.         
	The Board official said the committee would meet soon and send a notice to Haider to report to them.         
	The government also took a hard stand against the keeper, who announced his retirement from International cricket Tuesday, barely three months after making his Test debut.         
	The government will not support any move from Zulqarnain (Haider) to get asylum in the UK. We dont support his actions and believe he should have come to us if he was under threat from anyone. He didnt have confidence in the national team management or the Board (PCB), Pakistan sports minister Ijaz Hussain Jakhrani told reporters.         
	If he is such a weak and scared person he should not have played cricket in the first place, particularly not for the national team. This is not way for a member of the national team and a professional cricketer to behave, Jakhrani said.         
	Meanwhile, Arif Abbasi, the former chief executive of PCB, said that he was shocked at the way the team management had allowed the incident to take place.         
	To me the most shocking thing is that Zulqarnain didnt have enough confidence and trust in the management or his seniors to go and share his problems with them. They talk about discipline but where is the discipline? How did the manager give away the passport to Zulqarnain in the middle of the series? I blame the manager, Intikhab Alam, for this mess. He is such an experienced person and he allowed this incident to happen.         
	Alam, on the other hand, has spoken about his immense disappointment about the embarrassment caused by Haider.         
	I am disappointed because we had given a twohour lecture to the players before leaving for UAE. We even explained the clauses of their contract to them; even in Dubai, the ICC anticorruption officer gave them a lecture on what players are supposed to do if someone approaches them or threatens them, Alam said.

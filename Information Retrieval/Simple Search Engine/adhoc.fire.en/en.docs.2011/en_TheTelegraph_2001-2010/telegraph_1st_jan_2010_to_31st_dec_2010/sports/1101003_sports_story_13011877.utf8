The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji: Zaheer was talking to Laxman
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhajji: Zaheer was talking to Laxman
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                Zaheer Khan on Saturday       
	Mohali: Harbhajan Singh is known to raise the bar against Australia. Though the offie had to be content with just three wickets, he bowled stingily against the Aussies in the first innings in Mohali. The Turbanator opened up on various issues, including Fridays Zaheer-Ponting spat in a media interaction.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Did Sehwags dismissal peg India back?         
	Who said were at a disadvantage? It would have been nice if Sehwag remained But we still have a lot of batsmen to come         
	Should Sehwag have been more careful?         
	We all know what kind of a batsman Viru is. He plays his natural game and has won us many matches playing like that. So theres nothing wrong in it.         
	On the Zaheer-Ponting spat         
	I dont know exactly But Zaheer told me that he passed a comment on Usain Bolt to (VVS) Laxman. Ponting must have overheard that and hence reacted. I was far from the scene. So, it is difficult for me comment.         
	Zaheers five-wicket haul         
	He bowled brilliantly. I would place him in the same bracket as other great Indian pacers like Kapil Dev and Jawagal Srinath. Im sure he will be remembered as one of the greats.         
	Why didnt India take the new ball early?         
	We were quite happy with the old ball. It was reversing and it helped us check the run flow. Also, Ishant (Sharma) was not available for most of the part That also led to the delay.         
	Is the Test heading towards a draw?         
	Difficult to say If we can score as much as they did, things will be different Because there will a lot of wear and tear in the track and it may open up on the fourth day. So, anything can happen.         
	Hows the wicket?         
	Theres not much help from the wicket. No pace, no bounce, no carry, no turn --- its hard work for the bowlers. Thats why I tried different variations and tried to beat them in the air.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Subhas is happy with the show
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick had an uphill task within 48 hours of taking over as Mohun Bagans technical director. After registering a point with a 2-2 draw against Dempo, on Thursday, a relieved Bhowmick admitted that his wards performed better than his expectations.         
	The team was mentally shattered before I took over The defence, especially, was shaken. I wouldnt say that we were perfect today, that we didnt commit any mistake But I would definitely say that given the mental state they were in, the boys did better than I expected, Bhowmick said.         
	There are some chinks but I can take care of them. I didnt get enough time to have a look at the entire squad. But now I will get some time and will definitely work on the flaws, he added.         
	Asked how significant was the result for him and Bagan, Bhowmick said: This is of course a very important result It may just instil the required confidence that was missing from the side. That we scored two goals against a side like Dempo is of course an achievement. Also, at one point of time we were the better team on the ground. They had no answers when we attacked.         
	And he didnt forget to laud Jose Barreto, who scored the equaliser for Bagan. What can I say about him He was brilliant. His leadership skills are extraordinary, Bhowmick said.

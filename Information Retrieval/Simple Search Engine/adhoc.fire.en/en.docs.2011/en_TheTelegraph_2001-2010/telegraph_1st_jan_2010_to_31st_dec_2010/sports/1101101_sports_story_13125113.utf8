	Doha: Belgian Kim Clijsters captured the season-ending WTA Championships on Sunday with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 victory over world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki.         
	Clijsters, who won the tournament for a third time after her victories in 2002 and 2003, was playing in her first event since winning the U.S. Open in September following an operation to remove a mole from her right foot.         
	She pocketed almost $1.5 million in prize-money for winning the title in the Qatari capital after a match lasting two hours and 20 minutes at the Khalifa Tennis Complex.         
	I felt like it was never going to end, said the Belgian in a courtside interview.         
	It was a really tough battle with some great shots, great tennis and great fitness. Im glad that I won, obviously its disappointing for Caroline but I dont know how many more years Im going to keep doing this so.         
	She has a great future ahead of her.         
	Wozniacki, who wrapped up the year-end No.1 spot earlier in the tournament, paid tribute to Clijsters performance.         
	Its been a fantastic week for me, said the Dane. Kim just played amazing today and she deserved to win.         
	Clijsters succeeded because she had the more naturally forceful game, remained unfazed by the ups and downs of an unpredictably long drawn out battle, and played some of her best tennis in the final stages.         
	It was a disappointment for Wozniacki because she had wanted to answer those detractors who questioned her status as the worlds No.1 because she has not yet won a Grand Slam title.         
	This title would have been the next best thing, though there were moments when it looked within her reach, and she did suggest - with her tactical adaptability, and tremendous court coverage - that she has the capacity eventually to win it.         
	Wozniacki, who achieved the year-end top spot with her second win of the week here, said, I would love to come back here, and I would love to try for this title again.         
	Wozniacki had to find ways to counter Clijsters heavier game, sometimes by coming to the net more often; also by seeking more angles to keep Clijsters moving.         
	It made for good rallies and longer games. It was after one very long game that Clijsters broke to win the first set, gaining some momentum to break again early in the second.         
	But with defeat looming Wozniacki appeared to relax, hitting more freely, breaking back for 3-4 and remarkably breaking again to level the match. She also broke back in the final set, levelling at 2-2 after an early setback. But it was her last real surge.         
	Wozniacki unaccountably stopped a rally and called for a Hawkeye replay, only to get her call wrong. When she also delivered a double fault two points later, it helped Clijsters make the break for 4-2 which decided the match.

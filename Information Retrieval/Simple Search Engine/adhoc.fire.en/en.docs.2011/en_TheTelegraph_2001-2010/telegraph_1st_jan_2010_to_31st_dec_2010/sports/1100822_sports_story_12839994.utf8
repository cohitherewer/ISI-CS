The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Kim bows out
                                                                                                                       7                                      Injured Kim bows out
                      
	Montreal: An injured Kim Clijsters hobbled to a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 quarter final loss to Vera Zvonareva at the Montreal Cup on Friday, casting doubt on the Belgians ability to defend her US Open crown.         
	As Clijsters was being questioned later about her fitness, world No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki  the player the Belgian beat last year to win at Flushing Meadows  was sending a message of her own by blasting her way into the semi-finals with a 6-3, 6-2 win over French Open champion Francesca Schiavone of Italy.         
	The Dane had extra reason to smile after learning that she will likely be seeded No. 1 at the US Open after Serena Williams announced she would sit out the years final Slam while recovering from foot surgery.         
	Wozniacki will next face in-form Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, who booked her semi-final spot with a ruthless 6-1, 6-3 win over Chinas Zheng Jie.         
	The first Russian woman to win the US Open, Kuznetsova is also hitting her stride on the North American hardcourts, claiming her 13th career title in San Diego two weeks ago.         
	The other semi-final will pit Zvonareva against Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who moved on with a 6-2, 7-6 win over Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli.         
	Zvonareva had looked headed for the exit rather than the semi-finals when Clijsters broke the eighth-seeded Russian at the first opportunity on her way easily taking the opening set.         
	But Clijsters hurt her hip in the second set and Zvonareva pounced, sweeping through nine straight games en route to her second victory over the Belgian in seven career matches.         
	Clijsters later played down the injury she described as tightness in her left hip, saying she will undergo an MRI next week to make sure it is nothing serious.           (REUTERS)

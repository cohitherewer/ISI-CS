The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir captain for entire series
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gambhir captain for entire series

	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir has been appointed captain for the entire five-match ODI series against New Zealand, not just the first two games.         
	Confirming this on Sunday evening, a well-placed source of The Telegraph said: The press release issued by the Board (late on Saturday) didnt specify that, but the selectors have decided on Gambhir for all five matches.         
	The series, the last at home before the World Cup, will be played in Guwahati (November 28), Jaipur (December 1), Vadodara (December 4), Bangalore (December 7) and Chennai (December 10).         
	What is also clear now is that Sachin Tendulkar, regular vice-captain Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh wont be featuring in any of the matches. Besides, obviously, regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	All four are likely to leave for South Africa around December 5/6, arriving about 10 days before the start of the three-Test series.         
	Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman would be boarding the same flight. Possibly Pragyan Ojha and Cheteshwar Pujara too.         
	However, theres no clarity on Zaheer Khan. Theres a chance that Zaheer will play the last three ODIs, otherwise hell land in South Africa with no match practice at all... If he does play, then he wont be going with the advance party, the well-placed source pointed out.         
	The Board, one learns, would take a call on whether rookie quicks Jaydev Unadkat and Umesh Yadav also need to reach South Africa early.         
	Dhoni and Co. will be accompanied either by coach Gary Kirsten or bowling consultant Eric Simons. Both have played for South Africa, with the latter having coached the Proteas too.         
	Meanwhile, theres no official word, but it seems Dhoni has bruised fingers, while Sachin and Sehwag have a shoulder problem. Harbhajan, its gathered, has a shin injury, while Zaheer is recovering from a groin strain.         
	Except Zaheer, the other four are turning out in the final Test against New Zealand.

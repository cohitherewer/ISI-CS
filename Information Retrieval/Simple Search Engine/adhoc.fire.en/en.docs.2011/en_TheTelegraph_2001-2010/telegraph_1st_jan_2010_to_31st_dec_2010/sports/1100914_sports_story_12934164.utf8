            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan was a satisfied man at the end of his teams 5-0 rout of Mohammedan Sporting, on Monday. And may be as a testimony to that fact, the Englishman repeatedly uttered the word pleasing during the post-match media conference.         
	Playing with 10 men for most of the match and not conceding a goal is an excellent performance. Its a very pleasing sight to see your team do well, Morgan said.         
	We converted all the chances that we created What is more pleasing is the fact that not only our strikers, but also the mid-fielders are among goals, , he added.         
	He, however, criticised Penn Orji for inviting a needless red card. Getting a red card for showing dissent is an absolute waste. He made a mistake and hopefully he will learn from it. We have an in-house fine system and he will fined accordingly for the act, Morgan said.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Syed Nayeemuddin took the blame of the crushing defeat on himself. I am to blame for the result. We played badly today and that cost us. Our defenders were not up to the mark so theres no point in only blaming the goalkeeper. However, I believe that we can do well with this team in the Federation Cup if the co-ordination among players improve, the veteran coach said.

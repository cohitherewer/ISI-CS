    - First ODI 
  -  Injury-hit team India take on Proteas today             JAYDEEP BASU                            
	Jaipur: Weakened by the absence of some of their frontline players, India will bank on the substitutes to come good in the one-day series opener against South Africa here on Sunday.         
	The bowling unit looks particularly hamstrung with both the pace and spin spearheads out of action. Zaheer Khan, Indias strike bowler for quite a while now, will miss the entire series with a muscle strain, while Harbhajan Singh is skipping the first two ODIs in order to attend his sisters wedding.         
	Zaheers contribution goes beyond sending down his quota of 10 overs. The left-arm seamer is a vital cog in Team Indias wheel, often earning the early breakthroughs and paving the way for the slow bowlers before appearing again at death to contain the run rate.         
	Harbhajans absence, too, comes at a time when the off-spinner seems to have just got back his form in the Eden Test.         
	In the batting department, Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhirs absence means the others would have to shoulder more responsibility. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, however, insists the team can cope with the absence of the star players.         
	We are confident of doing well. As far as missing a few players is concerned, that happens in every series. It is a good opportunity for young players to prove that they belong to the international level. At the same time this is our chance to test the bench strength also, Dhoni said.         
	A lot would depend on what kind of start India get from the opening pair of Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Coming after them, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina need to do their bit while a burden of expectations is bound to be on Dhonis shoulders as well considering his highest ODI score came at this venue.         
	Talking about the bowling, Dhoni hinted that Uttar Pradesh pacer Praveen Kumar might make the playing XI on Sunday.         
	Praveen does not have the pace. He is not an express bowler but I feel he is a street-smart cricketer. The change in length, speed and the variation that he has along with the amount of cricket he has played really helps him.         
	At the same time, (Ashish) Nehra is also an experienced cricketer and has been around for a long time so it helps when you have an experienced guy like him. If you see our bowling department right now, it is not a very experienced line-up.         
	So Ashish will definitely have an effect when it comes to grooming other bowlers and suggesting what can be done on a wicket like this.         
	Apart from that (Ravindra) Jadeja has played a few games and we have R. Ashwin and Amit Mishra as well. I think the bowling strength is decent but if you compare it after including Zaheer or Harbhajan, there is a big difference. But, at the same time, it is up to the individuals how they shape up for the game, the Indian skipper said.         
	Having successfully maintained their No.1 Test team status, Dhoni and his men now have to win this three-match ODI series to retain their No.2 ranking in ODIs.         
	Its however not only India who are grappling with injuries.         
	South Africa have had their share of problems with skipper Graeme Smith returning home due to a finger injury, leaving the job of leading the side to Jacques Kallis.         
	But Kallis, it seems, isnt too nervous.         
	We are looking forward to the challenge have done it before, the veteran all-rounder said. We are hoping to win the series after the disappointment at Calcutta.         
	A multi-layered security net has been thrown over the venue after reports of potential terror attacks appeared in the media.

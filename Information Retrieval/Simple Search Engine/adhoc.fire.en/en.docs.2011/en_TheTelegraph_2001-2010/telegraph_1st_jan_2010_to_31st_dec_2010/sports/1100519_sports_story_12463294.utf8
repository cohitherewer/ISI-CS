The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijender stays No. 1
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vijender stays No. 1
                      
	New Delhi: Olympic and World Championship bronze medal winner Vijender Singh (75kg) continued his reign at the top, while Asian silver medallist Thokchom Nanao Singh (48kg) rose a couple of rungs to fourth place in the latest AIBA rankings.         
	Vijender (75kg), who became a Commonwealth champion in March, has 2137.5 points in the list updated after the 3 Star China Cup, which was a ranking points event. Vijender did not participate in the China Cup but given the points gap between him and his rivals, the Indians reign at the top was hardly threatened.         
	Olympic silver medallist Emilio Bayeux Correa of Cuba is a distant second in the list with 1875 points. Nanao (48kg), currently nursing a hand injury, has risen despite being out of action since January. The Manipuri, who is a former youth world champion, has 1400 points in the latest rankings.         
	The light fly weight list also has Commonwealth champion Amandeep Singh way down at the 54th spot, which is a drop of 10 places, with 225 points. Asian and Commonwealth champion Suranjoy Singh (51kg) gained three places, rising to 13th with 800 points.         
	The Presidents Cup gold medallist was part of a 13-member Indian team that recently went to Cuba for a training-cum-competition trip and he fetched a silver there. Olympian Jitender Kumar dropped three rungs to 21st in the bantam weight (54kg) list.

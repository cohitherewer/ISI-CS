The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi gets 5 more days to respond 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modi gets 5 more days to respond 
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Suspended IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi Monday got a breather after the BCCI gave him five more days to respond to the first showcause notice for alleged financial irregularities.         
	The BCCI decision came after Modi sought some documents from the BCCI to prepare his reply, though he was supposed to respond to the chargesheet by Monday.         
	Modi has requested the Board president (Shashank Manohar) and secretary (N. Srinivasan) to extend time. He was supposed to reply to the showcause today. The Board has taken a decision to extend time up to the 15th of May, BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty told reporters in Mumbai.         
	Shettys announcement came soon after Modis lawyer handed over the remaining documents pertaining to the IPL which were with the suspended IPL chief. Shetty did not want to reveal the nature of the documents that were handed over to him. This is the final phase of handing over of papers to the Board from our side. We had earlier submitted a bigger bulk of papers on the May 8, Modis lawyer said.         
	The first set of documents, both original as well as notarised copies, which Modi had submitted earlier included all franchisee agreements, global media rights agreements, global media rights packages, all bid documents, media rights licensee agreements, eligibility letters of bidders with details and sponsorship agreements entered into by IPL.         
	Modis request for an extension though was surprising as just a couple of days ago, he had asserted that he would personally hand over his reply to the BCCI Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2-wicket victory for NZ
                                                                                                                       7                                      2-wicket victory for NZ
                      
	Georgetown: Mahela Jaywardenes breezy 81 went in vain as New Zealand made a winning start to their World Twenty20 campaign, beating Sri Lanka by two wickets in the thrilling inaugural match of the tournament here on Friday.         
	Sri Lanka rode on Jayawardenes career-best Twenty20 score, that came off just 51 balls, to post 135 for six. But Jesse Ryders 27-ball 42 at the top and Nathan McCullums (16 off 6) last over heroics sealed the match in favour of New Zealand in 19.5 overs.         
	The younger McCullum came up with a four and a six off Lasith Malinga in the final over to finish off the run chase in style.           (AGENCIES)

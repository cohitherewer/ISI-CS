The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Im not coming back
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Im not coming back
                      
	Melbourne: There will be no comeback in this Ashes series, said Australian spin legend Shane Warne, putting to rest the frenzied speculation about his possible return to Test due to the teams continuing slump.         
	The flamboyant cricketer-turned-commentator, who has been offered a million dollars to come back and rescue Australias floundering Ashes campaign, said he is flattered by the attention but it wont be possible for him to actually return.         
	Im sorry to disappoint you, but there will be no comeback in this Ashes series, the 41-year-old wrote in his column for an Australian daily.         
	I must say I was very flattered and surprised that a lot of you out there wanted me to make a comeback and play in the series, he said.         
	Warne said although he would have wanted to be in the thick of things but it would require quite an effort to be match fit.         
	I must admit it did cross my mind, but then I woke up in London, where it was snowing, and realised I was only dreaming, he said (PTI)

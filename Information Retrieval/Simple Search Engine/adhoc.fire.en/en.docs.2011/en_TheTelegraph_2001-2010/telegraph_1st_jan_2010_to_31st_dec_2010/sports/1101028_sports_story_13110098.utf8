            OUR BUREAU                      
	The International Cricket Council on Wednesday refused to comment on recent reports about Suresh Raina having been spotted during the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka in the company of a woman who allegedly had links with a bookie.         
	We dont disclose the sending of reports by the cricket Boards to the Anti-Corruption Unit Boards speak with us and we speak with the Boards. Thats the protocol, Haroon Lorgat said in Mumbai.         
	The Telegraph, however, learns that the ICC is not investigating the matter.         
	The report has been rubbished as false and baseless by BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan in a media statement on Sunday.

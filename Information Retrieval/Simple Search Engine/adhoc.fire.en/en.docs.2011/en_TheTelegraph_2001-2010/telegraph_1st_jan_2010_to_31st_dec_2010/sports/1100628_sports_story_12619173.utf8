            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bengal juniors almost clinched a feat which the seniors have failed to in recent years. The hosts were gunned down in a penalty shootout by Chandigarh in the final of the under-19 football tournament for the BC Roy Trophy, at the Mohun Bagan ground, on Sunday.         
	Chandigarh clinched their maiden national trophy by beating Bengal 5-3 .         
	The match was locked 1-1 after regulation time. However, the extra time too failed to break the deadlock.         
	In the penalty shootout, Chandigarh converted all their chances, while Bengals Rajib Ghorui, who had scored Bengals lone, missed his kick from the spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wada committee endorses clause
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wada committee endorses clause
                      
	Mumbai: The executive committee and foundation board of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has endorsed the current system of athlete whereabouts requirement, rejected by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), at its meeting over the weekend in Montreal.         
	Results of a survey circulated earlier this year by Wada to anti-doping organisations showed that Anti-Doping Code signatories overwhelmingly supported the principle of whereabouts and reported successful implementation of the rules, a release from the Wada said Monday.         
	The survey showed there existed some misunderstanding from a number of anti-doping organisations as to the purpose of whereabouts requirements and Wada chief John Fahey called for user-friendly guidelines to help anti-doping organisations implement them.         
	Whereabouts information is a key element of effective out-of-competition testing programs, said Wada president Fahey. But they must be used by anti-doping organisations to design and implement truly effective testing programmes.

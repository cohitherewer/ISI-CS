The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB waits for UK decision
                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB waits for UK decision
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is waiting for the United Kingdoms home department to take a call on the asylum application of wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider.         
	Admitting that Zulqarnain had violated his central contract with the Board by leaving the team hotel in Dubai before resurfacing in London, during last months series against South Africa, a PCB official said that the Pakistan Board didnt want to make early judgements on the case.         
	We immediately suspended his contract on disciplinary grounds, but we dont want to do anything more until we know what happens to his application, the official said.         
	We dont want to jeopardise his case by doing anything, Subhan Ahmed, a member of PCBs fact-finding committee, said.         
	Ahmed, however, scotched rumours about PCB taking a lenient stand on the wicketkeeper.         
	It is a complicated case and some things are still not clear, although we had three discussions with Zulqarnain while investigating this matter, Ahmed said. (Agencies)

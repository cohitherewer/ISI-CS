The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: Every win is special 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni: Every win is special 
  - Greener the track, the better it may be       A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni declared it as a proud moment for Team India after they registered a historic 87-run win against South Africa, in Durban, on Wednesday. Speaking at a media conference, Dhoni also surprisingly said that the Indian team would welcome a green top in Cape Town.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On equalling Mohammed Azharuddins Test wins (14) as captain         
	It means Ive got a good side What it means is that weve played consistent cricket over a period of time. Of course its a proud moment. As a team  whether its batting, bowling or fielding  weve done consistently well. It feels really good that weve done well together.         
	If he is aware of his win percentage         
	What I want is my team to respect me, not anything else. Im fortunate to have people who are willing to go onto the field and do their best.         
	Comparing the Durban win with the victory against Australia, in Perth         
	I dont believe in rating wins. Youve forgotten Johannesburg 2006 Every win is special in its own way, whether you win in Kanpur, at the Eden or somewhere else in the world It means a lot.         
	India will be going to Cape Town with the series tied at 1-1. If he is reminded of a similar situation four years ago         
	Thats a difficult one. Four years back, we had a brilliant first innings and then a disappointing second innings, because of which we lost that Test. Its important to be at our best in all three departments. Its important to see what kind of track there is. The greener the track the better it may be Lets hope for the best. A bit of worry for us was getting 20-odd wickets, but the bowlers did really well here.         
	On why it is greener the better         
	Most of our bowlers are skill-based. Even if we bowl only at 135-140kmph, we are basically swing bowlers, which means the greener the wicket, the better it is because the bowlers can swing it a bit more. We are not naturally talented for flat wickets where you have put in a lot of effort and bounce batsmen out.         
	Winning without Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid scoring         
	Its not about being proud if someone is not performing. Whats important is how you back each other, and the way you enjoy each others success. Of course Pujara got a chance, his intent was very good, he was positive.         
	If Kalliss wicket was the turning point         
	There were many Most of their batsmen have done well in the last few series. However, the timing of getting Kallis, and De Villiers was important.         
	On Gary Kirstens help in staging a comeback         
	Its not the first time. When South Africa came to India we were 0-1 down That happened twice. In Napier, we were following on. Gary is a good coach to have A good man who he believes in hard work. It will be difficult to replace him.         
	Losing the toss, but still winning the match         
	One thing is for sure, Im very consistent at loosing tosses! In some places, like Centurion, it becomes really tough. The first day was the toughest. Toss at times can be really crucial. In this game, it didnt really matter But its always good to win the toss and put the opposition in when theres some help for bowlers.         
	On Zaheer Khan         
	If you look at the positive side, the youngsters are getting groomed under Zaheer. Also, Zaheer is very good under pressure. He doesnt panic in tough situations and he convinces bowlers about the fields they should set and the lines and lengths they should bowl.         
	Whether Sreesanth was over-aggressive         
	Theres nothing called over-aggression if you dont cross the limit. There are some guidelines that are needed to be followed, and there is nothing called over-aggression or under-aggression.         
	Gambhirs availability for the third and final Test         
	The chances are very bright Hopefully hell be available for the next Test.         
	Laxmans back problem         
	Thats one thing thats beyond my control, its between the physio and Laxman. Hopefully, it will be okay for the next few years. He played a very special innings. We always count on Laxman. Whenever you see him not scoring in a couple of innings, you know something very special is coming. At the end of the day, the 96 runs that he made mattered.         
	New year resolutions         
	Ive heard resolutions are meant to be broken, so no resolutions as such. Well try to continue to focus on the basic. Were enjoying the game and we want to continue doing that.         
	If he draws inspiration from the fact that as a captain, he won the World T20 and Champions League in South Africa         
	Thats one big positive were looking forward to. But it depends on what we do on those five days on the field in Cape Town. Well try to go there, do our best, give it our best shot .

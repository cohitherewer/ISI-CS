                                                                                                                       7                                      Day of doubles 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Canadian Alexandre Despatie bagged his eighth career gold medal when he successfully defended his three-metre springboard diving title on Monday.         
	Despatie, who won the one-metre title on Sunday, later said: Right now, I am just feeling the day. I felt great this morning, took the afternoon off and didnt think about competition. Im healthy and it was good to see it pay off today (Monday).         
	In athletics, Kenyas Nancy Langat claimed a CWG double by winning the 1,500m race on Sunday. She had earlier won the 800mtitle. Langat crossed the line in 2:00.01 ahead of New Zealands Nikki Hamblin and Canadas Diane Cummins.         
	 In the 800m, it could have been a close finish had Langats teammate Winny Chebet not tripped 10m before the finish line. Chebet finished second.         
	The race was notable for the absence of South African world champion Caster Semenya, who skipped the Delhi Games owing to a back injury.         
	In another herculean effort, Ugandas Moses Kipsiro became the second man after New Zealands Cecil Matthews to win both the 5000 and 10,000m races. Matthews had created the record in 1938. On Monday, Kipsiro (24) clinched the 10,000m gold after winning the 5,000m race last Wednesday.         
	Kipsiro ran the last lap of the 10,000m final in a stunning 53.96 seconds. He clocked 27 minute and 57.39 seconds to leave behind Daniel Salel (27:57.57) and Joseph Birech (27:58.58) for silver and bronze respectively.         
	In rugby seven, Kenya shocked reigning World Series champions Samoa 12-10 to progress as Pool C winners. They will next face Australia in the quarter-finals.         
	South Africa, New Zealand and England also ended the day with wins in their respective pools and, therefore, qualified for Tuesdays quarters.

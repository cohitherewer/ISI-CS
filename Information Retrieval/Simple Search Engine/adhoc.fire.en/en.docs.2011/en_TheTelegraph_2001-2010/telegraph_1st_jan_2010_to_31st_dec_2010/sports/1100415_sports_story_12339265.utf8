The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils test in Chennai heat
                                                                                                                       7                                      DareDevils test in Chennai heat
                                  
	Chennai: On a high after a comprehensive nine-wicket victory over the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Chennai Super Kings would continue their quest for a semi-final berth when they take on the Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Thursday.         
	Both the teams have 12 points but the Super Kings better run rate has put them second behind the Mumbai Indians on the points table. A win Thursday would all but confirm their place in the semi-finals.         
	There have been ups and downs in these teams fortunes with emphatic wins punctuated by pathetic losses, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni amp; Co. would have the home advantage in hot and humid conditions.         
	While both were favourites to make the semi-finals, the DareDevils find themselves in a rather precarious position, having lost three successive matches.         
	The loss to bottom-placed Kings XI Punjab on home turf would have surely hurt the Delhi outfits morale, and they would be looking for a better show.         
	They were undone by a couple of run-outs in the match against the Kings XI, and would be hoping that the big-hitting David Warner, the usually reliable Paul Collingwood, Virender Sehwag and captain Gautam Gambhir score big against the Super Kings. If these batsmen perform in unison, the DareDevils can have the Super Kings on the mat.         
	The Super Kings are likely to play the same eleven who beat the Kolkata Knight Riders Tuesday.         
	Their batting is no less intimidating, but Australians Matthew Hayden, Mike Husey and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni have not lived up to the expectations so far.         
	However, they had the better of the Super Kings in the first meeting in IPL III, at the Kotla. The Super Kings boast of a better bowling attack than the DareDevils as their Aussie pacer Doug Bollinger is in fine form.         
	Though Mutthiah Muralidharan has been proving costly, Ravichandran Ashwin and Shadab Jakati have done well to support Bollinger.         
	The teams are evenly matched on paper, and it would boil down to who handles the heat and humidity better.           (PTI)

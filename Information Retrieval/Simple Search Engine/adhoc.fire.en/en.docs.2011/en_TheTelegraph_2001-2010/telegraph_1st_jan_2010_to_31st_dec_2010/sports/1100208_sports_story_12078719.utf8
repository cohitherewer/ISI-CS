The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Didnt feel need for   fifth bowler, says Kirsten
                                                                                                                       7                                      Didnt feel need for   fifth bowler, says Kirsten
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Nagpur: Though his bowlers didnt put up a great performance against the South Africans, Team India coach Gary Kirsten still feels that the team didnt miss a fifth bowler.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If there was a deliberate attempt to check the run rate         
	After they had got 291 for two on the first day, we needed to pick up wickets and keep their run rate under control as well. Since we were not getting wickets easily, we concentrated on the run rate. (Amit) Mishra bowled quite well, beat the bat frequently. But unfortunately didnt manage an edge.         
	The game plan ahead         
	A couple of the batsmen will have to play well to help put up a good score.         
	Harbhajan Singhs performance         
	All the bowlers bowled well. I thought Harbhajans rhythm was fantastic today. He was just a bit unlucky. Also (Jacques) Kallis and (Hashim) Amla batted really well One has got to acknowledge their effort.         
	If a fifth bowler should have been played         
	We have played the last 15-16 Tests without the fifth bowler. We have done well without the fifth bowler So I dont think its necessary.         
	On the wicket         
	The wicket has obviously taken more turn than yesterday But at no point of time did it appear to be out of control and it was evident from the way the South Africans batted.         
	How much will the team miss Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman while replying to the mammoth score         
	We will obviously be missing their experience. But at the same time, it will be an opportunity for Murali Vijay and S Badrinath to perform against one of the best sides in the world and prove their worth.         
	Whether there are any worries about the bouncers from the South African pacers         
	It depends on the situation and how we will deal with them. But the wicket has a really low bounce, so lets see         
	On Amlas performance         
	I always thought that he is a fine player.

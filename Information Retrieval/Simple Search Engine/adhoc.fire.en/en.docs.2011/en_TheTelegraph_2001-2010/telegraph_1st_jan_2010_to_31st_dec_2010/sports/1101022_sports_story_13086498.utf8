  - Lalit Modis counsel gets a breather to work out a compromise formula       OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT            Lalit Modi                                 
	New Delhi: The Supreme Court Thursday adjourned a hearing on a petition filed by former Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi, accusing its members of bias and demanding its reconstitution, after his counsel Ram Jethmalani sought time to work out a compromise with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on the composition of the panel.         
	Jethmalani said that he was in touch with BCCI president Shashank Manohar and was also talking to other members (of the Board) in a bid to sort it out. The top court permitted time to Jethmalani to use his good offices to get the BCCI to agree to a formula which would in some way allay Modis fears about bias and victimisation.         
	While adjourning the hearing till October 29, 2010, a two-judge bench offered two suggestions of its own by way of a settlement.         
	Justice Gyansudha Mishra suggested that a retired Supreme Court judge be associated with the disciplinary proceedings from this point of time, if not as an active member, then as an observer. This, however, seems unlikely to be accepted by the BCCI, though Modi seems eager to have an independent person in the panel.         
	In another suggestion, Justice J.M. Panchal said that another way out would be to keep out the members of the disciplinary committee out of the general body meeting which will decide on the action to be taken against Modi on the basis of the report.         
	As per the BCCI rule book, the report of the panel would go to the general body for a decision on the follow-up action to be taken against Modi.         
	Modi has accused the panel of being biased and prejudiced against him. He had earlier moved the High Court seeking a stay on the proceedings and a reconstitution of the panel. But the High Court had turned him away dismissing his pleas as mere apprehension.         
	He then appealed to the top court. The top court is seeking a way out of the impasse by way of an agreement between the BCCI and Modi on who should sit on the panel.         
	Modi, had earlier accused Manohar of bias, following which he had recused himself from the panel. Now the panel comprises Chirayu Amin, Arun Jaitley and Jyotiraditya Scindia. Worried by the fact that the trio were pressing on with the charges which Manohar had prima facie held him guilty of  taking kickbacks to award media broadcasting contracts of IPL  Modi has taken the legal recourse to have the team reconstituted with members who would consider the charges afresh.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Cant make up for lost time, rues Dalmiya
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Friday said that despite the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s decision to exonerate him, there is nothing that the board can do to make up for the four years he has lost.         
	Speaking at a media conference here, Dalmiya said: They finally accepted their mistake. Yes, I lost those four years. Nothing can be done about it. No one can do anything to make it better.         
	Talking about his new role at the BCCI, Dalmiya said: Cant say no to the BCCI. If the board needs me, I am ready to provide my service in whatever capacity.         
	Asked if he was looking at the BCCI presidents post in 2014, he said: That is too far in the future. No point saying anything now. I am happy that officials from the CAB are getting to be a part of the various BCCI committees and doing good work.         
	Dalmiya accepted that what transpired was more than just poetic justice. This is no victory, as I never had a fight. I was forced to go to the court.         
	The former ICC president, however, got cheeky when he said the boards decision to withdraw the case was better late than never.         
	I won the case. The question was whether I could only win through the court or also through the boards decision. The board respectfully asked me to return. So, I have no issues, Dalmiya said.

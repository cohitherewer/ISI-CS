The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A season of the surreal
                                                                                                                       7                                        A season of the surreal
            Henry Winter            Chelsea players celebrate after winning the English Premier League title                           
	So long, farewell, arrivederci and adieu to a loopy Premier League season of clamour without glamour, of noisy neighbours, administrators, snubbed handshakes and brawls in front of the Womens Institute. The Premier League may not be home to the best football, an honour belonging to La Liga of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but it is certainly home to the most excitement. The Spanish keep their beach balls on the beach.         
	The season lacked a star but not drama and there was enough barmy material to keep soap-opera scriptwriters in episodes for years. There was the manager as naughty-boy messiah, Arsene Wenger banished to the Old Trafford stand. There were unprintable chants against John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Sol Campbell, yet wonderful sportsmanship from supporters applauding injured opponents and powerful fans movements at Old Trafford and Anfield. Green and gold were new colours splashed across the Premier League abstract.         
	This was the season of Emmanuel Adebayors taunting run towards the Arsenal fans and Marouane Fellainis coiffeur, moments when the hair stood on end. Didier Drogba was again top of the strops, the Chelsea striker finishing the season with a show of petulance, the match ball, the prize for top marksman and a ticking off from his manager, Carlo Ancelotti, and teammate Frank Lampard. Even those in Golden Boots have feet of clay.         
	So this was the season without a big name up in lights. The selfless and impressive Wayne Rooney deservedly scooped all of the individual honours but hardly trailed Hollywood gold-dust like Ronaldo in previous seasons. Some individual goals were real gems, good enough to add glitter to any season, such as Maynor Figueroas long-ranger against Stoke City, Danny Roses volley against Arsenal and Adam Johnsons curler against Sunderland.         
	Yet in keeping with the collective theme, the most eye-catching goal was Chelseas four-man move against Bolton Wanderers, a masterclass of touch and vision from Nicolas Anelkas chip, via Decos chest, Lampards flick to Drogbas cool, placed finish.         
	In this observers Premier League team of the year, Joe Hart just pipped Heurelho Gomes in goal. Few right-backs excelled so Branislav Ivanovic was a shoo-in, while Ashley Cole just beat Patrice Evra to the left-back slot.         
	In a season when established centre-halves struggled, Michael Dawson was consistently good while Manchester City must surely regret losing Richard Dunne. Other contenders included Thomas Vermaelen, occasionally vulnerable in open play, and Ledley King, magnificent recently but absent for chunks of the season. Yet as frequent goal sprees indicated, some of the defending was abject and Wenger had little hesitation in turning to a 35 year-old, Sol Campbell, to help out.         
	In midfield, Lampard and James Milner shone while for all Florent Maloudas prominence and Gareth Bales elegant raiding, Steven Pienaars vibrant form merits saluting. A three-man attack combined Carlos Tevezs non-stop endeavour, Drogbas target-man qualities and Rooneys deftness. Darren Bent also impressed.         
	Encouraging for England in the long term was the strong form of Johnson, Jack Wilshere and Jack Rodwell, as well as that of Hart and Milner. As for English referees, most fans and certainly most managers have a horror story, but Mark Clattenburg matured into one of the very best  fit, unfussy and authoritative.         
	The blue touch paper was lit by those in claret and blue, Burnley launching a season of the surreal with Robbie Blake upsetting Manchester United at Turf Moor. Owen Coyle masterminded that triumph and this was also the year of the manager. Coyle, who moved on to rescue Bolton, enhanced his reputation, as did Alex McLeish, Mick McCarthy, Steve Bruce, Roy Hodgson and David Moyes among others.         
	In Manchester, Alex Ferguson deserved praise for pushing United to within a point of Chelsea, while Roberto Mancini brought some stability to City. Some of the management was overly cautious, and Mancini and Rafa Benitez overdid the holding midfielders at times, but others set up teams adventurously, notably Harry Redknapps midfield quartet at Eastlands. Not the first fab four to boast a Lennon, Redknapps selection demonstrated what can be achieved when a manager keeps his nerve and his faith in talent like Aaron Lennon, Tom Huddlestone, Luka Modric and Bale.         
	Redknapp was named Barclays Premier League Manager of the Year but I voted for Ancelotti, who has brought the title back to Stamford Bridge and composure back to the dugout. Chelseas manager loved his first season in the Premier League. I found a fantastic atmosphere, a very good championship  not only in terms of the quality of the teams but also for the stadiums, the atmosphere, the high tempo, said Ancelotti. Every game is interesting.         
	For all the thrills and spills in equal measure, never has a season been so awash with noises off the pitch. Even by modern footballs skewed moral compass it has been truly bonkers. Normally the news that the England captain had an affair would be accompanied by public tut-tutting and sympathy for the cheated wife. John Terrys fling with the former paramour of Wayne Bridge, his international teammate, changed the dynamic, a point made by an England fan when saying, Terry has brought a problem into the England dressing room. Whatever Terrys sins, he handled the astonishing abuse well, particularly on a torrid night at the KC Stadium.         
	Hull and Burnley followed Portsmouth into the Championship, while debt-ridden Portsmouth almost became the most famous sinking in the Solent since the Mary Rose in 1545. In footballs mad world of everyone being famous for 15 minutes or more, even administrator Andrew Andronikou had people chasing his autograph.         
	Portsmouth fans, like those of Hull and Burnley, will be much missed. At least the followers of West Brom and Newcastle United will maintain decibel levels.

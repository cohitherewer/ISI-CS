The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee is out with injury
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brett Lee is out with injury
                                
	Dharamsala: High on confidence after a hattrick of victories, title holders Deccan Chargers would be hoping to continue the winning momentum against party-poopers Kings XI Punjab here Friday to stay in the hunt for a semi-final spot.         
	The Kings XI were dealt a blow when speedster Brett Lee fractured the thumb of his right hand Thursday. He will miss the remaining matches. The Australian pacer suffered the injury during practice.         
	The Chargers made a remarkable comeback in the tournament with three consecutive victories after they were down and out at one stage with a string of defeats. They beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore twice apart from defeating the Chennai Super Kings in their last three outings to be back in reckoning, and now they have to win both their remaining matches to seal their last-four place.         
	Kings XI, on the other hand, have nothing to lose as they are already out of reckoning. With back-to-back wins against the Mumbai Indians and the Delhi DareDevils, the Mohali-based side have already spoilt the parties of a few teams.         
	With the likes of captain Adam Gilchrist, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Symonds, Rohit Sharma and Tirumalasetti Suman in their ranks, the Chargers strength lies in their batting. But the inconsistency of the batting line up, especially of the top-order, remains a matter of concern.         
	Gilchrist has shown occasional glimpses of his brilliance with the bat, while Gibbs has been far from impressive. Suman has chipped in with useful contributions whenever necessary, and the duo of Rohit and Symonds have come to the sides rescue on more than one occasion. But what Gilchrist would be looking for is a combined effort from his batters Friday.         
	The Chargers bowling, however, has improved with every passing game. Australian Ryan Harris has turned out to be a valuable addition to the pace attack which also has RP Singh. But what must be heartening for Gilchrist is the emergence of Harmeet Singh, who turned the match on its head in one over against the Royal Challengers the other day. In the spin department, Pragyan Ojha has been consistent.         
	With semi-final hopes dashed, the Kings XI would look to restore some pride with victories. (PTI)

    - Chance for youngsters to prove their mettle in final odi vs proteas             KUSHAN SARKAR            Sachin Tendulkar will be missed                                 
	Ahmedabad: Its not that Team India have not won recent matches without Sachin Tendulkar. However, after his epic 200 in the Gwalior ODI, the maestros absence in the final one-dayer of the Micromax Mobile Cup can turn out to be a factor as the home team aim to go for the kill at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera on Saturday.         
	Add to that the absence of Virender Sehwag and suddenly the Indian top-order bears a fragile look on the eve of the match.         
	Its not something new  India going into the final one-dayer with the series in their pocket. But in this part of the world, one hardly sees a lack of interest when the national team is playing.         
	But for Saturdays encounter there is a growing feeling that, without the presence of Sachin, the match is of little or no significance.         
	The ticket sales were brisk on Wednesday when Sachin hit a double hundred. (But) the moment it was announced that Sachin and Virender Sehwag arent playing, the sales figures suddenly dipped, lamented a senior Gujarat Cricket Association official.         
	There is no Sachin or Sehwag but Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his band of young bravehearts still have a lot to play for against a South African outfit that is yet to recover from the Sachin Effect.         
	It will be a good chance for the Murali Vijays and the Sudeep Tyagis to put their hands up and be counted in the absence of the established players.         
	It is not every day that a team gets an opportunity to humiliate a side like South Africa.         
	As coach Gary Kirsten aptly put it at the media conference: We know that some of the talented youngsters are not getting enough chances. But when one gets an opportunity, he has to make full use of it and consolidate his place in the squad.         
	For the first time in the series, it will be an Indian side which, with the exception of Dhoni (161 ODIs), Ashish Nehra (99 ODIs) and Suresh Raina (89 ODIs), will have as many as eight players with less than 50 ODIs under their belt.         
	In the absence of Sachin and Sehwag, the Tamil Nadu duo of Murali Vijay (all set to make his ODI debut) and Dinesh Karthik may open the innings. However, there is a chance that comeback man Rohit Sharma will face the new ball.         
	At the afternoon net session on Friday, Vijay and Rohit were the first ones to pad up. Karthik having scored a fine 79 in Gwalior, batting at No. 3, may retain last matchs batting position.         
	In the bowling department, Sudeep Tyagi is set to replace an injured Praveen Kumar. It is still not clear whether talented Karnataka speedster Abhimanyu Mithun will make the cut.         
	The Motera pitch, according to curator Dhiraj Parsana, will be good for batting although the dew has often been a big factor here.         
	For the record, the hosts have lost their last three ODIs at this venue, to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies respectively. India batted first on all three occasions. Interestingly, the last time India won an ODI here was back in 2002 against the West Indies. The team had batted second then.         
	The South Africans have only pride to play for. Jacques Kallis would definitely like to avoid the ignominy of a whitewash. The South Africans were dealt a blow when JP Duminy returned home with an injury he picked up in the Gwalior ODI. Loots Bosman looks a likely replacement. Pacers Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe could also get a look in.         
	As the Proteas make a last ditch effort to salvage some pride, the Indian fans would want pyrotechnics from skipper Dhoni to add a new sparkle to the festival of colours.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Dinesh Karthik, Murali Vijay, Rohit Sharma, M.S. Dhoni, Yusuf Pathan, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Ashish Nehra, Sudeep Tyagi, Sreesanth/Abhimanyu Mithun         
	South Africa (from): Herschelle Gibbs, Loots Bosman, Alviro Petersen, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha, Roelof van der Merwe, Dale Steyn, Wayne Parnell, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Morne Morkel, Charl Langeveldt         
	Umpires: Ian Gould (England) and Sanjay Hazare (India); TV: Shavir Tarapore;         
	Match Referee: Andy Pycroft         
	Match starts: 2.30pm

                                                                                                                       7                                        Wozniacki thrashes Chang
  - Clijsters and Venus cruise; Roddick ousted; Bhupathi-Mirnyi up             Vera Zvonareva after her victory in New York, on Thursday                           
	New York: Top-seeded Caroline Wozniacki defeated Chang Kai-chen of Taiwan 6-0, 6-0 to advance to the third round of the US Open, Thursday.         
	Wozniacki needed only 47 minutes in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday to achieve the double-bagel. The Dane won 52 points to only 24 for her opponent, and has lost only two games in her first two matches at Flushing Meadows.         
	Wimbledon runner-up Vera Zvonareva beat 94th-ranked Sabine Lisicki of Germany 6-1, 7-6 (5) .         
	The No. 7-seeded Zvonareva now has made it to the third round at Flushing Meadows in seven of her eight trips to the tournament. But the Russian never has made it to the US Open quarter finals.         
	Zvonareva is trying to follow up on her first Grand Slam final; she lost to Serena Williams at the All England Club in July.         
	Lisicki hasnt won consecutive matches in 2010. She missed five months with an injured left ankle.         
	The Russian seventh seed raced through the first set but world number 94 Lisicki served for the second before Zvonareva hit back to take it on the tiebreak.         
	Lisicki, playing only her fourth match since March because of an ankle injury, was outplayed in the first set as Zvonareva hit a series of winners on both wings.         
	The German found her form in the second set and served for it at 5-4 but Zvonareva broke back immediately and then pinched the tiebreak 7-5 to reach the last 32.         
	In other matches, Belgiums 15th seed, Yanina Wickmayer beat Julia Goerges 6-4, 7-5 while Frances 18th seed Aravane Rezai lost to US Beatrice Capra 5-7, 6-2, 3-6.         
	The 22nd seed, Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez lost to Swiss Patty Schnyder 6-7, 4-6.         
	In the mens side, Mardy Fish, the 19th seed from US, defeated Uruguays Pablo Cuevas 7-5, 6-0, 6-2. Albert Montanes, the 21st seed from Spain, beat Australias Carsten Ball 6-4, 6-3, 6-1.         
	Andy Murray sent an ominous warning to his US Open rivals when he breezed through his first match at Flushing Meadows on Wednesday before home hope Andy Roddick made an undignified exit in the last match of the day.         
	In the womens draw, former champions Kim Clijsters and Venus Williams dazzled their opponents and charmed the crowds.         
	Roddick was outplayed by unseeded Serb Janko Tipsarevic but his 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 defeat was reduced to a footnote after the ninth seeds churlish rant with a line judge over a footfault that had no bearing on the result.         
	In hindsight, did I let it go too far? Yeah, probably, Roddick later admitted.         
	Fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi overcame a late resistance from Arnaud Clement and Nicolas Mahut to advance to the second round of the mens doubles event.         
	Bhupathi, who was a finalist here last year, and his Belarussian partner beat the French pair 6-1, 6-4 in the opening round match.         
	Meanwhile, Rohan Bopanna and his Chinese partner Zi Yan bowed out of the mixed doubles event with a 2-6, 4-6 first round defeat against Americas Rajeev Ram and Aravane Rezai of France.         
	Andy Murray showed why he is regarded as a serious contender to capture the mens title as he crushed Slovakias Lukas Lacko 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.         
	The perennial hope of British tennis, Murray succeeded in escaping the worst of the roasting heat by racing to victory in under two hours.         
	I managed to get through in straight sets so Im pleased, but it was a lot tougher than the score suggests, the fourth-seeded Scot said.         
	Everyone in my (supporters) box always tell me its a lot tougher watching in the heat than playing but Im not so sure. It was brutal conditions.         
	Although the weather was slightly cooler than the previous day, it was still hot enough to leave players drenched in sweat and calling for ice packs to drape around their necks at the change of ends.         
	New Yorks hottest summer in decades has spilled on to the courts at Flushing Meadows and contributed to a high dropout rate among the seeds.         
	Another eight seeds made early exits on Day III, giving the main contenders extra incentive to quickly kill of their opponents.         
	Clijsters, who won the hearts of the crowds last year with her infant daughter watching from the stands, showed no mercy in her centre court clash against Australian qualifier Sally Peers, who once pinned a photo of the Belgian on her bedroom wall.         
	Im just trying every match to grow so Im ready when the opponents get tougher, Clijsters said after thumping her inexperienced opponent 6-2, 6-1 in less than an hour.         
	Williams had no room for sentiment either as she romped to a comfortable 7-6, 6-3 victory over Canadas Rebecca Marino, who gave the third seed a brief scare in the opening set before succumbing to the Americans power.         
	Williams is only playing singles this year after her sister and regular doubles partner Serena pulled out with an injury and said she was loving the lighter workload.         
	So far I feel good. I made a quick turnaround this summer to try to get ready for the Open, she said.         
	Im glad that Im just in the singles. That way I have the opportunity to recover between rounds and to get ready to play the next one.         
	Venus has not won the US Open title since 2001 but she now represents the host nations best hope of a champion after Roddick, the highest-ranked American male, bowed out.         
	With his wife Brooklyn Decker watching, Roddick managed to turn parts of the pro-American crowd against him when he persisted in remonstrating with the official, evoking memories of Serena Williams foul-mouthed attack on a lineswoman last year.         
	What is this, call 1-800-RENT-A-REF, Roddick screamed at the woman.         
	Television replays later showed she was correct in calling the fault. Her only error was that she told Roddick it was his right foot, rather than his left foot, that he dragged across the service line.         
	Italys French Open champion Francesca Schiavone and Australias Samantha Stosur, the woman she beat in the Paris final, both advanced to the third round in straight sets while the other most notable casualty in the mens draw was Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych. The Czech stumbled at the first hurdle, outclassed 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 by Frances Michael Llodra, who is better known as a doubles specialist.         
	I dont know whether I played well or not today, Berdych said. I need to sit down with my coach who saw the match from the stands.           (AGENCIES)

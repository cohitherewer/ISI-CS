	New Delhi: Sunil Valson, a member of the 1983 World Cup winning squad, has been removed from the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) reportedly at the behest of the tournament commissioner Lalit Modi.         
	According to sources, the accreditation of Valson, a member of the Delhi DareDevils team management for the past three years, was cancelled last Wednesday after the former medium pacer had an altercation with the IPL chief executive Sundar Raman.         
	While neither Valson nor Raman was available for comment, an eyewitness to the incident said Valson was at the receiving end of Ramans fury after the former player failed to satisfy the IPLs bosss demand for some VIP parking passes.         
	Raman immediately complained to Modi, who called up the DareDevils management and asked them to remove Valson from the tournament duty, sources said.

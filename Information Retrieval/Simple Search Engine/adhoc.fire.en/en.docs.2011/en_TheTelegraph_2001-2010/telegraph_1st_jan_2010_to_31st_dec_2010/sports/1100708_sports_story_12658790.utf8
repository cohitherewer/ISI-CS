            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has made a profit of Rs 12.51 crore in 2009-10, according to the annual accounts report which was passed at the working committee meeting, on Wednesday.         
	The association made a profit of Rs 14.86 crore in 2008-09.         
	Unlike last year, when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) disbursed Rs 26 crore, the CAB received Rs 18 crore only from the parent body during this season.         
	The BCCI gave an additional Rs 8 crore as IPL-II was shifted to South Africa. So, it will not be right to say that our profit margin has dropped, treasurer Subir Ganguly pointed out.         
	The association has also decided to keep aside Rs 1.5 crore as a fixed deposit and the annual interest earned will be distributed equally among the 121 affiliated units. The annual report of the association was also passed on the day.         
	Meanwhile, the renovation of the Dr.B.C. Roy Club House will be starting later this month. A separate media enclosure will be constructed on the lower tier of the Club House. This will be ready by October 15.         
	The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is slated for July 28, while the Annual Awards Function will be held on July 24. Joy Raut of Cooch Behar was adjudged the Best District Cricketer for the 2009-10 season.

                                  A crestfallen Saina Nehwal, on Friday		    
	Paris: Saina Nehwal suffered a straight-game defeat at the hands of sixth-seeded Chinese Shixian Wang in the womens singles quarter finals to crash out of the World Badminton Championship, here on Friday.         
	World No. 2 Saina lost 8-21, 14-21 to Wang in a 34-minute encounter in to draw curtains on Indias challenge in the high-profile tournament.         
	The second-seeded Indian, tipped to be one of the hot favourites to win the title, was not at her best and lagged behind right from the start as the Chinese opened up a 3-0 lead in the first game.         
	Though Saina caught up with her opponent at 6-6, Wang pocketed eight straight points to surge ahead and held her fort as the Indians game crumbled.         
	The second game was no better as the Chinese opened up a 3-0 lead and the distance kept growing.         
	I was trying to be more quick around the net but somehow my movement was very, very slow and I was feeling too tired, said Saina.         
	The World Championship hopes of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta also went up in smoke, as the mixed doubles duo suffered a straight-game defeat to South Koreas Sung Hyun Ko and Jung Eun in the quarter finals.         
	The ninth-seeded Indians lost 16-21, 19-21 to the Koreans, seeded 12th, in a 31-minute battle to end Indias hopes in the mixed doubles category.         
	It was apparent mid-way through the first game when Diju clutched his lower back, that movement at the back-court was getting painful for him.         
	Still, he managed to earn points but the errors piled on. Jwala did her bit at the net and once in a while played at the back, but couldnt stem the aggression of the South Korean pair who used the smash and mid court placements to telling effect.         
	It was a struggle, said Jwala. We knew we were in a strong position having beaten the same team before but with Diju struggling it was difficult to maintain a set momentum, he said.         
	The Koreans managed to lead in the first game by at least two points and then capitalising on the errors by the Indians closed out the game 21-16 to lead the match 1-0.         
	The Indians did come back strongly in the second game. Leading 2-0 initially, they moved to 5-4 before Dijus sore back restricted him from leaping and smashing even when there were openings.         
	He started using the drop shot from the back court. The Koreans, sensing that he was unable to move, used the high toss to rattle off a few crucial points and take the lead 6-5.         
	But Gutta and Diju fought back to seize the initiative and led 11-10 at the second game break. Korea, however, equalised at 12-12 and then led 15-12 with a series of powerful smashes.         
	With some deft placements at the net, Jwala earned crucial points to draw parity at 16-16. But the back court was a problem with India as Diju was finding it difficult to bend and pick up the baseline corner smashes.         
	The duo still managed to fight and equalise the scores at 19-19 as the crowd started supporting them. However, two errors at the net and a shot across the sideline ended their hope of a semi-final berth.         
	We knew we were the better team and it is very difficult to come to terms with this loss, said Jwala. Right after the match, Diju had to be rushed to the massage centre and I hope his back gets okay fast.         
	Speaking on the teams future plans, Jwala said, Our aim is to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics and to do well there. We were very sure of a semi-final here but thats the way sport is.         
	Meanwhile, the top two seeds in the mens singles crashed out at Paris.         
	Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia knocked out top-seeded Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia 21-15, 11-21, 21-12 while defending champion, Chinas Lin Dan, was upset by South Koreas Park Sung Hwan 13-21, 13-21.         
	Hidayat, the 2004 Olympic champion will take on Hwan in the semis. Lay years runner-up Chen Jin of China rallied past the unseeded Hsueh Hsuan Yi of Taiwan 22-24, 21-5, 21-13.         
	In the womens singles, Tine Baun of Denmark defeated Cheng Shao-Chieh of Taiwan 21-18, 21-13 to move into the last four.         
	Baun, the reigning European champion, stretched her winning streak to 17 matches and will next face former world No. 1 Lin Wang of China, who defeated Eriko Hirose of Japan 21-16, 21-17.

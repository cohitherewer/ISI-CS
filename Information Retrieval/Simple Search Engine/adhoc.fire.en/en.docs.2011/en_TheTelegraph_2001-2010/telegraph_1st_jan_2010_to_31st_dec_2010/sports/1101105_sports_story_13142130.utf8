The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We failed to execute our plans: Ryder
                                                                                                                       7                                        We failed to execute our plans: Ryder
            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Jesse Ryder                      
	Ahmedabad: Jesse Ryder may have been lucky to snare Gautam Gambhir in his first over in a Test in India, but his team collectively failed to pull the brakes against a rampaging Virender Sehwag in the first Test here on Thursday.         
	The Indian opener tore apart the New Zealand bowling attack almost securing a 400-plus total for the hosts on the opening day.         
	Though some clever bowling and tired legs forced India to be content with 329 runs on the board, Ryder feels the Black Caps must tune up their bowling to prevent the score from spiralling further.         
	I tried to bowl full and straight, that was my plan. We knew Sehwag would be coming at us.         
	We somehow let him get away. Hopefully, when we go out tomorrow well stick to our plans, Ryder said.         
	Clearly, New Zealand looked unimaginative in their bowling and almost everyone went on a leather hunt.         
	While debutant Hamish Bennett showed some promise with his speed and bounce, Kane Williamson, who too won his Test cap on Thursday, took a hitting.         
	Ryder conceded they failed to stick to their plan against Sehwag and that hit the team badly.         
	Our plan was to tuck him up a little bit. But we failed to execute it properly. We bowled too wide and let him get away, he said.         
	As if a poor day with the ball was not enough, the visitors spilled three catches, all of the dangerman, Sehwag. It has been a long day on the field and catches are always vital. Its disappointing to have dropped him so many times, Ryder said.         
	The all-rounder didnt sound much excited about the Motera wicket as there was no assistance for the bowlers on the first day. The pitch is pretty flat. The odd balls kept low. They (India) were probably close to scoring 400 runs on the first day. But the late wickets helped us restrict them to 300, Ryder said.

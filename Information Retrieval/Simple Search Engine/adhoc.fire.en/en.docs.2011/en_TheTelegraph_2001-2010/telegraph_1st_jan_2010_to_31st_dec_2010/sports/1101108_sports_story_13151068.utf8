	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly mourned the demise of Siddhartha Shankar Ray and said that he would never forget the former chief ministers speech, which he made after the former India captains retirement from international cricket.         
	I am extremely saddened to hear about the demise of Shri Siddhartha Shankar Ray. He has not only been the ex-chief minister of Bengal and a renowned lawyer, but also someone who has been actively involved in sports, Sourav said.         
	Throughout my cricketing career I have had regular interaction and meetings with the man. He was a pillar of strength and constant source of encouragement during one of my difficult times.         
	His speech after my retirement will remain in my heart for a long, long time. I pray that his soul rests in peace and convey my love and affection to his wife and the family, Sourav added.  
	In 2004, Ray was Souravs counsel and successfully defended him against Match Referee Clive Lloyds two-Test ban on the then India captain.         
	Ray was also a former president of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and his body was brought to the associations premises on Sunday.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya, the CAB president, along with other office-bearers paid their last respects to the man who had a keen interest in cricket.         
	The Bengal cricketers, who were practising at the Eden, also paid their homage to Ray.         
	It is obviously a big loss for us He was our friend and always helped us whenever we were in a legal tangle. His valuable advice helped us on many occasions, said Dalmiya.         
	The CAB will hold a condolence meeting on November 14, at the Eden, and the offices will remain closed till Tuesday as a mark of respect.

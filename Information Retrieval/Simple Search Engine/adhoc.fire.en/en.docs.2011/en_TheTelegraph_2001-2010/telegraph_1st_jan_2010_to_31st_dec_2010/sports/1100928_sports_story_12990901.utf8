The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Practice perfect for Australia
                                                                                                                       7                                        Practice perfect for Australia
                  Ajinkya Rahane in Chandigarh, on Monday                     
	Chandigarh: Shane Watson and Ajinkya Rahane struck brilliant centuries while speedster Ben Hilfenhaus earned a five-wicket haul as the three-day warm-up game between Australia and the Board Presidents XI ended in a draw, at the Sector 16 cricket stadium, here on Monday.         
	Chasing a virtually unachievable target of 516 runs in 40 odd overs, the Indian side made 174 without loss, a much better performance after their first innings batting collapse.         
	While opener Shikhar Dhawan (5) retired hurt after a rising delivery by Hilfenhaus hit him close to his ear, the 22-year-old Rahane reached his century in just 103 balls. The openers unbeaten knock of 113 was studded with 18 boundaries and a six.         
	Saurashtra batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, who has been included in the Test squad, batted with patience in the second innings and consumed 102 balls for his 52 that included nine hits to the fence.         
	Batting first, Australia made 505 in their first innings, mainly due to the brilliant hundreds by openers Watson (115) and Simon Katich (104) followed by a dazzling knock by Marcus North (124).         
	Resuming at 143 for six, the Board Presidents XI could only add 34 runs before being bowled out for 177, giving the Aussies a huge 328-run first innings lead.         
	However, Australia did not enforce the follow-on and decided to bat again in their second innings.         
	Australia suffered an early jolt in their second innings, when Ricky Ponting, opening the innings to spend some time in the middle, mistimed a pull shot off Jaidev Unadkat to Umesh Yadav at square-leg.         
	Ponting, who made 42 in the first innings, would have liked more runs under his belt considering three of his teammates struck centuries in the first innings.         
	Piyush Chawla bowled well and earned three scalps in the second innings castling Tim Paine (0), Steve Smith (19) and having Mitchell Johnson (5) lob a catch to Rahane as they declared their second innings at 187 for six.

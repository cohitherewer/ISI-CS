  - Former Windies captain feels Indians are not accustomed to steep bounce               Vivian Richards                           
	New Delhi: The legendary Vivian Richards has offered to work as Indias batting consultant, saying he can help the batsmen sort out their perennial weakness against short-pitch bowling.         
	I could be a good consultant where batsmanship is concerned and especially where you have such aggressive fast bowling, I can be a little help at some point to teams, said the Caribbean great, considered one of the most aggressive batsmen the game has ever seen.         
	Im available, maybe they (India) will call me sometime to know how to handle such aggression, the former West Indies captain told a television channel.         
	For the second successive time in the World Twenty20, Indian batsmens technical frailties against short-pitched stuff were thoroughly exposed and the side crashed out of the event without winning a single Super Eight match.         
	Both Australian and English bowlers exploited this particular chink in Indias armour and Richards felt all Dhoni and his teammates needed some thorough practice against short-pitched bowling.         
	The Australians did put the wind up India that particular day. I dont think the Indian batsmen are accustomed to steep bounce. When the ball is bouncing that high, it needs some courage to tackle, Richards said.         
	What India can learn from the past is to get some practice against the real aggressive stuff, said the West Indian.         
	Richards did not subscribe to the view that Indian Premier League (IPL) was to be blamed for the teams dismal show in the Caribbeans.         
	India came into the tournament with the most T20 matches, taking in the IPL factor. I dont think its an excuse in any way. I was in South Africa in 2007 where they won the first T20 tournament and they played magnificently, Richards said.         
	Sometimes the ball is in your court sometimes its not. What I think Indias got to do at this stage is to see the way the Australians bowled at them and hopefully try and come to grips with the bounce and make the necessary adjustments, he added.

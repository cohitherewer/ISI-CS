The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I also got threats in domestic cricket
                                                                                                                       7                                      I also got threats in domestic cricket
                      
	Karachi: Zulqarnain Haider, who quit international cricket over death threats for refusing to co-operate with match-fixers, claimed that he also received similar threats while playing domestic cricket.         
	In an interview to a Pakistan tv channel, Haider said he had received threats to include certain players in his team in domestic matches.         
	Yes I have got threats that I should play so and so player or not play that player and over matches, he said.         
	Interestingly, Haider was removed as the captain of the Lahore Eagles team in March last year just before a match against National Bank in a domestic one-day tournament that later became a talking point in the cricket community.         
	Apparently, Haider, who had led the Lahore team in the national one-day competition until that match, refused to be part of a conspiracy to fix the game as National Bank, one of the strongest and most influential teams on the domestic circuit, needed to win it and improve their run-rate to qualify for the final.         
	What transpired in the match was highly debatable as the Lahore team first scored 122 in 40.3 overs, with Haider getting out for a duck and then National Bank responded with 123 for no loss in only 6.1 overs.         
	Salman Butt, who is currently suspended by the ICC for his alleged role in the spot-fixing scandal in England in August, scored 92 from just 25 balls hitting an amazing 16 fours and four sixes at the LCCA ground.         
	The talking point was that Lahore fielded a pacer Usman Sarwar, who conceded 78 runs in three overs, and that match remains his only game for Lahore till date.         
	After the match it transpired that Haider was forcibly removed as captain by officials because he refused to go according to the script and field rookie Sarwar.         
	Although questions were raised , the PCB later said it had found no evidence of foul play..         
	Meanwhile, uncapped wicketkeeper-batsman Adnan Akmal will replace Haider in the Pakistan squad for the two Tests against South Africa in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The PCB named Adnan, younger brother of Kamran and Umar Akmal, as Haiders replacement while Mohammed Hafeez will take the place of leg spinner Danish Kaneria.           (PTI)

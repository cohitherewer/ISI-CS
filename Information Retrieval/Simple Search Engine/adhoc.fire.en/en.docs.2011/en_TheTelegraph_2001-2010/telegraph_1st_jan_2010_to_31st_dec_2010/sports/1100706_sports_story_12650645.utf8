	Birmingham: Umar Akmal smashed 64 off 31 balls as Pakistan made 167 for eight in a Twenty20 International match against Australia in Birmingham on Monday. Akmal, who hit seven fours and three sixes in his knock, rescued an innings that looked to be faltering when captain Shahid Afridi was trapped leg before by Steven Smith for a duck, leaving Pakistan reeling on 47 for four midway through the eighth over.         
	Kamran Akmal scored 23 and Shoaib Malik chipped in with 21 as Australia took wickets at regular intervals. Pacers Shaun Tait (two for 25) and Dirk Nannes (two for 41) bowled well for Australia.         
	Pakistans tour of Australia last winter was dogged by dressing-room unrest, as the visitors were whitewashed in the Test and ODI series.         
	Looking to make amends, Pakistan got off to the worst possible start when opener Shahzaib Hasan (0) went for a golden duck on the fourth delivery of the innings, David Hussey taking a catch off the bowling of Nannes.         
	Salman Butt (13) and Kamran Akmal led a mini-recovery with a second-wicket stand of 43 before the latter was run out when he went for a quick single but was sent back by his partner. Butt was out of the very next delivery, when he hoicked Hussey to David Warner at deep midwicket.

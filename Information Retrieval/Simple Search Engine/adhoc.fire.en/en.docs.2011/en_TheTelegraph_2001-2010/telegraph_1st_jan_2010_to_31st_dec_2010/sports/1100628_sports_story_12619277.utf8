The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bielsa: I am not a hero
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bielsa: I am not a hero
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Though there is every possibility that Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa may end up on the losing side after Mondays match against Brazil, he would still be regarded as one of the heroes of the 2010 World Cup for his bold approach to the game.         
	Unlike Dunga, his Brazilian counterpart, who loves to play it safe on the pitch, Bielsa is one of the few coaches in modern football who still believes that attack is the best form of defence in football.         
	In Chile, the Argentine coach is considered a superhero for his efforts to take the team to the final rounds. Two days ago, thousands of people came down to the streets of Santiago to celebrate through the night when Chile reached the round of 16 after losing narrowly to Spain. Chile won their first two matches against Switzerland and Honduras.         
	The superhero tag is not right, said Bielsa, who is nicknamed madman in the football circle.         
	I have been involved, collaborated and integrated in a football project that has reached the World Cup and trying to move further, said Bielsa, a reclusive man by nature.         
	Bielsa, who coached Argentina in the 2002 World Cup before being shown the door, has reformed Chile into a fighting unit. Chile were a team who lacked an identity and one would generally find them engaged in efforts of imitating the styles of other more successful Latin American teams like Brazil and Argentina.         
	Under Bielsa, they crossed the qualification hurdle in the World Cup and established themselves as a strong side. One interprets the achievements and not the results. He who wins, wins and he who loses, loses, added Bielsa, who coached Argentina to the Olympic gold in 2004.         
	Contrary to Bielsas style of play, Dungas Brazil had clearly dropped the approach of playing aggressive football. Dunga is not ready to accept that his team has been playing unattractive game. He made it clear that his preference is to win the sixth title and not necessarily to play football that is pleasing to the eyes.         
	I am not interested in any debate, Dunga said. What is important is the technique of a team. We couldnt show that against Portugal. We always play to win. We always try to create openings, said Dunga.         
	However, Bielsas free flowing style of play has one drawback  the team has come under fire for their too much physical approach, one that will force them to miss at least three key players, due to bookings, in defence and midfield against Brazil.         
	Perhaps we were over-physical, admitted the 55-year-old Bielsa.         
	We dont have bad intentions towards our opponents. Once we lose the ball, we try to get it back as quickly as we can and sometimes this can happen. People say we use excessive force but I dont think that is right, the coach said.         
	Surprisingly, despite so much difference in their style of play, Bielsa is not ready to accept that Dungas team is less dangerous than the Brazil teams in previous World Cups.         
	I feel what Brazil are doing is right. They have retained all the creative aspects of the game and have added aggression and forcefulness. We will do the impossible to ensure that things dont come to an end for us so soon, he promised.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Somdev banking on home support
                  Somdev                     
	New Delhi: Indias top singles player Somdev Dev Varman and non-playing captain SP Misra are hoping to exploit the home conditions to re-enter the David Cup World Group when they host Brazil in the play-off tie in September.         
	India have played a lot of away-ties in the Davis Cup in the recent past and the last time the team played at home was in April 2008, when they defeated Japan.         
	With the ascendancy of Somdev, victories came over Chinese Taipei and South Africa in their own den, last year. And now that India will play at home in favourable conditions, both Somdev and Misra seemed excited.         
	Im really excited about playing Brazil. I think theyre a very good team but we have a big advantage playing at home, Somdev said.         
	Misra added: This is what I was looking forward to. This home advantage is crucial. Its been a long time that we have played at home. Luckily we have got for a World Group play-off tie.         
	Brazil are known to be a formidable outfit on clay courts, so India are expected to host them on hard courts.         
	But in spite of home advantage, Somdev expects a tough fight in the encounter. I think Brazils a very good team. They have very good doubles players. Thomas Bellucci has been having a great year and they have other guys who are playing really well too, he said.         
	Misra said he would urge All India Tennis Association (AITA) to host the tie on hard courts. They are clay court experts, so we should have home advantage but they are a difficult lot. Somdev prefers playing on hard courts and its AITA who has to decide the surface. I will let them know the players preferences, he said.

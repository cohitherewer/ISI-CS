The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tait, Nannes shine in win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tait, Nannes shine in win
                      
	Hobart: Pacers Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes took three wickets each as Australia outclassed West Indies by 38 runs in the first Twenty20 International here on Sunday.         
	According to Cricinfo, Australia put up 179 for eight in their stipulated 20 overs before restricting Chris Gayles men to 141 for eight in 20 overs.         
	For Australia, David Warner provided the early thrills with a brutal batting display before the Man of the Match Tait destroyed West Indies top order as Australias plans for the ICC World Twenty20 took a step in the right direction.         
	Warner and Shane Watson lit up Bellerive Oval, which was hosting its first night international, by taking Australia to 83 without loss in the eighth over and some late fireworks from Brad Haddin pushed them to the final score.         
	It was a good but gettable total, until two wickets in Taits first over knocked the life out of the chase.         
	Chris Gayle has failed to spark during the limited-overs portion of the summer and that trend continued when he swung wildly at Taits fourth delivery and saw his stumps rearranged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne helped me join IPL: Martyn
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne helped me join IPL: Martyn
                      
	Melbourne: Retired batsman Damien Martyn, one of the two Australian players sold at Tuesdays IPL auction, said it was his ex-teammate and the Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne who guided him in sending his entry for the auction.         
	The 38-year-old Martyn, who quit international cricket in 2006, was bought by the Rajasthan outfit for $100,000 (Rs 4.55 million), giving a major boost to his seemingly finished cricket career.         
	Another Australian, who found a place in the cash-rich tournament was one-day specialist Adam Voges, who was also picked by the Rajasthan team for $50,000.         
	Martyn said that he met Warne recently in Australia and asked about his prospects in the IPL.         
	We had a chat about the pros and cons and he put me on to certain people including (IPL commissioner) Lalit Modi. I said I had to get my paperwork in order and Warnie said he might be interested, depending on which other players were available, Martyn told an Australian paper.         
	That paperwork included signing out of the rebel Indian Cricket League, where Martyn had led the Ahmedabad Rockets.         
	The right-hand batsman had attended Australias national cricket academy with Warne 20 years ago and they have been firm friends ever since.         
	Other Australian players like Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger and Phil Hughes went unsold in the auction due to uncertainty over their availability for the whole tournament, which clashes with Australias tour of New Zealand.

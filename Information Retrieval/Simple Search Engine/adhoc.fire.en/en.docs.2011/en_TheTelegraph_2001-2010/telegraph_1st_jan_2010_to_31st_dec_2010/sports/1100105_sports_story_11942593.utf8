                                                                                                                       7                                      Prakash in main draw; Yuki ousted
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Moments after sealing a spot in the main draw of the Chennai Open, Prakash Amritraj said he was still trying to find a way to represent India in the Davis Cup.         
	Watched by his father, the legendary Vijay Amritraj, the US-born right-hander became the third Indian to make the main draw this year when he got the better of Lars Poerschke of Germany, winning 7-6(7-5), 6-3 in the final qualifying round on Monday.         
	Somdev Dev Varman and Rohan Bopanna have already received wild cards for the main draw.         
	The other Indian aspirant, Yuki Bhambri, however, wasnt as lucky and failed to make the main round when he went down 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 to Irelands Louk Sorensen after raising hopes in the second set.         
	Adding to the junior Australian Open champions woes was an ankle he twisted during play in the second set and Yuki looked in discomfort in the decider.         
	Prakash, on the other hand, was a picture of confidence after his victory over the German opponent. Buoyed by the support he had in the stands, Prakash said: Playing for India is something that I am still looking forward to.         
	A regular Davis Cupper for India till a year back, Prakash found himself ineligible to represent the country following a government ruling that only players holding Indian passports could be selected to the national teams.         
	I am trying my best to get the issue sorted out. The thing is, I am able to access some of the best training facilities with my US passport. If I gave that up, I may not get access to those facilities, said Prakash who plays under the Tricolour in professional events.         
	With the 2010 calendar comprising prestigious events like the Commonwealth Games, to be held in Delhi, and the Asian Games, Prakash would like to don the Indian colours but finds himself in a quandary.         
	Asked what efforts he was making to obtain an Indian passport, Prakash said: I am trying to find out how I can get an Indian passport and still have access to facilities in the US. Its a bit tricky as it involves a lot of things.

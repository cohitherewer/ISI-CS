                                                                                                                       7                                      Modric hits back at Cattermole 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	London: Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric has accused Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole of putting his career in jeopardy.         
	Modric claims Cattermoles studs-first tackle in Tuesday nights 1-1 Premier League draw at White Hart Lane could easily have broken his leg.         
	Midfielder Cattermole was shown a yellow card for the 69th-minute incident, which sparked a brief melee between opposing players.         
	Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp was adamant Cattermole should have been sent off for the third time this season, while opposite number Steve Bruce was equally convinced the challenge was fair.         
	Modric, who stayed down for some time following the tackle, left no doubt where he stood, saying: Players who tackle like that need to think before making a tackle because they can ruin careers of friends and professionals. They just need to think about it.         
	He should have been sent off. I cant show you now but there is a big swelling on my knee and he should have got a red card but the referee decided differently.         
	When you see tackles like that, it is a little upsetting, and if they are not punished properly then even more so.         
	For now, it is a little bit sore but I hope it will settle down. I jumped and if I stayed with my legs on the floor it would have been even worse, but I got out of the way at the last second.         
	Maybe if I stayed on the floor I would have broken my leg but I jumped and that has probably saved me.         
	Rafael Van der vaarts 64th minute goal went in vain as Tottenham Hotspur were held by Sunderland through a Asamoah Gyan equaliser in the 67th minute, on Tuesday.         
	In the second Premier League match on Tuesday, Stoke City beat Birmingham 3-2. Robert Huth gave Stoke City a start with his 44th minute goal. Ricardo Fuller followed it up with his 71st minute strike. For Birmingham, Keith Fahey (74th) and Cameron Jerome (76th) scored to bring the score to 2-2. Dean Whitehead hit the conclusive goal in the 85th minute to register a win home.

	New Delhi: Brian Lara has clarified that he is not sure about featuring in the next edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) saying he needed to be at the top of his game to compete with the best in business.         
	IPL supremo Lalit Modi recently revealed on his Twitter page that the West Indian batting great was keen to play in season No.4.         
	I dont know if I can (play next year). It has been a long time since I have played competitive cricket.         
	The standard of cricket being played in the IPL is pretty high, so I need to be on the top of my game before I think of joining, Lara was quoted as saying on the IPL website. So, for now, I am happy watching it.

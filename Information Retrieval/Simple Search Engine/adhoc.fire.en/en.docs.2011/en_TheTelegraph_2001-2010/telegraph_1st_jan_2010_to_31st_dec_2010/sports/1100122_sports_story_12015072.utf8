The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir curses himself if he is out cheaply, says Sehwag
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gambhir curses himself if he is out cheaply, says Sehwag
            A CORRESPONDENT     
	Virender Sehwag had raised a storm on the eve of the first Test against Bangladesh saying the opponents were an ordinary side. Speaking at a media conference after his sides 113-run victory on Thursday, the stand-in India captain didnt reveal whether he still held the same opinion, but said that he still believed that Bangladesh cannot take 20 wickets.         
	He also lauded Gautam Gambhir for providing the team with an excellent start and said that his hunger, after he was dropped from the team, helped him in his comeback and hit five consecutive centuries.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Indias showing         
	Its good to start the year with a win... Hum log jeet ke khatam bhi karenge... Its important to keep winning... Main kafi khush hoon.         
	If the team panicked after the first innings collapse         
	It happens... Just recently, Australia scored 127 in the first innings (Sydney), but still won against Pakistan.         
	Gambhirs brilliant form         
	Its important for us to get a good start. The Kookaburra ball always does something during the initial overs. I just told him that if we saw off the first 15 overs, it would help us a lot. I think he was hurt when he was dropped from the team. Then he made a comeback and hit five consecutive hundreds. He is a kind of player who curses himself when he is out cheaply.         
	On Ishant Sharmas performance         
	Ishant played really well. He bowled well one-change in this Test match Its good for him and good for Indian cricket.         
	On Bangladesh         
	They didnt bat well. They bowled well in the first innings because the conditions helped them. We batted well in the second innings.         
	His ordinary side comment on the eve of the match         
	Next question.         
	The Bangladesh bowlers         
	They still didnt get 20 wickets.         
	If he had deliberately declared (in the second innings) to deny Bangladesh the 20 wickets         
	I had to declare I wanted to win the game (smiles). I still believe that Bangladesh cannot take 20 wickets.         
	On Mushfiqur Rahims hundred         
	He batted well.

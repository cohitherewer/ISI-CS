The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We played poorly, admits Shabbir
                                                                                                                       7                                      We played poorly, admits Shabbir
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shabbir Ali, on Friday, was candid enough to admit that Bengal were abysmally bad against Delhi.         
	We played a poor game. Very poor. We didnt have any plan. But, compared to the first half we played a better game in the second. We created a lot of chances but just forgot how to put the ball in, he said.         
	Talking about youngster Robin Singh, who made his Santosh Trophy debut on the day, Shabbir said he would take some time to settle down. When I came to Calcutta first time, I too did not become Shabbir Ali overnight. So, give this youngster some time. He will deliver.         
	Shabbir felt the lack of competitive matches was the main reason. They are out of competitive matches for the last one and a half matches. I am sure they will bounce back, he said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Statistical highlights 
                      
	Sachin Tendulkar (214) registered his sixth double hundred of his Test career, on Tuesday. He now has three at home and three away.         
	 Sachin, who was dismissed by debutant Peter George, became a bowlers maiden wicket for the 10th time in his career.         
	 Sachin became the 13th double centurion to end up as the maiden wicket for a bowler.         
	 Sachin now aggregates 350 runs in this series. The most he has aggregated in a two-Test series is 362 against Zimbabwe in India in 2000-01. With one innings still to go in this Test, Sac-hin will be looking to better that. For the record, the most runs in a two-Test series by an Indian is by Rahul Dravid who scored 432 against Zimbabwe, in India, in 2000-01. Tendulkar now needs another 82 to better that!         
	 However, Sachins 350 runs is now the most scored by any player in a two-Test series against Australia. The previous best was by Aravinda deSilva who had scored 314 runs, in Australia, in 1989-90.           MOHANDAS MENON

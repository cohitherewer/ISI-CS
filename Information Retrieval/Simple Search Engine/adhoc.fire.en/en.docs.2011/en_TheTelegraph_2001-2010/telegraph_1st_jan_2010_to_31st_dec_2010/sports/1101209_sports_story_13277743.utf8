	New Delhi: Delhi bowlers stuck to a disciplined line to bowl out Railways for 259 on the first day of the sixth round Ranji Trophy Super League Group A encounter, being played at the Roshanara ground.         
	At stumps, stand-in captain Shikhar Dhawan and his opening partner Unmukt Chand knocked off 48 runs in only eight overs.         
	Shikhar has been entrusted with the duty of leading the side after regular captain Mithun Manhas had to pull out with a groin injury. Even Delhis best bowler Pawan Suyal was ruled out due to a knee injury.         
	Dhawan rightly opted to field on a seaming Roshanara track where barring veteran opener Shreyas Khanolkar (102, 187 balls, 19x4), there was distinct lack of application from the other Railways batsmen.         
	It was young Kapil Yadav who got Delhi the first breakthrough when opener Faiz Fazal (6) was caught by Aditya Jain.         
	Kapil bowled at a brisk pace occasionally getting the ball to rise from short of good length. However, there was some bad news at the end of the day as Kapil was taken for an X-ray after he sustained a side strain.         
	However, the first days play in Tamil Nadu vs Mumbai match was called off due to rain.

	New Delhi: The stage is set for SAI to remove Jose Brasa as the chief hockey coach in November.         
	According to sources, being constantly under attack from the Spanish coach, the SAI has run out of patience and has decided to show the coach the door once the national team returns from the Asian Games.         
	Brasa has become a liability, a senior SAI official said.

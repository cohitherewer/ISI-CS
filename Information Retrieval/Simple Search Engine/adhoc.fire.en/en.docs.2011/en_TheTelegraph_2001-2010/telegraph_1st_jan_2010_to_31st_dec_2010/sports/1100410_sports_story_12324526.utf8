The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A must-win match: Dravid
                                                                                                                       7                                        A must-win match: Dravid
            A CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid                           
	Bangalore: Royal Challengers Bangalores Rahul Dravid said at the pre-match press conference that they have to beat the Kolkata Knight Riders Saturday to stay in the hunt for a semi-final spot.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Saturdays match against KKR         
	It should be a good contest because both teams are in the middle of the table, and need to win against each other. I see this as a really important game. Teams need to win 7-8 games, preferably eight. If you are playing a team who are so close to you, you have to win that game. They have got a good team, so have we. With the quality of players we have, definitely we can bounce back. We are disappointed with what has happened in the last two weeks and are keen to bounce back. Tomorrow, you will see a side who are determined to stay in the tournament.         
	On Sourav Ganguly         
	He is a very important player for KKR, I think they are going to play him with just four matches to go before semi-finals. We are going to prepare ourselves thinking that he is going to play. I see no reason to think otherwise.         
	[Souravs availability had not been confirmed till the time of Dravids press conference]         
	Peaking at the right time         
	Every time is the right time to win. Looking back, its nice that we have that cushion, we started off so well that we could afford to drop a few points. But now the cushion factor is gone. You can see we won five and lost five, we cant afford to lose anymore games from now on. Certainly, we have to peak right now.         
	Chances of reaching the semi-finals         
	I think we are still in the mix, we started off really well winning four out of five games to position ourselves at the top of the table. We havent played the way we would have liked to in the last four or five games, but the good start is helping us now. We have to play good cricket from here, we cant afford to lose any game now. If you look at the table, every game is going to be important. When you are playing with teams that are competing for the spots with you, almost all are must-win games.         
	Not being able to defend 184 against the Deccan Chargers on Thursday         
	I think 184 was a good total and it was disappointing that we could not defend that. Credit to them, they took their chances, and it paid off. We could have bowled a little better in the middle and end overs. Having said that, we have some quality bowlers in our line-up, all the five bowlers who played yesterday (Thursday) are internationals. They have been consistent. We had some bad days, but we can definitely bounce back. The way we defended 170 here against Chennai (Super Kings) and the bowling performance against Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai (Indians) we can take a lot of confidence from that.         
	The international players         
	The arrival of international players has strengthened our side. If you look at the overall make up of the team, we have got decent all-rounders, explosive batsmen, five international bowlers, but you need to do it on the field in those 40 overs. The team composition has got nothing to do with.         
	The pitch         
	This is one of the better pitches to play T20 or any form of the game. It has given both bowlers and batsmen an even chance. There is something in it for the fast bowlers, bounce for the spinners. We have seen 200 and 180 being chased down on that wicket, so if you err in length, batsmen have got the chance to play their shots. Theres always a good contest between and ball on this wicket.

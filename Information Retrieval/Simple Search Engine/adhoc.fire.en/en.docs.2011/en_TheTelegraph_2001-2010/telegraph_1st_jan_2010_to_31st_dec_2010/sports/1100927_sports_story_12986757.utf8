	Singapore: Ferraris Fernando Alonso held off Sebastian Vettel in a thrilling finish to the night time Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday and moved to within 11 points of the Formula One championship lead.         
	The Spaniard led from start to finish but was pressured throughout by Red Bulls Vettel, who closed markedly over the final two laps to almost snatch a win, with the final margin being just two tenths of a second.         
	Alonso won his second Singapore GP, crossing a finish line clouded in smoke. Lotus Heikki Kovalainen had just stopped nearby with the rear half of his Lotus on fire. This win means a lot, Alonso said. We wanted to confirm on a track with more downforce that the car was performing well, and we did that. It seems we can be competitive on any track.         
	The gap between Alonso and Vettel remained around one second for much of the closing quarter of the race, but the German could find no way past on the tight Marina Bay street circuit.         
	I tried to push him as hard as I could into a mistake, Vettel said. Its hard to overtake here and it would have been too risky.         
	Red Bulls Mark Webber finished third  surviving a mid-race collision that eliminated McLarens Lewis Hamilton  to boost his championship lead to 11 points over Alonso with four races remaining. Webber leads with 202 points and Alonso is second with 191.         
	Hamilton nosed in front of Webber approaching a corner on lap 35 of 61 but the Australian did not yield the inside line and collided with the McLaren. While Hamiltons race was finished, Webbers Red Bull was unharmed.         
	The incident was investigated by stewards, but they chose to take no action, deeming it a fair racing incident. It was a key part of the race for me to keep him out, Webber said. I am very happy with third place.         
	Webber pitted after just three laps in a bold tire strategy that ended up paying off, effectively jumping from fifth to third once other cars came in for their tire change. However, the Red Bull driver was nursing his very worn tires toward the end of the race and had a difficult task to hold off Button.         
	Hamilton entered the race just five points off the championship lead, but his second straight non-finish meant he was now 20 points off the pace with 182. He said, Ive got to just try to enjoy the rest of the season. Its going to be a hard struggle the next four races.         
	This was a fair and square win for Alonso, and his 25th career victory puts him level in sixth on the all-time list with Niki Lauda and Jim Clark. He was closing in on his third world title.         
	(The championship) remains very tight, Alonso said. All five contenders have more or less the same possibilities.

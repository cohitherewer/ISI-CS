            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In a joint letter to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the secretaries of the five state associations from east zone placed a three-fold request for the improvement of the game in the region.         
	The meeting, that was held in Guwahati on Friday, was attended by secretaries of the state associations of Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Tripura and Jharkhand. The primary request was to shift one of the boards specialised academies to the eastern region.         
	Save east zone, all the other zones have a specialised academy. We have requested that BCCI should at least allot one of the academies to our region, an official who attended the meeting told The Telegraph.         
	If you look at the specialised academies, the batting academy is in Mumbai (west zone), bowling academy in Mohali (north Zone), wicket-keepers and spinners academy in Chennai (south zone) and the Umpires academy in Nagpur (central zone), he added.         
	Among the couple of other suggestions, the associations called for the revival of the now-scrapped Zonal Cricket Academy (ZCA) which has helped groom talented boys from the region.         
	The BCCI has done away with the ZCAs as all the state associations are supposed to have their own academies. But it will still take some time before the state academies come up in a full-fledged manner. Till then, we should revive the ZCA concept, the source added.

    - hamilton blasts team for second pitstop           [+uc('Tom Cary   The Daily Telegraph')+]            Lewis Hamilton in Kuala Lumpur, on Sunday                                 
	Lewis Hamilton has warned McLaren that he cannot keep producing brilliant performances to dig them out of trouble after his sensational drive from 20th to finish in sixth position in Sundays Malaysian Grand Prix.         
	McLaren left their drivers with a mountain to climb after an unnecessary gamble in qualifying on Saturday saw them kept in the pits too long as the weather worsened.         
	Hamilton began the race in 20th place, stuck between two Ferraris  the Italian team having made the same strategic error in qualifying  with Button not far ahead in 17th.         
	But the 2008 world champion lit the Sepang track up as he made eight overtaking moves en route to second place before pitting on lap 29.         
	His performance came just a week after he went from 11th on the grid to sixth place in Australia, a drive he described as one of the best of my life until his team called him in for a second pitstop, which he felt was a freaking terrible decision.         
	Although the 25 year-old lies just eight points off championship leader Felipe Massa in sixth place in the standings, he admitted he is frustrated not to have capitalised further given his McLarens pace and warned his team they must cut out the errors.         
	We cant afford to have races like that, Hamilton said. I dont how many more of those kinds of races I can do.         
	Its not easy at all. The weekend has shown we have the pace. I think if it had been dry in qualifying we could have made the first two rows.         
	He added: I cant complain. I think the two last races I have pulled out something good. They are probably the two strongest races I have had for a long, long time. Perhaps ever.         
	Button produced a similarly solid race on Sunday, on a completely different tyre strategy, to finish eighth, and Hamilton said he was excited by the prospect of what they could achieve when everything clicked.         
	Weve just got to push the guys. If it all goes right, it could be dynamite, he said.         
	McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh held his hands up to Saturdays error in qualifying but said that as a team everyone had to take responsibility.         
	Lewis is part of this team and it is true that you win together and lose together. I think Lewis understands that, he said. Im not here to defend what happened in Australia but there are other opinions and Ive seen other opinions that say we got it right.         
	Whitmarsh also explained the teams decision to bring Button in after just nine laps while Hamilton was kept out for 29 in the hope of rain.         
	We tried to do something different with the strategies today, he said. We were hoping that the good old 5pm rain was coming and that we had a shower, then Lewis would have been second. Weve been here a week and every bloody day it has rained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting the main worry for RCB
                                                                                                                       7                                      Batting the main worry for RCB

	Bangalore: Smarting from their seven-wicket loss to the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Royal Challengers Bangalore will be determined to redeem their pride in front of home fans when they take on the Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here Tuesday.         
	As captain Anil Kumble admitted, their performance at the Eden was below par in all departments of the game.         
	Their batting was unimpressive as they huffed and puffed to a niggardly 135. Their bowling came apart at the seam as Manoj Tiwary tore into their attack like a hurricane.         
	To add to their brimming on-field woes, the Challengers fielding was shoddy, highlighted by Sreevats Goswamis blundering glove work.         
	Except Jacques Kallis, who resolutely batted through the 20-over innings, the rest of the Bangalore batters came a cropper. Much was expected of Goswami, Virat Kohli and Manish Pandey, but the talented triumvirate fell to impetuous strokes.         
	Unless these youngsters and English-import Eoin Morgan, who would be eager to stabilise his place before Ross Taylor arrives, provide the thrust at the top, it will be difficult for the Royal Challengers to overcome the Kings XIs robust challenge.         
	The Kings XI, on the other hand, were tamed by the Delhi DareDevils in their first outing and also have issues on hand, especially with their fortified batting failing comprehensively in Mohali.

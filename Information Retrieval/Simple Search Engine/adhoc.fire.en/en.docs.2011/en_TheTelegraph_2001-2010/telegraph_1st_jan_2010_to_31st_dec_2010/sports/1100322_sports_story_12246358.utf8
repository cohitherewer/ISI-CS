	Chennai: The Kings XI Punjab made a sensational fightback, scripting a dramatic victory over the Chennai Super Kings via Super Over in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Sunday.         
	Asked to bat first, the Kings XI made a modest 136 for eight and were all set for yet another defeat when the home team reached 96 for one by the 14th over. But after that, the visitors made a remarkable comeback, restricting the Super Kings to 136 for seven, setting up IPL IIIs first Super Over.         
	In the bowl out, the Super Kings made nine runs off the bowling of Juan Theron, losing two of their three nominated batsmen  Matthew Hayden (0) and captain Suresh Raina (8).         
	Batting second, the Kings XI made 10 for one with Yuvraj Singh hitting a four off the fourth ball off Muttiah Muralidharan to earn the dramatic victory. Mahela Jayawrdene was out off the second ball after hitting a six off the first. The third nominated batsman, Irfan Pathan, did not have to face a single ball.         
	With the win, the Kings XI snapped their three-match losing streak and opened their account. For the Chennai team, it was their second loss in four matches.         
	Chasing a modest target of 137, they looked set for a thumping win before a dramatic collapse at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Wicket-keeper batsman Parthiv Patel struck a fighting 57 to take the side to a winning position, only to see his teammates throw away the game.                     
	Parthiv, who struck four fours and two sixes in his 58-ball innings, was the fifth man out in the 18th over, stumped by Kumar Sangakkara off Piyush Chawla. The dismissal turned the game on its head.         
	Needing 12 runs from two overs and with five wickets in hand, Manpreet Gony was bowled by Juan Theron in the penultimate over, leaving the Super Kings 10 away from the target.         
	A four by Albie Morkel off the first ball of the final over bowled by Irfan Pathan tilted the scales in favour of Suresh Rainas team and the score was tied at the fourth ball of the last over. Ravichandran Aswin could not score off the penultimate ball, and was caught by Mohammed Kaif off the last. Theron was the most successful Kings XI bowler with two for 17.         
	The Super Kings had begun sedately but solidly with Matthew Hayden and Parthiv raising 65 runs from 52 balls for the opening wicket. The duo shunned risks and looked content to preserve their wickets while keeping the required run rate in check with occasional fours and sixes.         
	Earlier, Muralidharans superb show (3/16) restricted the Kings XI to 136 for eight. Murali dismissed Sangakkara, Jayawardene and Kaif. Pacers Morkel and Lakshmipathy Balaji also bowled well, taking two and one wicket respectively. For the Kings XI, Yuvraj top-scored with a 28-ball 43 which had four fours and two sixes in it while opener Irfan Pathan made 39 from 32 balls.

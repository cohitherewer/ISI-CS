	 South Africa         
	There is an air of cautious optimism in South Africa as the Rainbow Nation prepares to write what is undoubtedly the most significant chapter of its short football history. A mammoth task lies ahead. Recent years have brought ample disappointments, but Bafana Bafana have also shown, albeit in patches, that  given motivation and purpose  they can be a potent threat. And there can be no greater motivation than representing their country in a World Cup on home soil. Their gallant performance at the Confederations Cup last June has shown just what this team are capable of.         
	Qualification         
	Secured automatic qualification by virtue of being the hosts.         
	Coach         
	In his second stint as a South Africa coach, Carlos Alberto Parreiras return was greeted with mixed feelings although the Brazilians many supporters are adamant that he is the man to lead this side to glory when the World Cup is being held at home.                   
	Star player         
	Midfielder Steven Pienaar is their prize asset and brings innovation and imagination to the side. Since joining Everton, Pienaar has reinvented himself and matured as a player.         
	Record         
	This is South Africas third appearance at the World Cup. South Africa have failed to make it beyond the group stages in their two previous World Cups. Clearly, this is a situation they will be desperate to remedy having flattered to deceive on the last two occasions.

	Mexico         
	After a turbulent couple of years that has seen three coaches come and go and more than sixty players pull on the famous green jersey, Mexico have returned to calmer waters under the steadying influence of Javier Aguirre. The former Atletico Madrid coach has restored the teams wavering confidence and taught them to believe. Having safely made their way to the finals, their goal will now be to progress beyond the Round of 16, where they have been knocked out at the last four finals.         
	Road to South Africa         
	The going has been tough for Mexico and the men in green have often looked in danger of missing qualification. But the arrival of Aguirre changed all that and Mexico ended the group in second place behind US.         
	Coach         
	Javier Aguirre is Mexicos most successful coach of recent times, and inspires confidence like no other when the search is for a man to lead them to the Cup.                   
	Star player         
	Barcelona defender Rafael Marquez is the leader at the heart of their defence and can also orchestrate attacks.         
	Record         
	Mexico have qualified for the World Cup 14 times in all, more than any other side from the CONCACAF Zone. Their best-ever show was as hosts in the 1970 and 1986 in finals , both last eight finishes.

  First intl: Vs Ecuador in 1997         
	Uruguay         
	Few nations have the footballing history of Uruguay. Nestling on the northern bank on the River Plate, the country has a population of a little over three million yet boasts an impressive collection of world, Olympic and continental titles and a record that compares favourably with the worlds best. The glory years of Uruguayan football are but a fading memory, however, with La Celeste having made just two appearances at the last five finals. Can 10 be the beginning of a rennaisance?         
	Road to South Africa         
	Just as they did in 2001 and 2005, Uruguay finished fifth in the ten-team qualifying group, which meant yet another play-off. But unlike four years ago, when they were eliminated by Australia, the Uruguayans made no mistakes this time against Costa Rica, the fourth-placed team in the CONCACAF Zone.         
	Coach         
	This is the second time 62-year-old Oscar Washington Tabarez takes Uruguay into the finals. The last time, they were knocked out in the Round of 16 in Italy 90 . Now, 20 years on, El Maestro looks to set the record straight.                   
	Star player         
	Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan has put together an impressive CV during his time in Europe and will be raring to go in South Africa.         
	Record         
	Uruguay will be appearing in the finals for the 11th time at South Africa 2010 and have two World Cup titles to their name, 1930 and 1950.

	Date of birth: 19 May 1979

  Position: Striker
  Club: Atletico Madrid

  First int'l: Vs Saudi Arabia in 2002         
	France         
	France crossed a new threshold in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, having never before graced the finals on four consecutive occasions. Les Bleus have become a regular presence in recent years, having earned a reputation as one of world footballs leading teams since the late 90s. Their fine displays at the first edition in 1930 marked them out as a good side and they have occasionally produced legendary talents, but only over the last decade have they evolved into a team that can challenge for the title.         
	Road to South Africa         
	They may not have done it in style, but France just about managed to book themselves a place in South Africa although it took the hand of Henry to break the hearts of the Irish with a 2-1 win.         
	Coach         
	Praised once for his communication skills, Raymond Domenechs perceived weaknesses in that domain were leapt upon after they failed to shine at Euro 2008. So, 10 is as big a challenge for the coach as for the team.                   
	Star player         
	Bayern Munich midfielder Franck Ribery is the livewire on the field and it will be his vision that gets them the Cup if Les Bleus do manage to win it for a second time.         
	Record         
	Les Bleus have appeared in 12 final tournaments, winning on home soil in 1998. Regular actors on the greatest stage of all, France also managed third-place finishes in 1958 and 1986, as well as fourth spot in 1982. France have also won a couple of Confederation Cup titles, in 2001 and 2003 apart from two Euro Cup crowns, in 1984 and 2000.

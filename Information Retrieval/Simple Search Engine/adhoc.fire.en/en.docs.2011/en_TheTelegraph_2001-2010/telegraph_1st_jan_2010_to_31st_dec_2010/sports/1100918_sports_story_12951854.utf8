	Durban: Skipper Michael Klinger and Daniel Harris produced a 124-run opening partnership to help South Australia inflict a humiliating eight-wicket defeat on the Royal Challengers Bangalore and qualify for the Champions League Twenty20 semi-final, here Friday.         
	South Australia first came out with a disciplined bowling display to restrict the Bangalore side to 154 in 19.5 overs on a slightly slow Kingsmead pitch and then achieved the target with nine balls to spare in the Group B encounter.         
	Klinger scored an unconquered 69 off 57 balls with the help of nine fours and a six, while Harris came out with a brilliant 57 off 38 balls.         
	South Australia scored 155 for two in 18.3 overs, with Callum Ferguson (21 off 14) giving company to Klinger.         
	Chasing 155 to win, both the openers started on an attacking note. Neither Klinger nor Harris faced any problem in tackling the Bangalore bowling attack.           (AGENCIES)

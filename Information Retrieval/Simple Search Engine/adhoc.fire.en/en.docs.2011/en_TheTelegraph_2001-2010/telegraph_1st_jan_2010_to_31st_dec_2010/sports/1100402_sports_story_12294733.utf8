                                                                                                                       7                                      I am good so I lasted this long: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was all praise for his bowlers after Thursdays victory at the Eden. At the press conference, he also stressed on the need for victories and said he wasnt upset at missing a well-deserved century.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The importance of todays win         
	We need winsWe need to go on with a few more victories. We won in Mohali but lost in Delhi. It was a bad toss to lose in Delhi Good to get a win here. Weve got some more home matches left and need to win them. It doesnt mean that away matches are less important but at home you always enjoy that extra advantage You know the conditions and can plan accordingly.         
	The significance of his innings         
	Ive got runs and the team won Thats most important.         
	If he was upset at missing the hundred         
	No Winning is most important.         
	If todays innings was the best in the IPL         
	Not actually Ive played a few good innings in the IPL last year and the year before. Its a different format and you need to understand that. Its not always about big scores. Its also not possible to consistently get big scores in this format. A 30 or 35 can also be of immense importance as David Hussey showed today.         
	If he was under pressure to perform         
	Ive never looked at life that way. In sport youre always under pressure to perform Its the same with everybody, be it Sachin Tendulkar or me. Youve got to get on with the game. Outside things have never worried me. Ive had faith in my abilities all through my career. If I wasnt good enough, I wouldnt have lasted this long.         
	If he was upset with the demonstration against him in the city         
	I didnt know about it until about 5 pm. I still dont know the details. But these are the people who have given me love and affection right through my career. So once in a while...         
	Winning the toss here         
	Toss wasnt very important in this match but in the Kotla game it was very important. If you have seen yesterdays match against Rajasthan Royals, you could see the wicket deteriorating. So when you lose tosses on these sort of wickets it becomes difficult for teams batting second. The wicket played well here and we bowled exceptionally well.         
	The exchange between him and Andrew Symonds at the ground         
	He wasnt congratulating neither was ILets leave it at that.

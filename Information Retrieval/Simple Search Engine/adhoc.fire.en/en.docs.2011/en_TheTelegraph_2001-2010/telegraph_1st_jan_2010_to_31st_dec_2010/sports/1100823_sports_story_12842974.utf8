The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wenger: It is the break that built Walcott
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wenger: It is the break that built Walcott
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Walcott                           
	Arsene Wenger believes Arsenal are already beginning to benefit from Fabio Capellos decision to omit Theo Walcott from the England World Cup squad.         
	Walcott netted a hattrick as Arsenal crushed Blackpool 6-0 at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday with an Andrei Arshavin penalty and goals from Abou Diaby and Marouane Chamakh completing the scoring.         
	Arsenal manager Wenger believes Walcotts impressive finishing and all-round play is further evidence that the 21-year-old is maturing as a player and is determined to put the disappointment of the World Cup snub behind him.         
	He is more electric than he has been, said Wenger. He was sharp. I like the way he mixed the final ball and his finishing.         
	That is always a sign a player is more mature. He plays at a very high pace and it isnt easy to make the right decison. But he got many decisions in the final third right.         
	Having had a complete break since last season, Walcott appears to have shrugged off the injuries that have hindered his development over the previous two campaigns.         
	He looks better for the break, Wenger added. Hes had good preparation for the first time in a long, long time.         
	Without being interrupted by an injury or coming back late. You can see that. For two or three weeks now hes been sharp because hes had a good preparation.         
	And Wenger insists Walcott has recovered from the shock of being overlooked by Capello and is now even more determined to prove the Italian wrong.         
	Wenger said: He is a guy who keeps his feet on the ground. He takes life in a positive way. The glass is half full, not half empty. So he took that as another challenge. Thats whats amazing about Theo.         
	He is 21, he is now at an age when players normally start. He is not at the peak of his game. He has to keep his attitude right. And he has to avoid injury. quot;         
	With Cesc Fabregas also making his first appearance since committing his future to the club, Wenger had much to be pleased about after such a comfortable win.         
	Wenger is also confident of making one more signing before the transfer window closes.         
	Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer remains his number one target, although the Cottagers reacted angrily last week after receiving a second offer for the player from Arsenal that they claimed simply mirrored the 2 million bid rejected in May.

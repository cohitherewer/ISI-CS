The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NSF chiefs vow to protect autonomy
                                                                                                                       7                                      NSF chiefs vow to protect autonomy
        OUR BUREAU                            
	The governments bid to limit the tenure of sports administrators met with stiff resistance on Monday with Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi, and other angry bosses of the National Sports Federations (NSF), vowing to do everything to protect their autonomy.         
	Miffed administrators, many of whom are politicians who have occupied the post for more than a decade, made it clear that they would oppose the draconian directive, setting the stage for a bitter stand-off with the sports ministry.         
	We are surprised by the government order. It is draconian order which questions the very basis of the autonomy of IOA and the NSFs. We reject the brazen attempt by the sports ministry to challenge our autonomy.         
	We will take appropriate steps and we are not backing off. We would do everything to protect our autonomy, Kalmadi said here. The brass of IOA and some NSF top officials had a meeting today (Monday). We have called an IOA executive committee meeting on May 18 and may convene a general assembly meeting as well (to discuss the issue), Kalmadi said.         
	Cracking down on the sports administrators who have monopolised most of the NSFs, the sports ministry on Monday announced a new regulation which says federation presidents cannot continue more than 12 years  with or without break  while secretaries or treasurers can serve two terms of four years at a stretch and would have to take a four-year gap before they seek a re-election.         
	The regulation hurts Kalmadi, who has been at the IOAs helm since 1996, while it also seeks to end the reigns of NSF chiefs V. K. Malhotra (archery), Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa (cycling), V. K. Verma (badminton), captain Satish K. Sharma (aero club) and B.S. Adityan (volleyball), who have been occupying the top posts for more than a decade.         
	Insisting that the autonomy of the IOA and NSFs are paramount, Kalmadi said, Our constitution goes to the International Olympic Council (IOC) and no one can meddle with that. All NSFs also send their constitution to the respective international bodies.         
	He said sports minister M. S. Gill has no business to issue the order at a time all the sports officials were focussing on the Commonwealth Games and CWG Coordination Commission was having a meeting here till Wednesday. The timing of the order amazed us. We completely disagree with the hostile approach of the ministry on the eve of the meeting of the co-ordination commission of the Commonwealth Games. The Games are just 150-odd days left and at this juncture the sports minster thought it right to issue such an order. said the IOA chief.         
	Kalmadi also dismissed Gills assertion that the guideline would help bring transparency to the functioning of IOA and NSFs. As far as transparency is concerned, IOA was brought under RTI (Right To Information) Act by the ministry and we accepted it with a smile because we have nothing to hide.         
	Gill, meanwhile, said on Monday that the new guidelines were not aimed at any individual and also defended the timing of the announcement. That has nothing to do with this. The Games are separate. I have no problems with anybody. I try to do my job. That is what I am paid for, Gill said outside the Parliament.         
	Gill said people were entitled to their opinion. Nothing upsets me. It is a free country. Everybody has a right to comment on whatever is done by the government, a minister or a ministry, he said.

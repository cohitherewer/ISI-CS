The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All-rounders give strength: Kallis 
                                                                                                                       7                                        All-rounders give strength: Kallis 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Herschelle Gibbs in Jaipur                           
	Jaipur: Stand-in South Africa captain Jacques Kallis sees the one-day series against India as part of the teams 2011 World Cup preparations. The all-rounder addressed newspersons on Saturday and answered questions about the series.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Changes in the team         
	Were trying to find the right combination and give everybody a fair chance. We need to get our game plan correct for the conditions and not make any mistake.         
	On the balance of the side         
	We are fortunate to have a lot of all-rounders. You need them in ODIs. In one-dayers, you want to bat as deep as you can and we have been fortunate in that aspect. It is good to have plenty of bowling options Has been one of our strengths Steyn, Langeveldt and other specialist bowlers have specific roles.         
	Whether it is difficult to switch over to one-dayers immediately after the Test series         
	Well, this is a different format altogether. We are disappointed to lose the Calcutta Test on the last day, but it is not going to have any impact on our performance in the one-day series.         
	Mark Bouchers fitness         
	Hes more than 100 per cent fit. He should play the next match.         
	On Corrie van Zyl         
	Corrie has got his own ideas and they are a little different from Mickeys (Arthur). He sat down with the team and explained what he wanted everyone to do. Though we dont have too much time before the World Cup, we are looking forward to his ideas and how they shape up over the next year.         
	The importance of this one-day series         
	From the team point of view, there is a lot at stake in the series. World Cup is here in another years time, and a lot, including about conditions, can be learnt from this series.         
	On his own bowling         
	The role I play in ODIs is to fill up the fifth bowlers slot. I am fortunate to have other all-rounders to support me.         
	Security arrangements         
	Well, it is surely disappointing. It is tough with so much security around and we dont get to do much on the tour apart from playing cricket.         
	The dew factor         
	Hope it doesnt come into play. But well have to take it into consideration while batting and bowling. We are prepared for it.         
	Harbhajan Singhs absence         
	He (Harbhajan) is surely a world-class bowler, but India have some more good bowlers and they are a strong one-day side.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Rajpal amp; Co. to resume strike
            Eighth Column                
	New Delhi: The truce hastily thrashed out last night by the Hockey India officials didnt last even a full day with the disgruntled players on Sunday deciding to go on strike again from Monday demanding dues and incentives.         
	We are not going back to the camp anymore unless our demands are met, Indian captain Rajpal Singh said from Pune.         
	Hockey India reacted sharply to players decision with treasurer Narinder Batra accusing them of blackmailing the Federation and holding the nation to ransom.         
	Its really shocking. They agreed to our offer yesterday and now they are back on strike. They cant hold a nation to ransom, he said.         
	Asked why they decided to go on strike again after six players, including the Indian captain himself, met the HI officials on Saturday night and agreed to rejoin the camp, Rajpal said other players felt the amount offered by HI was peanuts.         
	It was a marathon meeting that went on and on. At one time, we wanted to end it somehow and return. We returned and conveyed to our team members what HI offered us. But they felt it was too insignificant an amount and there was no question of ending the strike, Rajpal said, adding HI had offered Rs 25,000 for each player.         
	We have conveyed our decision to the coaching staff and by now, they must have relayed it to HI. HI has to come up with a better offer if they want us back in the camp, he said. Batra said HI officials will travel to Pune on Monday to sort out the issue.         
	Rajpal, meanwhile, assured that the players would keep themselves mentally and physically fit for the World Cup which begins next month in the capital.         
	Senior forward Prabhjot Singh also felt the money offered by HI was too meagre.         
	We put our proposals in front of Hockey India and they responded with their proposals.         
	Batra, meanwhile, was furious with the players, whom he accused of blackmailing.         
	Yesterday, we had such a long meeting with them where everything was discussed and a solution was reached. Now they come out saying they are going on strike again. This is blackmailing us. They are playing for a country and not a club. They cannot hold an entire nation to a ransom like this, he fumed.         
	 Batra claimed HI listened to every grievances of the players and offered a solution too.         
	They talked about insurance cover, graded systems and even the alleged poor quality of food they had at the Pune camp. We told them what we can immediately do. We even agreed to compensate for the poor food, arrange a meeting with the sponsor as they demanded and HI president (AK Mattoo) went to the extent of promising them Rs 1 crore each if they win the World Cup. We said we would get the money anyhow for them.         
	Now suddenly they did a u-turn and say its not acceptable. And all this talks about other playing rejecting our offer today is rubbish, he added.         
	Senior India player Prabhjot Singh was today nominated by his teammates as the person who will deal with the Hockey India and place their demands for dues and incentives to the authority.         
	Assistant coach of the team Harendra Singh, who was also present at the meeting, drew flak from the team members for taking Hockey Indias side, sources said.         
	Why should we bother when the media, film stars and also former Olympians are supporting our cause? Now we have solid support from within and from outside, the players said during the meeting.         
	According to the sources, the players vowed to fight till the last and said, We are prepared to lose our jobs, then the country will rise to support us. We will not give away our rights in a democratic country.         
	Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Olympian Dhanraj Pillay were the among who backed the revolting players.           (PTI)

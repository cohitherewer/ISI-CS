The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand back with a bang
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand back with a bang
                      
	Nanjing: World champion Viswanathan Anand struck back with vengeance and outclassed Wang Yue of China with black pieces in the sixth round of the Pearl Spring Chess tournament here.         
	With his second win apart from a loss and three draw, the Indian ace moved within striking distance of the top honour with four rounds still to come in this super tournament being played on a double round-robin basis between six players.         
	Anand was the lone winner on the day when the other two games ended in draws.         
	Etienne Bacrot of France played out an easy draw with Magnus Carlsen of Norway, while Vugar Gashimov of Azerbaijan also did not give many chances to former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and signed peace.         
	Carlsen remained in sole lead on 4.5 points from his six outings in the tournament following a draw with Bacrot, who inched himself up to four points and remained just a half point behind the leader.         
	Anand remained sole third but the difference is what matters from the previous round as the Indian ace is now just a half point behind second placed Bacrot and only one point behind Carlsen.         
	Gashimov took his tally to 2.5 points after drawing with Topalov and remains fourth, while Topalov is now clear fifth on the standings on two points, a half point ahead of Wang Yue.         
	Anand played a gem of a game to beat the local hopeful. Up against a Catalan opening, Anand went for a topical set up and did not find any difficulty in retaining the dynamic balance he was looking for.

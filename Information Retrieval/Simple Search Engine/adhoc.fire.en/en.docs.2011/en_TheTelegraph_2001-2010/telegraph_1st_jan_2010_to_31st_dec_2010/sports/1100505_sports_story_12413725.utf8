	New Delhi: Suspended Indian Premier League chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi is likely to give next week his reply on charges levelled against him by the governing council.         
	Modi is in the process of finalising responses to various issues, including his relationship with Rajasthan Royals part owner Chellaram, raised by the IPL governing council on Monday last, sources said.         
	After the IPL governing council meeting on April 26, BCCI president Shashank Manohar had told reporters that contrary to Modis claims that everybody knew about his relationship with Chellaram members of council were not aware of the stakeholders of the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Sources said that the reply to Modi would address in specific details about the information shared with council members and their public statements right from the IPL I.         
	When contacted, IPL vice-chairman Niranjan Shah said from Mumbai that Modi had introduced Chellaram as his brother-in law and every body knew about it.         
	Responding to his purported statement in 2008 as spokesperson of BCCI that he did not care about the Modi- Chellaram relationship, Shah said, but it was his (Modis) responsibility as IPL chairman to give the complete shareholding details. Though I knew Chellaram and his relationship, I was not aware of his role., he said.

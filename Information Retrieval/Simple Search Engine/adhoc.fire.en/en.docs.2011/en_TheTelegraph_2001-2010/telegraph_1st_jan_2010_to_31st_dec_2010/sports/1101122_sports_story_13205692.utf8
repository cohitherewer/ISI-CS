            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: New Zealand pacer Tim Southee believes it was Virender Sehwags onslaught that upset their plans and gave India the momentum on the second day of the final Test.         
	(Virender) Sehwag plays like that We knew he was going to do that Our plans were right, but he came and upset it all, Southee said on Sunday.         
	The Black Caps peppered Sachin Tendulkar with a lot of short deliveries and when asked if it was deliberate ploy, the pacer said: The plan was to mix it up and make it unpredictable But he, too, got going.         
	Southee, who had figures of one for 41, said he bowled well in his second spell. I got a little bit of rhythm in my second spell.         
	He hit three sixes in his 38 and was instrumental in taking New Zealands total to 192 after Brendon McCullums early dismissal on Sunday.         
	I hung around and batted for sometime I managed to go over the top a few times.         
	Was Andy McKay a bundle of nerves in his debut Test?         
	We all rallied around him and he bowled a few good spells, Southee said.

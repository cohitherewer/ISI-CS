	Georgetown: West Indies will have to sort out their batting woes of the opening match against Ireland when they take on England in their second Group D match of the World Twenty20 here on Monday.         
	All-rounder Darren Sammy did the rescue act for West Indies in their opening match against Ireland with a 17-ball 30 but the rest of the batsmen came a cropper and that would be a major worry for the hosts.         
	Sans big-hitting skipper Chris Gayle, the Windies managed to pull off a 70-run win against Ireland but even the comprehensive margin of victory could not hide their batting frailties against the minnows.         
	George Dockrell, a 17-year-old spinner, managed to rattle a line-up that boasts of Twenty20 big-hitters like Dwayne Bravo, and West Indies cannot afford to repeat the same mistakes.         
	The hosts showed more purpose while defending the total against Ireland, but Sammy, Ravi Rampaul, Bravo and Kemar Roach will face a tougher test against Paul Collingwood and his men.

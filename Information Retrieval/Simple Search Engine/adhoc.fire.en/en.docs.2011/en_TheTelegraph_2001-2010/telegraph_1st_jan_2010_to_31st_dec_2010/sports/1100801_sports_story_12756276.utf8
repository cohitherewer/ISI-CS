            OUR CORRESPONDENT IN MUMBAI/OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI            Shashank Manohar arrives for the BCCI working committee meeting, in Mumbai, on Saturday. (PTI)                           
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), at the receiving end following a severe scrutiny of its revenues, on Saturday rejected a request from the organisers for Rs 100 crore in sponsorship for the Delhi Commonwealth Games.         
	The BCCI working committee, which met here on Saturday, also decided to renege on its earlier commitment of extending Rs 25 crore aid to the All India Football Federation (AIFF).         
	Half the amount has already been made available to the AIFF, but the BCCI said they would now hold back the remaining Rs 12.5 crore.         
	The committee expressed its inability to agree to the request of the Commonwealth Games to be the lead partner by donating Rs 100 crore, a statement from BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said.         
	The statement made no mention of the money to be doled out to the AIFF but a BCCI source said that the income tax departments decision to withdraw tax concessions forced them to come to this decision.         
	Prior to 2007-08, I-T had granted tax exemptions to the BCCI, which claimed it was engaged in the charitable work of promoting cricket in the country. But that concession was revoked following the launch of the IPL and its multi-million dollar media rights.         
	The (tax) exemption was disallowed for the year 2007-08 as it was held that the BCCI is no longer promoting cricket as a charitable activity and is now primarily a commercial entity, S.S. Palanimanickam, the minister of state for finance, had informed Rajya Sabha earlier this year.         
	BCCIs decision to pull the plug is likely to put the AIFF in a spot of bother as it has ambitious plans for the improvement of the national teams, both at the senior and under-19 levels.         
	Based on an assurance from the BCCI, the AIFF made extensive plans for the national team, planning a payment of around Rs 8 crore towards the players salaries and organising the preparatory camp in Portugal.         
	After returning from Portugal, the team are also to play a series of friendly matches against top Asian sides.         
	The payment of Rs 12.5 crore to AIFF may involve certain tax problems that the Board would like to avoid for the moment, sources said.         
	The working committee has now left the issue to the annual general meeting for its consideration, they added.         
	Meanwhile, Nimbus Sport was likely to bag the television production rights for the period starting next month and ending 2014.         
	Nimbus were invited for discussions as they were the most qualified and lowest bidder and a final decision would be taken by the BCCI early next week, a source in the know said.         
	The bid from World Sport Group, whose contract for the IPLs media rights was terminated by the BCCI following the facilitation fee controversy, was not opened by the working committee, a Board source said.         
	The production rights would cover 19 Tests, 34 One-Day Internationals, four T20 Internationals and 350 days of domestic action.         
	Among other decisions, the working committee agreed to back the candidature of New Zealand Cricket chairman Alan Isaac for the post of the ICC vice-president.         
	It also decided to appoint Dr Vece Paes, a former Olympian and father of tennis star Leander Paes, as its anti-doping officer.         
	The committee also approved a loan of Rs 20 crore each for the cricket associations of Mumbai and Tamil Nadu as aid for stadium renovation.

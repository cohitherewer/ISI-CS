	New Delhi: The hearing panel of the National Anti Doping Agency (Nada) on Wednesday lifted the provisional suspension on 10 dope-tainted athletes but asked them to reappear for another hearing on Saturday.         
	The 10 athletes include four wrestlers, two swimmers and one athlete, who were part of the Commonwealth Games squad but were placed under provisional suspension after they tested positive for methylhexanemaine, a banned substance.         
	However, according to Nada director general Rahul Bhatnagar, these athletes will have to wait till September 25 to know whether they can take part in Commonwealth Games.

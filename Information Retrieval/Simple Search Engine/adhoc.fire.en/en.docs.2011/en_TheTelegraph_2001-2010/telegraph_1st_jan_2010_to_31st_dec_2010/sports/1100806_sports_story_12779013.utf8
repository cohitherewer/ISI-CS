The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shaky Bengal look to rock Goan boat

  - Arnab Mondal, Sheikh Azim return but no Shankar Oraon for semi-final       A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: If Dempo SCs four national league titles in the last five years are an indication, then Bengal football and Goan football have clearly gone in opposite directions in this period. Needless to say, things look darker at Bengals end.         
	There has been a steady decline in the standard of club and state teams from Bengal in recent years. Although IFA general secretary Utpal Ganguli wont agree, the lack of talent is quite evident, if one was to closely analyse the performances of the Bengal teams over the years.         
	But even then, when the 29-time champions square off versus the defending champions in the semi-final of the Santosh Trophy, one would expect a keen contest.         
	The contrasting performances of Bengal and Goa in the current edition, however give a different picture. While Goa have performed true to their reputation to record convincing victories in their three quarter final group league matches, Shabbir Alis boys have been at their inconsistent best throughout the tourney.         
	They were scrappy in the 1-1 draw against Delhi, brilliant during the 7-1 win over Mizoram and grievously profligate best for the 1-2 loss to Tamil Nadu.         
	Surely, the hosts should consider themselves lucky that Delhi were unable to get past Mizoram. That would have brought the curtains down for Bengal. For the eternal optimists though, the defeat at the hands of Tamil Nadu is a sign that Bengal might have a bit of the old champions luck working for them.         
	But what cannot be denied is that Wednesdays loss was a wake-up call for Bengal. At least coach Shabbir thinks so.         
	Im terribly disappointed with our teams performance on Wednesday. I cant believe we missed so many chances. But it would have hurt more had it been in the semi-final or the final. So, its a good sign that we have lost out in the group stages itself, Shabbir said on the eve of the semi-final.         
	So, do your team start underdogs on Friday?         
	As a coach, I will never underestimate my boys. Goa might be the favourites on paper. But once the match starts, reputations hardly count. Its your performance on the day that matters, the former India striker said.         
	Arnab Mondal who is coming back from a double booking will again start in the heart of defence. Arnabs presence will definitely bolster the defence. Sheikh Azim is also fit. He has more experience than Safar Sardar but I will like to take the call tomorrow.         
	If Arnab and Azeems availability is a positive sign, Shankar Oraons absence will definitely hurt the team. Oraon, who has made an impact with his speed and thrust, sustained a knee injury during the match against Tamil Nadu. Its not only about scoring goals. Shankar brings in a lot more with his sudden bursts of speed and the ability to disturb defenders, the coach said.         
	If Tarif Ahmed is fit, he will partner Nilendra Dewan upfront or else Robin Singh will make the first XI. Shabbirs assessment of the TFA cadet is that he is a bit slow on the turn but has a good first touch.         
	Sandeep Nandy, who has been shoddy under the bar for Bengal, might make way for Abhra Mondal.         
	Goa, on the other hand, will rely largely on the proven trio of Peter Carvalho, Milagres Gonsalves and Nicolau Borges.         
	Shabbir knows the damage Carvalho and Borges can cause to the opposition defence and the Bengal coach was planning to put in place a zonal marking system for the duo.         
	We arent bothered about our opposition. We have come here to defend our title and are confident of doing so, Goa coach Mariano Dias said.         
	Meanwhile, in another semi-final, mighty Punjab will take on Tamil Nadu.

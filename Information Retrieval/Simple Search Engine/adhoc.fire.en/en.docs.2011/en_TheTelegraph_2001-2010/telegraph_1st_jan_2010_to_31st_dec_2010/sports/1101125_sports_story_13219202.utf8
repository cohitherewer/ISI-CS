            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: Second-ranked South Africa and sixth-placed Pakistan have moved in different directions in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table after their two-Test series ended on Wednesday with both games drawn.         
	South Africa had entered the series leading Pakistan by 36 ratings points. This gap meant the Proteas were expected to win the series convincingly. As such, because the rankings are weighted to reflect this difference, South Africas failure to win the series means it has dropped points.         
	Following drawn Tests in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, South Africa have now slipped from 119 ratings points to 116 ratings points while Pakistan have gained five ratings points and now have 88 ratings points.         
	India are still at the top of the table.         
	Rankings         
	1. India (129); 2. South Africa (116); 3. Sri Lanka (115); 4. England (112); 5. Australia (110); 6. Pakistan (88); 7. New Zealand (80); 8. West Indies (79); 9. Bangladesh (7)

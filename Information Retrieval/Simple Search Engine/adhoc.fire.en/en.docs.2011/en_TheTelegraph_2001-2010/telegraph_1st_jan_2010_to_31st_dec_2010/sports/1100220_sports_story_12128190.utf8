            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto tries to get past Rajiv Ghosh at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting held reigning champions Mohun Bagan to a 1-1- draw in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday.         
	After the young Souvik Chakraborty put the green and maroon brigade ahead in the 20th minute, talented striker Nilendra Dewan equalised 10 minutes later.         
	Mohun Bagan now have 25 points from nine matches, while Mohammedan Sporting have 20 from as many ties.         
	Bagan could have won by a bigger margin but for their profligacy in front of the goal. Souvik twice shot wide from close, Ishfaq Ahmed drove across the field from inside the six-yard box and the usually dependant Barreto failed to direct a shot when he had rival keeper Manas Barua at his mercy.         
	If you miss chances like this, what else can you do, newly appointed coach Satyajit Chatterjee said after the match. But I am not worried much about todays missed chances. This is a marathon league and we will have our chances, Chatterjee said.         
	Mohammedan Sporting back-four of Biren Thapa, Anupam Sarkar, Amrit Pal Singh and Rajiv Ghosh, along with midfielder Sovan Chakraborty should be lauded for holding fort amidst the barrage of attacks. In fact, either Anupam or Sovan should have been the Man of the Match instead of Barreto. But here adjudicators decisions generally defy all logic and Friday was no exception.         
	Coming to the goals, Bagan shot ahead in the 20th minute when Shubha Kumar freed Barreto oon the right. The Brazilian beat the off-side trap, made the most of the open space in front and then left defender Rajiv Ghosh for death before releasing it to an onrushing Souvik. The young midfielder slotted it home albeit in a not so convincing way.         
	The equaliser came soon. Eduardo, after bungling with three set-pieces earlier, got this one right and Nilendra punished the Bagan defence for being indecisive inside the box with a smart header.         
	TEAMS         
	Mohun Bagan: Shilton Paul; Zenith Genius, Sagram Mandi, Shiekh Azim, Biswajit Saha, Souvik Chakraborty, Ishfaq Ahmed Snehasish Chakraborty (66), Lalram Luaha, Subha Kumar (Branco Curdozo 78), Jose Ramirez Barreto, Ryuji Sueoka.

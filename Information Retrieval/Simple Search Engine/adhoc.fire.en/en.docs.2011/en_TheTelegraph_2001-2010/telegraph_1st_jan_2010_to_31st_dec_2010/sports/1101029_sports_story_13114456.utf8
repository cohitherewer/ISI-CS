The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand held by Topalov
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand held by Topalov
                      
	Nanjing: World champion Viswanathan Anand played out a draw with Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria to remain in joint second position after end of the eighth round of Pearl Spring Chess tournament.         
	After surviving a real scare against Norwegian Magnus Carlsen in the seventh round, Anand could do little with his white pieces against Topalov, who appeared well-armed after his first victory in the tournament in the previous round. The lead positions remained unchanged as the other two games of the day also ended in draws.         
	Carlsen was troubled for a brief while by Chinese hopeful Wang Yue but eventually got a draw, while Etienne Bacrot of France settled for the peace treaty quite early against Vugar Gashimov of Azerbaijan.         
	With just two rounds to come in the six-player double round-robin tournament, Carlsen retained his lead and barring a debacle, he looks set to annex the title here.         
	The Norwegian took his tally to 5.5 points out of a possible eight to keep Anand and Bacrot at a full point distance. Topalov and Gashimov are on 3.5 points and sharing the fourth spot, while Wang now has 2.5 points in his kitty.         
	In the remaining two rounds, Carlsen has to meet Topalov and Gashimov, while Anand will take on Gashimov and Bacrot. The Frenchman has Wang apart from the Indian ace and things can heat up if Anand and Bacrot win the next round.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Out of favour Ishant Sharma put up a brave front on Wednesday, saying his omission from the squads for the Zimbabwe tri-series as well as the upcoming Asia Cup did not mark the end of his career.         
	Not being picked in the team is a situation every cricketer faces at least once in his career. All cricketers go through this tough phase and then rise (from the fall). I have to be positive rather than be thinking that I will never get a chance in the team again, Ishant, in the city for a promotional, said.         
	He was also confident about his return to the national side. I am not thinking of that far (till the World Cup) My next target is to do well in the Test series in Sri Lanka, he said.

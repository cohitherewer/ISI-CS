            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Lack of technical support from the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has reduced the ongoing national under-14 boys festival at Jamshedpur to a complete farce, according to state team coaches.         
	So much so that some of the coaches are planning to write a joint letter to the state associations, pointing out the technical flaws in the festival.         
	We have no complaints about accommodation or food. The arrangements here are excellent, said a coach. But the sheer lack of technical knowledge of the AIFF officials is spoiling the show.         
	As per Fifa guidelines, the results at an under-14 festival are not as important as certain other things like excellence in skills, presence of mind and sportsman spirit. On the basis of these, the teams are awarded green cards and points and the side that impresses the most receives the fair play award.         
	Sadly, the AIFF representative here has no knowledge, said a state coach. He doesnt even know about the formats of the matches, like 30 and 60 minute matches and mixed groups.         
	Another coach complained: Generally, it is the skills like fire and cross, beat and score or penalty shootout that are taken into consideration. Here, the AIFF man included juggling of the ball in the skills competition, something that has little meaning in modern football.

	Argentina playmaker Lionel Messi has declared that he wants to finish champion and top scorer at the 2010 World Cup finals, as well as stating unequivocally that, despite criticism in his home country over his performances in the national shirt, he has nothing to prove to his detractors.         
	Messi said he was eagerly waiting for the action to begin with the Albiceleste kicking off their campaign on June 12 against Nigeria.         
	Im feeling very comfortable in this team. Im relaxed and Im myself, the lynchpin said, before talking up his teams chances over the upcoming month: Player for player, there is no team better than ours in this competition.         
	The Barcelona hitman, who scored 34 goals in firing his side to another La Liga title also addressed the old accusations that he cares more for his club than Argentina, which he left for Spain at the age of 13. Many things have been said about me, good and bad things. But I have always had the trust of my coaches and teammates, and that has been a great support.         
	Messi continued to underline that the only place he needed to prove his loyalties was on the field. Nobody wants to have a great World Cup more than me, Messi said. But thats it, I dont have to say anything else. I have to play, and nothing else.         
	Messi said Argentinas period of concentration at their base in South Africas capital was essential to strengthen the team after a disappointing qualifying campaign.         
	Im calm, keen for the Word Cup to start, but this national team doesnt just have me but a great group of players, he said before going on to add that we were lacking this, to be together, have time to get to know each other. Now we have that, were making the most of it and its been good for all of us.         
	Juan Sebastian Veron, a member of the old guard and Messis roommate at the teams World Cup base, too, was optimistic.         
	The team is in the making... Were working on tactical questions... and with the passing of the days the coach will go looking for options, Veron said.         
	Veron, 35, said he hoped Messi would maintain the brilliant club form that made him the worlds top player.         
	Lets hope he is in form because hes an important component of the national team. Hes looking good generally.         
	However heavy the Argentinians reputation might be, they might not find life in Group B easy. At least not against Nigeria whose captain Nwankwo Kanu has warned the Messis not to write them off ahead of their opening World Cup match in just under 10 days time.         
	The Portsmouth striker arrived in South Africa with the rest of his teammates earlier this week as they begin final preparations for the World Cup.         
	Lars Lagerbacks still have one final warm-up match before they face North Korea on Sunday. The Super Eagles are yet to win in two outings under their new Swedish coach, but an unworried Kanu is not too fazed and has targeted an opening match upset at the finals.         
	Speaking in Durban where the team will be based for the June 11 to July 11 competition, he said: The question is not how we survive Argentina, but how Argentina survive us?

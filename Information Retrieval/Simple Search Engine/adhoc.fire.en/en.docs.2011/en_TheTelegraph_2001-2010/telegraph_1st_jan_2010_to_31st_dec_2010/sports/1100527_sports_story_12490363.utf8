The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods can surpass my record: Nicklaus
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods can surpass my record: Nicklaus
            Mark Reason   The            Tiger Woods                           
	Jack Nicklaus looks down at his feet and wonders if this is the first time he has ever worn white socks with long trousers. The Golden Bear is at Heaton Park Golf Centre on the outskirts of Manchester teaching a lot of schoolchildren who do not really know who he is.         
	They know he must be great because the mayor is here with his gold chain. But when Nicklaus asks the 10 and 11-year-olds when he started playing golf, the guesses range from 18 to 40. They would all recognise Tiger Woods, but Nicklaus is just an old man from a far off age.         
	When Nicklaus wonders if he can rip a ball to the trees at the end of the driving range, one bystander shouts out: Take off your pullover. Back in 1970, Nicklaus famously removed his sweater and ripped a three-wood through the back of St Andrews 18th green. Jack just smiles and says: Nowadays I just want to put another one on.         
	Once upon a time Nicklaus was the pin-up on a young Woodss wall. It is his record of 18 majors that Woods has always dreamed of beating and Nicklaus knows he must always answer the question  will he or wont he  until Woods either wins the five more he needs or retires from the sport.         
	Nicklaus says: He plays very well at Pebble and St Andrews (the venue of the next two majors). St Andrews will be a lot easier for him than Pebble Beach because if he hits an errant drive at St Andrews he will find it. You can aim at the middle of the course there and still get around very well. He always plays well there.         
	But Woods could also have problems, of the physical and psychological variety, as Nicklaus acknowledges. He adds: We have no idea what his neck issue is. We have no idea if his knee is bothering him. We have no idea whether hes got his head screwed on properly because of his private affairs.         
	This year has a lot to do with him beating the record. Hes in his prime. If he doesnt play well on three golf courses that he owns  Augusta, Pebble and St Andrews  if he doesnt win on one of those, he might not break it. I suspect he will win one of the next two and I suspect hell pass my record in the next couple of years.         
	A few years ago, it was a definite, but these days Nicklaus is no longer sure. We shall find out a lot more about Woodss chances when he plays at Memorial, Nicklauss own tournament, next week. Last year Woods smoked the field.         
	But the doubts are swirling now. Woodss absence has let others fill the void. Phil Mickelson has prospered and so has Northern Irelands Rory McIlroy. Nicklaus says: I dont watch a lot of golf but I got intrigued by his (McIlroys) last nine holes (in his impressive win at Quail Hollow earlier this month) and watched a lot of it.         
	Meanwhile, Woods will take part in a challenge featuring former British Open champions before the 150th tournament begins.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

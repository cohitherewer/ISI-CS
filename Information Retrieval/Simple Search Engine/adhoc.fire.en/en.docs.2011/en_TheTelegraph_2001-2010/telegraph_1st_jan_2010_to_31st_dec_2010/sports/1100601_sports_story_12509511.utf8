	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday served a third show cause notice to suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi regarding irregularities in the sale of theatrical rights for the T20 tournament.         
	A third show cause notice has been sent (to Modi), BCCI secretary Srinivasan told The Telegraph. The IPLs theatrical rights were won by Entertainment and Sports Direct with the highest bid of Rs. 330 crore for a period of 10 years from 2010 to 2019.         
	The third notice comes even before Modi had replied to the earlier notice issued to him on May 6 by the BCCI based on communication from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke on allegations of trying to run a parallel IPL in England.         
	Meanwhile, Modi served a defamation notice to Clarke, demanding an unconditional apology and retraction of his allegations.         
	The notice has been served on Mr. Clarke by the English solicitors of Mr. Modi. Mr. Clarke has been given seven days time to provide a full and unconditional apology and to retract his allegations which are untrue, Abdi said.Abdi also said that Modi had demanded compensation.

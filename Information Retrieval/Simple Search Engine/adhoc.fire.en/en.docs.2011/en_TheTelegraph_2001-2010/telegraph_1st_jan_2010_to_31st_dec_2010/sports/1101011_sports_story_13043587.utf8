	New Delhi: Australias Alexandra Croak made a unique record by becoming the first athlete to win gold in two different sports at CWG on Sunday.         
	Croak, who won gold in the synchronised 10m platform in partnership with Melissa Wu on the opening day of the diving competition, had previously won gold in gymnastics in the teams event and silver in vault at 2002 Manchester Games.         
	The Aussie quit gymnastics after Manchester and started diving since 2004. She competed in Melbourne 2006, where she and Wu won silver in the same event they won on Sunday. But the two were forced to split when Wu went to stay in Brisbane and Croak settled in Sydney. But the duo came together once again when Wu moved to Sydney in January.                   In mens discus throw, Australias Benn Harradine won gold by recording a distance of 65.45m, while the bronze went to Carl Andrew Myerscough of Canada who managed a throw of 60.64m. Indias Vikas Gowda bagged silver.  
	Kenyans dominated the mens 800m race as their athletes won all the three medals at stake. While Boaz Lalang won the gold, the silver and the bronze went to Richard Kiplagat and Abraham Kipalgat, respectively.Leon Baptiste of England won the mens 200m.

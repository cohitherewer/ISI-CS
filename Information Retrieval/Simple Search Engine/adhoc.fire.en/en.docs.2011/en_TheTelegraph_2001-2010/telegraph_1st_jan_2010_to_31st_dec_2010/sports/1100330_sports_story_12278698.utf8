  - Mahela to lead Kings XI punjab in Sangakkaras absence       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Irfan Pathan and Brett Lee during a practice session, in Mumbai, on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: In sport, there are two varieties of pressure  a positive one demanding consistency of your good work and a negative one urging you to come out of your bad patch.         
	While the Mumbai Indians will experience the positive pressure, the Kings XI Punjab will feel the bite of the negative version when they clash in an Indian Premier League (IPL) tie at the Brabourne Stadium on Tuesday.         
	With 10 points from six matches, Sachin Tendulkars team cant be accused if they are optimistic about making the semi-finals.         
	Their comprehensive 41-run win over defending champions the Deccan Chargers on Sunday was marred by the $15,000 penalty imposed on Harbhajan Singh, who did the star turn actually. But such is the momentum the side has got that the episode is unlikely to hamper their preparations against the lowly Kings XI.         
	In fact, the Mumbai Indians have not been left with much time for preparation, let alone that to be hampered. With only a days gap between the two games, most of the players, including Harbhajan, decided to take their day off while the second rung went through an optional nets session on Monday.         
	Thats the way it is in IPL. At some stage, teams have two-three days break and some times they play back to back. If you have to finish the tournament in 45 days, thats how it has to be, TA Sekar, Mumbai Indians director of cricket, said on the eve of the match.         
	Kings XI, on the other hand, would be bogged down by the fact that they would be without their skipper Kumar Sangakkara, serving a ban following the teams slow over rate in the match against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Their key batsman Yuvraj Singh, who opened the innings the other night, has a sore wrist and skipped the match-eve practice but is expected to play.         
	In Sangakkaras absence, the team would be led by fellow Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene. Australian Shaun Marsh would replace Sangakkara, marking his maiden appearance this season.                 
	Manvinder Bisla is expected to don the wicketkeepers gloves while medium pacer Sreesanth has been left out for the match.         
	Sekar, however, said his team would not be taking the Punjab side lightly. In T20s, there can always be an upset. And in the IPL, all the eight teams are as good as any one of them, he said.         
	Much of the Mumbai sides success this season has so far revolved around Tendulkars awesome form and Sekar paid tributes to his captain.         
	He is a good student of the game and none at the moment has 20 years of international crickets experience like he does, he said.         
	He has made the players feel at home and knows exactly what he wants to do. He has shown that T20 is not all about sixes and fours.         
	The middle order, after a strong start when they posted 200-plus totals in the first two games, has shown some fragility, and if not for Harbhajans exploits with the willow, would have been in danger against the Chargers.         
	Whether Jayawardenes men can exploit that chink, it remains to be seen.

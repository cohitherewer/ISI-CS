The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dunga is best in business: Cesar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dunga is best in business: Cesar

	Johannesburg: Two days before Brazil take on Didier Drogbas Ivory Coast in a crucial World Cup match here, star goalkeeper Julio Cesar looked a relaxed man.         
	On Friday, when the Brazilian squad came down to the Saint Sthithians School for an unscheduled practice session, the Inter Milan custodian made it a point not to disappoint the autograph hunters. He even allowed some of them to be photographed with him.         
	Brazil had been practising at Randburg High School since their arrival in South Africa but decided to change the location because of poor ground condition. Large patches of grass came out when Brazils reserve team faced a local under-19 squad in a practice match on Thursday. The ground is generally used for rugby.         
	Finally, when Cesar met the waiting newspersons, he took on Dungas critics. He called the Brazilian coach the best in the business and said the present Brazil team would win the World Cup because of right tactics.         
	I think our performance against North Korea was not at all bad, said the goalkeeper. In fact it was good After all, it was our first match. The coach has adopted the right style. I dont think we have any reason to complain, said Cesar.         
	Cesar accepted that Kaka was not at his best against the Koreans. He is making a come back from injury He should be given more time. Once he gets back to his old self, Brazil cant be stopped. We are a balanced side. We have a good forward line and midfield. Our defence is the strongest in the world. We should win the Cup, said Cesar.         
	The Brazil goalkeeper said the North Koreans were too defensive. It was difficult to draw them out. How can you play attacking football against them? Tell me what did they do in the entire match? I had no role till we conceded the goal. It was so cold out there, it was freezing.         
	You do your best, you use a special powder, but when you have nothing to do, its very bad to play like that, especially in the cold. You have to try to keep warm and keep concentrating in case youre suddenly called upon to take part in the game.         
	Cesar, however, is aware that things wont be easy for Brazil in the next two matches against Ivory Coast and Portugal. We have to play against (Didier) Drogba and (Cristiano) Ronaldo. They are two players with completely different style. Without doubt we have to pay more attention to both of them.         
	Cesar rates Ronaldo higher than Drogba. Ronaldo is technically superior and has more skills, Cesar said.

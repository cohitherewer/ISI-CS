	London: Matches in this seasons Champions League will have two additional assistant referees, world governing body Fifa announced on Wednesday.         
	A meeting of the International Football Association Boards technical sub-committee (IFAB) agreed that an experiment carried out in last years Europa League would be extended to other competitions, most notably the Champions League.         
	At a special meeting of the IFAB held in Zurich on 18 May 2010, the Board had reviewed the experiment with two additional assistant referees that was carried out in the 2009/ 2010 Uefa Europa League, and had decided to continue the experiment until the 126th IFAB annual general meeting in 2012, but not to limit it to a single confederation, a statement said.         
	Wednesdays decision in Wales to widen the experiment means that two additional referees assistants will also be used in the AFC Presidents Cup in September, the French League Cup, the Uefa Super Cup as well as domestic competitions in Brazil and Mexico.

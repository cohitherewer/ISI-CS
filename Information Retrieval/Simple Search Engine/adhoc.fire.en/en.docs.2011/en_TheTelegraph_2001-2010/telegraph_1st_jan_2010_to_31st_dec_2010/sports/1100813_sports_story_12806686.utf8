                                                                                                                       7                                      Difficult to shift in death, too
                      
	Wellington: One of New Zealands greatest cricketers is proving as difficult to shift in death as he was in life.         
	Bert Sutcliffes ashes were buried at the Carisbrook ground in Dunedin in April 2001, but none can remember where the burial had exactly taken place. The ground is being redeveloped and the Sutcliffe family had agreed for the ashes to be relocated.         
	Dads ashes are proving as elusive as bowlers found taking his wicket, son Gary said.         
	The ground had been prodded with turf probes, combed by a metal detector all to no avail.         
	Sutcliffe played 42 Tests, with five centuries and an average of 40.1.           (REUTERS)

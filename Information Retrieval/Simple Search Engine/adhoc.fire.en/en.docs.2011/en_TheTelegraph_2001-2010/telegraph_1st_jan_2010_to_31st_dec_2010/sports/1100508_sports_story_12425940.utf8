The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: Shot selection was poor
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dhoni: Shot selection was poor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Team Indias Super Eight campaign in the world Twenty20 began on a wrong note when they succumbed to a 49-run defeat at the hands of Australia in Bridgetown on Friday.         
	Needing 185 for victory, the Indian batsmen, with the exception of Rohit Sharma (79 ..), surrendered meekly as they folded for 135 in 17.4 overs.         
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted at the post-match presentation ceremony that they were outplayed in all departments of the game. He was also of the view that the Indian top-order should have been a little more careful with their shot selection in the initial overs.         
	Dhonis counterpart Michael Clarke praised his teams all-round show for the victory.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Clarke: It was another good performance from us And it was also another good start by our openers. We have the best opening batsmen in the tournament and we are every pleased to have them. They set up the game for us today. More importantly, we did well in all the three departments of the game. We batted well and were outstanding in our bowling and fielding. The conditions over here were ideal for our fast bowlers, and the short boundaries helped our batsmen. Its good to see that our plan worked today (Friday). We always have a plan depending on the opposition and the conditions. We opted to use pace more than bounce to bowl the Indians out. From here on, we need to continue our winning momentum. We have two tough games coming up, and we need to concentrate on them.         
	Dhoni: We were thoroughly outplayed today. But we bowled well initially and the Aussies got the momentum once they managed those big hits. In fact, our bowlers did well during the last five overs to restrict the Aussies to a score less than 190. But we did give away 20 runs too much. Yet the target (185) was achievable. I have always maintained that during batting, the first few overs are crucial. On a wicket like this, which had bounce, it is wiser to leave a few deliveries initially. But today we played too many shots. Sometimes the adrenaline flow goes wrong. Today, we wanted to fight fire with fire and take on the Australian fast bowlers. We knew we would be peppered with short balls, which we did not handle too well. For the last 20 years, India have always had problem against the short ball. But we have done well in Durban, which is one of the quickest wickets. So we have been successful on and off. Im not thinking about the net run rate. We need to do well in the remaining matches and the net run rate can then take care of itself.         
	David Warner: I was a bit watchful to start with Its wiser to let the one who is striking the ball well lead the attack. Though at once stage we were well set for a 200-plus score, I think what we managed ultimately was good enough It was enough to give the bowlers the confidence.

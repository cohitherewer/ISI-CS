The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag end EBs winning streak
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag end EBs winning streak
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Chirag United staged a coup of sorts at the Ambedkar Stadium, on Thursday night, when they made their first ever Durand Cup final with a 1-0 victory over mighty East Bengal. In the final on Sunday, Chirag United will take on five-time champions JCT Phagwara.         
	Unbeaten in the last 18 matches, the red and yellow brigades dream run finally came to an end, when midfielder and man of the match Mohammed Rafiques hopeful left footer from the right found its way into the net off a deflection, in the 86th minute.         
	With only four minutes left, a stunned East Bengal could do little to alter the course of the contest before the Kerala referee Santosh Kumar blew the final whistle. Its a great win for my team, one of the best in recent time, said Chirag coach Subroto Bhattacharya. I have been saying for a long time that no team in India is unbeatable. My boys proved it tonight, he added.         
	Without taking any credit away from Bhattacharya, it was certainly not East Bengals day. Without top five players in the line-up, the Federation Cup champions were a depleted lot and found it hard to maintain their style of play in the midfield.         
	The absence of midfielder Mehtab Hossain because of two yellow cards was East Bengals biggest handicap. To add to this, four other key players  Penn Orji (ankle injury), Tolgay Ozebe (hamstring), Vashum (knee injury) and Ekene Ekenewa (stomach upset)  also did not make the first eleven. It was next to impossible for coach Trevor Morgan to chalk out a working strategy.         
	Late in the match, Morgan tried to add some life into East Bengal attacks by bringing in Ekene Ekenwa, but it was too late. All that the foreign recruit could do during his six minutes stay on the pitch was to have a swing at the goal, which completely missed the target.         
	Bhattacharya also agreed that absence of key players in East Bengal played a role behind his teams victory. Initially I planned to play defensive but went for the 4-4-2 formation only after I found that five of their players were not playing. East Bengal were definitely depleted by their absence, he said.         
	In a match that remained mediocre for most part, Chirag had more chances but Rafique and Denson Devdas wasted easy opportunities in front of the rival goal. On three occasions they had the goalkeeper Sandeep Nandy at their mercy but all they managed was to head the ball over the crosspiece.         
	East Bengals best chance came in the 83rd minute when Naoba Sin-ghs curling shot hit the post but Robin Singh made a mess of the rebound.         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Abhijit Mondal; Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, Chika Wali, Justine Stephen and Narugopal Hait; Mohammed Rafique (Arnab Mondal, 89th), Denson Devdas, Subhas Chakrabarty and Gaouranga Biswas; Josimar and Asif K.         
	East Bengal: Sandeep Nandy; Naoba Singh, Nirmal Chetri, Uga Okpara and Saumik Dey; Harmonjit Singh Khabra, Sanju Pradhan, Sushant Mathew and Ravinder Singh; Robin Singh and Budiram Tudu (Ekene Ekenewa, 84th).         
	Referee: Santosh Kumar.

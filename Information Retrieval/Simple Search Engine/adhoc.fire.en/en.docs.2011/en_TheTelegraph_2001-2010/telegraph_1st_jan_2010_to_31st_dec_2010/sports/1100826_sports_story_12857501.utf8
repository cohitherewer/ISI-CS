                                                                                                                       7                                        Deep not resting on laurels
            A STAFF REPORTER            Deep Sengupta                           
	Calcutta: Deep Sengupta, Indias latest Grandmaster, says he will strive hard to reach the 2600 Elo rating.         
	Basking in glory, post his GM title in March and some brilliant performances in France early this month  he won two and had a fifth finish in the third meet  the 22-year-old will be the chief attraction when the 5th Tea Board of India Chess for Youth meet gets underway, at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, on September 2.         
	I am really playing well. But I cant afford to rest on my laurels. My next goal is to reach the 2600 Elo mark, Deep, who at present has a rating of 2557, said on Wednesday.         
	I have to keep on performing well because just being a Grandmaster doesnt help. You need to be consistent, he said.         
	Deep said he doesnt believe in playing mind games against opponents as most chess players do. I dont do that. I try to keep it as simple as possible, he said.         
	Deep said being from a small town  Chakradharpur in Jharkhand  had been a problem for him during his early days.         
	I would often come to know of a tournament after it ended. But once Dibyendu sir (Barua) came to Chakradharpur and saw me playing, there was no looking back, Deep, who is now based in Calcutta, said.         
	The world under-12 winner in 2000, Deep is now focusing on the National A meet. I want to do well. I am preparing for that, the defending champion of the premier section of the Chess for Youth meet said.         
	Meanwhile, Dibyendu informed that around 500 participants will be seen in action during the four-day meet.         
	While the premier section is for Indian players below 25, the junior category will be only for local players. The last date for entry is August 31.         
	Kapil Dev will be inaugurating the tournament, jointly organised by Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy and Allsports Management.         
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will be present during the closing ceremony, an official said.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin is at peace with his batting, says Ravi Shastri
    - Former India captain on the maestros 3 best ODI innings             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Sachin after his   world record-creating   200 not out in Gwalior                                             
	Calcutta: Few outside Sachin Tendulkars family know him better than Ravi Shastri, a former India captain and cricket manager. In town for the IPL matches, he spoke to The Telegraph, listing Sachins top three ODI innings  limited overs action-time, after all.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youve known Sachin for over 20 years... Youve played with him, too... He has featured in just one T20 for India, but hundreds of ODIs... Which have been his best 50-over innings?         
	A The unbeaten 200 (vs South Africa, in Gwalior)... That would be at the top... It was a masterclass, such a clinical execution of plans... Indeed, it was like a surgery. The way he pierced the field, found the gaps... It was brilliant... Then, Id pick his 134 in the 1998 Sharjah final (against Australia)... After that, Id go for his 98 in the 2003 World Cup (vs Pakistan, in Centurion).         
	Some words on Sachins innings in Sharjah and in Centurion...         
	Again, both had class written all over... In Sharjah, there was a little more audacity and daring as compared to the 200 this February. Hed then toyed with the attack in brutal manner... Sachin was younger and stronger then, you know... That 98 was in a pressure match... The quality of stroke-play and the overall quality of batsmanship was in an entirely different league.         
	How is it all so different for Sachin?         
	(Laughs) Twenty years in the game and the guy is still greedy! That being so, its not a good omen for bowlers around the world... I see Sachin being there for another three years, at least... His appetite has not diminished and I just feel hes been batting better in the last two-three years... Thats remarkable... He seems to be at peace with himself, is very relaxed... A lot, of course, has to do with the team hes playing in... Today, he doesnt have to feel that hes the only one who has to score... There are other players who get into the act and complement each other... Bottom line, then, is that hes at peace with his batting and thats being reflected in his performances.         
	The dressing room atmosphere created by Team India coach Gary Kirsten appears to have helped in a big way...         
	Exactly, everyones at peace... Sachin wouldnt be in this state of mind if the surroundings werent good... Clearly, theres nothing which is irritating him... Hes comfortable focusing on his game and looking at the teams interests.         
	Should Sachin now actually target Brian Laras Test record (400 not out), the only major one not against his name?         
	Look, he shouldnt be bothered about any record and just play his game... He should do so for another three years or so and, if hes not injured, hell continue to give us plenty of enjoyment... In the immediate future, I see him getting past 100 international hundreds... See that happening rather quickly.         
	[Sachin has reached 93  47 in Tests, 46 in ODIs.]         
	Finally, what can youngsters learn from Sachin?         
	They should study his entire career... Watch his tapes... Watch the making of history... Theres no end to what youngsters can learn from Sachin.

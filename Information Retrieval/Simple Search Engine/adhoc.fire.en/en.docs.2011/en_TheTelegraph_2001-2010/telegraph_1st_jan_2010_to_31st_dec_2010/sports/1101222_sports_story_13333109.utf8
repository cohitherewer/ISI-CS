The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen salutes Tendulkar 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pietersen salutes Tendulkar 
                      
	London: Kevin Pietersen feels that Sachin Tendulkar has raised the bar so high by scoring 50 Test centuries that it would be hard for the other cricketers to surpass his record.         
	He is just a legend of the game. To score 20 or even 30 Test hundreds would represent a magnificent career, but to go on and score 50 is remarkable, said Pietersen.         
	He has set the benchmark for other batsmen to follow, but the truth is it is hard to see how anyone can truly follow him because he is moving the bar so high, he added.         
	The 37-year-old Tendulkar became the first cricketer in history to score 50 Test hundreds, against South Africa in Centurion on Sunday.         
	Pietersen said more than Tendulkars stupendous batting feats, he was amazed by the Indians longevity at the top level, his fitness and work ethic.         
	It is not simply about ability where Sachin is concerned, it is about longevity, fitness, and hard work. And to cap it all he is such a gentleman.         
	I watch him bat and sometimes I wonder how he makes it look so easy. He has an unbelievable gift and he has made the most of it and long may he continue, Pietersen was quoted as saying by a tabloid.         
	Tendulkar and Pietersen became friends in 2008 and they both played in the Indian Premier League, but for different franchises.         
	Im lucky to have been able to get to know him, said Pietersen. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal slips to tied 25th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal slips to tied 25th
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: An erratic even-par 71 saw Indian golfer Arjun Atwal slip nine places to tied 25th after the second round of the Asian and PGA Tour co-sanctioned CIMB Asia Pacific Classic here today.         
	Atwals overall score stood at three-under 139 after he slotted in five birdies against an equal number of bogeys in an eventful day. In his front-nine, the Orlando-based golfer, who is the lone Indian in fray at the event, gained a couple of shots but dropped an equal number of bogeys to make the turn even-par.         
	And it remained even-par for the day when he picked up three birdies and three bogeys in his backward journey. At the top, American Ben Crane (64) and local favourite Pariya Junhasavasdikul (65) shared the the lead with totals of 11-under 131.

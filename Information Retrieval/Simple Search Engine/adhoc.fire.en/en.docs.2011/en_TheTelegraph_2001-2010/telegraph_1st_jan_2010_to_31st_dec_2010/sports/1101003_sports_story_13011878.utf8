                                                                                                                       7                                      Paine all praise   for Viru 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mohali: Australia wicketkeeper Tim Paine said on Saturday that while it is entertaining to watch Virender Sehwag bat, it is extremely frustrating to be on the rough end of the stick.         
	Speaking at a media conference on Saturday, Paine, who got out on 92, said: Its good to watch Sehwag, but it can be frustrating. When I batted it seemed the track was difficult, and then he comes in and makes it look so easy. He is a world class batsman.         
	Even though the wicket behaved rather sluggishly, Paine believed the match was evenly poised.         
	According to the Aussie, 428 was a good score to defend.

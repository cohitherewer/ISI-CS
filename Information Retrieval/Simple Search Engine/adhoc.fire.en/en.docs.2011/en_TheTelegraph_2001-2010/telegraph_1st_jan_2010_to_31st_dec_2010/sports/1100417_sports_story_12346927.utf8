The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Quail Hollow is next on the Tigers plate Tiger Woods
                                                                                                                       7                                        Quail Hollow is next on the Tigers plate

	It looks like business as usual for Tiger Woods from now on after he announced on Thursday that his second comeback tournament will be the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, from April 29-May 2.         
	The tournament is a regular station on his post-Masters calendar and appears to confirm Woodss intention to resume his normal schedule.         
	Woods usually uses Quail Hollow as a warm-up event for the so-called fifth major, the Players Championship, and judging by Thursdays announcement, he can now be expected at both that tournament at Sawgrass and the Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village a week later.         
	After last weeks Masters at Augusta, when his much-trumpeted return to golf after a five-month absence passed without incident, Woods had hinted at another short break from the game, expressing his intention to take a little time off and re-evaluate things. However, this process appears to have taken less than a week, with Woods yet again returning earlier than anticipated.         
	It will be Woodss first experience of a boisterous crowd, rather than the reverential congregation that politely applauded him to a fourth place finish at Augusta. Clearly Woods feels ready to enter the gladiatorial arena once more, although it is safe to assume that his wife, Elin, will not be accompanying him.         
	Although he planned to contest the US Open at Pebble Beach in June, it was thought that he would maintain a sparse itinerary, perhaps turning up at Sawgrass on May 6 as a favour to Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner.         
	The timing of the announcement is also telling. Following the early submission of his US Open entry form earlier this week, Woods has again opted to make his decision ahead of schedule rather than leaving it until the last minute, as he has tended to do in the past.

            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Trainer Daniel David is the one to follow in Wednesdays six-event card, featuring the 1,600m Moon Fairy Cup which may witness a close contest between Burst Of Speed and Caravaggio. However, going by her two facile wins, Burst Of Speed is expected to defy the stiff penalty slapped on her last win and she may score in the hands of jockey A. Imran Khan. Daniels Desert Image and Asiatic Boy are also judiciously prepared to win their respective events. Trainer Errol Bhungards Ardent Prince is the other one who may not let down in the 4.30pm event.

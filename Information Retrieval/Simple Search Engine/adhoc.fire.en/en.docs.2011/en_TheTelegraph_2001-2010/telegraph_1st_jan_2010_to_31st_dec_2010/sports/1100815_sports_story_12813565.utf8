	Kohler: Matt Kuchar held onto his lead at the PGA Championship without hitting a shot as the second round was finally completed Saturday.         
	Jim Furyk climbed up the leaderboard with a flurry of birdies and Tiger Woods birdied three of his last nine holes to survive the cut and remain in contention to win the last major of the year.         
	Woods, one of 78 players who returned to the Whistling Straits course early to complete their second rounds, shot a two-under-par 70 to reach the halfway stage at three-under. That left him in a tie for 21st place, five strokes behind overnight leader Kuchar and four behind second-placed Nick Watney.         
	With the dots where they are for this afternoon, theres some really tough pins, but theres some pretty accessible pins, Woods said of the third-round set-up.         
	Seventy-two players made the cut at 1-over. Among those who didnt were Padraig Harrington, who had gotten himself back to even par only to double-bogey the 18th hole. British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen, US Open winner Graeme McDowell, defending PGA champ Y.E. Yang and Ryder Cup captains Corey Pavin and Colin Montgomerie also missed the cut.         
	Players will go off of both tees and in groups of three Saturday afternoon in the hope of making up some of the time lost in the long fog delays that delayed the start of play Thursday and Friday.         
	Furyk birdied four of his first five holes after play resumed Saturday morning, finishing with a 68 that got him to 6 under. J.B. Holmes (66) is also at six-under, trailing Kuchar by two strokes and Nick Watney by one. Bubba Watson (71), Vijay Singh (66) and Ryan Palmer (68) joined the big group at five-under.         
	But the biggest mover was Woods. The turmoil in his personal life has spilled over onto the golf course, and he arrived at Whistling Straits fresh off the worst performance of his career. After showing flashes of his old masterful self in the first round, Woods was back to the unpredictable play thats dogged him all season.         
	It looked like more of the same Saturday, when he had to scramble early just to make the turn at even par. But he settled down with a birdie to start the back nine, and his 70 has him at 3 under  close enough that Kuchar and everyone else ahead of Woods ought to keep an eye on him.         
	This was the first time he was under par in back-to-back rounds since the Memorial  and it could have been even better. After hitting to 8 feet for a birdie on 17, he pulled off a spectacular 5-wood out of the bunker on 18. He almost made birdie there, too, but his long putt stopped a few inches short of the hole.         
	The fog that has wreaked havoc on tee times at the PGA and further muddled what was already a wide-open championship finally lifted Saturday, and the golfers who came back early to finish their second rounds found far more favourable conditions. The wind that had been gusting Friday night was down to a whisper, the humidity was less oppressive and skies were mostly clear.(Agencies)

	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans unbeaten streak in the premier division of the Calcutta Football League (CFL) continued Saturday with a 3-0 victory over Tollygunge Agragami at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	This win helped the green and maroon brigade go on top of the CFL table with 24 points from eight matches.         
	The match began on a slow note but a penalty, awarded to Bagan in the 38th minute, changed the momentum.         
	In the very next minute, veteran Jose Ramirez Barreto placed the ball in the corner of the net, without giving goalkeeper Raju Ganguly a chance, for Bagan to go up 1-0.         
	Bagan made it 2-0 two minutes before the breather. Man of the Match Ryuji Sueoka got a pass from Souvik Chakraborty to slam the ball straight into the net, bypassing the custodian for a 2-0 lead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf rap for Afridi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yousuf rap for Afridi
                  Yousuf                     
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Muhammad Yousuf is baffled by teammate Shahid Afridis ball-tampering act in the fifth and final one-day international against Australia in Perth.         
	I dont know why he did it but it brought a bad name to the country, the good thing is that at least he realised his mistake and admitted it. I hope he does not repeat it again. Pakistan cricket does not need such incidents, Yousuf said.         
	The skipper returned here on Wednesday after a humiliating Australian tour where they were whitewashed in both one-day and Test series.         
	Yousuf said he does not intend to step down despite a disappointing performance Down Under.         
	I accepted the captaincy for these difficult tours at a time when no player was willing to accept this challenge. I think I have done a decent job and I want to continue as captain, I will not resign, he said when asked to comment on statements from the PCB that they would appoint a new captain after the Australian tour.         
	Yousuf contended that statement like that affected performance of the team in the one-day series.         
	It did affect our performances as it hit the morale of the team and some players started fancying their chances of becoming captain, he said, reacting to PCB chairman Ejaz Butts statement that younger player will be handed over the reins of the team.         
	The senior batsman said there was no need to make the statement during the series and even if the board wanted to remove him it was their decision.         
	I admit our performance was bad throughout the series, it was an unsuccessful tour for us. The results against Australia could have been better but our fielding and batting let us down.         
	Yousuf said he was not a defensive captain but tried to lead the team according to the situation and strength of team in both the series.         
	Meanwhile, embattled Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt refused to step down after the National Assemblys standing committee on sports asked him to resign.         
	Some people are trying to pressurise and blackmail me but why should I resign, I have done nothing wrong. Let them prove their allegations, and I will resign. Only the chief patron who has appointed me can ask me to resign, Butt said.

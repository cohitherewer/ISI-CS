	Calcutta: On the field, the most endearing sight was when a delirious Harbhajan Singh came sprinting towards the Dr BC Roy Club House acknowledging the cheers of the crowd. But off it, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his band of bravehearts decided to keep the celebrations low-key.         
	Unlike the 2001 epic win against Australia at the Eden, there was no one to uncork the bubbly in the dressing room. Injured Zaheer Khan left for the airport to catch an early evening flight to Mumbai. The Delhi boys  Ishant Sharma and Gautam Gambhir  had soon left for Delhi. The others will be leaving by Friday afternoon.         
	Late on Thursday, the players who have stayed back had a party of sorts at the poolside of the team hotel.         
	So, the players might not have gone overboard, with the celebrations, but for 14-year-olds Subhashish Bhattacharya and Kanik Seth it was a day that will forever remain etched in memory.         
	After all, not everyone is lucky enough to be presented with cricket gear by the Indian captain. A little after the match was over, Dhoni quietly came out of the dressing room with a couple of wicket-keeping pads and gloves. The proud recipients, Kanik and Subhashish, were beaming with joy. The Indian captain, in fact, autographed the pads.         
	I dont know whether I will ever wear these pads. Rather than using it, this is something I can only possess with a sense of belonging. During one of the practice sessions, he saw me knocking and praised me. Then he asked what I did. I told him I was a keeper. He then promised to give me his keeping gear at the end of the match. I couldnt believe it when I saw him coming out with the gear, an ecstatic Subhashish said on Thursday.         
	Did Dhoni tell you anything else? He was happy to learn that I come from Kharagpur where he was posted for a number of years. (Dhoni was posted in Kharagpur when he was an employee of the Indian Railways). Subhashish plays for City AC in the CAB second division league while Kanik, who is a trainee at the Videocon School of Cricket, plays in the second division for Narkeldanga Sir Gurudas Institute.

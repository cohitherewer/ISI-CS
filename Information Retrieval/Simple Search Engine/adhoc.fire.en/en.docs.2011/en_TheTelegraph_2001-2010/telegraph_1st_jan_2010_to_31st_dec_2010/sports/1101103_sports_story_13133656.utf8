The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Despite barbs, Smith stands by Herschelle
                                                                                                                       7                                        Despite barbs, Smith stands by Herschelle
                  Graeme Smith                     
	Johannesburg: Despite being accused of creating a divide in the team by Herschelle Gibbs in his autobiography, To the Point, South African skipper Graeme Smith said the out-of-favour opener could still make a comeback to the national team.         
	Like every other player he is still welcome in the team, as long as his performances justify it and if he is willing to have an open discussion with every guy he discusses in the book, said Smith.         
	The team and the game are more important than any player, and that includes myself, he added.         
	In the tell-all book, Gibbs wrote that Smith was hopelessly too powerful and even coach Mickey Arthur struggled to assert himself when faced with the skipper.         
	The book also gave accounts of his sexual escapades, involving other South African players as well, during overseas tours.         
	I havent read the book yet, but I have to confess that the rest of the team and I are hurt by some of the things he says, Smith was quoted as saying in a website.         
	It is outrageous to allege that there is a culture of debauchery, Smith said.         
	Coming back to accusations of divisions in the South Africa squad, Smith said: In every team there is usually a group of senior players that takes the lead, just like in a successful business.         
	If Herschelle ever felt left out, its a sign of his own insecurity. Someone like AB is far more junior to him and should never have been a threat to him.         
	According to Smith, despite everything, the team carried Gibbs through the most difficult times of his life.         
	The South African skipper said that he would still like to stay friends with Gibbs.         
	Gibbs, however, is unruffled by his teammates criticism. The opener said he got a message from Smith asking about the claims made in the book. My answer to him was it didnt take a rocket scientist to figure that out, he said.         
	Among others miffed by Gibbs claims, Proteas batting consultant Kepler Wessels, said: This surely puts an end to any hopes he had of playing for South Africa again.           (PTI)

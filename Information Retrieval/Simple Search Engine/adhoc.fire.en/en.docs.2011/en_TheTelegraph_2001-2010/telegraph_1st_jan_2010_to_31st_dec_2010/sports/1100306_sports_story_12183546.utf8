	Kuala Lumpur: Four Indian golfers, including Shiv Kapur and C. Muniyappa, missed the cut as just half of Indias 10-man contingent could complete their second round in the Malaysian Open on Friday.         
	Veteran Jyoti Randhawa withdrew after his nightmarish opening round of 77, while it was end of the road for Muniyappa (145), Kapur (146) and Himmat Singh Rai (146).         
	Anirban Lahiri, who had carded 75 on Thursday, needs a three-under second round card to hang in for weekend action and the youngster was two-under after nine holes.         
	Arjun Atwal was at the provisional 15th place at three-under. Joining him was SSP Chowrasia who was going even par after just two holes. (PTI)

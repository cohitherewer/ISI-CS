The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill rope in Dias, Rafi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Churchill rope in Dias, Rafi
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Steven Dias                           
	Mumbai: Steven Dias and Mohammed Rafi, star players of the soon-to-be-shut Mahindra United, would be playing for Churchill Brothers in the I-League next season.         
	One of the familiar scenes in Mahindras matches has been Dias, a key India player, making a perfect cross and Rafi connecting it for a goal. Captain KN Ajayan could move either to Pune FC or Salgaocar, most likely the Goan club, team sources said.         
	Among the foreigners, Svetozar Mijin would not be returning to India.         
	For me, its tough to find accommodation here. The weather is killing, Mijin, who started on the bench in most matches, told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	Mohun Bagan have already roped in Mahindra striker Muritala Ali.

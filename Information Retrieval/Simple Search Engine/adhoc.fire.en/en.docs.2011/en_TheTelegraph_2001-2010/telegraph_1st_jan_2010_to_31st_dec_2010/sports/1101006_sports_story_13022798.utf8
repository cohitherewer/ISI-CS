The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | VVS shouldve been the MoM
                                                                                                                       7                                        VVS shouldve been the MoM
  - A remarkable achievement, says Zaheer Khan       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Zaheer Khan                                 
	Mohali: Zaheer Khans reverse swing was one of the key factors that led to the downfall of Ricky Pontings men, in both the innings.         
	The Man of the Match lauded VVS Laxman for his effort at the press conference.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The VVS Laxman show         
	It was indeed a Very, Very Special performance He has done it so many times for us. A remarkable achievement Full credit to Laxman for the way he batted today (Tuesday). If I were asked to adjudge the Man of the Match, I would have given it to him. Laxmans presence in the dressing room creates a calm atmosphere.         
	Laxmans injury         
	Luckily he was fit enough today to bat. However, I had asked him after the days play and he said it is yet to heal properly. He is working with the physio on that.         
	His eight-wicket haul in the match         
	It is always tough in the subcontinent. It is a hard job for the seamers. But in this match, pacers from both the teams did a fantastic job and a great effect on the match.         
	Thoughts of the team when Sachin was dismissed         
	We were hoping that there would be one partnership that would carry us through. Just then Sachin got out. There was some tension. Everyone was nervous and we were trying to maintain our composure.         
	Tension in such matches         
	Theres a lot of nerves involved in such crunch ties. When two top teams are fighting hard, such tension is natural. We just try to concentrate on the game and not think about the result.         
	Performance as a team         
	We have been doing well collectively for the past couple of years. We are getting good results as a team.         
	The victory         
	We fought really hard in this Test. It was a superb day of cricket from both the teams. Luckily, we did enough to snatch a win and gain momentum in the two-match series.         
	Some dubious umpiring decisions         
	The important thing for us is that we won the match. Errors will always be there in cricket, and that is how it has been. But yes, if technology is available, it should be provided to the umpires.

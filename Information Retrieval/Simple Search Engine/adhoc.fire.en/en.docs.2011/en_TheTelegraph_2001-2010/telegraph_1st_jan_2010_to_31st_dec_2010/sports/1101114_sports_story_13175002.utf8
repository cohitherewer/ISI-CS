                                                                                                                       7                                      History beckons Alonso
                      
	Ferraris Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, who is eight points ahead of Red Bulls Mark Webber and 15 clear of Sebastian Vettel, has the best chance to win the 2010 drivers title, in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, on Sunday. The Spaniard is sitting pretty after hauling himself to third place in the closing seconds, on Saturday.         
	If the finishing order stays the same as the start  Vettel first, Lewis Hamilton second and Alonso third  then Alonso will become the sports youngest triple champion.         
	Following are the permutations and the combinations          
	 Fernando Alonso (Spain) Ferrari 246 points:         
	If he wins or finishes second, the title is his.         
	Third or fourth place will be enough if Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel wins the race.         
	Fifth place secures the title on race wins if neither Red Bull is first.         
	Sixth is sufficient providing Red Bulls Mark Webber is no higher than third and Vettel does not win.         
	Seventh or eighth makes him champion if Webber is not on the podium and Vettel does not win.         
	Ninth does the trick on race wins if Webber is no higher than fifth and Vettel is out of the top two.         
	Tenth is good if Webber is out of the top five and Vettel out of the top two.         
	Alonso will also be champion without scoring another point if Webber finishes out of the top five, Vettel is no higher than third and McLarens Lewis Hamilton does not win.         
	 Mark Webber (Australia) Red Bull 238 points         
	Webber is champion if he wins and Alonso is not second.         
	Second wins the title, providing Vettel does not win and Alonso is no higher than sixth.         
	Third is sufficient if Alonso is out of the top six and Vettel does not win.         
	Fourth will do if Alonso is no higher than ninth and Vettel does not win.         
	Fifth takes the title if Alonso is 10th or lower and Vettel is out of the top two.         
	 Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Red Bull 231 points         
	Vettel is champion if he wins Sundays race and Alonso finishes fifth or lower.         
	Should Vettel win, with Webber second and Alonso fifth then all three will end up with 256 points. However Vettel would beat Webber 5-4 on race wins and Alonso on a countback to fourth places (They both have two seconds and three thirds while Vettel has three fourths to the Spaniards two).         
	Second place is enough for Vettel providing Webber is no higher than fifth and Alonso out of the top eight.         
	 Lewis Hamilton (Britain) McLaren 222 points         
	Hamilton must win to be champion. Even then, he needs Alonso to finish out of the points, Webber no higher than sixth and Vettel third or lower.           (AGENCIES)

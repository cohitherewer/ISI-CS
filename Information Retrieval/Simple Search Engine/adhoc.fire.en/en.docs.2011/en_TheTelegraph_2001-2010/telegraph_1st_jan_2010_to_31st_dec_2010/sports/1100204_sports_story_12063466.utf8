The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohit in as Laxmans cover
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rohit in as Laxmans cover
    - My back is absolutely fine, says Mahendra Singh Dhoni             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday                                 
	Nagpur: With V.V.S. Laxman still not 100 per cent fit, the national selectors have added Rohit Sharma to the India squad for the first Test against South Africa, in neighbouring Jamtha, from Saturday.         
	Laxman hasnt fully recovered from the injury to his left hand, sustained while fielding on the fourth day in Chittagong. That was on January 20 and he had to return home early from Bangladesh.         
	The senior pro didnt take part during the teams fielding practice on Wednesday afternoon, but he did bat at nets.         
	Afterwards, Laxman was overheard saying Im better. Hed reported here after two sessions of nets in Hyderabad.         
	Two first XI batsmen  Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh  are already out through injury.         
	Rohit, in the city for the Board Presidents match against the visitors, was understandably delighted when one spoke to him at the Pride Hotel, late in the evening.         
	It feels good that Ive been asked to stay back... Bahut hi achcha lag raha hai, Rohit, a triple centurion in this seasons Ranji Trophy, maintained.         
	Rohit scored no more than 20, but has an excellent technique, with many seeing him as the logical successor to, say, Dravid.         
	The selectors, with Krishnamachari Srikkanth in the chair, had to fall back on somebody as theyd picked one reserve batsman short in the XV. Instead, theyd chosen a second wicket-keeper, Wriddhiman Saha.         
	In hindsight, they shouldve done better: Either named a XVIth player or not selected Laxman for Test No.1.         
	But while the selectors didnt want to take a chance with the captains back, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is absolutely fine.         
	Dhoni told The Telegraph: My back is absolutely fine... There are no issues over it... Last month, though, hed been forced to miss the Chittagong Test owing to back spasms.         
	In a one-on-one in Jamtha, after the first nets session ahead of the two-Test series, Dhoni accepted that former captain Dravids absence would be felt, but quickly added that one cant have any control over injuries.         
	He said: Obviously, well miss Dravid, but one cant have any control over injuries... Its like a captain having no control at all over the toss... Dravid suffered an on-field injury (on the left jaw bone) and, as it turned out, had to undergo surgery...         
	Asked whether he was conscious of the Test rankings, with South Africa being No.2, pretty close behind India, Dhoni replied: The series wont be about who is placed where, but about playing well... (Irrespective of the rankings) Youve still got to play to potential...         
	Had Graeme Smith, the South Africa captain, tried to put India under pressure by conceding that the hosts were the favourites?         
	But were always under pressure... You cant cite even one series when we havent been so... In fact, we were under pressure in Bangladesh, too... The expectations are always high, Dhoni pointed out, grinning.         
	Dhoni, by the way, had 50 grammes shaved off a new bat. That seemingly harmless exercise fuelled speculation, in some quarters, that it had something to do with his recent back problem.

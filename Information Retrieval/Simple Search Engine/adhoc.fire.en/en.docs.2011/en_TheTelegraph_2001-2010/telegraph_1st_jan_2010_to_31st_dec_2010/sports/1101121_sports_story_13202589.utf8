	Abu Dhabi: A 37th Test century from Jacques Kallis and an unbeaten 120 by AB de Villiers helped South Africa weather early blows and end the first day strongly at 311 for five, in the second Test against Pakistan, at the Zayed Cricket Stadium, on Saturday.         
	Kallis and De Villiers put on 179 for the fourth wicket after debutant Tanveer Ahmed had helped reduce South Africa to 33 for three in the sixth over. Ahmed, the lone bright spot for Pakistan, finished the day with figures of four for 67.         
	It was a second hundred in successive Tests for Kallis and his fifth this year alone. After Ahmeds three-wicket burst had left South Africa tottering, Kallis and De Villiers proved the wicket was playable, scoring at more than 4.5 runs per over. De Villiers and Mark Boucher (26) were at the crease at close.         
	Pakistan not only surprised everyone with the decision to field on a flat wicket but also to give the 31-year-old Ahmed the opening ball ahead of Mohammed Sami. Ahmed rewarded that faith by sending back South Africas top three in the space of 29 balls.         
	Opener Alviro Petersen was the first go, caught in the slips by captain Misbah-ul-Haq off Ahmeds third ball in Test cricket.         
	Hashim Amla, the Proteas most in-form batsman who needed just six run to complete 1000 this year alone, was adjudged caught behind when the ball brushed his thigh pad after scoring four. Captain Graeme Smith also was caught behind a few overs later.         
	The fourth-wicket pair of Kallis and De Villiers steadied the tourists before moving from strength to strength in the session after lunch. Kallis, who hit his first six on the back foot off the bowling of Ahmed, struck two more straight back over spinner Abdur Rehmans head  a trick De Villiers repeated.         
	Kallis was eventually out for 105 from 147 balls, with 12 fours and three sixes. He was removed soon after tea when Ahmed returned and extracted enough reverse swing to force Kallis to play on to his stumps.

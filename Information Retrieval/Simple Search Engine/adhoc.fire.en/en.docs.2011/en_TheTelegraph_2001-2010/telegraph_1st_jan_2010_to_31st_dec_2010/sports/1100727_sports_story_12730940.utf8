                                                                                                                       7                                        Maradona is ready, but with a rider 
                  Maradona                     
	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona Monday met Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona, but neither said a public word about whether the legendary player will stay on as coach of the national team.         
	Maradona said before meeting Grondona that he wants to keep coaching Argentina as long as he can keep his entire coaching staff.         
	If they touch the kit man, if they touch the massage therapist, Im out, Maradona said early Monday in an interview with a TV broadcaster as he arrived at the Ezeiza airport from Venezuela.         
	But Grondona imposed his conditions as well during their meeting, which AFA spokesman Ernesto Cherquis Bialo described as cordial and deep.         
	Neither side immediately answered the question of the day  whether Maradona will stay on as coach  ahead of a meeting Tuesday between Grondona and AFAs executive committee, where Cherquis Bialo said the association president would describe in detail his discussion with Maradona.         
	Maradona said the players support him and that he feels eager to keep coaching the national team despite Argentinas 0-4 loss to Germany in the World Cup quarter finals  but only if he can continue to lead the team in his unique way, without staff changes imposed by AFA.

                  SERVE VOLLEY
     Naresh Kumar                                  Roger Federer       
	The late night and pre-dawn vigils left us bleary eyed and exhausted. But it was worth it. The exciting 2010 Australian Open came to a thrilling climax when Federer broke away from the peloton and left his challengers in the dust. Andy Murray, the odds on favourite to dethrone Federer, ranged alongside briefly in the final but could not break through. Murray was reduced to tears.         
	In his post-match speech he said that he could cry like Federer but it was a shame that he could not play like him. Serving for the third set at 53 and thereafter having five set points in the 13/11 tiebreaker, Murray failed to clinch what could have become the turning point of a gruelling match.         
	The bitterly fought tiebreaker was tension packed and sent the heart racing. Both players were affected by the tension but the 28-year-old Federer dug deep to pull off his 16th Grand Slam. The New York Times summed it up beautifully, With Australian Title, Federer returns from Vulnerable to Invincible.         
	The final left little doubt about Federers emphatic superiority. In simple terms, Federer had less enforced errors, hit more winners and aces than Murray.         
	What distances Federer even further from the pack is that he is able to produce winners and aces on important points and in tiebreakers. Federers suspect backhand was everybodys target from the first round onwards.         
	It never wilted and Federer fearlessly kept on going for it. As the tournament progressed, it got better and better and eventually was honed to become a potent weapon in his final against Murray.         
	Especially the down the line backhand, which is one of the most difficult shots in the game. In modern tennis it is a match winner because it dislodges the opponent from the left corner of the base line from where they all tend to control the rallies.         
	Besides being highly strung, Murrays shortcomings are his reluctance to attack in spite of being a good volleyer. Also Murray stands too far behind the baseline which forces him to cover much more ground for the angled shots.         
	Significantly his apology to the fans back home for letting them down highlights the crushing load of expectation he is carrying. He sees himself as the saviour who will end the 74-year-old British Grand Slam draught.         
	Federer in his victory speech, gauging Murrays deep despair, said: Youre too good not to win a Grand Slam. Dont worry about it. Murrays loyal high decibel support team with raised fists and clenched teeth in my view, raise the tension to higher levels when what Murray needs is to relax and play freely. A loose free hitting Murray could make an impact on the history of the game. The best advice to Murray came from a letter to him published in one of the newspapers.         
	In brief it said forget that you are British Scottish or whatever. Pretend you are a Martian, forget 73 years of no trophies because that is not your problem and remove the pressure.         
	The peloton chasing Federer is like a pack of hungry wolves. All are younger than the 28-year-old champion and they no longer believe that Federer is invincible.         
	Federer too feels the heat and said in an interview said: Im being pushed a great deal by the new generation coming up.         
	From the fast hard courts of Melbourne their quarry is moving into the testing fires of the slow clay courts in Europe  Federers weakest surface.         
	Federer summed up the improved standards in the game saying: when I came on tour, matches were played very differently. It was more of a bluff game, guys serving well, but there was always a weakness you could go to. The many long rallies of over 20 shots at unbelievable speed yet accurate have brought the game close to perfection. But in achieving such a level in highly competitive conditions, players often violate bio-mechanic limits of the body and go through unbearable mental pressure.         
	Almost every player is carrying an injury and 70 per cent of the injuries, one is told, are due to overuse of limbs. Players who are forced to retire because of injuries, as well as medical time outs, during matches have become a common sight.         
	How does one solve the mystery of Federers unparalleled reign? Loose limbed and casual looking without rippling muscles, he has run the 64 and above giants of the game into the ground.         
	I am no scholar but suspect that with his searing focus and other qualities, he has strayed into spiritual territory. Devotion, discipline, sacrifice and austerity demanded by the all consuming search for perfection are a form of tapasya.         
	Whats more and paramount, is that he seems to be liberated from ego and the jal of maya. Federers success, I like to believe, is akin to yoga and the tennis courts around the world are his Himalayas. At home, we have another sporting yogi  Sachin Tendulkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi will shine in SL: Dravid
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvi will shine in SL: Dravid

	New Delhi: Former India captain Rahul Dravid has predicted that the three-match Test series against Sri Lanka will be a challenging one.         
	He was also hopeful that Yuvraj Singh, who has been troubling with his form of late, will perform well in Lanka.         
	Sri Lanka are a very formidable team and they play tough cricket at home. In the last two times we travelled there, we won a Test match but did not win the series, he said at a book launch here.         
	It is going to be a challenge but we have got a good team. We have got bowlers who are capable of taking 20 wickets, which is important to win a Test, the right-hand batsman added.         
	Speaking on Yuvraj, he said: Yuvraj would be keen to do well and prove a point. I think we will see the best of him in the series.         
	He was also of the view that Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis, who wreaked havoc when India toured Sri Lanka in 2008, would not be much of a problem to tackle.         
	He (Mendis) is still a good bowler. He was completely new to us when we toured Sri Lanka last time (in 2008). He played a major role in the series. But hopefully, we have learnt our lesson, he said.         
	I think we played him pretty well when he came to India. We learnt how to tackle him. We will have the answers to whatever Mendis throws at us this time, Dravid said.         
	Asked about his own preparation for the series, Dravid said: I would not need to make any particular adjustments in my batting for the series. I have been training and preparing for the last six weeks keeping in mind the series.         
	He also disagreed with the notion that his shoes would be difficult to fill in once he quits international cricket.         
	Without naming anyone, I would like to say that there are plenty of players ready to take my place. There is an abundance of young talent, Dravid said.         
	Meanwhile, Dravid congratulated Saina Nehwal, who won three consecutive international titles in a span of three weeks to jump to the third position in the world rankings. (PTI)

    - Indian Open Atwal tied 18th on DAy II           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Manav Jaini during the second day of the Indian Open, in New Delhi, on Friday. Picture by Prem Singh                                 
	New Delhi: On a day when defending champion C. Muniyappa and double PGA Tour winner Daniel Chopra crashed out of the Hero Honda Indian Open, unheralded Manav Jaini exploited home advantage to good effect and hurled himself into title contention at the Delhi Golf Club, on Friday.         
	Arjun Atwal, the other PGA Tour winner in the fray, made much of the lost ground with improved three under 69 to lay four shots off lead at the halfway stage. Atwal, overnight 45th, is now placed 18th along with five others, including Ashok Kumar and Firoz Ali.         
	I was less rusty today, said Atwal at the end of the day, who was felicitated by the Indian Golf Union (IGU) for his superb performance in the PGA Tour. This is only the beginning. Indian golf has huge promise and a lot of players would come up soon to take the centre stage, he told the gathering during the function.         
	The lead at the end of the second round, however, remained with Korean youngster Baek Seuk-hyun and Englands Simon Griffith (138), both of whom are now in line to win their maiden Asian Tour title.         
	On the other hand, newcomer Jaini, who has 10 top-10s on the local circuit this season, produced a bogey free card to move into contention and had a total of five-under 139, just a stroke behind the two leaders. He shot birdies on the 13th, 18th and second holes for a shot at glory.         
	Sharing the third place with Jaini were Americans Anthony Kang (67) and Ben Fox (69). With them is Swedens Richard Karlberg (69), who is chasing a second victory at the fabled Delhi venue after the SAIL Open earlier this year.         
	This is my home course and I know it pretty well. I think 10-under would be the winning score. A positive mindset helps a lot at this venue, said the 27-year-old Jaini.         
	I am really enjoying the greens. I think its easier for me to read the greens because its my home course. The comfort is there. Thats the advantage of playing at home. If I can continue to play like this then I can at least hope to be in contention if not anything else, the bespectacled golfer said.         
	Other Indians contenders included Mukesh Kumar, whose second straight 70 put him as the second best Indian in tied seventh place. Both Jaini and Mukesh played in contrasting style. While Jaini used the driver liberally, Mukesh did not use it even once.         
	My confidence soared after I converted an up and down from the bunker for par on the 11th , said Mukesh.         
	This was an excellent par save as my drive had landed in the rough on that hole. The putter was hot today. I made a tough downhill putt from 10 feet for birdie on the 18th and an uphill one from 25 feet for another birdie on the third, Mukesh added.         
	The Jyoti Randhawa fans, however, were left a disappointed lot as the three-time winner carded a one-under 71 to remain tied 23 on the leaderboard. But, then, he was far better placed than holder Muniyappa (75), who had to make a hasty exit after being tied 94. Equally poor was Indian-origin Swede Daniel Chopra, whose 76 left him six-over overall in a field where the cut came at four-over.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF must not tinker with local leagues

	Recently, I came across a news item which said that the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) had asked te All India Football Federation (AIFF) to disallow I-League footballers from playing in state association-run local leagues. I felt that if the clubs, for the time being, could be allowed to keep a pool of five players each for use in both competitions, it could prove to be a good idea.        
	At the same time, while I agree that the I-League is the right platform for the improvement of football in India, there should be an exhaustive debate on whether it is ready to carry out the task yet. I have a feeling the charm of the I-League has somewhat waned in the past few years.        
	Since I am not connected with the I-League anymore, I am in no position to comment on the events organisational aspect. What really pains me is the fast-dwindling attendance at the league matches, mainly in Calcutta and Goa. I am told that although the spectators response in Shillong and Pune is encouraging, not many people are coming to watch their teams at the other centres.        
	In Calcutta, the lack of spectator interest can be attributed to the failure of the local teams to do well of late. But whats going on in Goa is puzzling. After all, the Goan teams are dominating in the I-League. I sincerely hope the AIFF has the answer to this problem.        
	My question is simple: Will the I-League gain in status by reducing the long-established local leagues in Calcutta and Goa to second-tier tournaments? I am afraid not. To breathe life back into the I-League, the AIFF needs to put its own organisation, which seems to have too many loose ends, in order.        
	Frankly, I dont blame the AIFF for all the problems in the I-League like fixtures, scheduling, venues etc. For a body that is mostly dependent on other agencies for venues, travel and boarding and lodging, it is impossible to get the desired results as per the original blueprint.        
	Sometimes, I feel that the I-League is a concept borrowed from the western world that may never succeed in India. Compared to India, the western nations are much smaller in size and also much ahead in terms of sporting infrastructure. Any attempt to match them may prove futile.        
	I know the concept was a huge hit in two Asian countries  Japan and South Korea. But both are advanced nations and much smaller in size. A big country like Brazil had no national level league till a few years back but they could still beat the rest of the world regularly.        
	Well, I am not suggesting that the I-League should be discontinued. All that is needed is for a balance to be struck between the local and national leagues. There is no point in blindly following the diktats of Fifa and the AFC. From my experience I can tell you that local leagues in all parts of the country always have a sizeable following. By weakening them, I am confident, the I-League wont gain anything.        
	The bosses in the federation, I am sorry to say, are an ill-advised lot. They want the game in India to be a centrally controlled affair, hoping that the state associations and sponsors will fall in line. By forcing the local leagues to lose their popularity, they are cutting at the very roots of the game. This may prove disastrous for Indian football.

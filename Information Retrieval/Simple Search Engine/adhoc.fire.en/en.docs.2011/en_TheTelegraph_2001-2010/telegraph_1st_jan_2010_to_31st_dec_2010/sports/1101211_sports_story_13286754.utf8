            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal skipper Manoj Tiwary led by example with an unbeaten century to guide his team to 295 for five in reply to Saurashtras first innings score of 423 in Rajkot on Friday.         
	Bengal bowlers had looked distraught after failing to mop up the Saurashtra middle-order cheaply, but the Bengal skipper made up for the agony with a sublime 116. He added 127 runs for the third wicket with Dibyendu Chakrabarty (80) to take Bengal close to the 300-run mark. The visitors were 128 runs adrift of target at stumps on Day Three.         
	Losing wickets is difficult on the Khanderi strip that has slowed down considerably and Tiwary felt Bengals chances could have been better had Chakrabarty hung in little longer. To be honest, the track is placid and its hard for bowlers to get wickets here. The first six wickets that we got on the first day was wholly due to their (Saurashtra) batsmen making mistakes. On a strip like this, if a batsmen sets himself in, its difficult to get out unless you throw your wicket away, Tiwary told The Telegraph.         
	The Bengal skipper said he has a huge responsibility on his shoulders Saturday and the result will depend on how the two overnight batsmen (Tiwary and Laxmi Ratan Shukla) negotiate the morning session. The kind of experience we share, we can reach the target. But we have to survive the morning the session. We have the full day tomorrow and hope we can apply ourselves, Tiwary said.         
	Resuming at 33 for one, Sreevats Goswami (49) and Chakrabarty added 72 more runs to their overnight five-run stand before Goswami fell one run short of his second first-class fifty.         
	The Bengal wicket-keepers 131-ball stay at the crease came to an end when he was caught by Saurya Sanandiya off Shitanshu Kotak (1/53). He struck eight boundaries during his innings.         
	But then came a determined Tiwary who played responsibly to guide Bengal forward. In Chakrabarty, Tiwary got a perfect partner as the duo went about their business with consummate ease. Chakrabarty slammed 11 boundaries during his marathon 214-ball stay. But he sent a nick to Sagar Jogiyani behind stumps off a Sanandiya delivery.         
	He (Chakrabarty) got out to a lose shoot. Hes a newcomer to first class cricket and will mature gradually, Tiwary said off Chakrabarty.         
	Sanandiya was the pick of the Saurashtra bowlers. He removed Anustup Majumdar (12) and Writam Porel (24) and returned figures of 3 for 41 in 15 overs.         
	The two wickets have given the hosts hope on the final day. But unless they can remove Tiwary, Bengal surely have a chance of running away with three points in a do-or-die game.

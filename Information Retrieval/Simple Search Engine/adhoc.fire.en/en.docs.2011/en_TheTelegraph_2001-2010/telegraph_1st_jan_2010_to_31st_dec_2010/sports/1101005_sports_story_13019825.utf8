The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Soniya and Sukhen falter, made to settle for silver
                                                                                                                       7                                      Soniya and Sukhen falter, made to settle for silver
 - IWF official blames Organising Committee for the losses            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: It was heartbreak for Bengal boy Sukhen Dey, at the Nehru Stadium Weightlifting Hall, on Monday.         
	The 56 kg lifter from district Howrah gave a stiff competition to Games record holder Hamizan Amirul Ibrahim of Malaysia, before settling for a silver, five kilograms short of the winners effort. Ibrahim cleared 257 kg and Indias Srinivasa Rao lifted 248 kg, for the bronze medal.         
	Ibrahim, in the process, claimed the first gold medal for his country, setting a new Games record of 116kg in the snatch, surpassing his personal best of 115. He lifted 141 in clean and jerk.         
	In the days opening weightlifting event, Indias hopes of bagging the first gold medal ended in disappointment when woman weightlifter Soniya Chanu settled for the second spot in the 48 kg category.         
	Pre-Games favourite to bag the first gold medal on home turf, Soniya lifted a below par 167 kg to stand second in the event behind Nigerian schoolgirl Augustina Nwaokolo, who hoisted 175 kg to win the contest with a new Games record. Indias Sandhya Rani Devi took the bronze with a total clearance of 165 kg.         
	A senior official of the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) was livid at the end of the day. I clearly blame the Organising Committee (OC) for losing the gold medals, he said.         
	We requested the organisers several times to allow our lifters to practice on this Nehru Stadium platform. The permission never came. We have no home advantage. Like foreign participants, our lifters are also playing here for the first time.         
	All said and done, Soniyas performance came as a shock even to her ardent fans. Known to clear around 180 kg in training session, the Manipur girl lost the plot in snatch and jerk. Her second and third attempt in snatch turned out to be fouls and it helped the Nigerian to go ahead of her Indian opponent.         
	Nwaokolo clinched the issue in her favour in clean and jerk, as she lifted four kilograms more than Soniya despite being marginally less in bodyweight.         
	Dey, however, was the surprise element in the event, with his career best of 112 in snatch, and 140 in clean and jerk.         
	I was determined to win the gold this time, said 21-year-old Sukhen, a non-commissioned officer with the Indian Army.         
	In the junior world championships, two years ago, I won a bronze medal in snatch, but lost out on the overall result. Today (Monday), the Malaysian was too good. I still could have won, if I did well in the last clean and jerk.         
	Dey tried a lift of 146 kg in the last attempt, but could not finish it properly. I slipped, rued Dey.         
	With a little more luck, he could have done it, said his coach DD Sharma, who described Dey as a potential world champion.         
	When I first saw this boy in the junior nationals in Kerala, I immediately realised that he had the talent to make it big. He is training to lift 270 kg these days. If he manages to do so, Sukhen should figure among the top six lifters in the world, said Sharma.

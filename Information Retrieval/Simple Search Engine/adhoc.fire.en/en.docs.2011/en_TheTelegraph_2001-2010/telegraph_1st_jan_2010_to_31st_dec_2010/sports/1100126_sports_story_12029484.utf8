The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid much better after the fracture
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dravid much better after the fracture
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Rahul Dravid, admitted to Dhakas Square Hospital after being felled by a Shahadat Hossain bouncer, on Monday afternoon, was much better when The Telegraph contacted the doctor on duty there at 10.45 pm.         
	Dravids much better... In fact, hes sleeping right now... He had soup in the evening and, a short while ago, biscuits in milk... He has also been given daab water, the doctor, who requested not to be identified, said.         
	The doctor added: Dravids not in pain, but thats because hes on pain-killers... Hell remain on a liquid diet till assessed by the orthopaedic surgeon (Dr Fazlul Huq) under whom hes been admitted... Surgery isnt planned...         
	Dravids in a VIP room on the 12th floor and not in the ICU, as mentioned in some reports coming out of the Bangladesh capital.         
	Among the technically most accomplished of all time, Dravid still got deceived by the dual bounce and ended up ducking into the bouncer in over No.2 of the second new ball.         
	The blow fractured his left jaw bone.         
	Fortunately, thanks to the helmet, Dravid didnt suffer a more serious injury. The ball, being new, was hard and anything may have happened to the former captain.         
	Dravid was then on 111 (29th Test hundred) and his availability for the home series against South Africa, beginning on February 6, is now in question.         
	It would be a huge setback if hes not available.         
	The Bangladesh quicks, incidentally, had been unusually aggressive during the day. That, too, on a wicket with unpredictable bounce, as the other centurion, Sachin Tendulkar, put it.         
	Earlier in the evening, when contacted on his cellphone, Team India manager Arshad Ayub stated: Dravids stable... Theres no head injury... His condition will be reviewed tomorrow (Tuesday)... He didnt mention anything about wanting to go back and I didnt raise the issue either...         
	Its not official, but Dravid wont be playing any further role in the ongoing Test, at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.         
	Meanwhile, Yuvraj Singh also has an injury  hes sprained his left wrist. Its not clear whether hell be able to bat.         
	Where injuries go, this has been an awful season for Yuvraj.         
	Footnote: Eight years ago, Anil Kumble had broken his jaw (courtesy Merv Dillon) in the Antigua Test. Despite being in pain, hed returned to the field and bowled 14 overs on the trot. After that, he came back home for surgery. The match ended in a draw.

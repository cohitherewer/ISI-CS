The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias great selection puzzle!
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indias great selection puzzle!
  - Bewildering how an out-of-form Rohit got the nod ahead of Tiwary       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Saurabh Tiwary                                 
	Calcutta: Four days after he was dropped from what became a virtual semi-final, against New Zealand, a terribly low on confidence Rohit Sharma made a comeback, in the tri-series final!         
	Starting the day with an average of 5.00 in the tournament, nobody expected an out-of-this-world show from the 23-year-old. He didnt disappoint and fell for five, ending the tri-series with a shocker of an average  5.00.         
	For a specialist batsman, especially one widely regarded as strong on technique, it just cant get worse.         
	One isnt suggesting that Rohit alone is to be blamed for a very worrying performance by Team India. But, yes, he had no business featuring in the XI, on Saturday.         
	In fact, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, vice-captain Virender Sehwag and coach Gary Kirsten must take the rap for a flawed selection.         
	They shouldve gone for a hungry Saurabh Tiwary, waiting for months to get his first cap. His inclusion couldve taken Sri Lanka by surprise, forcing Kumar Sangakkara to redraw strategy.         
	Known faces are, after all, quickly sorted out, but the world has only seen the explosive bat, from Jamshedpur, in the IPL.         
	Where signals go, the team management messed up big time. Indeed, timing isnt of relevance over the 22 yards alone.         
	In early June, the 20-year-old Tiwary was touring England with India A when Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) picked him for the Asia Cup.         
	He didnt get a game, in Dambulla.         
	Then, late last month, Tiwary was in Australia, again with the India A boys, when the selectors chose him for the tri-series.         
	Well, no game this time either and Dambulla surely wont be one of Tiwarys favourite cities.         
	One cant help but ask whether the selectors and the team management are actually on the same wavelength. Doesnt seem so, otherwise Tiwary wouldve been blooded, keeping the 2011 World Cup, which is getting closer by the day, in mind.         
	If Tiwary isnt to be given exposure, then theres no point having him in the squad. Give his place to somebody else.         
	I agree that (capping Tiwary) ought to have been done... Theres no justification for playing somebody who has been failing, when a younger player is in the wings, a source involved with the selection process told The Telegraph.         
	The gentleman indicated that if Tiwary didnt have the team managements confidence, then, in the circumstances, even a Ravichandran Ashwin wouldve been a better bet than Rohit.         
	While Rohit will need time to regain confidence, others are in the same boat as well. Except MoS Sehwag (he collected another Linea!) and Dhoni, nobody touched the 100-mark in the tournament.         
	Unbelievable, but thats the reality.         
	Make no mistake, theres much work to be done before the next series, at home, against Australia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fine relief for IWF
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fine relief for IWF
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games will be doling out an interest-free loan of $375,000 to the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) for paying up the fine to the apex body. This means that the Indian weightlifters will be now be able to participate in the October 3-14 Games.         
	The IWF was fined $500,000 last year by the international body after six Indian lifters were tested positive.         
	While the federation managed to raise $125,000 on its own, it had appealed to the sports ministry and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to help them pay the rest of the amount.         
	Indian weightlifters are favourites to win at least 15 medals, including five gold medals in the Commonwealth Games.         
	On Tuesday, after the sports ministry directed the OC to release the interest free loan, an IWF official said the money was expected to come in the next couple of days.         
	The participation of Indian weightlifters in the Commonwealth Games is now almost certain, said the official. We should be getting the money before the August 31 deadline, the official added.         
	During the last month, the ministry wrote to IOA twice, requesting them to have a talk with the international weightlifting body, through the International Olympic Committee (IOC), for the reduction of fine.         
	The IOA, however, did not show much interest in bailing out the IWF.

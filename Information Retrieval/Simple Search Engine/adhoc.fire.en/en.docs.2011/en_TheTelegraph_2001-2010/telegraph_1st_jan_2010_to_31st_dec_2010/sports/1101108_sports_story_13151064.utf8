	Brisbane: Australia snapped a run of seven straight losses in all forms of cricket when they beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets, in the third and final ODI on Sunday.         
	Sri Lanka claimed the series 2-1 after winning the first match in Melbourne by one wicket and the second in Sydney by 29 runs. Young fast bowlers Clint McKay and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets as Australia dismissed Sri Lanka for 115 in 32 overs after Kumar Sangakkara won the toss elected to bat. McKay took five for 33 and Starc four for 27.         
	Michael Clarke made an unbeaten 50 and Brad Haddin had 31 to steer Australia to 119 for two in 21.3 overs.         
	Australias first win of the domestic summer went a long way to repairing their damaged confidence on the ground on which they will open their Ashes Test series against England in 18 days.         
	McKay and Starc added a note of aggression which have been absent from Australias bowling in recent matches and Clarke and Haddin were both confident and clinical in their pursuit of a modest target.         
	McKay was named Man of the Match for his career-best bowling figures and Sri Lankas Lasith Malinga was Man of the series.         
	Australia at last re-discovered their ability to dominate other teams, a quality notably missing on their recent tour to India and in the first two matches of this series.         
	McKay and Starc relished a pitch at the Gabba ground which was faster and bouncier than those on which the first two matches were played. Both used the pace of the wicket and a steepling bounce to disconcert, then dismiss Sri Lankas batsman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chawla makes cut after   Dhoni vote in tight call
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chawla makes cut after   Dhoni vote in tight call
    - No debate over Rookie Vinay Kumars inclusion           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              
	Chandigarh: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis support facilitated leg-spinner Piyush Chawlas recall, after 20 months.         
	The 21-year-old, who made his Test debut when 17, is in the XV for the World T20s third edition, which gets under way in the West Indies on April 30.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, Dhoni initially said he would be comfortable with either Pragyan Ojha or Chawla. However, when it came to choosing one as the second spinner, after Harbhajan Singh, he didnt go for the left-armer.         
	The selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) didnt have a problem with the captains choice.         
	Chawla is both a better fielder and batsman... That played a big part in his recall... Dhoni rightly pointed out that of the two, Chawla would be more useful in T20, is how one source put it.         
	Speaking on Friday evening, the gentleman added: That the squad is for a T20 tournament also worked in Rohit Sharmas favour... That he has been pretty consistent in T20 helped him edge out Virat Kohli... Had the selection been for a 50-over competition, then Kohli would have been preferred.         
	That Rohit can be relied upon for some overs of off-spin made his case somewhat stronger.         
	Young Manish Pandey was discussed, but the selectors werent able to slot him. A pity, really, but hes just 20.         
	When Kohli wasnt able to find a place, Pandey didnt stand a chance. Of course, he would have walked in had Gautam Gambhir been ruled out on fitness grounds, another source informed.         
	Apparently, Gambhir and Ashish Nehra got picked after the selectors were told that both would be seen in action, for the Delhi DareDevils, in the franchises next match  against the Kolkata Knight Riders, on Monday.         
	While Gambhir got injured during the ongoing IPL, Nehras injury occurred in the lead up to the tournament.         
	Meanwhile, quick Ranganath Vinay Kumar, the lone rookie to be chosen, made it without a debate. A message, therefore, has been sent to the likes of Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma.         
	Neither has made an impact in the IPL. Not that everybody who has, got selected.         
	Kumar, incidentally, had been tipped as the dark horse in these columns.         
	Footnote: Kumar Sangakkara, the Kings XI Punjab captain, has welcomed Chawlas inclusion in the World T20 squad. Piyush is full of energy and the selectors have made a good choice... Besides his bowling, hes an excellent fielder and a good bat... He has the right attitude, too...

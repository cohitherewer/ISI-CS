	Guangzhou: Unheralded Sandhyarani Devi proved to be the saving grace for India by bagging a silver medal in wushu, while the fancied shooters fell by the wayside for the third successive time on a rather unproductive fifth day of the 16th Asian Games, on Thursday.         
	The 27-year-olds achievement was the lone bright spot in an otherwise heart-breaking day, which generally saw below-par performances in most disciplines. Sandhyarani, who was handicapped by a leg injury which she picked up in her semi-final win against Paloy Barckkham of Laos, lost 0-2 to the Iranian.         
	I could not raise my leg which was stiff following the injury sustained in the semi-finals. I was trying to throw her down with my arms but could not accomplish that too. I was targeting the gold but could not perform to potential because of the injury, she said.         
	With the addition of just a silver medal, Indias medal tally rose to one gold, five silver and seven bronze.         
	Saina Nehwal sailed through her womens singles pre-quarter final but Parupalli Kashyap became a first round casualty in the mens event as India wrapped up a mixed day in badminton.         
	World No. 3 Saina, the only player to win her match in the womens team event, saw off her first opponent Lydia Cheah of Malaysia 21-15 21-17 in only 28 minutes to book her quarters berth. She will now meet the winner of Yip Pui Yin of Hong Kong, the world No. 12 and sixth seed, and Pai Hsiao Ma of Taipei for a place in the last four. Kashyap, ranked 31 globally, proved unequal to the task of overcoming his first round rival and fifth seed Nguyen Tien Minh and was beaten 21-14, 22-20 by the world No. 8 Vietnamese.         
	The other Indians who were shown the door were Aditi Mutatkar, mixed doubles pair of Arun Vishnu and Aparna Balan and the mens doubles teams Rupesh Kumar-Sanave Thomas and Arun Vishnu-Akshay Dewalkar.         
	Arvind Bhat, ranked 43rd in the world and a replacement for the injured Chetan Anand, did not have to struggle much as his first round opponent, Sri Lankas Niluka Karunaratne, gave him a walkover into the last 16. The women hockey teams chance of a medal was severely dented after going down to South Korea by a solitary goal. The Indian eves now need to win two of their last three matches to keep themselves in the race for a bronze medal.         
	India had a mixed day in tennis as Karan Rastogi and Vishnu Vardhan started their campaign with a comfortable victory in the mens doubles, while Rushmi Chakravarti and Poojashree Venkatesha crashed out of the womens doubles in the first round.         
	The shooters put up a dismal show on another windy day with only pistol expert and Melbourne Commonwealth Games hero Samaresh Jung coming up with something notable in the morning session of the competitions. Jung missed the mens 25m standard pistol shoot-off for the bronze by one point in a straight final to finish seventh overall.         
	After ending Indias 24-year-old medal drought in the pool in Asian Games, teen swimming sensation Virdhawal Khade topped his 100m freestyle heats but the effort was not good enough to fetch a place in the finals of the event. Khade clocked 51.25sec to top the 100m freestyle heats but the eventual eight qualifiers returned timings of under 51 seconds. Indias woeful show continued in sepaktakraw with both the mens and womens teams bowing out of medal contention.         
	After making a disappointing start to their campaign on Tuesday, when the mens team lost to Japan and the womens team was thrashed by South Korea, India once again failed to make a mark, losing to hosts China.         
	Meanwhile, Indias lone gold winner in this edition of Asian Games, Pankaj Advani, and Aditya Mehta will begin their snooker campaign, on Thursday.         
	India would be expecting to add a few more medals in their kitty in this sporting discipline before it ends on Saturday. In mens basketball, India suffered their second consecutive loss after succumbing to a 66-93 defeat at the hands of Chinese Taipei. They play against Iran on Friday. (PTI)

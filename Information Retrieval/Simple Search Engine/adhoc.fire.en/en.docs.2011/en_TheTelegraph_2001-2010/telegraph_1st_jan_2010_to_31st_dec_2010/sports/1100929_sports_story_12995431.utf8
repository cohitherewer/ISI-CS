The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke: Bonus if Harbhajan   misses match
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clarke: Bonus if Harbhajan   misses match
                            
	Chandigarh: Australia have great respect for Harbhajan Singh but it will be a huge bonus for the visitors in case he misses the first Test, at Mohali, in the wake of the injury scare, vice-captain Michael Clarke said on Tuesday.         
	Clarke, however, added that he was confident that the Indian off-spinner will play at Mohali and said they were preparing strategies on how to tackle him.         
	I am very confident that Harbhajan will play. I know how much he loves playing against Australia, Clarke said at a media conference here.         
	But if he doesnt play, it would be a huge bonus for us. He has enjoyed quite a success against Australia, he said.         
	Asked about the confrontations involving Harbhajan and the Australian players in the past, Clarke said: Certain players like confrontation and perform better doing that But it is one aspect which we are not going to focus on and our eyes would be on Harbhajan, the bowler.         
	There are guys like him in all teams, who perform better with that kind of confrontation.         
	In my opinion, Harbhajan is one of the best spinners in the world. He is always tough to face under any conditions, he said.         
	Facing pace bowlers Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan is also going to be tough, with their reverse swing abilities.         
	Asked about too much cricket being played these days, Clarke said at the end of the day the choice has to be made by the players whether to play tournaments like IPL and the Champions League Twenty20 or not.         
	I guess guys have a choice. They dont have to play all of IPL or the Champions League, he said.         
	Clarke, however, said that it was also one aspect of international cricket where players have to travel a lot, switch between formats and make adjustments to varying playing conditions.         
	As professional athletes, you are trained to handle this and you have to adapt and make things happen. I guess thats what makes you a successful international cricketer, he said.         
	He further said that at the end of the day, players have to see and make their own priorities and commitments.         
	Playing for Australia, that is my priority. If you feel your body needs rest, play less IPL and the Champions League Twenty20, he said responding to a question.           (PTI)

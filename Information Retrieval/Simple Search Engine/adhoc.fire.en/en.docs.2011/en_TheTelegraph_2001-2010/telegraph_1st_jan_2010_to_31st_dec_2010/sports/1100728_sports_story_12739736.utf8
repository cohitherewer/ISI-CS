The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Low-key AGM on the cards
                                                                                                                       7                                      Low-key AGM on the cards
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: If Chitrak Mitra, who has been a witness to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)s annual general meetings for the past three decades is to be believed, the 79th edition is certainly going to be a dull one by any standards.         
	There are no elections as and there are no contentious issues to be debated, unless someone decides to broach any topic on the floor. The only interest will be the menu, Mitra, who is a former joint secretary of the CAB, said in jest.         
	With the Jagmohan Dalmiya-led faction literally weeding out the opposition, Wednesdays AGM is unlikely to have even any kind of symbolic resistance from the anti-Dalmiya group.         
	Dalmiyas eternal bete noire Samar Paul is not attending the AGM (Aryan is one of three affiliated units who arent attending the AGM) for the first time in many years. The slight element of drama that might have been in store is also not there due to Pauls absence.         
	Such has been the command of the Dalmiya-led faction, that even some representatives, who wanted to contest for a place in the working committee, have withdrawn their nominations.         
	The star attraction will be Sourav Ganguly, who will be attending his second AGM. Sourav, like last year, will be representing Mohammedan Sporting Club.         
	It will be interesting if Sourav, who has always been vocal about the loopholes in Bengals cricketing system, voices his opinion. Although the CAB officials wont find it amusing but Bengal cricket is often the last topic that representatives find fit enough for discussion!         
	Current national selector Raja Venkat is one of the prominent members of the anti-Dalmiya camp who is likely to attend the meeting.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB, in an email to ICCs ticketing partner KyaZoonga has intimated them about the state governments decision to levy amusement tax on tickets which are priced at and above Rs 500.         
	We have told them about the current situation. Now its up to them to decide on the revised rates. However, we are unsure about those who have bought and will buy the tickets online before August 1. Will they now have to shell out extra money?, a senior CAB official questioned.         
	Also, with the number of seats being reduced to around 60,000 (10,000 less from what the CAB had earlier anticipated), there wont be more than 3000 tickets up for auction. According to sources, around 915 tickets have been sold during the first round of auction.         
	In their bid to get an idea of actual number of annual, associate and life members, the association will have stringent methods of verification before the members get hold of their complimentary tickets.         
	We have noticed that a lot of people renew membership cards of people who have passed away. Even if we use photo ID cards or PAN cards, it can be misused. Therefore, we will be asking the card holder to produce current bank statement in order to confirm his identity, the official said.

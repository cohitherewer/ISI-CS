	Kohler: Matt Kuchar wasted no time taking the lead at the PGA Championship, making a birdie on his first hole after the first round resumed Friday morning in shooting a 5-under 67 for a one-stroke advantage.         
	The American leads a group that includes three-time major winner Ernie Els and Bubba Watson. Two-time major winner Angel Cabrera was still on the course at four under.         
	Tiger Woods is four strokes off the lead at one under.         
	But his 71 on Thursday was still cause for small celebration: it was the first time in eight rounds that Woods had broken par, and he made a brief appearance on the leaderboard after three birdies in his first four holes.         
	Half the 156-player field had to come back Friday morning to finish the first round after darkness halted play Thursday night. But just as it did Thursday morning, fog delayed play for about three hours Friday.         
	Its tough finishing anywhere when youve been on the range for two-and-a-half hours, said Adam Scott, who had five holes left when he came back Friday. Its been a long day already.         
	Im not a big fan of less than eight hours sleep, and it was five and a half last night, Kuchar said.         
	I never wake up in the best of spirits, so (the delay) was just some extra time to kind of get my body back in sync again.         
	His time on the range worked.         
	Picking up on the par-4 No. 6, Kuchar birdied it and played his last three holes at par to preserve the lead. He finished the first round with an eagle  he holed out from 124 yards out on the fairway early in his round  four birdies and just one bogey.         
	I was very impressed. Very impressed, playing partner and European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie said. He handled himself very well.         
	Els is desperate to make sure another year doesnt end without a major, and has to be happy being only one stroke off the lead. Hell be even happier if he can get his second round in Friday.         
	Second-round tee times were pushed back four hours, making it unlikely everyone will get in 18 holes Friday.         
	Hopefully we can get 18 holes done. Then its a real winner, then you can put your feet up, Els said. Weve got a ways to go.         
	Phil Mickelson, meanwhile, finds himself a ways away from the leaders.         
	He has failed in his first two months of opportunities to take the No. 1 ranking from Woods, but he has another chance at Whistling Straits. Mickelson went backward when he got back on the course, though was at 1 over.

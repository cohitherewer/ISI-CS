The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Graeme is uncertain for first Test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Graeme is uncertain for first Test
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It will be a race against time for Graeme Smith to recover before the first India-South Africa Test, beginning December 16, as the Proteas skipper will return home Thursday to recover from a fracture in his left hand.         
	Smith sustained an undisplaced fracture to the fourth metacarpal of his left hand when a Shoaib Akhtar delivery hit him during the first ODI against Pakistan three weeks ago. The Proteas opener subsequently experienced swelling and discomfort during the second Test match.         
	It is the same hand that was injured during the ODI series against Pakistan three weeks ago, said team manager Dr. Mohammed Moosajee.         
	It was aggravated by the continuous wear and tear involved with fielding and batting and flared up while he was fielding during the current Test match.         
	It will be a race against time to get him fit for the Test series against India, Moosajee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav-led panel to have new brief
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav-led panel to have new brief
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will retain the cricket development committee (CDC) which was formed last year and which is headed by former India captain Sourav Ganguly.         
	The committee was created to analyse Bengals performance in the Ranji Trophy but, after the first few meetings, its four members never met again. Former Bengal captains Arun Lal, Ashok Malhotra and Pronab Roy are the remaining members.         
	While Lal and Malhotra were busy with their media commitments, Roy hardly watched any home matches last season. The only person who had a fair idea about Bengals performance was Sourav, as he played four matches  against Baroda, Saurashtra, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.         
	This time around, the committee will have a different task  to provide suggestions on infrastructure development at the State Cricket Academy coming up at Kalyani.         
	Meanwhile, former joint secretary and current head of CABs stadium committee, Chitrak Mitra, will be co-opted in the working committee.

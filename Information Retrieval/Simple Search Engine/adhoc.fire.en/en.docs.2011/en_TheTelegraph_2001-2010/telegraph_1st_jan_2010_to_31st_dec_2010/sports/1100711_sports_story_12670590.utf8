	The D-Day has arrived. Spain and the Netherlands cross swords at the Soccer City in Johannesburg in a battle that will give us a new world champion.         
	Being a former national coach, I feel tempted to step into the shoes of both Vicente del Bosque and Bert van Marwijk to see things from their perspective as the two coaches prepare their teams for the biggest final of their careers.         
	In my view, Spain enjoy a slight advantage, but if it goes to the tiebreaker, the Wesley Sneijders may succeed in doing something which a long line of their illustrious predecessors could not.         
	Read on         
	WHAT IF I WERE SPAIN COACH VICENTE DEL BOSQUE...         
	If I were Del Bosque, I would definitely start with Fernando Torres. The Liverpool front-liner is a big match player and a big match player generally delivers on the big stage. He is due for a big performance and Sunday could be when he finds his magic touch. Any coach would take a chance on a player of Torress calibre.         
	Pedro, who was a surprise choice against Germany, will be introduced in the last 30 minutes. He has speed and tenacity and will give width to the attack. I will also tell little Pedro to curb his selfishness and play the ball to his colleagues more often. He is young and ambitious and the excitement of scoring in a World Cup semi-final may be got the better of him as he ignored an unmarked Torres to muff a clear scoring chance. If he gets onto the field for the last 30 minutes, I am sure he will make amends.         
	Knowing that I have the best midfield in the world, I will once again tell my boys to dictate terms right from the word go. Most of them have been playing together in the national team for the last four years and I have at least six players from Barcelona. These players know have a great understanding of each others style. I mean, Xavi probably knows what Iniesta has had for lunch on any given day and when that happens, you can bet that you have a bunch of winners.         
	My personal favourite is Iniesta. His ball control is simply amazing; he leaves his markers for dead with the deftest of touches and he does that at will. He was finesse itself against Germany, piling misery on the young rivals making them dispirited. The Dutch will play a physical game to stifle our skilful players.         
	The likes of Mark van Bommel, John Heitinga and Nigel de Jong (I expect him to start ahead of Rafael van dar Vaart although the latter had a brilliant last 45 minutes against Uruguay) will do their best to close down on any space.         
	When that happens, I will ask Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets to provide ample cover for Xavi and Iniesta. I would also like to see Joan Capdevila overlap down the left more often so that Robben has little space to operate down the flanks.         
	I dont think the Dutch will give us enough openings on Sunday. So I will ask the Xavis to wait for the set-pieces. Against Germany, the way Gerard Pique shielded Carles Puyol with a dummy jump was awesome. I will want them to do something similarly amazing on Sunday. Lastly, being a World Cup winning teams coach is an all-time high. I would like to be on top of one on Sunday.         
	AND, WHAT IF I WERE BERT VAN MARWIJK...         
	First things first, I would tell my boys to forget that we have been second best in two World Cup finals. Thats a thing of the past and I believe theres no point talking about it. On Sunday, both would be fighting to be first-time winners and neither can be expected to yield even an inch on the field.         
	There has been a lot of criticism of our style of play. We have been vilified for having consigned the idea of Total Football to the dustbin. But I say we are ready to play ugly and win. At the end, it is the result that counts. Nobody will remember us for losing the final playing beautiful football.         
	My main player is Sneijder and I would like to see him getting more cover in midfield. Once he gets the ball, then Robin van Persie and Robben will be there to create confusion among the Spanish back-four. I will tell the boys not to allow the Spanish midfield to regroup fast. If they are allowed to play passes, which they do with unbelievable precision, it will be difficult for us.         
	I will take heart from Inter Milans Champions League semi-final match against Barcelona where the Catalans had no answer for Inters defensive organisation. With seven players from Barcelona playing in this team, I am counting on something similar unnerving the Spaniards. I will ask Robben to spend more time in the attacking third and make sure Capdevila has no room for manoeuvre.         
	Iniesta and Xavi are the two playmakers in the Spanish team and its quite obvious they will be marked. But theres a problem marking Iniesta. He is so skilful with the ball and, at times, uses his heel to dribble! So, one mistimed touch on him and you would have given away a foul. His markers will have to be careful about that.         
	I am expecting Torres to start, in which case Heitinga and Joris Mathijsen, the two central defenders, will have to be careful. It was Mathijsens blunder that allowed Diego Forlan to shoot the equaliser Tuesday last but I am sure there wont be a repeat of that on Sunday. Indeed, there wont be any room for mistakes.         
	Lastly, we are confident of pulling through, this time around. You cant be third time unlucky. Can you?

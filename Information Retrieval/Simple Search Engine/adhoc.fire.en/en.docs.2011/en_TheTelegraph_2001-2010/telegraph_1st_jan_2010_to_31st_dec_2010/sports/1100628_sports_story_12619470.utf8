	Football is a simple game; played simply it is a thing of great beauty. It is the players who make matters complicated, or as England showed, difficult for themselves and, when they do that, along come Germany and put them to the sword.         
	What a show of sublime simplicity from the slick German war machine. The Germans charged, and scored, they broke, and scored, ultimately winning 4-1. England could only watch in disbelief. Was it really happening to them? Denied a goal and crumbling under German bombardment, the English were twice victims on Sunday  of luck and listlessness.         
	This match-up was a tad bit premature at a World Cup. I mean these are world-class teams, the cream of Europe.         
	Their fans are among the most passionate in football and there is great sporting tradition and bitter historical rivalry that makes this fixture one of the most explosive affairs in sport. So a last 16 meeting between the two means a grand protagonist bows out with the drama still some distance from the climax.         
	But even then, on Sunday, it was the Germans who seized their moment while the English just failed to turn up.         
	Where was Wayne Rooney? The English Maradona could ask no questions of the German defence. But the blame is not his alone. Rooney is a striker. Get the ball to him and he will score for you. But he was a lonely man at the head of this English attack.         
	Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and the rest of the Englishmen at the centre of the field could not keep their part of the deal. They failed to supply him with the telling passes. He waged a lonely war upfront while the Germans ran amok in the English half.         
	The Germans demonstrated a far superior understanding of the game with their brand of attacking football.         
	Miroslav Klose, the scorer of the first goal, and Lukas Podolski, who got the second, were complemented by the creative and counterattacking genius of Mesut Oezil, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Mueller, the deliverer of the coup de grace with his double strike at the end.         
	The Germans did not have to rely on flukes or fortune. They showed what beautiful football exactly means. They passed better, moved and held their positions better and co-ordinated their attacks better.         
	After all, they should really have been 3-0 up when Lukas Podolski got the teams second goal had Klose not missed a sitter just after putting his team in front.         
	A German win had appeared a foregone conclusion then. The English game had gone to pieces and not even 30 minutes had passed. The Gerrards looked aimless going forward and clueless falling back.         
	Case in point, the first goal of the match. It was a goalkick that flew straight down the middle with Klose the intended recipient. That much was clear. Everything else appeared a mystery to Matthew Upson as he made a complete hash of the clearance.         
	Although he made amends with Englands only goal of the match, there was just no compensating for the Gerrards defensive frailties against the ruthless German war machine. The English did not get their basics right. One man should have marked Klose with another to cover him. But when Manuel Neuers shot curled into Kloses reach, both Upson and John Terry were caught off guard and out of place.         
	The English did flare up for a brief period in the second half but could not force any mistakes from the Germans. It was a matter of only one goal at the time and the English went all out for it. The Germans knew what to do when that happened. They waited and the moment the English gave the ball away they swept forward and stung  twice inside five minutes.         
	But what could the English do, they were desperate by then and had to go for broke. Had Lampards goal stood, maybe the English strategy in the second half would have been different. For one, they would certainly not have left themselves so exposed at back. But the Germans deserved everything they took from this match.         
	God balanced his books after 44 years. That is what the Germans will be telling the English. The hand of justice moved across the page and having scripted Englands fall, swiftly moved on. This was the events of the 1966 final replayed with the places exchanged.         
	No one can tell for sure whether the ball had gone in that day at the Wembley, but you need not watch the video twice to see that it had crossed the line after Lampards shot hit the crosspiece.         
	 It was alas the referee who needed a second glance or at least a second opinion. But Fifa still needs convincing about better equipping its man on the field.

	Finally, a team from Africa gives me hope. In the curtain raiser to the 2010 World Cup, I had talked about my dream of seeing a team from Africa making it to the semi-finals. But the likes of Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon did not show that promise. South Africa may have a nations backing but they cant make the grade. Lets be honest about it.        
	So it was left to the Ivory Coast to lead the African challenge. And, on Tuesday, they showed they have the guts, the gumption and the talent to take on anybody in this world. Had luck been on their side and had they been little more industrious, they could have left the Nelson Mandela Bay in Port Elizabeth with three points. Yes! A victory against Portugal was always there. Unfortunately they had to settle for a goalless draw.        
	Most of the players of this Ivory Coast team play in top European leagues and that gave them the confidence to call spade a spade against Portugal. They were organised in defence and were not scared of tackling their rivals. Also what caught my eyes was the fact that they also showed clear intention of playing a pleasant passing game.         
	The Kolo Toures and Salomon Kalous showed that even without their inspirational captain Didier Drogba, they have the courage to play good football. What helped Ivory Coasts cause was also the presence of Sven-Goran Eriksson in the dug-out. The Swede took over the reins very late but looked very much at home.         
	They way Cristiano Ronaldo was bottled up through out the match deserves special mention. Eriksson knew very well that if Ronaldo gets space, he can be devastating. So what they did was brilliant. They cut the space between the back-four and the midfield and that did not allow Ronaldo any room.         
	I should also mention about Didier Zakora. This defensive midfielder was brilliant in the centre of the park and barring once  when Ronaldo unleashed a booming volley that hit the post  he was blemish free.         
	This draw will give Ivory Coast lot of confidence. They next play Brazil and another point will surely make them a strong contender for the second round slot from the Group of Death. As far as Porugal are concerned, they will have to improve by leaps and bounds        
	Lastly about Didier Drogba. He broke his arm only a few days back but what a remarkable recovery he had that allowed him to play the last 25 minutes. Had someone followed his pass inside the box it would have been a dream openers for the icon of African football.

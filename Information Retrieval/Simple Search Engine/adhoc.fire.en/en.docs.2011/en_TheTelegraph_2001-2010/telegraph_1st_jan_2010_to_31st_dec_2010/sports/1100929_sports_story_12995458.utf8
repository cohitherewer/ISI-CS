The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ian keeps on tweeting
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ian keeps on tweeting
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Ian Poulter                           
	Ian Poulter insists European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie has not banned his players from using Twitter during the tournament at Celtic Manor this week.         
	On Monday, Montgomerie said that the recent controversy involving England cricket star Kevin Pietersen had prompted him to ask players to refrain from using the social networking site during the Ryder Cup, a move also made by opposite number Corey Pavin.         
	Pietersen was fined for reacting angrily to being left out of the one day and Twenty20 squads and later issued an apology for his language.         
	Montgomerie said: Ive just asked my team not to and they have said OK  thats fine, well start again tweetering or twittering, having never done it, on Monday, Oct.4. Kevin Pietersons error changed my view as to that.         
	Prolific tweeter Poulter, however, said: For the record Colin hasnt banned twitter, he has asked to be respectful to the teams privacy.         
	Not that Montgomerie intends to police things to make sure nobody steps out of line.         
	Its not a ban, because if somebody does it how can you punish someone for it? Its not a ban. Im not mentioning any names. I dont know who Tweets or who doesnt Tweet on our team, so I cant tell you. The captain doesnt and whoever does has been asked not to.         
	United States captain Pavin, who arrived with his side in Cardiff in mid-morning Monday after an overnight flight from Atlanta, commented: I think we talked about it as a team and we thought it best not to do it.         
	We need to focus on playing and working on preparations and getting ready to play the Ryder Cup.         
	As Colin said, Team USA, whatever they would like to do, Tweeting or Facebooking or whatever it may be, they have the opportunity to do that next week  and for the rest of their lives.         
	Last years Open champion Stewart Cink, one of Pavins four wildcards, is the chief tweeter in the American line-up.         
	He told his 1,201,022 followers from Atlanta: Were finally off to Wales!! Wont be tweeting until we get back.

            A STAFF REPORTER            India captain Sanjay Kumar (left) with his Pakistani counterpart Zaheer Abbas, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: A week back the Pakistan volleyball team had lost all hopes of participating in the Asian Volleyball Championship (Central Zone) in the city. The Indian high commission in Islamabad had still not cleared their visas and there was no hope in sight.         
	Pakistans conditioning camp had been disbanded and the players asked to go home. We knew the tour was not happening. Most of the players had returned home, said manager Farooq Meyer.         
	Suddenly three days before our departure, we were told that the visas had been cleared. Thankfully, we managed to get in touch with most of the players.         
	The high commission officials were very helpful. They worked even after normal working hours to clear our visas. Our initial plan was to travel by bus, but later we took a train and crossed the Wagah border on foot. The visas had to be adjusted accordingly, Meyer said.         
	The boys havent slept for 48 hours. They were travelling. Its the motivation of playing in India that has kept their eyes fresh.Last night we slept for hardly three hours after arriving in New Delhi Lets sleep well tonight and prepare for Fridays match, the manager hoped.         
	For Meyer, this is an opportunity to be back to his ancestral roots. Meyer studied in Darjeeling before his parents settled in Pakistan after the partition.         
	I remember going to the Victoria Memorial with my father. Also, walking around the Maidan with monkeys grabbing fruits... I hope to visit the places tomorrow (Friday), an emotional Meyer said.         
	The Pakistan team, under Brazilian coach Augusto Sabbatini, is looking to gain experience keeping in mind the Asian Games in Guangzhou, China in November. This tournament is very important for the Asian Games. My players need international experience Ours is a young team, said Sabbatini, who took over in November 2009. The volleyball team had worked with a Chinese coach previously.         
	Every match is important. Players need to understand the need to win. This side will take another couple of years to mature. The average age of the players is 20 and we wish to bring it down to 19, he added. Most of the Pakistan players are employed and practice for two/three months before the start of a tournament. Manager Farooq Meyer said volleyball was the third most popular game in Pakistan after cricket and football.         
	Captain Zaheer Abbas is hoping for the best. We dont have much experience. Hopefully well do well. All the teams are good here and with some luck we hope to do well. Giving the example of the successful Indo-Pak tennis pair of Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi, Zaheer said India and Pakistan should play regularly. Aisam and Bopanna have been very successful at the US Open. We can learn a lot from them.

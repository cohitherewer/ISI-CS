	Calcutta: Around 480 city coaches got valuable tips from Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore and National Cricket Academy director Sandeep Patil, in a mega coaches coaching workshop organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), here on Wednesday.         
	The move was to keep the coaches abreast of the latest techniques and emphasise the growing need to communicate with players from various age-groups and how man-management is a key to galvanise players at the senior level.         
	Former Sri Lankan coach Whatmore, under whose tutelage the island nation took some giant steps in international cricket, discussed on batting techniques as he also dwelt on the need to be pragmatic as a coach.         
	He harped on communication as a vital tool to understand, motivate and correct players.         
	He also said that it is often seen that the communication process is skewed in a cricketers formative years as he moves up the rungs.         
	It not only stagnates his learning process, but creates a void that becomes irreparable after a point, he added.         
	Among other things, Whatmore also emphasised the need to be tactful in dealing with senior players.         
	In a rare example, he said: (Muttiah) Muralidharan is an ultimate professional, always loved money, and got motivated.         
	Among others who shared their valued expertise were ICC Match Referee Raju Mukherjee, NCA physician Kinjan Suratwala, V. Venkatram.

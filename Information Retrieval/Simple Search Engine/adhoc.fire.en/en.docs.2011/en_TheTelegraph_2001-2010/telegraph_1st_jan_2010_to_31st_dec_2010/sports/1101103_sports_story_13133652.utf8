            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A series win over top-ranked Australia in the three-match ODI series will see Sri Lanka replace India and grab the second place in the ICC ODI rankings, but South Africa will have to win their remaining three matches against Pakistan if they want to topple India.         
	Both Sri Lanka and South Africa are currently locked on 115 ratings points, two behind India, but all this can change depending on how the two series pan out.         
	A 3-0 win for Sri Lanka will put them on 121 ratings points  four behind Australia, who will drop to 125 ratings points  while a 2-1 success for Kumar Sangakkaras side will take them to 118 ratings points.         
	However, Sri Lanka will drop behind England on 112 ratings points if Ricky Pontings side make a clean sweep of the series, while both the sides will retain their pre-series rankings and ratings if Australia wins the series 2-1.         
	On the other hand, South Africa face a far difficult challenge, particularly after Pakistans sensational one-wicket victory in the second ODI in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.

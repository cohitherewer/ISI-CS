	 The Bengal team, in all likelihood, will have to play their Ranji Trophy home matches at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, in the upcoming season as the construction work of the Eden Gardens gallery will be in its final phase. It will be difficult to complete the work if we have to stop it for the Ranji Trophy matches, a senior official said.                
	 In order to stop teams from fixing matches in the group stages, the CAB are mulling to do away with the drawn games. All two-day completed league matches should be result oriented. Only the matches which cant be completed due to some reason will be declared as drawn games, a senior office-bearer informed.

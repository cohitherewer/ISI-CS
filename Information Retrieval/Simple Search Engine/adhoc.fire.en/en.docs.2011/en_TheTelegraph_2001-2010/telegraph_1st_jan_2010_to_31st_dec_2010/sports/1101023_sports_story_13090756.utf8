  - Modi issue 
  -  October 26 deadline to be missed, but the BCCI stays cool         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Till Friday evening, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) hadnt received a compromise formula from Lalit Kumar Modis senior counsel, Ram Jethmalani.         
	Around 30 hours earlier, the Supreme Court gave Jethmalani eight days to try and work out a compromise on the composition of the three-member disciplinary committee which is probing the many charges against Modi.         
	Jethmalani himself sought time.         
	Significantly, with the Supreme Court adjourning the hearing of Modis petition till October 29, the six-month deadline for the BCCI to complete proceedings against the former official wont be met.         
	Modi, it may be recalled, had been suspended and showcaused in the early hours of April 26, minutes after the Indian Premier League (IPL)s third edition ended.         
	That the October 26 deadline wont be met isnt bothering the BCCI, though. With good reasons, too.         
	Modi is no longer chairman of the IPL, nor is he a vice-president of the BCCI... In fact, he doesnt even represent any association... The six-month deadline is, therefore, a non-issue where we are concerned, a top administrator told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday, he added: Today, Modis ties with the BCCI are as close as that of a man on the street... Hes out of the organisation and, for us, doesnt exist... Money doesnt seem to be a factor for him, so he can retain a battery of lawyers, but the BCCI knows where he stands.         
	Clearly, nobody in the BCCI is shedding tears for Modi, who was given a carte blanche by Sharad Pawar, now the International Cricket Council president, when the IPL was being put on track, back in 2007-08.         
	The BCCI, on its part, has already informed the Supreme Court that it wont be possible to reconstitute the disciplinary committee (comprising Arun Jaitley, Chirayu Amin and Jyotiraditya Scindia) at this advanced stage.         
	Modi, whose passport may get revoked, has alleged bias. He moved the Supreme Court after getting no relief from the Bombay High Court.         
	There was a time when Modi had many eating out of his hand. In the last six months, however, the pitch has changed dramatically.         
	Footnote: It couldnt be confirmed, but Jethmalani appears to have had a one-on-one with a key BCCI official some weeks ago. The dialogue, so to say, wasnt taken forward.

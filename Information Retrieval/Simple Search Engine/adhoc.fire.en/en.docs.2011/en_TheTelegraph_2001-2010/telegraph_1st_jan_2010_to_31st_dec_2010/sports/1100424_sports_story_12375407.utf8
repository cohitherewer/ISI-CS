The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pataudi clarifies
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pataudi clarifies
            OUR BUREAU                      
	One of Indias most respected cricketers, former India captain and a member of the Indian Premier League (IPL) governing council, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, has clarified that at no time during the television interview, on Thursday, did he mention there was match fixing in the cash-rich tournament.         
	On Friday evening, speaking to The Telegraph, Pataudi said: What I meant to say was that everything else was flung at the IPL, except match-fixing. That way, I am relieved that such an allegation hasnt been made.         
	Pataudi added that there was no reason to believe that any of the matches over the three seasons of the T20 league had been fixed.         
	On Thursday, in the television interview, Pataudi had said the governing council was a failure and that it should have been more aware of what was happening.         
	We should have been doing the questioning, but we didnt, because everything seemed okay. We were all carried away by how well he (Lalit Modi) was doing, he had said.         
	Pataudi, though, had credited Modi for the IPLs success. But said there were some factions within the governing council, who were not happy with the IPL chiefs functioning.

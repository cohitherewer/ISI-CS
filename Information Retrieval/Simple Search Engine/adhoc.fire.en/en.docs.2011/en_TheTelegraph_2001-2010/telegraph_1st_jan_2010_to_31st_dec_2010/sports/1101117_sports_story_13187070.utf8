The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Only a series win will satisfy Vettori 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Only a series win will satisfy Vettori 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori is happy with his teams performance so far, but insists they are not satisfied until they win the Test series.         
	Speaking at a media conference, on Tuesday, Vettori said Zaheer Khans injury, which forced the Indian speedster to bowl just three overs in the day, made it difficult for the hosts to win the Test.         
	We are happy, but not satisfied or content It was never our intention to come here and draw. If you get into that frame of mind you take a backward step straightaway. So weve come here to win a Test series and, at times, weve put ourselves in those positions. Im pleased with the manner in which our top-order has performed, especially after the Bangladesh series, Vettori said.         
	We wanted to get through that first hour, hour-and-a-half, and see where we were at Brendon and Kane played so well, so positively. But the fact that India were down a bowler probably made it quite difficult for them, he added.         
	Speaking on Harbhajans superlative show with the bat, he said: There is a plan always Only they are not working. We will have to rework our plan. Harbhajan and Sehwag are two players who have done very well against us in this series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All under control: Federer
                                                                                                                       7                                      All under control: Federer
                      
	Basel: Roger Federer has cleared the air with the Swiss tennis federation over his last-minute decision to pull out of the Davis Cup tie in Kazakhstan in September, the 16-time Grand Slam champion said on Monday.         
	Federer received rare criticism in his homeland when he withdrew two days before the tie. Switzerland went on to lose 5-0 and were condemned to the Europe/Africa group, effectively the competitions second division.         
	Criticism is okay but I think most of the people actually understood my decision, Federer said after overcoming Alexandr Dolgopolov in the Swiss Indoors on Monday when the Ukrainian retired hurt.         
	I dont read that much press but I always try to be very transparent with my thoughts. Kazakhstan was unfortunately not one I could do at the very end, I tried to keep it open as long as possible, but I always think of the long term.         
	I had a good conversation with the president of Swiss Tennis and all is under control.         
	Federer has played 37 Davis Cup rubbers, although from 2005 to last year he only represented his country in the playoff round which decides whether they stay in the World Group.         
	The Kazakhstan tie came shortly after the US Open, where Federer lost to Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals, but Swiss media said he should not have waited until the last minute before deciding.         
	Federer lost only four points on his serve as he won 6-4, 5-2 in 51 minutes on Monday, the match prematurely ending after Dolgopolov hurt his ankle.           (REUTERS)

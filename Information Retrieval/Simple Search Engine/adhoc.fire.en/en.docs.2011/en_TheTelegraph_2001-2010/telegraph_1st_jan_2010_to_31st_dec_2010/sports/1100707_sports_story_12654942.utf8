                                                                                                                       7                                      Injured Zaheer ruled out
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Zaheer Khan    
	Calcutta: Zaheer Khan has been ruled out of the forthcoming tour of Sri Lanka due to a shoulder injury. Karnataka pacer Abhimanyu Mithun will replace him, a Board of Control for Cricket in India said.         
	The tour includes three Tests, followed by a tri-series in Dambulla, also involving New Zealand.         
	Zaheer was rested for the recent tour of Zimbabwe in order to preserve himself for the busy season ahead. He participated in the Asia Cup in Dambulla and played in all four of Indias matches. The BCCI release did not reveal the cause of the injury or for how long he has been advised rest.         
	Zaheers absence will come as a big blow to India, whose fast bowlers havent been up to the mark of late, due to injuries and loss of form. The senior pros unavailability will mean that a lot of responsibility will rest with Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth.         
	Mithun has been on the fringes for the last few months after performing impressively for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy, where he was the highest wicket-taker last season. He made his ODI debut in Ahmedabad against South Africa.         
	He was withdrawn from the India A squad in England to replace the injured seamer Vinay Kumar in Zimbabwe, but didnt get a game. He rejoined his team-mates in England for the one-dayers.         
	The tour begins on July 18 with the first Test in Galle.

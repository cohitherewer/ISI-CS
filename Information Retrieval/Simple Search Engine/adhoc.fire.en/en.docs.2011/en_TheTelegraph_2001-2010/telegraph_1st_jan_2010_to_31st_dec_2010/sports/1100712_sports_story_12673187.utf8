The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Exhausted players cost Cup its sheen
                                                                                                                       7                                      Exhausted players cost Cup its sheen
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  
	Johannesburg: It was supposed to be the biggest show on earth, the best and more exciting than any other sporting event.         
	Yet, the failure of some of worlds most exhilarating and valuable players on the ultimate stage has left the 2010 World Cup a lot poorer; not in financial terms but in quality. The stars, who were expected to make the world stop in unison for 90 minutes, left their fans hugely disappointed.         
	Lionel Messi, Kaka and Wayne Rooney did not manage a goal between them, Cristiano Ronaldo scored just once and Fernando Torres found himself out of the starting line-up after repeated failures.         
	Michael Ballack had to skip the World Cup because of the injury he suffered in the FA Cup final and a troublesome knee injury forced Ghana midfielder Michael Essien to be ruled out of the meet.         
	There had been a lot of hue and cry about how the leading players, who do their duty for the top clubs throughout the year, were too jaded to stay at their best in the World Cup.         
	Top players were definitely tired. Fifa has to do something, or else the interest of the World Cup would be gone in a few years, former World Player of the Year, George Weah told The Telegraph during a Fifa function a few days ago.         
	Its not Weah alone who has raised concerns. In fact, Danny Jordaan, chief executive of the World Cup organising committee here, has asked Fifa to give the issue a serious thought.         
	Player freshness is always an issue at the World Cup, Jordan said. We have been wondering just how many matches the body of a footballer can take. Is it 70? Is it less?         
	I was having a discussion with Lucas Radebe (former South African footballer) before the 1998 World Cup when he was at Leeds. At the end of a season, the body cannot take the pressure and extra energy required for the World Cup. We have to make sure these players do have a rest before they come to a very demanding World Cup in Brazil, Jordaan said.         
	Jordaan had reasons to feel upset as some of the African nations were the hardest hit. The players starred in the African Cup and then in various European leagues before returning to their respective countries to spearhead their World Cup campaigns.         
	England went out in the pre-quarter final stage itself and manager Fabio Capello cited tiredness as reason for the failure. Some felt Italy and France slipped because their ageing stars could not cope up with the hectic schedule.         
	But, then, not everyone is buying the argument that player fatigue was the sole reason for their failure. Former Dutch star Ronald Koeman, who along with former Bulgaria captain Hristo Stoichkov, was present at the Spain training session on Saturday night, felt the issue was being blown beyond proportion.         
	Its definitely an issue but it could never stop good players from performing, Koeman said. How could Spain and the Netherlands reach the final? These players also played in highly demanding leagues back in their countries before coming here, Koeman added.         
	Koeman has a point. Six players in the Spanish squad belonged to Barcelona while three came from Real Madrid. In the Dutch team, most of the players do their duty for leading clubs like Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich and Ajax Amsterdam.         
	Dirk Kuyt, the livewire of the Dutch attack, said he wasnt jaded while coming for the World Cup. I played 53 games for Liverpool but wasnt tired. The Dutch manager gave me a week off after the Liverpool season so I could focus on the tournament. That was good for me.         
	Afterwards, I trained hard. I fought for my place in the team and enjoyed the World Cup, said Kuyt.         
	There seemed no tiredness in either his voice or his game.

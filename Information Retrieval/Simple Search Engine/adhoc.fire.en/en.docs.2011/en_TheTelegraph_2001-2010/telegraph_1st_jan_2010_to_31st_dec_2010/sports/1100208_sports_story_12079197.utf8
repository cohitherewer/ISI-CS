	Melbourne: Just a few days after completing a clean sweep against Pakistan, Australia continued their winning streak with a 113-run victory over the West Indies at the MCG Sunday.         
	The hosts were set up by Shane Watsons half-century and Doug Bollingers exploits with the new ball, according to Cricinfo.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee leaps into the lead

	Ponte Vedra Beach: Golf has been abuzz about a youth movement again, especially this week after the fuzzy-cheeked duo of Ryo Ishikawa, 18, of Japan and Rory McIlroy, 21, of Northern Ireland shot record-low rounds to win on the Japan PGA and the PGA Tour last week. But here on Floridas First Coast, where alligator hide is not always a reference to the primordial-looking reptiles in the water hazards at TPC Sawgrass, things are a bit different.         
	Different week, different golf course, different experience level necessary for success. At the Players Championship, it usually helps to have a few more miles on the odometer.         
	Enter Lee Westwood of England, the broad-backed 37-year-old leader after two rounds, as reported in Saturdays Late City edition.         
	Europes best player based on current form  and the best player in the world without a major championship  Westwood has diligently worked his way back up to No.4 in the official world golf rankings with his runner-up finish at the Masters.         
	With a few turns around the globe since turning pro in 1993, and the scars to prove it, Westwood has been there and back. He reached No.4 in the world in 2003, then took a four-year free fall to No.252. Now the self-described slow learner is back at No.4, older, wiser and playing better than any European and every American with the possible exception of Phil Mickelson.         
	Because world No.1 Tiger Woods, playing only his third event since his private life was left in tatters following a sex scandal, still seems to be struggling to get his game together after grinding out a 71 to lie nine strokes off the pace.         
	Although his driving was erratic, the 14-times major champion recorded five birdies along with two bogeys and a double-bogey at the difficult 14th.         
	I wasnt quite as sharp today (Friday) as I was yesterday, Woods told reporters after finding only eight of 14 fairways off the tee.         
	A week after missing the cut by a staggering eight shots at the Quail Hollow Championship in North Carolina, Woods at least avoided the embarrassment of a second consecutive early exit.         
	But Westwood again showed why he could be the man to beat this week at the Players, vaulting into the halfway lead Friday with a round of 65 for a 12-under-par 132.

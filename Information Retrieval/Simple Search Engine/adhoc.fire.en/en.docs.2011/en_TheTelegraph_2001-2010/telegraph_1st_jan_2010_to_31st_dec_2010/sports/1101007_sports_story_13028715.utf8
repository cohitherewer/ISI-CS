            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                Rushmi      
	New Delhi: After the highs, come the lows. Rohan Bopanna bowed out of the mens singles event of the Commonwealth Games, here on Wednesday, losing to second seed and world No. 133 Peter Luczak 2-6, 6-7 (5) at the R.K. Khanna tennis stadium.         
	Earlier, Sania Mirza and Somdev Dev Varman made it to the quarter finals in singles. Unseeded Indian Rushmi Chakravarthi pulled off a surprise upset against third-seeded Katie Brien to make the quarters too.         
	 While Sania recorded an emphatic 6-0, 6-2 victory over Brittany Teei from the Cook Islands, Dev Varman defeated Sri Lankan Amresh Jayawickreme 6-0, 6-1.         
	I am excited to win my first match. I am focussing on my game and I still have to deliver a lot more, said Saina after her match.         
	The second-seeded Indian was happy that her wrist was holding up. The ball is heavy here, it flies a lot and you have to use your wrist. I am happy the wrist is holding up.         
	Rushmis surprise victory saw the 33-year-old make the last-eight stage.         
	Though Rushmi lost the first set 1-6, she then pulled herself together to win the next two 7-6, 7-5 to cause the biggest upset in the competition so far.         
	Its the first time Ive played her and shes seeded. It was a tough one. It was difficult as Im not playing on the circuit now. Thus, it is one of the best wins of my career, she said after the match.

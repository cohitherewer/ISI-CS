	London: Arsenal stayed hot on the heels of champions Manchester United and leaders Chelsea when they won 2-0 at Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on Sunday with captain Cesc Fabregas again providing the inspiration.         
	Fabregas scored the opener and played a big part in Fran Meridas first Premier League goal as Arsenal moved to 45 points with United, who have played a game more, on 47 and Chelsea on 48.         
	Aston Villa became the latest top-four challenger to miss an opportunity when they were held to a disappointing goalless draw by West Ham United and Fulhams poor away form continued with a 2-0 defeat at Blackburn Rovers.

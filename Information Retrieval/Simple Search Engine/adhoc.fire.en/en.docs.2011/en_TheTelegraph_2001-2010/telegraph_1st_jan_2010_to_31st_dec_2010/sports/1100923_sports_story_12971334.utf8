            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Mary Kom    
	New Delhi: Five-time world champion MC Mary Kom qualified for the Asian Games on Wednesday, after the completion of the second round of trials, conducted by the Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) at the Talkatora Indoor Stadium.         
	Barring the IBF officials, no one was allowed to enter the stadium during the trials.         
	The initial trials, conducted in Bhopal last month, had been deemed inconclusive by the IBF.         
	Mary, who competed in the 48kg division to win her fifth world title in Barbados last Saturday, will be appearing in the 51kg flyweight competition in the Asian Games, at Guangzhou.         
	In the trials, Mary fought against L. Saritha Devi and Meena Kumari.         
	Though the result of the bout was not announced, Mary Kom was later named in the squad along with Preeti Beniwal (60 kg) and Kavita Goyal (75 kg).         
	I am very happy to have made the team but Im feeling bad for Sarita. She is a good boxer but both of us cannot be selected for the same weight category, said Mary Kom.         
	But, the good part is that my hard work and patience has paid off. I am very happy about that.         
	Mary Kom fought just a day after landing from Barbados.         
	However, the fatigue hardly showed when the 27-year-old took the ring as she dominated her two bouts to get the nod of the selection panel.         
	The panel, which has, among others, Manchester Commonwealth Games gold-medallist Mohammed Ali Qamar and IBF secretary general P. K Muralidharan Raja.         
	Mary was outstanding in both her bouts. Despite the fact that she was coming into the ring after such a long journey, she fought so well in both her bouts that there was hardly any doubt, said Muralidharan.         
	Womens boxing has been introduced in the Asia Games for the first time. The sport will also make its Olympic debut in London in 2012.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Kalighat players at the Eden, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Kalighat Club won their first trophy of the season after thrashing Mohun Bagan by 71 runs in the final of the Senior Division Knockout one-day championship at Eden Gardens. Opting to bat first under extremely humid conditions, Kalighat put up an impressive 279 for eight in the stipulated 45 overs.         
	Manoj Tiwary, who has just relinquished the club captaincy in favour of Sourasish Lahiri, scored 59 with the help of three fours and a six. Young southpaws Sudeep Chatterjee (55, 65 balls, 4x2, 6x2) and birthday boy Shreevats Goswami (47, 40 balls, 4x7) had provided a rollicking start.         
	However, the run-rate dropped in the middle-overs after which it was Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shuklas turn to tear apart Bagan attack with a quickfire 53 off 39 deliveries. Apart from five boundaries, Shukla hit couple of huge sixes.         
	After fielding for three hours in extreme conditions, chasing 280 was never going to be easy for Bagan. Wickets fell at regular intervals and Bagan were all out for 208 in 41.1 overs. Kalighat captain Lahiri was the pick of the bowlers, grabbing four for 38.         
	However, Shukla is a doubtful starter against East Bengal for the league quarter final as he is still not hundred per cent fit after recovering from chicken pox. The Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee wants Shukla to take at least a months complete rest.         
	If he wants to take care of his body, he should immediately stop playing this season. Bengal cricket needs him badly, Banerjee said.         
	Brief Scores         
	Kalighat 279/8 (M. Tiwary 59, L.R. Shukla 53). Mohun Bagan 208 in 41.1 overs (S. Lahiri 4/38). Kalighat won by 71 runs

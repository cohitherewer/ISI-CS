            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The ongoing World Cup hockey at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium is spreading its own message of effective brotherhood with sibling power fuelling the campaign of at least three teams in the tournament.         
	South Korea , the only Asian team to make the semi-finals in the last two World Cups, have the twin brothers  Moon Kweon Kang and Moon Kyu Kang  who are doing a great job in the midfield to keep alive their teams hopes for a last four berth.         
	The duo was born on April 24, 1988 and took to hockey almost at the same time. Moon Kweon, however, made his international debut before his brother and has represented his nation in 62 matches so far. Moon Kyu, who played in 33 matches before the World Cup, said winning the World Cup and the Olympic gold had always been the common goal for both the brothers.         
	We are yet to achieve the target but one day we will, promised Moon Kyu. Our parents had always remained very supportive and want us to continue playing the game as long as we can.         
	Like South Korea, Olympic silver medalists Spain also have two brothers, Ramon and David Alegre who are considered very important members of the squad. Ramon, the elder of the two, is a defender and played superbly in the last Olympic final against Germany. David, 25, is also a veteran of more than 150 international matches.         
	But the Argentine team is the best example of brotherhood in the ongoing World Cup. The team has three sets of brothers, two among the players and the other one in the coaching staff.         
	The most famous of them is Jorge Lombi. Having hung up his boots recently, Jorge is here in Delhi as an assistant coach to his elder brother Pablo.         
	Pablo is two years elder than me and also played for Argentina, said Jorge. As a hockey coach, he is definitely the best in the country. We have a perfect understanding and are doing a great job, he added.         
	Like the coach, Argentina captain Matias Damian Vila also has his brother, Lucas Martin Vila, playing in the team.         
	Lucas Martin Rey and Matias Alejandro Rey are the other pair of brothers in the Argentine team. According to Jorge Lombi, hockey is a firmly established sport in Argentina. In Argentina, there are many families whose every member play hockey. Thats one of the reasons why you get to see so many brothers in the team.         
	But nothing could be more unfortunate than what has happened to Mantell Brothers of England. While Simon Mantell, 25, was flown back home from Delhi after breaking a bone of his foot a couple of days before the start of the World Cup, his brother, Richard, followed him only a few days later with a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle against Pakistan.

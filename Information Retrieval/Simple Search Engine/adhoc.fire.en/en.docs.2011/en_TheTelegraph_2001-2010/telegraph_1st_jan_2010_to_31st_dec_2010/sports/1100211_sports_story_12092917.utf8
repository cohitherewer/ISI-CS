            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: An appeal by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) challenging the 12-month ban imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on the Kotla has been dismissed by the independent Appeals Commissioner, Michael Beloff.         
	The BCCI had disputed the ICCs classification of the pitch used for the India-Sri Lanka ODI on December 27 last year as dangerous and unfit.         
	Beloff, conducted the hearing via a teleconference on Tuesday and issued his written judgement late on Wednesday.         
	As per the regulations, the decision to declare the pitch as unfit was taken by ICC general manager (cricket) David Richardson and ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle. The BCCI had subsequently appealed against the decision.         
	In his judgement, Beloff said: Following due consideration of all the evidence and submissions from both the ICC and the BCCI, the correct decision was taken by Mr Richardson and Mr Madugalle to declare the pitch to be dangerous and, therefore, unfit.         
	Beloff added that the imposed suspension until the end of 2010 was proportionate in this case, according to an ICC release.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: We must now focus on making sure the New Delhi venue is ready in time for the 2011 World Cup.         
	The ICCs pitch consultant will travel shortly to the Kotla, a ground with a long and proud history, to begin the process of remedial work that will ensure the pitch is restored to its former glory.         
	The one-day International had been called off after 23.3 overs, during which the Sri Lankan players received several blows due to the uneven bounce of the pitch.         
	The ICC governing body earlier hadnt specifically used the word ban, but the ruling implied just that.         
	The ICC said in a statement that following the conclusion of a full investigation into the circumstances leading to the abandonment of the ODI on December 27, it was confirmed that no international cricket would be played at the ground until the end of December 2010.         
	As per the BCCIs rotation policy, the Kotla is not scheduled to host any international match this year.         
	The fact that the Kotla will host the Delhi DareDevils home matches in the upcoming IPL-III will, however, give the DDCA a chance to rebuild its image.         
	The Kotla is expected to host seven matches during the IPL in March-April. The one-year ban is on international matches, and the IPL, being a domestic tournament, is out of the global governing bodys purview.         
	Richardson and Madugalles decision was taken, after considering all the evidence, including video footage of the match, and the Match Referee Alan Hursts report and the submissions from the BCCI.         
	Richardson had said: We understand that turf pitches, by their very nature, are not and cannot be expected to always behave predictably and that an occasional delivery of unexpected steep bounce, while not ideal, especially for limited-overs cricket, is part of the game.         
	In this instance, however, we are of the view that the frequency of the misbehaving deliveries (on average just more than one every three overs)  and the excessive degree of variation  had the potential to inflict serious injury on the batsmen and that therefore the pitch that was prepared for the above match was dangerous and should therefore be classified as unfit.         
	The BCCI had disbanded its grounds and pitches committee following the abandonment of the ODI.         
	All members of the grounds and pitches committee of the DDCA  chairman Chetan Chauhan, convenor Sunil Dev and curator Vijay Bahadur Mishra  had also resigned owning moral responsibility for the pitch fiasco.

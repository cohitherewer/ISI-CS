The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I play like   a clown: Pietersen
                                                                                                                       7                                      I play like   a clown: Pietersen
                            
	Sydney: Englands Kevin Pietersen believes he is hitting his best form just at the right time with the Ashes series against Australia just a couple of weeks away.         
	The mercurial South African-born batsman was dropped by England for the Twenty20 and one-day series against Pakistan in September after a poor run of form.         
	A spell playing back in South Africa had rejuvenated him, Pietersen said after top-scoring with 58 in Englands first innings in the three-day tour match against Western Australia in Perth.         
	Ive never really been a technical player. I play like a clown, Pietersen, who added a quickfire 35 in 22 balls in the successful run-chase for victory on Sunday, said.         
	Its just my mental approach that I needed to change, and Im on fire at the moment.

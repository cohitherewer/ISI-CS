            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: It was the 10th century partnership in Tests between Virender Sehwag (173) and Rahul Dravid (104) on Thursday. While the Indian opener never allowed the Kiwis bowlers to dominate, Dravid took time to get into the groove for his 30th Test hundred.         
	Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Sehwag said there is no secret to their success except that they like to play the game in their own different styles.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Rahul Dravids innings         
	I think Rahul (Dravid) takes his time in batting and bats in his own style. I bat differently in the way I want. We never discuss our batting on the field or who should score faster or slower. Even today, we were chatting that the wicket is slow and that we should play little straighter than the cut or flick shot. He knows how to score runs and he has got a hundred.         
	If he had any specific game plan against the New Zealand bowlers         
	It was just a normal approach because I knew if I could stay in there for an hour I would settle down. Moreover, its difficult for a spinner to bowl on Day One because theres no turn and bounce. So, I mainly aimed at surviving for the first one hour and then score the runs.         
	Whether it was easy to bat on the wicket         
	The wickets slow and is easy to bat on. The ball is not moving, not seaming, too. But you have to apply yourself, be patient and pick the right balls to play your shots.         
	It also depends on which type of bowler is operating and at what time. Like, in the morning, the new ball was coming on to the bat nicely and we raced to 120 odd runs before lunch. But as the game progresses, the wicket will get slower.         
	On why he asked for a runner         
	My right knee was hurting because I fell down in the morning. Thats why I came back with a runner after tea. Now, its feeling better.         
	The sudden free-hit sign in the middle of the Test match         
	We are playing so many ODIs and T20 matches these days. So, I thought after the no ball (by Chris Martin), I will take a free hit. It was a joke. We should enjoy Test cricket also. As I did that everyone started laughing.         
	If Sachin would get his 50th Test hundred here         
	He never thinks like he has to score his 50th Test hundred or 51st hundred. He approaches each game like hes playing his first match.         
	On the New Zealand pace attack         
	Their bowling is not that experienced. One guy (Hamish Bennett) is making his debut and the other (Chris Martin) is not much experienced when bowling in Indian conditions. So, its difficult for a bowler who has never played in India and never bowled with an SG ball to make an immediate impact. They would learn for this experience...         
	His views on Hamish Bennett         
	A good bowler. He will learn a lot. This is just his first Test match. So... He has pace and an awkward action which is difficult to pick.         
	An ideal target on this wicket         
	We are looking at 550. If we can get there we can put pressure on the New Zealand batsmen. The pitch is slow, but it will turn on the third and fourth day. I am sure about that.

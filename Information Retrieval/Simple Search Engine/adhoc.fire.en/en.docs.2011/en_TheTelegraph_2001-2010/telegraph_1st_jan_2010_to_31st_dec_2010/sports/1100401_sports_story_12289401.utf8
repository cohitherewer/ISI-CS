                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies sweep series vs NZ
                      
	Hamilton: Mitchell Johnson achieved his second 10-wicket match haul in Tests to finish off New Zealand before lunch as Australia swept to a 2-0 series victory here Wednesday.         
	New Zealand resumed at 185 for five chasing a record-breaking target of 479, but Johnson and Doug Bollinger dismissed them for 302 to secure a 176-run victory, according to Cricinfo.         
	Johnson was responsible for causing the early damage on Day IV when his spells gained three wickets and he backed up with another three.         
	The six for 73 followed his four for 59 in the first innings. The performance ensured Australia finished the summer unbeaten.

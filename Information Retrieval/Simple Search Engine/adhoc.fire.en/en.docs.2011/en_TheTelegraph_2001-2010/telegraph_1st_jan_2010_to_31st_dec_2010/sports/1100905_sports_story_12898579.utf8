The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal finds   fixing horrifying
                                                                                                                       7                                        Arjun Atwal finds   fixing horrifying
  - Dont cricketers already earn enough, asks ace golfer       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjun Atwal                                       
	Calcutta: I cant imagine how a sportsman can live with himself after selling his country and his soul... I just dont understand this business of match-fixing and spot-fixing. I find it horrifying...         
	That was history-authoring golfer Arjun Atwals reaction when The Telegraph sought his views on the latest scandal to rock cricket, a sport he keeps track of, despite being based in the US.         
	Speaking from his hotel in Bangkok, on Saturday afternoon, as he neared the end of a lovely holiday in Thailand, Atwal said: I havent read all the details, but its all there in the papers and on the TV... I wonder how it will end...         
	Dont cricketers already earn enough? If money is the only consideration, Im sure theres enough to be made from endorsements. Why get on the payroll of bookies? Im intrigued.         
	After five days in Pattaya, Atwal and his family (wife, sons, parents, in-laws), as also close friends such as Gaurav Ghosh, came to the capital on Friday and will begin dispersing on Sunday.         
	This break was badly needed... The last time we had a family holiday was years ago... A break like this helps recharge batteries, Atwal, who recently became the first Indian to win a US PGA Tour title, pointed out.         
	Atwal, incidentally, flew to Thailand without his golf kit. My sons (Krishan, Shiva) were most happy when they learnt that the clubs would be left behind at home... So, you could say, Ive had a complete holiday!         
	Unless theres a change, Atwal will resume training on Tuesday, the day after reaching Orlando. Hes likely to be seen in action in the September 30-October 3 Viking Classic in Mississippi, which launches the Fall Season.         
	I drop my sons off to school and, then, do around half-an-hour of gym work and half-an-hour of yoga... After that, Im off to the driving range nearby, where I work on whatever I need to... Chipping, putting, driving... I play nine holes and end by 6.00-6.30 in the evening, when its time to return home, Atwal explained.         
	Atwal does have sponsorships from equipment providers, all foreign companies, but is looking for a tie-up with somebody from India.         
	People, I guess, are under the wrong impression that I make a lot, merely because I stay in and play in the US... Well, let me tell you that even somebody like Tiger Woods gets no more than 10 per cent or so of his earnings from the Tour, the rest is from endorsements and sponsors... Im still waiting for an Indian corporate to come forward...         
	Absolutely touched by the gesture from fellow-members of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, who gave him a standing ovation during the AGM on Thursday, Atwal said: Oh, I wasnt aware, till you informed me... Its overwhelming and Im thankful to Royal...         
	Now 37, Atwal got initiated into golf at the Tollygunge landmark.

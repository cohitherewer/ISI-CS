The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chief selector wants Yousuf in ODIs, too
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chief selector wants Yousuf in ODIs, too
                  Mohammed Yousuf                     
	Karachi: After his successful return to the Pakistan Test side, Mohammed Yousuf is all set to make his comeback in the one-day squad with chief selector Mohsin Khan saying that he sees a role for the former captain in next years World Cup in the subcontinent.         
	Mohsin said Yousuf, who averages 42 in 282 ODIs for Pakistan, still had a key role to play in the limited overs format.         
	Yousuf showed on his return to Test cricket at The Oval what a classy player he is. I have been saying he still has two to three years of cricket left in him. I also see a role for him in the one-day squad, specially with the 2011 World Cup in mind, Mohsin said Sunday.         
	He can play an important part in the one-day team and he can guide the younger players. In recent times most countries have relied on senior players in their one-day squad, he said.         
	Pakistan pacer Mohammed Aamer, who was instrumental in Pakistans four-wicket victory, said the secret of his superb performance was the ability to keep the pressure at bay.         
	Aamer, who scalped five wickets for 52 runs to help his team restrict the hosts to 222 in the second innings, also bagged the Man of the Match award.         
	I dont really let pressure affect me at all. I believe that pressure is something that an individual creates for himself and its something that you can avoid. I just go out there, relax, smile, enjoy myself, play my natural game, do what comes naturally to me and play my cricket according to the conditions and match situation, he said.         
	The more you worry about things when you are out there in the middle, the more problems you are going to encounter, the 18-year old said.         
	Aamer also felt that his partnership with Mohamed Asif was good for Pakistan cricket.         
	Hes a fantastic guy to bowl in tandem with. Hes such a threatening bowler, a wicket taker, someone who has ability to take a wicket with every delivery. He is such a brilliant team player who will bowl according to any situation.         
	His nagging accuracy and skill really helps me and I think we complement each other very well, Aamer said.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan have dedicated a part of their match fees to victims of the floods which have devastated their country. The floods, which have affected a third of the country over the past three weeks, have killed at least 1,600 people and left more than four million homeless.         
	Pakistan captain Salman Butt said his team had dedicated the victory to the flood victims. We have already donated a percentage of our match fees, he said. This is the only way we can give back to the Pakistan people if we perform well.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss said his team would also donate a part of their match fees. Its a massive humanitarian catastrophe out there and were trying to help as much as we can and the more people who do that the better, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harris to miss   rest of series
                                                                                                                       7                                      Harris to miss   rest of series
            A STAFF REPORTER                             
	Calcutta: Australian pacer Ryan Harris suffered a stress ankle fracture while bowling in the fourth Ashes Test and will require surgery forcing him to miss the rest of the series, Cricket Australia said Tuesday.         
	Harris pulled up while bowling the fifth ball of his 29th over and immediately pulled off his left boot and sock.         
	He limped off the ground with the team physio and a decision is to be taken whether he will bat in the second innings as Australia battle to avoid defeat in the fourth Test.         
	Ryan Harris developed ankle pain during Englands first innings and scans have revealed that he has a stress fracture of his left ankle, team doctor Trefor James said in a statement.         
	Ryan is likely to require surgery and will consult a specialist in the next 24 hours.         
	Australia will now need to find a bowling replacement for Harris for next weeks fifth Ashes Test in Sydney.         
	Harris was playing in only his fifth Test match in Melbourne and he also has a degenerative problem in his right knee that needs corrective surgery.         
	If I was 21 Id get it done but Im not, Im 31 and its a 12-month recovery, so for me to have that I think would be the end of my career, he said, after taking 6 for 47 in the second innings of the Perth Test.         
	Harris had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee earlier this year.

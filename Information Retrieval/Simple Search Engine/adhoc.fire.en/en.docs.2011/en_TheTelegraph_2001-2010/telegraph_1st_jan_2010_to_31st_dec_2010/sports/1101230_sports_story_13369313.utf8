	Durban: Team Indias hero, V.V.S. Laxman, spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On getting the MoM award...         
	Am very happy... Im feeling proud... Beating South Africa at home is never easy and to be the MoM in a winning effort here is just terrific.         
	Being unusually emotional...         
	As Ive said, Im very happy that I could contribute to a winning cause... Its a win which is going to be remembered for long.         
	Dedicating the effort to...         
	(Laughs) My wife, Sailaja... Im sure her prayers are getting answered.         
	Finally, celebrations...         
	Weve had a quiet one... Theres talk that the team will have dinner together, but its not confirmed... We arent going overboard as weve only won a Test, winning the series remains... Were looking forward to having a big celebration in Cape Town (at the end of the three-match series).

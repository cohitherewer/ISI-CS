  - Half-centuries by Akmal Brothers go in vain         THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Michael Hussey produced an astonishing late onslaught to sneak Australia past champions Pakistan and into the World Twenty20 final against England.         
	Australia had rarely looked likely to better Pakistans mammoth 191 for six  but after Hussey hit three sixes and a four from four Saeed Ajmal deliveries, they did so with one ball and three wickets to spare at Beausejour Stadium.         
	Hussey (60 not out) dominated an unbroken stand of 53 with Mitchell Johnson, and made a mockery of expectations after Ajmal began the final over needing only to stop Australia making 18 more runs to carry Pakistan into a third successive final in this competition.         
	Earlier, Pakistan rode on blistering half-centuries from Kamran Akmal (50) and Umar Akmal (56) to post a challenging 191 for six .         
	Put into bat, Kamran and Salman Butt (32) shared a 58-ball 82-run opening partnership to set the tone while Umar provided the late charge as Pakistan stunned Australia with their stroke-play on a sticky Beausejour wicket here.         
	Inclement weather and wet ground conditions had earlier delayed the start of the match by half an hour but that did not bother the Pakistan openers as they went about their business.         
	After a watchful start to ensure no initial hiccups, Kamran and Butt went hammer and tongs, smashing Dirk Nannes, Shaun Tait, Mitchell Johnson and Shane Watson with casual disdain to reach 40 in six overs.Kamran set the ball rolling, hitting Dirk Nannes for back-to-back fours at cover and mid-off in the third over.         
	Butt then used his bottomhand to good use to pick up his first four at cover before playing a striking square cut for another boundary in the third over off Shaun Tait.         
	Butt meted out the same treatment to Johnson in the fifth over when he danced down the pitch and slammed a ball from outside the off stump to the point boundary.         
	With Pakistan going great guns, Clarke turned to spinner Steven Smith but Kamran clobbered the Australian for a four and a six to accumulate 15 runs off his first over.         
	Shane Watson was in Kamrans firing line in the next over as the opener plundered a six and two fours en route to his fifty in 32 balls as Pakistan breezed to 81 in nine overs.         
	However, two balls later a brilliant catch by David Warner off Johnson at deep cover cut short Kamrans journey as Pakistan lost their first wicket at 82 in 9.4 overs.         
	Butt followed Kamran into the hut when his shot off Smith found Warner in the deep as Pakistan slipped to 89 for two in 11.1 overs.         
	Three overs later, David Hussey removed skipper Shahid Afridi when he sliced one towards point and Brad Haddin caught it after an almost collision with Watson.

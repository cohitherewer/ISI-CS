The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cook may get time to spice up game
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cook may get time to spice up game

	Englands selectors will announce the squad for the third Test against Pakistan on Sunday morning. All indications are that the team will be unchanged with Alastair Cook being given the next two Tests, both in London, to make the big score both he and Englands management feel will set him on his way to a fruitful Ashes series in Australia.         
	Cook has scored just one 50 in his past three series on home soil and has got himself in a tangle with his technique. Idiosyncrasies in technique abound even at the highest level and the adage used to be whatever works for the individual.         
	But trigger movements, however complicated (and Cooks are), have to be subconscious not self-conscious, which is what his little foxtrot at the crease looks like.         
	Assuming they do pick him, the selectors will hope Cook gets an assist from two sources. Essex are in the Friends Provident Twenty20 Finals Day at the Rose Bowl on Saturday and there is nothing like a few lusty blows to declutter the mind.         
	It once worked well for Andrew Flintoff and there is little more uplifting for struggling batsmen than to nail a few out of the middle.         
	The second is that the pitch at the Oval tends to suit batsmen better than most (last years surface against Australia being an exception), and in particular batsmen who prefer to play off the back foot, as Cook does.         
	He has the backing of Andrew Strauss, his captain, who, apart from pointing out the tricky nature of facing Pakistans bowlers in helpful conditions, fully endorsed his opening partner after the second Test at Edgbaston.         
	Strauss does not pick the side, but it would be unthinkable for the selectors to ignore his testimony and drop Cook now. After all, not many teams change their personnel after their sixth successive Test win.         
	With the Ashes looming, the pressure on Cook to get a score in the next two Tests will be intense.         
	The best players always find a way to come through but how long do you give an ailing player to succeed? Cook will get a 100 eventually but then give a monkey a pen and enough time, they say, and he will one day write Hamlet.         
	Cook is Englands vice-captain, and earmarked as Strausss eventual successor, so there is a lot at stake for him to fail again.         
	Players rarely volunteer to be dropped when out of form, but it is not unknown. When Terry Alderman had Graham Gooch leg before, for fun in the 1989 Ashes, Gooch suggested to selectors that he might be better off working on his game away from the Test arena, but was ignored.         
	The selectors try to be loyal to players, and that is fair enough. But, it is tricky balancing between doing right by Cook and convincing those pressing him with runs in county cricket, like Hampshires Michael Carberry, that the England team is not a closed shop. Carberry has scored six championship 100s this season and must be wondering how much higher the entry bar is set.         
	There will probably be one change to the squad at Edgbaston. Before he turned his ankle over a few weeks ago, Ajmal Shahzad was to be the spare bowler but his place was taken by Tim Bresnan.         
	Unless they feel the Oval pitch might turn, in which case Monty Panesar would present a good case to at least be on hand, following some good performances for Sussex, Shahzad will probably resume his role.         
	If the Oval is true to type, Pakistans batting should be harder to shift, especially if, as expected, it is bolstered by Mohammed Yousuf, their best batsman of recent times.         
	Players representing Pakistan always seem to have something to prove to someone, but being banned indefinitely for poor captaincy and then retiring because of that, as Yousuf did, takes the burden of proof to new levels.         
	Meanwhile Kevin Pietersens agent is set to hold informal talks with Middlesex in the build-up to the third Test. Pietersen, who will leave Hampshire at the end of the season, needs to find a new county to satisfy the England and Wales Cricket Boards regulations.

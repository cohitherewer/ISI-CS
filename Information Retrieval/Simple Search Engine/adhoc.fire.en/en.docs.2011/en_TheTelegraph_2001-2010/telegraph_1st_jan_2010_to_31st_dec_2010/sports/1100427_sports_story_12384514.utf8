The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB in a spot of bother
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB in a spot of bother
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal is in a weird fix as some of the clubs are declining to play the remaining matches of the different first division tournaments.         
	As a result, the CAB office bearers are finding it hard to complete the statutory first division tournaments by June 30. The statutory tourneys include League, A.N.Ghosh and Knock-out tournament. P. Sen Trophy, which is an invitational meet, is always the last tournament of the season.         
	As the league was postponed for nearly two months (because the fate of the West Bengal Police-Aryan match wasnt declared), some of the lower rung clubs placed in relegation zone are now declining to play.         
	The clubs, which are reluctant to play, are YMCA, Manohorpukur Milan Samity, Barisha SC and Bhukailash Sporting Club, High Court and Suburban Club.         
	Some of these clubs have written to the CAB citing their inability to play in the relegation play-off. The reasons given are the inordinate delay in starting the second phase and the excess expenditures incurred. However, we believe that these are all excuses to avoid playing relegation play-offs, a senior member of the tournament committee stated.         
	He further added: We have repeatedly asked them that we would provide them with practise facilities and whatever they required. But they are in a non co-operative mood. Though High Court and Suburban looked like softening their stand, but the four others are little reluctant to play. We might have to take stern action if these clubs dont co-operate.         
	However, six other clubs  George Telegraph, DKS, Rajasthan, West Bengal Police, Young Bengal and Paikpara Sporting Club  have said they have no problem in playing the relegation play-offs.         
	The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Tuesday received a cheque of Rs 25 lakh, out of the remaining Rs 50 lakh they were supposed to receive from the Kolkata Knight Riders for hosting the seven IPL matches this season. We have received a cheque of Rs 25 lakh today (Tuesday). Thus, we have now received Rs 2.25 crore out of Rs 2.50 crore, a senior CAB official informed.

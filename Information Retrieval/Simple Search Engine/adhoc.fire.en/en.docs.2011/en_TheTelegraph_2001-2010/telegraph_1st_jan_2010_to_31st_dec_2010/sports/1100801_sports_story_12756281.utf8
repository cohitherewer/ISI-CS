The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif: Been a good comeback
                                                                                                                       7                                      Asif: Been a good comeback
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif believes his bowling has improved by leaps and bounds ever since he made his international comeback after serving a 12-month suspension for a positive dope test.         
	I feel I am improving everyday and my bowling is getting better all the time and in every match. It has been a good comeback for me since returning to the team last year, Asif said.         
	The pacer told a television channel that he had vowed to give his best when he returned to the team. Being banned for 12 months and facing other problems in this period was a big test for me. My cricket suffered a lot and it took a lot of effort physically and mentally to come back to international cricket, Asif said.         
	The lanky pacer finished with 5 for 77 including a spell of 4 for 12 runs on the second day of the first Test against England at Nottingham, leaving him just one wicket short of the 100 mark in Test matches.         
	I think having a bowling coach like Waqar Younis has helped a lot and allowed me to slowly come back. But as a bowler also I feel I am improving with every match and the rhythm is good, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori shines on Day I vs Aussies
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettori shines on Day I vs Aussies
                      
	Hamilton: Daniel Vettori experienced the perfect start to his 100th Test after taking four wickets, running out Ricky Ponting and watching his side ruffle Australia in the second Test that started here Saturday.         
	New Zealand dismissed their highly fancied opponents for 231 and then finished at 19 for one. Tim Southee accepted extra responsibility to back up his captain after the hosts picked two spinners. He provided a clever performance with four for 61, according to Cricinfo.         
	But the star was Vettori, who earned more worthy plaudits in a praise-heavy week, with fur for 36 in 19.3 overs.         
	New Zealand benefited from a series of errors from the most qualified Australian batsmen, and then swept through the lower order.

	New Delhi: In a shocking incident, the Indian shooting contingent was harassed by the organisers of the ISSF World Cup in Dorset, UK, forcing team manager M. Padmanabhan to shoot off a letter to the Indian High Commissioner in London.         
	In his letter, Padmanabhan said Commonwealth Games gold medallist Manavjit Singh Sandhu was insulted by the transport supervisor.         
	Our shooters were in the process of boarding the bus from the ranges to the official hotel when the driver slammed the door shut on the Indian shooter waiting outside and left him at the range. When the other shooters on the bus strongly objected, the driver turned back and went to the supervisor of the transport dept, Mike.         
	Mike then returned to the bus and yelled and screamed at our shooters and insulted them. He was very very rude and threatened the team with dire circumstances. He then (asked) Manavjit Singh to get off the bus, Padmanabhan wrote in his letter.

    - In my eyes, Mother is a saint, says ace golfer             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Arjun Atwal                                 
	Calcutta: Arjun Atwal, the history-maker, spoke to The Telegraph from his Orlando residence before leaving for Thailand, for a brief holiday. During the conversation, the 37-year-old who has become the first Indian to win an US PGA Tour title, picked his idols.               
	Excerpts               
	The ones whove had the biggest influence on him         
	(Laughs) Parents (Bindi, Rupi), wife Sona... In the early years, my parents provided great balance, instilled values... Then, in the last 10 years or so, my wife has had a big influence, has been an absolute pillar of strength... The yoga ashram (in Bihar) Ive been associated with has also been a significant player.         
	His idols (alphabetically)         
	JACK NICKLAUS (70): I grew up watching his tapes... There were no instructors as such then and certainly no academy. I learnt a lot from his Golf My Way, an iconic instructional book...         
	Moment to remember: Meeting Nicklaus during a Pro-Am hed organised after the death of his young grandson, in a drowning accident, a few years ago... I requested a photograph with him and he obliged... That remains one of my most cherished photographs... Did I tell Nicklaus that Id idolised him? No... I mean, he wouldve heard that from everybody!         
	GREG NORMAN (55): What a presence... When hes around, you cant miss him... I just love the way he plays...         
	Moment to remember: Meeting Norman during the Honda Classic, on the West Palm Beach... It wouldve been in 2004, I guess... I knew his caddie and asked him to get an autograph... Thats when I met Norman and used the occasion to tell him hed been a big inspiration... Pros usually dont take autographs on the Tour, but I didnt want to miss that chance... Normans been such a crowd-puller.         
	MOTHER TERESA (passed away in 1997; birth centenary celebrated on August 26): She didnt lead her life for herself, but for others... Frankly, I cant think of a more amazing individual... She hasnt got sainthood, but, in my eyes, shes a saint... To come to Calcutta at such a young age and make it her home... Then, to make a difference in the lives of so many... Only a saint could do all that. I dont know how many would put themselves in her position...         
	Regret: Not having met Mother... Ive been to the Missionaries of Charity, though, and Ive been making an annual donation... Its something very personal and, obviously, Mother has had a big influence.         
	The qualities idols should have         
	Its a tough one, because different people look at heroes and idols differently... Ive looked up to Nicklaus and Norman because of what theyve done for sport in general and golf in particular... Plus, theyve been such remarkable individuals even off the golf courses... I look up to Mother because of her selflessness, of the example she has set.         
	Finally, on dear friend Tiger Woods         
	Havent come across a more simple human being (in the sports fraternity)... Dont forget Tiger has been No.1 for years, but still... I wont take names, but Ive met superstars from other disciplines and, yes, they have egos.

	Vieira mulls retirement  
	Paris: Former France captain Patrick Vieira said on Saturday he would not be available for selection under new coach Laurent Blanc, which could mean his prolific international soccer career is over. Vieira, 34, now past his prime, was not included by coach Raymond Domenech in the French World Cup squad, whose group stage exit from the finals in South Africa was engulfed in scandal after players boycotted a training session. Asked on French television channel Canal Plus if he would be available for selection under Blanc, who will now replace Domenech, Vieira said: No, it wouldnt be reasonable. One of the worlds finest holding midfielders, Vieira was a prominent member of Frances 1998 World Cup and 2000 European championship-winning teams. He has scored six goals from 107 internationals.

We had a difficult start on June 11 due to transportation issues as a result of lack of co-ordination between different groups. But now that has been sorted. Altogether, definitely since then, I think that we have been able to solve all the issues. If on July 11, we are on the same level as we are today, I would say its a perfect World Cup, FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said.

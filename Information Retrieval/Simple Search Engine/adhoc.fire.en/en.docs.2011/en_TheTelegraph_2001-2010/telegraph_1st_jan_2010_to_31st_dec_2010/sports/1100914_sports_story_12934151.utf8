	London: The Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) chief Tim May fears the betting mafia might be targeting children in the under-age cricket tournaments to get them involved in corruption at the senior level.         
	We understand players are being increasingly targeted at under-age tournaments by the various elements that are floating around the game, May was quoted as saying.         
	Were continually told that youre in (involved in corruption) you cant get out so its no surprise that young players are coming under pressure. We regularly talk about the importance of player education among international players, but this has to filter down to those playing at domestic level and also at the various age groups underneath, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sporting shock Mahindra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sporting shock Mahindra
                      
	Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa mounted a strong fightback in the second half to beat Mahindra United 3-2 in the I-League on Tuesday and keep alive their hopes of avoiding relegation.         
	Viva Kerala, too, earned a lifeline in their bid to beat the drop by defeating Lajong FC 2-1 in their last home fixture in Kozhikode. Viva, 11th on the table after 24 rounds, have two more matches to go.         
	Sporting Clubes win gives them 24 points from as many matches, the same as Salgaocar, but they occupy the bottom rung on account of inferior goal difference. Mahindra remained second with 38 points from 24 matches.         
	Sporting Clube enjoyed the bulk of possession and were rewarded for their creativity with goals from substitute Nathaniel Amos, Junior Obagbemiro and Adil Khan.         
	Sushil Kumar Shinde and Mohammed Rafi were on target for Mahindra, both of whose goals came in the first half. The first of those was from the spot with Shinde converting after Rovan Pereira brought down Rafi in the penalty area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We tried our best, but failed, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      We tried our best, but failed, says Dhoni
    - Im not bothered... We have more respect for the country than those shouting slogans           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Mahendra Singh Dhoni        
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Mahendra Singh Dhonis shoulders werent drooping when he came to address the Fourth Estate, late on Tuesday, after Team Indias ouster from the World Twenty20s third edition.         
	Also captain when India won the inaugural event, in 2007, Dhoni has now seen his team exit from the Super Eights in successive editions.         
	In between, of course, was another poor show in an ICC event  the Champions Trophy, last September-October.               
	The following are excerpts from Dhonis media conference and his brief one-on-one with The Telegraph         
	Yet another defeat in an ICC tournament...         
	We arent playing to potential... Nobody came here to lose, but what can be done if the opposition plays really well and outplays you? We had the countrys 15 best T20 players.         
	Result being a setback         
	One has to learn lessons.         
	Failing to total more than 163 (for five), despite a superb start  90 for one after 10 overs         
	Sri Lanka bowled very well from the 12th over or so... They bowled perfect yorkers and, even though we tried, we couldnt push the scoring... The last few overs didnt go our way... Its disappointing.         
	Winning the toss and opting to set a target         
	I dont regret the decision... Had we got 175-180, then we wouldve been looking to defend 155-160, instead of 143... Those extra runs wouldve made a difference.         
	Not having enough time to prepare for the bouncy surface at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown         
	Cant blame the wickets or the conditions... We knew what to expect... I cant complain that we didnt have enough time.         
	A number of batsmen falling to the short-pitched deliveries         
	Most of us batsmen have a problem with that... We dont have bouncy wickets and dont have bowlers (in domestic cricket) who bowl at 145 kmph... We have a problem and Im not ashamed of saying that we dont play the short-pitched bowling well... If we have a problem, we have a problem.         
	Inputs from coach Gary Kirsten on tackling such deliveries         
	His inputs have been there... While practising, we try and get into good positions to hook and pull... Hes been of great help, but we have limitations.         
	Whether the IPL has, again, contributed to Indias poor show         
	No... The Indian players shouldve benefited... Some have done well and the IPL has helped us to groom players... Talking of myself, I came here feeling fresh, despite playing all but three of the (Chennai Super Kings) matches... However, you have to respect your body and take care of your body... If youll party after a match and travel the next morning, then that will take its toll... Its up to individuals. (Adds grinning) Im glad that next year, the IPL will be after a big event (the 2011 World Cup), so I wont be having to answer IPL-related questions.         
	Senior pros like Yuvraj Singh failing         
	You could say that contributed to our defeat... The big-hitters didnt come off... They werent successful.         
	The negative reaction from fans         
	We get appreciated and we get criticised... Were used to it, know what to expect... We tried to give it our best shot, but ended up losing...         
	Reports of demonstrations back home         
	Im not bothered... We have more respect for the country than those doing such naare baazi... Its easy to get slogan-shouters out on the streets.         
	His message         
	I accept our performance hasnt been good, but at the end of the day, its a sport... We tried our best, but failed... I still feel we have a very good side, its a team with potential. But, yes, weve had two-three off-tournaments.         
	Not practising on the eve of the match against Sri Lanka         
	We want the players to be fresh... We play and practise right through the year, one day wouldnt have made a difference... Remember, its important to take time off cricket.         
	Pressure on him as captain         
	Irrespective of the opposition, one is always under pressure... I havent played any match where there has been no pressure... I try and do the best I can... The captain is the face of the team, he has to face the media (and the fans ire)... I know Im the captain in a country where cricket is such a big sport.         
	Injuries to Virender Sehwag and Praveen Kumar         
	They happen and, so, one has to take and manage the resources available.         
	[Sehwag didnt make the trip at all; Praveen wasnt available after the first-round.]         
	Zaheer Khans omission from the XI against Sri Lanka         
	He had a bruised right thumb... We wanted fully fit men out on the park.         
	What will be discussed at the last team meeting in the West Indies         
	Well analyse what went wrong... Even introspect.         
	Lastly, plans for the immediate future...         
	Ek mahina ki chhutti ho gi... Ill rest and prepare for the next season which, for me, begins with the Asia Cup (in Sri Lanka).

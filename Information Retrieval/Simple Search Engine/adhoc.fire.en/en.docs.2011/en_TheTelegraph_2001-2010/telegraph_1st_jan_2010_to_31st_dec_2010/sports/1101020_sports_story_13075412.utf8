The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A medal against all odds
                                                                                                                       7                                      A medal against all odds
                      
	New Delhi: Inhalers are as integral to his kit as racquets but stringent anti-doping rules meant that Indian shuttler P. Kashyap, who is an asthmatic, battled his breathing problems without some key medicines before clinching the mens singles bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games.         
	Kashyap, who beat higher-ranked Malaysian Mohammed Hafiz before losing to Englands Rajiv Ouseph in the CWG semi-finals, defeated compatriot Chetan Anand in the bronze medal play-off.         
	But during the campaign Kashyap had to avoid some regular medicines he takes for his breathing problems due to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)s stringent code.         
	Because of Wada rules, we cannot give him all medicines as we did not want to take any kind of risk related to his career. During tournaments, including the CWG, he did not take his medicines and fought against it. He is a brave child, Kashyaps father Uday Shankar said.         
	The Kashyaps, in fact, go on to reveal that they never thought their son would be able to pursue the sport after being diagnosed with asthma five years ago.         
	We were worried because he was diagnosed to be in the second stage of asthma and we thought he will not play anymore, his mother Subhadra said.         
	But, he proved them wrong. (PTI)

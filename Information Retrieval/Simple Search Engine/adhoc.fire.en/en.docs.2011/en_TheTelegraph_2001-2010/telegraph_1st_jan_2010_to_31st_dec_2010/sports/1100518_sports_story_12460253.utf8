The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karun upbeat after scare

	Monaco: Karun Chandhok hailed Sundays Monaco Grand Prix as one of his best races yet, despite running over a rivals steering wheel and then crashing out with a car skimming his helmet.         
	The Indian Formula One driver was running in 14th place when his HRT and the Lotus of Italian Jarno Trulli tangled at the Rascasse corner with four laps remaining. Trulli had tried to go past on the inside but ran out of space as Chandhok turned in. The Lotus lifted and went over the top of the other car.         
	Jarno just tried something silly really, the Indian said in the team motorhome after returning from a debrief with engineers.         
	I dont think he would have even had enough steering lock to get around the corner from the angle he was coming at. He would have done the old Schumacher 2006 parking move.         
	He has apologised...I quite like Jarno, hes a nice guy and I think when he apologises he knows hes screwed up.         
	Fortunately I was a bit lucky as I ducked and he went over my head, continued Chandhok.         
	It didnt actually touch me but it looked worse than it actually was. But it was very frustrating because that was probably my best race of the year in terms of pace and we were racing the other two new teams.         
	The Indian had earlier driven over a steering wheel tossed onto the track by Brazilian Rubens Barrichello after he crashed his Williams on the approach to Casino square.         
	The wheel, a piece of equipment worth around $50,000 or roughly the cost of a luxury car, then became jammed under the HRT until it worked loose.         
	What was he doing?, Chandhok said of Barrichello.(Race director) Charlie (Whiting) actually asked me about it. You see on the video that he just throws it.         
	I could feel it scraping all the way to Mirabeau and then the noise stopped. One of the marshals has reported back that they saw it fall out of my car in the tunnel. And then Bruno ran over it.         
	That steering wheel has been well and truly Hispania-ed.         
	Barrichello said later on his Twitter feed that he had thrown the wheel out because he wanted to get out as soon as possible. After the shunt I was facing the wrong side of the track and the car was on fire.

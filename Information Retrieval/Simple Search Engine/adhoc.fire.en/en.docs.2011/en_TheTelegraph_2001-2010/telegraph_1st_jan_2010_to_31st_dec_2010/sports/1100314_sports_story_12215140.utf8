                                                                                                                       7                                      Sessions with Akram helped   Ishant: Dav
            A STAFF REPORTER                                        Dav Whatmore        
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) coach Dav Whatmore feels that the presence of a shrewd tactician like Sourav Ganguly has been of great help for him. Speaking at a media conference on Saturday, the Sri Lanka-born Australian also said that though he was happy with the Knights performance in the first match, they still needed to work on their batting at the top of the order.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	Bracing up for a Super Sunday (against the Royal Challengers Bangalore)         
	Yeah, obviously Expecting a similar performance from the boys on Sunday.         
	On facing the last years finalists         
	They may have been finalists last year, but tomorrow (Sunday) is a new day. Also, the fact that they entered the finals last year, improving from their last position finish the first edition of IPL, proves that things can change. We will need to play well against them.         
	On Souravs captaincy         
	I am fortunate that I have a shrewd captain like Sourav who knows how to handle pressure situations.         
	Ishant Sharmas bowling         
	I thought Ishant has struck a good rhythm even before the tournament started. When you are talking of Ishant, its the quality that matters over quantity. There was never a question mark over his ability. He always had that. Its just that for a certain period of time, things didnt work out in his favour. But he is coming back well. Also, sessions with someone like Wasim Akram has been of great help.         
	Important players in the Bangalore team         
	There are a few, but I wouldnt like to name any specific players. They have players who can be dangerous.         
	Any changes in the squad         
	I am not going to tell you that.         
	The positives from the last match         
	I think the best part was the fighting spirit shown by our boys when many thought that our chance of winning the match was bleak. We still have to work a bit on our batting at the top of the order.         
	The Eden Gardens wicket         
	There are a lot of local boys who know the wicket. So, that will be of great help.         
	On being the coach of a high-profile team like the KKR         
	Its a tough job No matter how much you do, you still feel you could have done better. As a coach, you have to put a lot of emphasis on the basics.         
	The coachs role during the strategy breaks         
	I am a firm believer of the fact that once the match starts, its the players game. A coach can only contribute that much. The course of the match is very much determined by the leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy with the preparations
                                                                                                                       7                                        Happy with the preparations
  - It will be a pleasure to have Gary for another three years, says Mahendra Singh Dhoni         A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni, during a media conference in Johannesburg, on Wednesday                                 
	Centurion: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni disagreed with the view that there was any pressure on the visitors in the tough South Africa tour and that the team is looking forward to the challenge.         
	Speaking at a media conference on the eve of the first Test, against South Africa, Dhoni, however, accepted that Zaheer Khans injury is a concern for the team.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Zaheers injury         
	Zaheer is doubtful for the first Test. Well take a call tomorrow (Thursday) morning before the start of the game. As I said he is quite doubtful for tomorrow.         
	Whether Zaheers injury is a big blow         
	Zak has been our best bowler, who has always led the bowling attack, whatever the conditions may be, whether it is a flat track or a seaming track. It is a blow but at the same time we have to see the larger picture. We have to think about the World Cup also Any injury t your best eleven players may have a bigger impact so thats also a bit of a concern. Till we are 100 per cent sure about his fitness and injury, we wont risk playing him.         
	On who might replace Zaheer         
	Well exactly have to see. Whoever plays will be making his debut, whether it is (Jaydev) Unadkat or (Umesh) Yadav. We will have to discuss and see what the best combination will be. We will discuss with some other senior players, and accordingly pick the best possible XI.         
	Harbhajan Singh         
	Harbhajan has played in all the formats in these conditions. I don think it will be a big concern because he knows the conditions very well. He is one bowler who adapts to the conditions well.         
	Virender Sehwags impact         
	He doesnt take the pressure Thats the best part. You can have only one Sehwag. Thats the beauty of his game. Whatever comes his way he will play according to the merit of the delivery. Thats what his strength is. We hope that along with Gautam (Gambhir), he will give us a good start, which we always cherish.         
	Whether there is a selection dilemma regarding Suresh Raina and Cheteshwar Pujara         
	It gets really tough because you have Rain who has been doing a good job in the middle order Then you have Pujara who, too, is doing well. Unless something happens to the openers, someone like (Murali) Vijay cannot make it to the team.                     
	If the keepers job is difficult on bouncy SA tracks         
	The last time I came here I got injured because of the wobbling ball, and had to miss one of the Test matches. Of course it is a bit of a concern and it is more about the bowlers we have got. Its Sreesanth and Zaheer who trouble the keepers the most. At the same time, you try to do what you can, practise well Injuries are part and parcel when it comes to the wicketkeeper.         
	On whether the presence of Gary Kirsten would help         
	He knows the conditions really well. He has played most of his cricket here. At the same time, he knows the mindset of the South African cricketers really well His views will be really important for us. I have always said that he is one of the greatest things to have happened to Indian cricket apart from the talented cricketers we have got. Throughout he has always been away from the media and just concentrates on the work he needs to do. We have had a great time under him. It is an advantage to have him in the side.         
	Garys future with the Indian team         
	What you need to see is that he has been part of the Indian team for the last three years. He has a young family, which means Gary wants to spend time with his family. That will be the most crucial thing apart from the money aspect. He has given whatever he could, the best he could, and of course it was a pleasure to have him in the side But then again, it is a decision he will have to take. More than the cricketing part, it will be his family that will have a real impact on the decision. As I always say, it will be a pleasure to have him for another three years.         
	If there is any pressure being the No. 1 side         
	We always play under pressure whether we play in India or abroad. It always goes hand in hand with the Indian team. Doesnt matter whether we are playing Bangladesh or Zimbabwe or any other side We are always under pressure because the expectation levels are really high. Rather than thinking about expectations, we will take it one session at time. Accordingly, the long-term goals will be achieved if we achieve the short-term goals.         
	On the preparations         
	What is important is how we are utilising the time we have got. So we are quite satisfied with the effort that the guys have put in. Especially, the guys who have come in early. We are quite happy with our preparations. If we had a bit more time, it would have been better, but we all knew the schedule and we tried to make the best of whatever we had.         
	Plans to tackle Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel         
	When you come to South Africa, and you think about their bowling attack, first of all you think about Steyn and Morkel. But there are others also in the side who can really have a big impact on the game. You think about Kallis, who is a genuine all-rounder, because of whom they can play with five bowlers. I think, more than just concentrating on two bowlers, it is important to think about the whole attack. Of course those will be the two key bowlers who will start with the new ball and its important to see off the new ball in these conditions.         
	The challenge of South African conditions         
	It will be interesting because we are touring quite a few nations. The conditions will be different. Some of the places will be good for seam attack while some will have bounce. So I think it is a good opportunity for some of us to prove ourselves and go to the next level as a team. It is a challenge for us, more than taking it as pressure or thinking about the adverse conditions. Cricket is all about playing under different conditions, at different venues. It is an interesting year ahead of us.         
	Importance of the toss         
	It will be crucial because yesterday (Tuesday) we had a look at the wicket from a distance and it looked quite damp, which means without the sun it will stay a bit damp. Fast bowlers will get something out of it initially If you win the toss, 60 per cent of the game goes in your favour, if not more. After that you have to bowl well on that kind of wicket.         
	The wicket         
	Frankly speaking when we saw the pitch Tuesday it had a green tinge but I dont think there was enough grass on the wicket. It is a normal Centurion wicket, which means it will assist the fast bowlers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Topalov on level terms
                                                                                                                       7                                      Topalov on level terms
                            Veselin Topalov      
	Sofia: Challenger Veselin Topalov Tuesday went for the kill in the eighth game of his world championship match against Viswanathan Anand and had one full point to show for his aggressive play, getting the better of his opponent in 56 moves in a Slav Defence to tie the 12-game rubber at four-all.         
	Topalov, playing with white pieces, showed he was still working on the opening and, although that has hardly borne much fruit, the Bulgarian found his patience being rewarded just when he needed a shot in the arm in his battle against the world champion. If Anand gave a good account of himself in choosing quiet lines, Topalov was smarter, looking for sharp variations that could have gone either way.         
	Anand was the first to deviate from the Slav of the earlier games. On move 13, the world champion found a rook move, obviously from his home preparation, that basically aimed at offsetting any possible behind the scenes work Topalov had put in to improve his opening after Game 5.         
	Anand did the basics right when he went for a Queen-less game quite early, thereby protecting himself against Topalovs aggression.         
	However, Anand ran into Topalovs preparations on move 18. The Bulgarian pushed his Queen-rook pawn to invite a sharp line in the opening itself. Anand thought for 15 minutes before he could come up with a reply.         
	Topalov opened up the position and trained his guns on Anands king. Whites rooks occupied the central files and looked threatening as the black king was taken out of its castle.         
	Although Anand kept the bishop pair against the bishop and knight with a rook each, the world champions position was far from satisfactory. (AGENCIES)

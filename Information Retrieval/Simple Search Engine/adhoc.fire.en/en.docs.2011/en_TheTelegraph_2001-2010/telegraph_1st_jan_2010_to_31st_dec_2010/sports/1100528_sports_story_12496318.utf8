The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil want extra space
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brazil want extra space
                  Dunga                     
	Johannesburg: Brazil arrived at the World Cup on Thursday saying they will be less friendly to fans and the media as it was four years ago.         
	The players and coaches hope to avoid the euphoria they blame for their elimination in the quarter finals at Germany 2006.         
	Brazil moved into their training camp with the usual expectations that accompany the five-time world champions, but coach Dunga quickly made it clear that the team will try to keep as much distance as possible from the hype surrounding them.         
	From the first day we said the priority is the national team, Dunga said. Everything else comes later. We need to have a certain balance when it comes to the work of the national team.         
	The Brazilian Football Confederation said through its spokesman in the teams first news conference in South Africa that what happened in the 2006 World Cup did not work and will not happen again.         
	The teams 2006 build-up in the lakeside resort town of Weggis, Switzerland, was marked by a partying atmosphere that players and coaches said was detrimental to the team. Thousands of fans were allowed to follow nearly all of Brazils practices and the media had daily access to nearly all of the players. Brazil fell to France 1-0 in the quarterfinals.         
	The media will have access to only some players this time, and fans will not likely be able to watch the teams practices.         
	People often complain that we are being harsh, Dunga said. Sometimes you dont need to give access to everything we do.         
	Brazil have always been one of the teams which gave the most access to fans and the media, but not this time.         
	We want you to think about it and see if its really necessary to have so many TV cameras pointed to the players rooms here, confederation spokesman Rodrigo Paiva said.         
	Brazil are staying at the five-star Hotel Fairway inside a golf club in Randburg. The team will practice at a nearby school, but only the media is expected to have access to parts of trainings.         
	Brazil players underwent a physical conditioning session at the hotel on Thursday and would get to the field for the first time on Friday.         
	The players first reported to the national team in the Brazilian city of Curitiba last Friday for a series of physicals. The focus of the preparations in Brazil was to work on the players fitness.

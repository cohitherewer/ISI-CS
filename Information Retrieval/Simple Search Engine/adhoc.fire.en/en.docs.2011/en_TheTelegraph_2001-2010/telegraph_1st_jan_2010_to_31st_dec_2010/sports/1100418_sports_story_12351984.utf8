The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lacklustre EB held by BNR 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lacklustre EB held by BNR 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal were held to a goalless draw by BNR in a CFL Premier Division match at the Howrah Municipal Stadium, on Saturday.         
	This is East Bengals fifth draw in the local league, which took their points tally to 26 from 13 matches.         
	BNR on the other hand are now on 16 points from 14 games. East Bengal could have lost the match if their young goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not saved a Dhiman Sinha spot-kick.         
	Gurpreet also effected a few more saves which resulted in a maiden Man-of-the-Match award for the youngster.         
	With coach Phillippe de Ridder leaving with the squad for the AFC Cup away tie in Syria, it was a match where assistant coach Tushar Rakshit was in charge.         
	Rakshit in his desperate bid to get the elusive winner even introduced Bhaichung Bhutia and Syed Rahim Nabi during the latter part of the match but even that falied to bring in three points for the red and gold brigade.         
	The best chance for East Bengal came in the stoppage time of the first half when Jibon Singhs shot hit the post and Poibang Poshnas header off the rebound also hit the horizontal.

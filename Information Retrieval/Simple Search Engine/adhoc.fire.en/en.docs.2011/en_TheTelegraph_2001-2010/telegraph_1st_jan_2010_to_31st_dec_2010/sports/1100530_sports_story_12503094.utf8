The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal shows Hewitt the door
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nadal shows Hewitt the door
                      
	Paris: Rafael Nadal broke down some typically stiff resistance from Australian Lleyton Hewitt to record a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory in their third-round clash on a chilly afternoon at Roland Garros on Saturday.         
	Hewitt, who must be sick of the sight of the Mallorcan here after now losing to him in four of the last five years, rocked the Spaniard by breaking in the opening game, but Nadal hit back immediately and gradually cranked up the pressure.         
	Hewitt stood toe-to-toe with Nadal in some spellbinding baseline rallies, at one point prompting a forehand winner from the Spaniard which saw him roll over on his back on the red Parisian clay after executing the shot.         
	The Australian battled as tenaciously as ever, breaking Nadal thrice to keep the interest levels up for a crowd huddling from a chill wind, but he generally lacked the firepower to extend Nadal.         
	The end came after two hours and 28 minutes when Hewitt pelted a backhand long.         
	Hes an unbelievable player, a great champion, a former No.1. When I was young. I always watched Lleyton on TV, he was one of my idols and to play him is a pleasure, Nadal said in a courtside interview.         
	Nadal, a four-time champion, next plays Brazilian 24th seed Thomasz Bellucci on Monday for a place in the quarter finals.         
	Also on Saturday, world No.3 Novak Djokovic survived a second-set lapse before beating Romanias Victor Hanescu 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to book his place in the fourth round.         
	In a seesaw performance, the Serbian pumped his fists and smashed his racket onto the ground as he struggled to break Hanescus resilience on Centre Court.He came back from a break down, however, in the fourth set to win six games in a row, wrapping up the win when the 31st-seeded Hanescu misfired a service return after two hours and 38 minutes.         
	Next in line for Djokovic is American Robby Ginepri.         
	Djokovic, twice semi-finalist at Roland Garros, believes he will be physically fit for the challenge after skipping the Madrid Masters earlier this month.         
	This year I have not done that great on the clay courts because of some other reasons, the Serbian, who has been struggling with allergies, told reporters.         
	I did not do as well as I did in 2009, but the good thing about taking a break is that Im fresh and ready here in Paris.         
	I do feel it on the court and hopefully I can feel it next week.         
	Although Djokovic seems to be coping with his health problems well, a sickly Serena Williams suffered a dizzy second set during her third-round match on Saturday, but recovered her senses in time to beat Russias Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-1, 1-6, 6-2.         
	The American world No.1 needed a check-up from a doctor after dropping five consecutive games to her 18-year-old opponent in the second set and admitted afterwards that she was not feeling well during a scrappy match. I just got a little dizzy. I dont know. I got really fatigued. I felt really dizzy out there. I was just trying just to stay in there, the 28-year-old told reporters. Just fighting a cold and fighting sickness.         
	(The doctor) said that theres a bug thats going out. Players start feeling tired and the next day they get sick. Im going to load up. Ive been loading up on vitamins. I should be okay. I hope.         
	Ninth seed David Ferrer fell to a surprise 6-4, 6-0, 7-6 defeat by Austrias Jurgen Melzer in the third round. The Spaniard, a finalist in Rome earlier in the claycourt season, never got to grips with the Austrians pace from the back of the court and was two sets down in barely an hour.         
	Melzer, seeded 22, reached the fourth round for the first time in eight attempts when Ferrer crunched a forehand into the net to lose the third set tiebreak 7-1 after an hour and 56 minutes.         
	Melzer now faces Russian qualifier Teimuraz Gabashvili, conqueror of Andy Roddick earlier on Saturday, for a place in the quarter finals.         
	Seventh-seeded Fernando Verdasco of Spain has struggled to reach the fourth round by beating Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (1), 6-4.         
	The left-handed Spaniard committed 61 unforced errors but managed to break the 30th-seeded Kohlschreiber nine times on Saturday to match his best result at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament after a marathon that lasted more than four hours.         
	Verdasco, who won in Barcelona and reached the final in Monte Carlo and Nice on clay this season, next plays countryman Nicolas Almagro.         
	Local hope Aravane Rezais dreams of a French Open crown were dashed in 15 minutes on Saturday as Russian Nadia Petrova emerged a 6-7 6-4 10-8 winner of a sudden death shoot-out in the third round.         
	The 15th-seeded Rezai, who beat Justine Henin, Jelena Jankovic and Venus Williams en route to the Madrid Open title earlier this month, cracked first on a chilly Parisian morning after play re-started at 7-7 in the decider.         
	Rezai had saved three match points against the 19th seeded Petrova late on Friday before play was interrupted by dusk. After the first three games went against serve, Petrova finally held to prevail on the days first match point to set up a fourth-round clash with world No. 2 Venus Williams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB set to retain Laxmi as captain
                                                                                                                       7                                        CAB set to retain Laxmi as captain
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shukla                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is all set to persist with Laxmi Ratan Shukla as the Bengal captain for the upcoming domestic season. For the 29-year-old all-rounder, this will be his fourth season at the helm having first been named captain for the 2007-08 season.         
	In the last ten years, save Rohan Gavaskar, who captained Bengal for four consecutive seasons, no other player has led the senior state side for such a long duration.         
	Although there is still some time for the official announcement, the CAB brass is almost certain that there is no replacement for Shukla at the moment.         
	Is there anyone who can replace Laxmi at the moment? The fact is that we dont have his replacement. Wriddhiman Saha may have been the vice-captain of the India A side but he is still some distance away from leading the state squad, a member of the selection committee told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Manoj Tiwary should concentrate on his batting. This season will be a make or break for him. Ranadeb Bose has been a superb performer, but his performance can get affected if he is made the captain. With a depleted bowling attack, we cant afford to put additional pressure on Ranadeb. Also, he looked stressed while leading East Bengal in local cricket. So, it boils down to only one choice that we have. That is Shukla. One cant deny that he is the most experienced Bengal player around, the source further added.         
	Though Bengal havent been able to make it to last four of the Ranji Trophy under Shukla, they have achieved the distinction of playing in the Vijay Hazare Trophy (national one-dayers) final for three consecutive years.         
	Shukla, who has played 97 first-class matches, is just 33 runs short completing 4000 runs in first-class cricket. He also has 113 first-class wickets to his name.         
	Meanwhile, all-rounder Sanjib Sanyal, who has represented Railways in the Ranji Trophy for the past six seasons, may be again available for selection for Bengal if he gets a NoC from his employers.         
	Sanyal is unlikely to play for Railways this year. I havent yet decided whether I will skip this first-class season or not. If I decide to apply for NoCit will help me continue playing first-class cricket staying at home, Sanyal stated.

	Birmingham: Sania Mirza could not progress beyond the second round in her first tournament since marriage and went down to Thailands Tamarine Tanasugarn in the WTA tennis tournament here on Thursday. Playing in her first tournament since February, Sania went down 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 to her Thai opponent in a match spread over two days.         
	Playing her first tournament since her much-publicised marriage to Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik, Sania did manage to win the first set against the 14th seed before rain drove her to the locker room on Wednesday.         
	The break seemed to have done a world of good for Tanasugarn who edged out Sania in the second set to force the decider and dropped just one game in the final set before walking away with a hard-earned win.         
	Sania wrote on her Twitter page yesterday that she was happy to be back in the court again. (I) Had not imagined Id be playing after marriage in the first place and here I am at yet another tourney! Hope this answers everyones concerns, she wrote.         
	Settled in Dubai post-marriage, Sania also made it clear that she had no clear cut plans to retire. Will take life as it comes, she wrote.         
	In Halle, Indias Rohan Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi bowed out of the Gerry Weber Open following a straight set defeat against Marx Philipp and Igor Zelenay. The Indo-Pakistani pair lost 2-6, 6-7(3) to the German-Slovakian combination in the first round of the euro 750,000 ATP 250 event. With this defeat, Bopannas challenge ended in the tournament as he has already exited from the singles event. Bopanna had qualified for the singles main draw but could not progress beyond the first round as he lost 4-6, 6-7(11) to Thiemo De Bakker of the Netherlands.

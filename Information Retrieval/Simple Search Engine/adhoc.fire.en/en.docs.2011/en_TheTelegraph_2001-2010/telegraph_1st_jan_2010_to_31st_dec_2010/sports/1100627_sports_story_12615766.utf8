                                                                                                                       7                                      Lords gears up for first Twenty20
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly will lead the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) XI for the T20 match against Pakistan, at Lords, on Sunday.         
	It will be the first T20 staged by the MCC at Lords, inarguably the home of cricket.         
	The occasion will also mark Brian Laras return to competitive cricket after quite sometime.         
	Also confirmed is former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Harris whose tight bowling brought him much success in limited-overs cricket. Harris stands second on the all-time New Zealand wicket takers list in one-day Internationals.         
	Two Afghan players have also been included  Hamid Hassan and Mohammed Nabi. Hassan became the first Afghan to play at Lords in 2007, when he represented the Club against a Europe XI.         
	Meanwhile, the MCC players practised at Lords on Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hope Brendon will play: Vettori
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hope Brendon will play: Vettori
                      
	Vadodara: Faced with a do-or-die situation to stay afloat in the five-match series, New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori Friday said his injury-hit side was hoping that dashing batsman Brendon McCullum will be available on Saturday to bolster the batting line-up in the third ODI against India here.         
	New Zealand had been lacking the spark in their batting in the absence of McCullum and Vettori said he was hoping that the aggressive opener, who took part in the net sessions on Friday, is available on Saturday.         
	I think he seems to have come through his training pretty well. He is improving all the time. He is doing some keeping now. We are really hoping he can play tomorrow, said Vettori at the pre-match media conference here.         
	We would like to see how Brendon gets through the wicketkeeping (stint) and then take a decision (on the team composition).         
	Vettori indicated how much the team was missing McCullum and the balance he brings to the playing eleven, when asked if he can be played as a pure batsman without being burdened by wicket-keeping job.         
	He said the team desperately wanted to win the game and stay alive in the five-match series. (PTI)

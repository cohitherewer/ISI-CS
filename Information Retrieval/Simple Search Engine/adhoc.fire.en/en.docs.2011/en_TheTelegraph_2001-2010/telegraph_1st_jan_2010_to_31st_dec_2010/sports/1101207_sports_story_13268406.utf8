The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag are wary of Salgaocar 
                            Chirag are wary of Salgaocar 
                      
	Margao: Ekene Ikenwas return from East Bengal will boost Salgaocars attack when they take on Chirag United in the second round of the I-League to be played at Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	Salgaocar started their I-league campaign on an impressive note when they beat Viva Kerala 3-0. They will be looking to repeat the same Tuesday and this time they also have the home advantage.         
	The return of Ikenwa, who was responsible for pulling Salgaocar out from the relegation to finish sixth, will strengthen their attack. He, along with Yusif Yakubu will form a formidable attack.         
	Salgaocar, who have strengthened their side by recruiting midfielder Ryuji Sueoka, has scored a brace against Viva Kerala. They have also strengthened their defence, which looked vulnerable last year, by recruiting Chinta Chandreshekar, Khelemba Singh Syed Faria and Jaspal Singh.         
	Salgaocars coach Karim Bencherifa is happy with the composition of his team. He said, Our boys played well in the opening match, which we won 3-0 against Viva Kerala. Now they need to remain more consistent.         
	Chirag United will be looking to their key player Joshimar Martins to score goals and will be assisted by Nigerian Junior Elijah. Talented Denson Devadas will stir the midfield.         
	Meanwhile, Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya said, Salgaocar are a better side than last year with good foreigners. Its going to be a close contest and we have to remain extra cautious as they have the home advantage, Bhattacharya said.         
	In another match, JCT will take on Churchill Brothers on Tuesday.         
	JCT suffered a shock defeat against debutants Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) in their opening fixture, and they would look to make amends against Churchill.           (PTI)

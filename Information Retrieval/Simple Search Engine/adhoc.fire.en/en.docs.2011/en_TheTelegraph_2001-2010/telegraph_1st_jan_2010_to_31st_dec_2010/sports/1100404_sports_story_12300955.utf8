The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its in the tough times that you know who your friends are...
                                                                                                                       7                                        Its in the tough times that you know who your friends are...
    - Yuvraj Singh touched by India teammate Gautam Gambhirs support             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh in the city, on Saturday                                 
	Calcutta: Touched by India teammate Gautam Gambhirs somewhat emotional support in a signed column, Yuvraj Singh has said that, one day, he hoped to return the favour.         
	Its in the tough times that you get to know who your true friends are... Ive known Gautam for a number of years and what he wrote today made me feel good... Those whove seen me over the years know the kind of person I am... Theyre the only ones who really understand me...         
	Hopefully, one day, Ill be able to do something similar  for Gautams benefit, Yuvraj told The Telegraph, late on Saturday, shortly after arriving in the city for the Kings XI Punjab-Kolkata Knight Riders clash.         
	Im aware that I havent done well in this seasons Indian Premier League (IPL)... Id like to say sorry to the fans, but Id also like to point out that its difficult to judge form in T20, Yuvraj added.         
	Gambhir, clearly, belongs to a special breed.         
	The 28-year-old is neither driven by rankings nor obsessed with awards. And, if it comes to defending a fellow-cricketer, his columns there to make a point.         
	In his latest, Gambhir, the Delhi DareDevils captain, called for an end to the assault on Yuvraj by sections of the media and the janata.         
	Yuvraj is an exceptional cricketer... Hes always been the way he is, in form or out of it. Hes had the same lifestyle, the same carefree attitude to life in general. So, why kick the guy when hes down? Yes, hes going through a lean patch, but that doesnt make him any less a player, Gambhir wrote, among other things.         
	Asked what made him publicly support a senior colleague (very few care to do so on record), Gambhir said, talking exclusively: Because Yuvraj is exceptional... Ive meant every word of what Ive written...         
	The other day, the IPL reprimanded Gambhir for speaking his mind on the Rajasthan Royals. No kudos, though, have come his way for standing up for Yuvraj.         
	Coming off an injury, rather a series of injuries, Yuvraj has been averaging no more than 17.12 for the Kings XI. To suggest that he has deliberately underperformed in IPL III isnt different from accusing him of, say, batting for the bookies.         
	Nothing could be more preposterous.         
	Yuvraj, incidentally, earned his maiden India cap just months after the match-fixing scandal broke, in the summer of 2000, and belongs to a generation which helped India quickly overcome the shock which followed Cronjegate.         
	Nobody likes to lose the captaincy, whatever be the level, and it wouldnt exactly be normal behaviour for Yuvraj to be on Cloud Nine once the top job got taken away by the owners.         
	Disappointment is one thing, damaging the franchise quite another. You may bet on Yuvraj hitting six sixes in an over (a feat he has achieved), but it wouldnt be wise to lay a wager on the 28-year-old trying to hurt his team.         
	Andrew Symonds would be an extreme example, but Yuvraj is somewhat like Andrew Flintoff  he needs space to operate and isnt the strictly conventional sort.         
	As Gambhir put it so strongly, allow Yuvraj to get his game back on track. With the World T20 mere weeks away, India cant afford to have a genuine match-winner in a state of distress.         
	Indeed, let Yuvraj be.         
	Footnote: Yuvraj, by the way, conveyed his good wishes to one-time mentor Sourav Ganguly, the Knights captain. My good wishes are with him... Id like him to do well in the IPL, but not against us!

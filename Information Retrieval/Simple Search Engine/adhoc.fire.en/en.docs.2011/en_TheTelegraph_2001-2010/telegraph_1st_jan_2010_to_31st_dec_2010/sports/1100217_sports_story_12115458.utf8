The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injuries worry Arsenal
                                                                                                                       7                                        Injuries worry Arsenal
            THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES            Arsenal players limber up during a practice session in London Colney, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Arsenal have travelled to Portugal for their Champions League clash with Porto without a number of key players.         
	First-team regulars William Gallas, Alexandre Song, Andrey Arshavin, Manuel Almunia and Eduardo. were all absent from the 18-man squad which left on Tuesday.         
	Eduardo has not played since the 0-0 Premier League draw against Aston Villa on January 27 because of a hamstring injury, while Arshavin picked up a similar problem against Liverpool last week.         
	Song was unable to shake off a knee problem that saw him limp out of a training session yesterday.         
	Sol Campbell could be set for a first European appearance for Arsenal since the Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in Paris in 2006, while Carlos Vela returns from a knee injury.         
	Denilson could be recalled for Song, although Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, is likely to give greater responsibility to Abou Diaby         
	Wenger has more options when it comes to replacing Arshavin and Eduardo with Tomas Rosicky and Theo Walcott fit again while Samir Nasri has recovered from the concussion he sustained against Liverpool.         
	We know that when you go to Porto you need a solid defensive performance, Wenger said. I was reassured with our defence [last] Wednesday  that was maybe the biggest part of our game against Liverpool. We looked solid defensively for the first time in the last three big games, and that is vital before you go out for a Champions League game.         
	I believe in the first leg our defensive performance will be important because against Manchester United and Chelsea we were 2-0 down after 20 minutes and that is massive in games. So lets keep our defensive discipline we had against Liverpool and I am sure we can score when we play.         
	Porto is a tough draw. They dont look like a prestigious team, but every year they are in there and they can surprise people. They have been playing very well recently.         
	Meanwhile, Bayern Munich have won their past 12 games, yet coach Louis van Gaal and some of his players are not entirely happy going into the round-of-16 match against struggling Fiorentina.         
	Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 3-1 at the weekend to be only one goal behind Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga standings but the team was left badly exposed several times in the match.         
	We need a bit more order in our game, Van Gaal said ahead of Wednesdays first leg. We dont want to play defensively, but we cant afford the kind of mistakes we made in the last match.

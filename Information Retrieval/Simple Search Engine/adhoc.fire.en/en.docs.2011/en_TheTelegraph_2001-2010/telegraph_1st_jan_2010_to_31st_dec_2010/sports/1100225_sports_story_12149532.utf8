                                                                                                                       7                                      Anjum anchors the Indian win
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India beat England by seven wickets in the third one-day International and now lead 2-1 in the five-match series.         
	India won the toss and elected to put England in on a wicket that had far more bounce than the teams had experienced during the previous games in Bangalore.         
	For India, Dhar picked up four for 19 while Jhulan Goswami, Preeti Dimri and Gouher Sultana scalped two wickets each.         
	Indian opening batters Poonam Raut and Anjum Chopra looked in fine form and raced to 97 before Gunn picked up the wicket of Raut, followed two balls later by Roy. It was too little too late. Anjum top scored with an unbeaten 61.

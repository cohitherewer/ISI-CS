	New Delhi: Hockey coach Harendra Singh, on Tuesday, submitted his resignation after India lost to Malaysia in the Asian Games semi-finals in Guangzhou.         
	Taking full responsibility for the defeat, Harendra, in a letter to Hockey India (HI) secretary general Narendra Batra said: Keeping in view the dismal performance, I hereby tender my resignation as the national coach of the mens hockey team with immediate effect.         
	I accept the moral responsibility for the debacle at th 16the Asian Games, Harendra added.         
	His resignation, if accepted, is going to create a void in the national team. Chief coach Jose Brasa of Spain is expected to be shown the door once his contract ends at the end of this month.

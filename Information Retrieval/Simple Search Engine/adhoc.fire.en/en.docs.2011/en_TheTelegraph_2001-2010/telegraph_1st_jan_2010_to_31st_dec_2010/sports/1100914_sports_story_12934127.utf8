	Calcutta: The Indian archery team, comprising of Jayanta Talukdar, Dola Banerjee and Deepika Kumari hope to hit the bulls eye in the Archery World Cup Grand final in Edinburgh to be held on September 18 and 19.         
	Talukdar, who clinched a bronze in the recently concluded World Cup, in Sanghai, said: I hope we would be able to live up to the expectations in this tournament as well. Talukdar will face the challenge of Michelle Farngilli of Italy in the first round.         
	Dola, who is currently placed 10th in the world rankings, said: I had planned for some rigorous practice sessions with the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games in mind. But the wildcard in the World Cup has forced me to change my plans.... However, the Edinburgh meet will help sharpen our skills.         
	Dola will face Mospinek Justyna of Poland in the opening round. The 17-year-old Deepika echoed Dola as she said: I want to gain as much confidence as possible from the World Championships. A decent performance there will help my confidence before the Commonwealth Games and the upcoming Asian Games.         
	Deepikas first round opponent will be Ukraines Victoriya Koval. The trio will leave for the United Kingdom on Tuesday along with coach Purnima Mahato.

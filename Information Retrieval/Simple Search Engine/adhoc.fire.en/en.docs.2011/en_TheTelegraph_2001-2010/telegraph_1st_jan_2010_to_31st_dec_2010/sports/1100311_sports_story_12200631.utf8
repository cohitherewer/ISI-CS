	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkars autographed ticket to watch IPL action on the big screens of theatres across the country was auctioned and fetched Rs 11 lakh here Wednesday.         
	The proceeds of the auction, which began at a base price of Rs 5 lakh, would go to Tendulkar-supported charitable organization Apnalaya, it was announced.         
	Unveiling the first ticket for the matches to be seen in theatres, the maestro talked about his support for Apnalaya.         
	I have been supporting this charitable organisation for a long time now. I am trying to help it by raising money, and creating a platform for the underprivileged kids to express their talent, Tendulkar said.         
	He also announced he would be donating his bat, which he has used in international matches this season, for charity. The bat would be displayed in all the theatres screening IPL matches before it goes under the hammer. The proceeds would again go to Apnalaya.         
	Tendulkar, who would be leading the Mumbai Indians in the March 12-April 25 event, said his team were preparing hard. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai prevail in a tense finish 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mumbai prevail in a tense finish 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai made heavy weather of chasing a modest target before clinching a nail-biting two-wicket win over Railways here on Saturday.         
	Chasing 252, Ajinkya Rahane scored an aggressive 94 to put Mumbai in control. But the right-handers fall after tea triggered a batting collapse.         
	Trying to find the proverbial final lap kick, Mumbai lost wickets in a flurry and slumped from 204/2 to 237/8 before Rohit Sharma (31 not out) bailed them out with some sensible batting.         
	Railways did well to bring it this close after Sahil Kukreja (54) and Rahane laid the foundation for a comfortable Mumbai win with a 97-run partnership.         
	In fact, the visitors might have ended on the right side of the result had Sanjay Bangar held on to an edge from Sharma at slip when the batsman was on 14.         
	Captain Murali Kartik (3-69) and veteran JP Yadav (3-54) bowled uninterrupted throughout the final session to lead the Railways fightback, but it proved to be too little too late.         
	The hosts needed 36 with seven wickets in hand at the start of mandatory overs, when skipper Wasim Jaffer, trying to break the shackles, played a reverse sweep against Kartik and was caught by Bangar at slip.         
	And suddenly losing four wickets for 21 runs at 237, Mumbai were struggling to salvage three points from the first innings lead.         
	But Kartik, bowling to a 7-2 leg side field, made a rare error in his line and Sharma squeezed out five runs of his over to ease the pressure. The right-handed batsman then did well to curb his natural attacking instincts while still retaining the positive attitude to steer his team home.

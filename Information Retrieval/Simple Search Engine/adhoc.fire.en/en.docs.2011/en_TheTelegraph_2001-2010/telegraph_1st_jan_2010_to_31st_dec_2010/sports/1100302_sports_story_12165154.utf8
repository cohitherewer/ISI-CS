	Lahore: Pakistan players Kamran Akmal and Shahid Afridi are likely to face disciplinary action on the recommendations of the five-member inquiry committee that was formed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to look into the teams poor performances in Australia.         
	Sources in the Board said that the committee, which met on Saturday, had completed its proceedings and the legal advisor of the PCB, Tafazzul Rizvi, had been given the task of preparing the final report and recommendations of the committee.         
	The committee will meet again on Tuesday where they will discuss and approve the report prepared by the legal advisor after which the chief operating officer, Wasim Bari, who heads the committee, will submit it to the PCB chairman, Ijaz Butt, one source said.         
	He said that at Saturdays meeting, Rizvi and another member had made it clear that they would not be part of any eyewash and wanted the committee to prepare its report and make recommendations based on facts.         
	There will be no cover-ups by the committee and there is strong likelihood that the committee will recommend disciplinary action against Akmal and Afridi, the source said.         
	While the match-fixing allegations cloud hangs over Akmal, who was also involved in violating the players code of conduct in Australia, Afridi could be penalised for his involvement in the infamous ball-tampering incident in the fifth and final one-dayer in Perth last month.         
	A foreign radio service had earlier revealed that Akmal and his teammate Rana Naved were the two Pakistani players under investigation by the Board for their alleged involvement in match-fixing.         
	The PCB chairman had mentioned at a press conference on Friday that two Pakistani players were involved in match-fixing but then retracted his statement and made it clear he was talking about old cases.         
	Meanwhile, Butt also chaired a meeting of the new look governing council on Monday here but later talking to the media declined to give out any notable or new information.         
	Asked about the match-fixing allegations against Akmal and Rana Naved, Butt insisted he had already made the issue clear and would not comment on it further.         
	When asked about the central contracts to be given to the players, Butt said that the mode of the contracts had been finalised and approved at the governing council meeting but announcement of the players who would be given the contracts would be made later.         
	He also said that he would comment on the inquiry committee report when he gets it.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy for Spain
                                                                                                                       7                                        Easy for Spain
                  Fernando Llorente scored a brace                     
	London: The cream began to rise to the top of the Euro 2012 qualifying groups with world and European champions Spain, Germany, Netherlands and Portugal, all winning their matches in style, on Friday.         
	Spain saw off Lithuania 3-1 in Salamanca to take their tally to six points from two games and move to the top of Group I with all three goals coming from headers  two by Fernando Llorente and one from David Silva.         
	Germany stayed top of Group A, with a 3-0 win over Turkey in Berlin. Miroslav Klose scored twice to take his tally for Germany to 57 goals.         
	The Dutch won 1-0 in Moldova to take over first place in Group E with a Klaas-Jan Huntelaar strike.         
	Portugal beat Denmark 3-1 in Porto with Nani scoring twice in two minutes and Cristiano Ronaldo adding the third to jump from fourth to second in Group H behind surprise leaders Norway.         
	Former world champions Italy bucked the trend by being held to a 0-0 draw by Northern Ireland in Belfast but remained top of Group C with second-placed Serbia slumping to an unexpected 3-1 defeat at home to unfancied Estonia.         
	Montenegro, who have only been playing as an independent nation for three years and have a tiny pool from which to chose their team, maintained their unexpectedly excellent start when they beat Switzerland 1-0 to preserve a 100 per cent record.         
	Mirko Vucinic scored the winner after 68 minutes against the Swiss, when he chipped the ball home from a narrow angle and then celebrated in bizarre style by taking his shorts off and putting them on his head, earning a yellow card.         
	There were few surprises on the night but there were upsets for Slovakia, who lost 3-1 away to Armenia in Group B, and Serbia, who were beaten 3-1 at home by Estonia in Group C.         
	Former world champions Italy dropped their first points when they were held to a goalless draw by Northern Ireland in their Group C match in Belfast.         
	Russia held on to beat Ireland 3-2 in Dublin after the Irish hit back with two goals late in the second half of their Group B match. Hungary were the highest scorers on the night, crushing minnows San Marino 8-0 in Budapest in their Group E game.

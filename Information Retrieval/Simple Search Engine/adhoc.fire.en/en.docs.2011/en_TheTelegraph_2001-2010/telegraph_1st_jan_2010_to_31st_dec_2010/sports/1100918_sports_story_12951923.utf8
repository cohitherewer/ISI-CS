	Chennai: 2008 Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton Friday said he was looking forward to drive in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix to be held in Greater Noida on October 30 next year.         
	Its going to be incredible experience for me (driving in Indian Grand Prix). There were hardly any fans at the Turkey Grand Prix. But with the huge number of fans and support in India, I look forward to it (participating in the Indian Grand Prix), said Hamilton, who is on his third visit to India for a promotional event.         
	The ace Formula One driver, who was flown straight from the Chennai airport to the Madras Motorsport Race Track here, drove the Rs.2.4 crore Mercedes AMG on the track as part of the event.         
	Asked about his chances of winning this years World Championship title, Hamilton, who is currently second in the drivers standings, said anything could happen, as there are still five races to go. Its very challenging with strong competition, but there are still chances of winning the title with five races to go, he said.         
	Asked how he felt driving along side seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher he said, Wow! Its great. It is an honour to drive along with him.         
	Around 10 people, who won a contest conducted by Vodafone, were individually taken for a drive by Hamilton on the race track.         
	Hamilton, however, said that though he was impressed by some of the features of the track for Indian Grand Prix but would rather wait to drive there first before giving his verdict. quot;I have seen a couple of features of the track here in New Delhi but I have not used and tried that on simulator. It looks impressive, quot; the 2008 champion said. quot;You can never know what its going to be like unless you go there and actually drive there. quot;         
	Although Hamilton has yet to see the track in person, he was confident the race will put India firmly on the Formula One map.         
	 quot;I think its really special and great that India has truly embraced this world of Formula One, quot; he said. (Agencies)

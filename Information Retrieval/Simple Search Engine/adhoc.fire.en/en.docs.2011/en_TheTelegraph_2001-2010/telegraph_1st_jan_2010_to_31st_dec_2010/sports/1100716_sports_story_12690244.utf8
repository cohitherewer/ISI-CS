	Calcutta: A formidable Maharashtra started their Santosh Trophy campaign in style, thrashing Chandigarh 4-0 Thursday in a Cluster-II match in the 64th edition of the National Football Championship, at the Howrah Stadium, on Friday.         
	Former Mohun Bagan forward Surajit Bose struck twice while Reuben DSouza and Alex Ambrose scored one apiece at Howrah Stadium as the Maharashtrians put the minnows to the sword. Andhra Pradesh defeated Tripura 2-1 in another Cluster-II match at the Barasat Stadium, while Karnataka beat Meghalaya 1-0 in a Cluster-I match at the Khardah Stadium.         
	The match at Howrah Stadium saw Vijith Shetty and Co. dominate proceedings right from the word go.         
	In the 30 th minute, Jatin Singh Bisht essayed a fine assist for Paresh Shivalkar on the right who played a low centre for Reuben to tap home with the two centre-backs out of position.         
	Maharashtra failed to make inroads in the first 15 minutes after the change of ends and, at the stroke of the hour, Surajit came on for Reuben. That introduction gave the necessary thrust upfront as both Jatin and Vijith took complete control of midfield.         
	Surajit scored his first and the teams second goal when he stretched to meet a Jatin cross from the right that deflected off Nikhil Prashar before going in.         
	The third goal, in the 87th minute, was the best of the four as Ambrose barged into the box to unleash a powerful right-footer that beat custodian Raj Kumar hands down.         
	Ambrose was taken off immediately after the third goal but Surajit scored his second teams fourth in the 89th minute with a gentle push into an open net after receiving the ball courtesy another deflection off an opposition defender. It always feels nice to contribute towards a winning cause, said Surajit, who represented Bengal in 2009.         
	Teams         
	Maharashtra: Kunal Sawant, Collin Abranches, Gautam Debnath, Othello Tabia, Rauf Khan, Nishant Mehra (K. Aseem, 46), Vijith Shetty, Jatin Singh Bisht, Paresh Shivalkar, Alex Ambrose (Kaushik Bose, 86), Reuben DSouza (Surajit Bose, 60)

	Referee: C.R. Srikrishna

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger, Steve to play third match
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger, Steve to play third match
                      
	Newport: US captain Corey Pavin sprang a surprise when he omitted in-form Jim Furyk for Fridays opening fourball matches at the Ryder Cup. World No. 5 Furyk, a veteran of six previous Ryder Cups, clinched Tour Championship and FedExCup honours in Atlanta, on Sunday, and was a possible partner for Tiger Woods.         
	Pavin opted to send out world No. 1 Woods with fourth-ranked Steve Stricker in the third match of the day against Britains Ian Poulter and Ross Fisher. Its also the first time since 1999 that Woods will not be in the leadoff match.         
	Woods, who has struggled for form this year and failed to qualify automatically for the US team, and Stricker gelled superbly at the 2009 Presidents Cup, where they were unbeaten in four matches.         
	In Fridays opening game, world No. 2 Phil Mickelson and big-hitting Dustin Johnson will take on Britains Lee Westwood and Germanys Martin Kaymer in a mouth-watering encounter.         
	Sixth-ranked Kaymer, one of six rookies on the European team, clinched his first major title at last months US PGA Championship.         
	Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, a widely expected partnership, will take on Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar in the second match.         
	In the final fourball, Britains Luke Donald and Irishman Padraig Harrington take on US rookies Bubba Watson and Jeff Overton. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pawar, not Lalit Modi made the promise
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pawar, not Lalit Modi made the promise
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar gave a fresh twist to his payment row with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday, claiming that its former president Sharad Pawar had promised him extra payment for his services as an IPL governing council member.         
	Gavaskar had Tuesday hit out at the BCCI for not paying him for his role in the governing council, which was promptly refuted by the BCCI.         
	Gavaskar said he was now waiting for Pawar to meet Shashank Manohar and sort out the matter. The current BCCI president, however, said on Tuesday that he wasnt aware of any such meeting and no appointment had been sought.         
	There have been many queries from the media and cricket lovers after my interview on NDTV last night (Tuesday). It was physically impossible to reply to each individual and therefore this release, Gavaskar said in a statement.         
	I have nothing further to add at this point, except that I am now waiting for Mr Sharad Pawar, the then president of BCCI, to arrange a meeting with the current president of BCCI to help untangle and resolve this demanding matter, since it was he who made the offer for the extra payment over and above the original amount given to the former players on the governing council and on whose word I agreed to come on board the governing council, he added.         
	Gavaskar, on Tuesday, created a flutter by stating that he had not been paid for the past three years, which forced him to send a gentle reminder about the non-payment to the BCCI.         
	Gavaskar has found support from suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi, who said the former India captain had always been forthright in his dealings and never known to be a liar.         
	A lot has been said about Sunny. All I can tell you is that in all my dealings with Sunny, Ive never known him to be a liar or anything. Sunny has been forthright. Im sure theyll sort it out, Modi said in London.

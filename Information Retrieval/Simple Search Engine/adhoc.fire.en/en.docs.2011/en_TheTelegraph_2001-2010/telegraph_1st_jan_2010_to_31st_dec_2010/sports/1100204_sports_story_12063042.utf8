The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hingis to play tennis league
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hingis to play tennis league
                      
	Washington: Martina Hingis cant help but contemplate yet another comeback when she sees the success Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin are having after being away from tennis.         
	The five-time Grand Slam singles champion retired for the second time in 2007, when she was given a two-year suspension for testing positive for cocaine.         
	That ban ended September 30, and Hingis has committed to a full season of World TeamTennis (WTT), the mixed team league founded by Billie Jean King. Hingis will be picked by a team on February 11.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For now, Gary only till 2011 Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                        For now, Gary only till 2011 Cup
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                           
	Calcutta: Gary Kirsten, the Team India coach, was the last to leave the Eden dressing room on Wednesday evening.         
	On the way out, he was overheard asking for the Meteorological Centres forecast for Thursday, the final day of the two-Test series against South Africa, a country he played for with much distinction.         
	Clearly, it helps to have a pro like Kirsten, hailed as the worlds best coach by vice-captain Virender Sehwag.         
	Realising that, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has more or less completed the paperwork to formalise a one-year extension.         
	Kirstens existing contract, for two years, ends next month.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Kirsten isnt, for now, keen on an extension post the 2011 World Cup.         
	Youve got to remember that Kirsten has a young family and has been quite clear in not committing himself beyond the showpiece tournament... For anything after the next World Cup, the call wont be made now, is how one source put it.         
	Another pointed out that mental conditioning expert Paddy Uptons contract, too, would be extended by a year only. He came on board on Kirstens recommendation.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but it appears Kirsten had a discussion with the BCCI secretary, N. Srinivasan, here on Tuesday evening.

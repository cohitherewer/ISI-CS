                                                                                                                       7                                      Spain coach cautious before D-Day
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: A distinguished footballer of his time and a formidable coach, Vicente del Bosque is known as a father figure to Spanish footballers. A man of enormous tactical acumen, who had guided Real Madrid to great success, the seasoned Spanish manager is now waiting for his last shot at glory.         
	More than taking Spain to the final, Del Bosque has been credited for bringing the entire nation under one flag. Back in Spain, there are certain areas were people dont raise the Spanish flag but they, too, are now fully backing the national team.         
	Yes, I know the Spanish flags are being raised all over the country, said Del Bosque. Our team has brought everyone closer. Thats the beauty of football. Its a great game. Thankfully, Spain are also playing like champions. But nothing can be guaranteed in the final, he said.         
	The Spain coach freely admitted that Sunday would be the biggest day in his life. I have won many football matches in life, but nothing can be compared with the one that we will play against the Netherlands. I consider myself a privileged person.         
	Del Bosque said that no one could deny that Spain are the most attractive team in the World Cup. We have our own style and never did we deviate from that. Even in the tough matches against Portugal and Germany, we played the possession game with Xavi and (Andreas) Iniesta in the midfield. A Spain victory would only make the game more popular, the coach commented.         
	The Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk, on the other hand, is more aggressive despite his team being called the underdogs. What is beautiful football? the Dutch coach asked. No one likes to play ugly football. We also try to play beautiful football, sometimes we manage to achieve it to some extent, and sometimes we fail. It cannot be anyones monopoly. Our primary objective is to win. So we play as per our own strategy, said Marwijk.         
	Twice before we reached the finals (1974 and 1978) and we lost. We have no intention of doing the same. I can assure you that the boys will play good football and win, the Dutch coach said rather curtly.

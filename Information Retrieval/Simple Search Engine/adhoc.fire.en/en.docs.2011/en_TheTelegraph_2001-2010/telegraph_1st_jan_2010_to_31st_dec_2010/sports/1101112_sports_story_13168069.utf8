The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India brace for New Zealand encore 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Team India brace for New Zealand encore 
            SUDIPTO GUPTA            VVS Laxman in Hyderabad, Thursday                           
	Hyderabad: Hats off to the Black Caps  New Zealand let go an ideal opportunity to grab such headlines goofing up an easy chance to bury Team Indias pride as the No. 1 Test side, in the opener, in Ahmedabad.         
	From Friday, Daniel Vettori amp; Co. will once again try to achieve the improbable, teach the so-called masters a lesson and assert the eternal fact, yet again  in sport, the term favourites often fails to justify its dictionary definition.         
	The build-up to the India-New Zealand Test series was loud and clear in foretelling the outcome  a thumping triumph for India. But the Black Caps went audaciously close to taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	However, the dual handicap of inexperience of the conditions and having a bowler short, took the match away from them.         
	That the Indians, who are perched at the peak of the ICC team rankings, were made to sweat to save the Test, makes the prospect of a mouth-watering second Test all the more possible.         
	No matter the wealth of experience or the bonus of known conditions, the fact that Vettoris boys had the upper hand till the last day of the Ahmedabad Test will always be there at the back of Mahendra Singh Dhonis mind.         
	Having tasted blood with a whitewash versus Australia, New Zealand were nothing but a helpless sport waiting to be hunted down.         
	But the fact that counting chickens before they hatch can never lead you to a successful business was once again highlighted.         
	From talks of arrogance (skipping the limited overs matches against a meat-and-drink Black Caps squad), India are suddenly wide-eyed, trying to make sure that no further slip-ups affect their reputation ahead of a tough South Africa tour.         
	On the other hand, while an arrogant approach, from Vettori and Co., can return results as disastrous as their ODI series in Bangladesh, New Zealands controlled aggression can spell doomsday for the hosts.         
	On Indias agenda are some definite worries. Starting from Gautam Gambhirs form to the spinners unimpressive tweaks, a lot really needs to be done. Dravid did score a century in the last Test, but he never looked like the Wall, rather was more of a shabby makeshift arrangement.         
	For New Zealand, its difficult to pinpoint a particular flaw. As a young side, they need loads of improvement. But yes, their batting, comprising the dangerous Ross Taylor, the defiant Jesse Ryder and the diminutive Kane Williamson definitely looks in a better shape than their bowling which, in spite of the shivers that they sent through the Indians spine, have been ordinary at its best.         
	The Hyderabad pitch promises better assistance to the bowlers than its Ahmedabad counterpart. With some bounce sprinkled all over it, a Zaheer Khan or even a Chris Martin may literally keep the batsmen on their toes.         
	While the Indians, in all probability would not be tinkering with the playing XI, the Black Caps may bring in all-rounder James Franklin in place of the injured Hamish Bennett, who has been sent home.         
	But the mother of all expectations, which remained unfulfilled in the Ahmedabad Test, will once again provide the cricket enthusiast an extra reason to follow the match. Sachin Tendulkars half century of hundreds is on the cards and it would be a perfect gift to Hyderabad, which is hosting a Test after 22 years.         
	Diwali is gone, but we wont mind some more fireworks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rice fears for Pietersen
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rice fears for Pietersen
                      
	Nottingham: Kevin Pietersens attitude towards County cricket is threatening his international place, according to the man who helped kick-start the batsmans career in England.         
	Former South Africa all-rounder Clive Rice was a key figure in persuading the now 30-year-old Pietersen to join Nottinghamshire in 2001.         
	Pietersen quit the Midlands county in 2004 for south coast side Hampshire.         
	But in June the England star announced his intention to leave Hampshire at the end of this season for a team based nearer his London home.         
	Pietersen has not appeared in a first-class match for Hampshire since 2008 and the club refused a request from the England hierarchy to play him in a one-day match last weekend because he planned to be elsewhere next season.         
	Since becoming an England regular, Pietersens lack of County cricket has rarely been an issue. But he has now gone 21 innings in a row without a Test century after his dismissal for 22 in the second innings of the ongoing series opener against Pakistan at Nottinghamshires Trent Bridge headquarters here Saturday.         
	You cannot play on the basis that you think you can just turn up at international level, Rice said. Nothing can replace time in the middle, theres no substitute for it, he added.

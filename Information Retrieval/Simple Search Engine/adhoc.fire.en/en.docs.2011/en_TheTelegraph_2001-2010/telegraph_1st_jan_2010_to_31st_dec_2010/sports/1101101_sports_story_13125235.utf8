	Perth: Captain Kumar Sangakkara was 44 not out and Tillekeratne Dilshan added 41 on Sunday as Sri Lanka beat Australia by seven wickets in a Twenty20 match at the WACA Ground.         
	Sri Lanka scored 135 for three with 21 balls remaining after Australia had early problems and notched up 133-8 in their 20 overs.         
	Late hitting from Brad Haddin and Steve Smith saved the home side, who won the toss and batted first. They entered the match having not lost a home Twenty20 game, but was on track to post their lowest score after slumping to 44 for five after 11 overs.         
	Smith (34 off 23) and Haddin (35 off 30) combined for a 66-run stand to help lift Australia well past the 79 posted against England in Southampton in 2005 before Sri Lanka easily topped the target.         
	Captain Michael Clarke promoted himself to opener in an attempt to end a slump that had him averaging just 21.45 in T20. But the experiment failed, with a one-handed catch by Dilhara Fernando while running backward in the deep to end Clarkes innings at 16.

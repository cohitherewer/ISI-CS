The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bullish Germany ready to roll

  - Coach Loew says he wants to embarrass Aussies with their passing game
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: Germany are the kind of team that rarely disappoint at a World Cup. They are disciplined, well organised and always come up with good results, however dull their style of play.         
	So well known are the Germans for their efficiency that former England striker Gary Lineker was forced to remark: Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a round ball for 90 minutes and, at the end, the Germans win.         
	On Saturday morning, when Oliver Bierhoff, legendary Germany striker and current manager of the national team, spoke to a group of journalists here, he exuded enough confidence to suggest Linekers appraisal of the game could not have been more correct.         
	An hour later, Germany left for Durban to take on Australia in their crucial Group D match on Sunday. Despite the absence of national hero Michael Ballack and other key components, Germany, Oliver said, would live up to the expectations this time.         
	I know our captain (Philipp Lahm) said this was the best German side in the last six years. I am in full agreement with him. Our results in preparations showed how right the captain was, said Bierhoff, famous for his Euro Cup final match winner against Czech Republic.         
	The goal was also the first Golden Goal in a major international tournament. A prolific goalscorer, Bierhoff has 37 strikes for the national team.         
	Now our moment of truth has arrived. The World Cup opener between South Africa and Mexico was the start now it gets serious, he said.         
	But then, critics feel the current German team are far from the picture of solidity and efficiency they make themselves out to be. Along with claims of there being plenty of cracks in Joachim Loews team, there are also rumours of personality conflicts in the dressing room.         
	Bierhoff, however, dismissed all that talk as media speculation. We saw in our friendly against Bosnia that a lot of things worked well and how united the team was. Our advantage is that many players know each other and have played together since the youth team days, said the German manager. But there is no time to find your groove. We have to peak against the Australians.         
	Asked whether goalkeeper Manuel Neuer could be the weak link, Bierhoff said: You cant dismiss someone just because he has only five caps to his name. He may not be as experienced as Rene Adler but he shows no nerves. We are absolutely convinced of his qualities.         
	Four years ago, a young Germany side reached the semi-final riding a wave of national pride. Two years later, they reached the final of the 2008 European Championships, losing to Spain. Maintaining that forward trajectory will not be difficult, promised coach Loew.         
	We can go in with confidence, but we have respect for Australia, Loew said. All teams here are well organised and know the passing game. We want to be able to embarrass our opponents with our passing game.         
	Likely teams         
	Germany (4-3-3): 1-Manuel Neuer, 3-Arne Friedrich, 17-Per Mertesacker, 16-Philipp Lahm, 14-Holger Badstuber, 6-Sami Khedira, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 8-Mesut Ozil, 13-Thomas Mueller, 10-Lukas Podolski, 11-Miroslav Klose

	Referee: Marco Rodriguez (Mexico)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wadekar: India start favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wadekar: India start favourites
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Ajit Wadekar                           
	Nagpur: Rahul Dravids absence notwithstanding, former captain, coach and chief selector Ajit Wadekar is convinced that India start favourites for the two-Test series.         
	It wouldve been wonderful had Dravid been available, but we still start favourites... Sachin (Tendulkar), (V.V.S.) Laxman, (Virender) Sehwag, Gautam (Gambhir)... Its a very strong line-up, Wadekar told The Telegraph, on Thursday evening.         
	He added: Then, I think our bench strength, too, is good... Im absolutely confident that well comfortably win the two-Test series...         
	Wadekar may not watch the entire first Test, beginning on Saturday, but is definitely going to be at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha for the first couple of days.

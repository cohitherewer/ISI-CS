                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      IN THE CITY
                  
	Monday was the day to introspect as Mohun Bagan general secretary Anjan Mitra met coach Satyajit Chatterjee and the senior members of the team following a string of poor performances in the I-League. Bagan, for the record, suffered consecutive losses to bottom-placed Sporting Clube de Goa and Lajong FC.       
	As expected, the meeting failed to point any definite reason for the setbacks and most of the players blamed it on fatigue. The players, however, categorically said that there was no immediate need bring in a physical instructor. It is just a matter of one win which will again bring us back on track, a senior footballer said.      
	And hopefully that win will come against Railway FC in a Calcutta Football League, Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Bagan play their next I-League match against Karim Bencharifas Salgaocar on April 10.                 
	SOCCER: CFL Premier Division: Mohun Bagan vs Railway FC (Salt Lake Stadium, 3.30 p.m.)

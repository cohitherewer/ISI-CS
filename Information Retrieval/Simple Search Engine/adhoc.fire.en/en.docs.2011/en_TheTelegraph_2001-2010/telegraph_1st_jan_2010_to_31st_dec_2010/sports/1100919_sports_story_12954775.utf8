The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rio faces Torres in clash of reds
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rio faces Torres in clash of reds
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Rio Ferdinands reticence about looking back is understandable given that, of the last 100 fixtures played by Manchester United, he has figured in just 41. A succession of injuries to the 31 year-olds back, groin, and knee have proved costly for the 30 million defender.         
	Aside from the games he has missed for United, he suffered the agony of having to pull out of a World Cup and received confirmation that his chequered fitness record was a decisive factor in Sir Alex Ferguson overlooking him for the Old Trafford captaincy in favour of Nemanja Vidic.         
	With his 32nd birthday just two months away and Ferguson talking enthusiastically of the progress of 12 million acquisition Chris Smalling, Ferdinand, who ended his three-month knee injury lay-off against Rangers in midweek, is under pressure like never before at United.         
	So despite his reluctance to assess his 18 months from hell, the question remains valid. Is he finally over the injuries?         
	Ive been over this 100 times. Ferdinand said. Hopefully, as Ive said, I will now have a sustained period of being injury free. I will be going into the Liverpool game with no apprehension, but Ive been over this 20 times or so. Im sure it will be in the archives.         
	Last seasons archive points to the 2-0 defeat at Anfield on Oct 25, when Ferdinand, compromised by a long-term back problem, was destroyed by Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.         
	That game proved the final straw, with Ferguson withdrawing Ferdinand from the firing line in order to restore his fitness. The player was sidelined for three months, then came a four-match ban for hitting Hulls Craig Fagan, a niggling groin injury and, finally, the knee injury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haile calls it quits
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haile calls it quits
                      
	New York: World-record holder Haile Gebrselassie announced his retirement after dropping out of the New York City Marathon on a day that featured the rise of a new Ethiopian star. Countryman Gebre Gebremariam won the mens title on his marathon debut. Kenyas Edna Kiplagat was another surprise winner in the womens race.         
	Gebrselassie pulled out on the 16th mile in 1:19:40 with a right knee injury. I never think about to retire. But for the first time, this is the day, he said.         
	Gebrselassie had an MRI on Saturday that showed fluid and tendinitis in his knee. He said he had trained hard for the race and did not want to complain anymore.         
	In 2008, Gebrselassie set the world record in 2:03:59 in Berlin. Widely considered the greatest distance runner ever, he has won two Olympics golds and captured eight world titles in events ranging from the 1,500 meters right up to the marathon.         
	Trying to complete the 26.2 miles was rescued Chilean miner Edison Pena, who jogged the tunnels while trapped underground.         
	The 26-year-old Gebremariam became the first man to win New York in his marathon debut since Rod Dixon in 1983.         
	Another Kenyan, Moses Kigen Kipkosgei, was third. (Agencies)

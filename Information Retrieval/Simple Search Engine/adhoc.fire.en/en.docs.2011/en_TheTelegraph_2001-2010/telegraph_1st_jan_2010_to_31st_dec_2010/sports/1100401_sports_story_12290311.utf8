	Calcutta: Dav Whatmore knows that the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), are in a tight position and need to deliver.         
	The coach, at the match eve press conference on Thursday, said: We had gained some momentum with the victory in Mohali. However, it was a step backwards for us when we lost to the DareDevils in the last match. That makes this match even more important as we are looking to become a team that wins. We want to be as positive as we can.         
	However, he didnt agree that captain Sourav Ganguly hasnt contributed handsomely at the top of the order. You cannot tell that he didnt get runs Only a couple of matches ago he got a 50. Certainly we are keen to have a good start, he said.         
	On the teams not so impressive record while chasing, Dav said: Chasing is tricky but we have won a game chasing.         
	Optimistic about KKRs chances, Dav said: We need to win another five of the remaining matches to be in a comfortable position.         
	Australian allrounder David Hussey said he was aware that most of the Australians in the IPL are doing well. I know that the Australians are performing well in the IPL. Its up to me to deliver.         
	Expressing happiness over his selection for the Australian T20 World Cup squad, David said: Of course, Im happy to be selected But I want to focus on the Chargers match. I believe we have the team to do well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have the team to triumph: Hussey
                                                                                                                       7                                      Have the team to triumph: Hussey
                      
	St Lucia: Australia may be unseeded for the World Twenty20, but they have the squad to win the title, according to David Hussey.         
	Hussey said the team were stung by their first-round exit in the 2009 World T20 in England. I think last year was a failure, Hussey told an Australian daily. We didnt even make the Super Eights.         
	This year if we all do our job, we can make the Super Eights and hopefully do some damage.         
	I truly believe weve got the squad to go a long way and hopefully make the final and come away with the silverware.         
	Hussey has warned defending champions Pakistan that Australia will be in their face when the two heavyweights clash in the group stage.         
	Australia play Pakistan in St Lucia on Sunday in Group A before Michael Clarkes men take on Bangladesh two days later, with two sides advancing to the Super Eights.         
	Hussey says he was embarrassed by their first-round exit last year. I think our pace bowling trio, or the four of them (Shaun Tait, Mitchell Johnson, Dirk Nannes and Brett Lee), is probably a key to our game, the Australian batsman said.         
	Hopefully well be really aggressive and have intent up front, maybe a bit of attitude and get in their face a bit, and hopefully use that tone to carry on with the fielding and batting and just play a complete, perfect all-round game against Pakistan, that would be good.

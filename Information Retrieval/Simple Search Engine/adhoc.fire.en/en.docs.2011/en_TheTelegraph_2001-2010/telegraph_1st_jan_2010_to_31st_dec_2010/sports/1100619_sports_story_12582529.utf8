	Tembisa: Four North Korean football players suspected to have gone missing in South Africa have turned up for World Cup practice.         
	The four players missed North Koreas match Tuesday against Brazil. Fifa denied the players were ever missing and said they were left out of Tuesdays line-up because of a technical error.         
	We have no information that the players may have disappeared, a Fifa spokesman said.         
	Our liaison officer with North Korea hasnt signalled anything to us.         
	The players  Pak Sung Hyok, An Chol Hyok, Kim Kyong Il and Kim Myong Won  were on the field for training as usual Friday.         
	A video shot by a broadcaster on Thursday night showed three of the supposedly missing quartet sitting on the team bus.         
	The fourth was sighted working out at a Pretoria gym that same evening.         
	All four turned up to training Friday at Makhulong Stadium, and were seen stretching, jogging and kicking soccer balls before a crowd of hundreds of journalists.         
	North Koreas next match is against Portugal on Monday in Cape Town.           (AGENCIES)

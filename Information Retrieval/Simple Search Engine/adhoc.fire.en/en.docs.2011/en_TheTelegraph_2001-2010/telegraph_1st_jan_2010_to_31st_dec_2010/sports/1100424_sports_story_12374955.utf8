                                                                                                                       7                                      Black Caps to play SL in US
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand and Sri Lanka will play three Twenty20 cricket matches in Florida next month as part of a partnership between the United States and New Zealand cricket boards.         
	[That Florida might be hosting T20 Internationals between Test-playing nations, after the World T20 in the West Indies, had been reported in The Telegraph on December 15, last year.]         
	The first international matches played in the US by Test-playing nations will be held at Lauderhill, near Miami, from May 20 to 23, New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said Friday.         
	We have the experience and capacity to help develop the game of cricket in the US. We are looking at ways of helping USA Cricket grow the game both professionally and at the grassroots, Vaughan said in a statement.         
	This T20 series is the first of many initiatives between our two cricket boards and we envisage the Black Caps playing in the US on an annual basis.         
	The series will follow the World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies, which ends on May 16.         
	The T20 matches will be played at the Central Broward County Regional Park Cricket Stadium on May 20, 22 and 23.         
	News of an alliance between the New Zealand and US cricketing bodies was first announced in February.           (AGENCIES)

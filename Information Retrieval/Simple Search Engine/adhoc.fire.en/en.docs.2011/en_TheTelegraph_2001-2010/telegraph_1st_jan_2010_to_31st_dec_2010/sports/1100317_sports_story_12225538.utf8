The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fortunate to have superb captain, says Fleming
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fortunate to have superb captain, says Fleming
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming is hopeful that captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis elbow injury, from a Shane Bond delivery, doesnt prove to be serious.         
	He has gone for an X-ray. I hope that everything is well and its just a bruise and nothing more than that, Fleming said at the media conference. However, he didnt forget to lavish praise on Dhoni. I am fortunate to work with a superb captain. His ability to retain composure in pressure situations is second to none, he said.         
	On a personal front, this win was far more satisfying than the usual manner of victories of the Chennai side, feels the former New Zealand captain.         
	Normally, the mantra for the Chennai team has been to score heavily in the Powerplays and put the pressure on the opposition. Today (Tuesday), we did just the reverse. Our boys really studied the pitch well and paced the innings. It was brilliant batting at the end. From overs 4-12, we ran hard, took the singles and twos well and then accelerated towards the end. When the Knight Riders batted, our bowlers hit the right areas, which was impressive. It was more of a subtle win.

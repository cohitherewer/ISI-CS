	Chittagong: Opener Tamim Iqbal hit a brilliant 95 to power Bangladesh to a six-wicket win over Zimbabwe in fifth one-day International (ODI), on Sunday, and a 3-1 victory in the five-match series.         
	Local boy Tamim entertained his home crowd with seven sixes and five fours to score 95 off 96 balls as Bangladesh eased past Zimbabwes modest 188 for six with seven overs to play.         
	Tamim survived a few anxious moments at the early part of his innings and had one clear let-off when Christopher Mpofu dropped a sharp return catch with him on 24.         
	He never looked back after that, however, and again exploded with some powerful driving. Tamim struck six sixes in his 154 against Zimbabwe, at Bulawayo, and surpassed that mark in the 29th over of the innings with a six off Dabengwa through long on.         
	He attempted another long bomb off the next ball but fell short as Graeme Cremer dived to take a catch at deep mid-wicket and deny him a deserved century. It ended his 136-run second wicket partnership with Zunaid Siddique, who finished on an unbeaten 56.         
	Wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim took a single off Dabengwa, taking the hosts to 189 for four, which gave Bangladesh their sixth series win over Zimbabwe on home soil in the past six years.         
	Zimbabwe took a surprise lead in the series with a nine-run win in the first game, but Bangladesh bounced back to win the next two games by six wickets and 65 runs respectively. The fourth one-dayer was rained off.         
	Zimbabwe had a disastrous start to the final game when, after choosing to bat first, they lost a wicket off the first delivery.           (REUTERS)

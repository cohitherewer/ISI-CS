The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Siddle and Haddin in T20 squad
                                                                                                                       7                                      Siddle and Haddin in T20 squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Peter Siddle and Brad Haddin were included in the Australia Twenty20 squad for their match against Sri Lanka at the Waca on October 31.         
	Its exciting to see the return of Peter Siddle and Brad Haddin into international cricket as part of this squad for the Twenty20 International against Sri Lanka on Sunday. Peter is a key bowler in all forms of the game and has made a return from injury and is now ready to take his place in this Australia Twenty20 squad, National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said.         
	It is unfortunate for Tim Paine, having played so well for Australia recently, to miss out on this squad but Brad has made a very good recovery from his elbow injury and is an established member of our side in all forms of the game.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Michael Clarke (captain), Cameron White (vice-captain), Brad Haddin, John Hastings, David Hussey, Clint McKay, Dirk Nannes, Stephen Keefe, Peter Siddle, Steve Smith, David Warner, Shane Watson.

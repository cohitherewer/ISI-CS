                                                                                                                       7                                      Middlesex give up on Yuvraj
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Middlesex have pulled out of their bid to sign Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh (playing for the Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League) for this seasons Friends Provident Twenty20 despite receiving a signed contract from him.         
	Middlesex have been unable to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and have decided against signing Yuvraj after discovering that Indias increasing international commitments, including the Asia Cup and a triangular one-day competition in Zimbabwe, were likely to clash with most of their Twenty20 matches.         
	Calls to the BCCI to seek clarification on this point have proved fruitless, however, we have since been advised that Yuvraj Singh will be required to represent India in this tournament, therein leaving us in an untenable position, leading to us make the decision to notify Yuvrajs representatives that we will not be pursuing our interest in bringing him to Lords, said Middlesex chief executive Vinny Codrington.         
	Middlesex, who have already recruited former Australia wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist as their other specialist Twenty20 overseas player, had even agreed what squad number Yuvraj would wear on his shirt before his move collapsed.

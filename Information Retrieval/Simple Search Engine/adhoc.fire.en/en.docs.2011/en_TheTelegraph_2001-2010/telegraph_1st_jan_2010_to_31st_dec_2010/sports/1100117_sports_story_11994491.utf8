The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Present situation is frustrating 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Present situation is frustrating 
  - NRAI, Sports ministry blame each other for the abhinav Bindra mess       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI AMP; OUR CORRESPONDENT IN CHANDIGARH            Abhinav Bindra                                 
	A day after Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra threatened to quit shooting alleging he was treated poorly by the authorities, both National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) and the ministry of sports were quick to shift the blame on each for the mess.         
	The ministry, which so far had insisted that all shooters should join the trials to get selected for the national team, on Saturday said it would not object if the ace marksman was exempted from trials.         
	Its for the national sports federations to lay down the selection criteria, the ministry said.         
	If the tells the Ministry tomorrow that it wants to follow a separate approach for the top shooters and exempt Abhinav from trials, we would have no objection, the ministry said.         
	Bindra had earlier said he was frustrated with the NRAIs attitude.         
	It may be recalled that Bindra had told The Telegraph last month, he was training overseas when the NRAI had directed him to be present for the trials in India. On returning home, Bindra said, he was informed that the trials had been put off.         
	Bindra also said that he intended to spend two months in Europe and was eager to compete in the Munich event in January. Thats because the World Championship, in August, is going to be at the same facility and it will be nice to get a feel of that venue, he had said then.         
	It is quite unfortunate and extremely distressing to me that my point of view is not being appreciated and respected. The present situation leaves me very frustrated and upset.         
	It does not really leave me with much motivation. It disturbs me and makes it difficult for me to focus on the sport, Abhinva said in statement read out to the media in his sprawling house in Zirakur, 20 km from Chandigarh.         
	I dont see the chance for future success if I am not going to be allowed to prepare in a certain way of training, Abhinav added.         
	The NRAI, on the other hand, blamed the ministry for the mess up.         
	It was the ministry which said that everyone will have to attend the trials to get into the team. What can we do about it? How can we go against the ministrys directive to select a player from outside, asked NRAI general-secretary Baljeet Sethi.         
	Sethi said he would place the entire thing in front of the selection committee. Let them take a decision, he said.         
	In Chandigarh, Abhinavs father A.S. Bindra showed a mail his son had received from the sports ministry passing the buck to NRAI to sort out the problems.         
	They are again asking us to approach the NRAI.         
	We go to the NRAI and they ask us to approach the sports ministry and when we approach the sports ministry we are told to go to NRAI. There is nobody anywhere to respect our views, he lamented.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney ruled out of tie vs Valencia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney ruled out of tie vs Valencia
            THE TIMES, LONDON AGENCIES                            
	London: Wayne Rooney will miss Wednesdays Champions League match against Valencia because of an ankle injury.         
	The England striker was substituted in the 61st minute of Uniteds 2-2 draw at Bolton on Sunday and the Premier League club said he will not be part of the squad that flies to Spain on Tuesday.         
	A statement on Uniteds website on Monday said Rooneys ankle injury is not thought to be serious, but added that Ferguson has chosen not to play him against the Spanish leaders.         
	United, which drew 0-0 with Rangers in their opening Group C match, are already without injured wingers Ryan Giggs and Antonio Valencia.         
	Kevin Keegan, the former England manager, had accused Rooney of double standards after the players on-the-field problems continued in the wake of revelations about his private life.         
	 His only goal in six appearances for United this season came from the penalty spot, and Sir Alex Ferguson suggested last week that the forward is struggling to deal with the scrutiny that has followed the publication of stories about extra-marital affairs.         
	Keegan, who watched the match as a television pundit, expressed concerns about Rooneys form, but said that the forward could not complain about scrutiny over his private life, having heavily publicised his family life, including his wedding, as part of a lucrative contract with OK! magazine.         
	You cant have all the contracts and sell your wedding to magazines and then suddenly say, Thats the tap I want to turn on, but I want to turn the other one off, Keegan said when asked about Rooney.         
	I know from when I played that, if you are advertising boots and all these things, you have to make appearances. But one thing I would say is, Keep your home and your family out of it. His performance at Bolton tells me his confidence is shot.         
	For United to get back to where they should be and winning at places like Bolton, they need Wayne Rooney firing on all cylinders. But at the moment theyre minus Wayne Rooney.         
	Rooney had an ice pack on his ankle after being substituted with nearly 30 minutes left at the Reebok Stadium, but Mike Phelan, the United assistant manager, admitted that the substitution was partly a tactical consideration. Wayne had a bit of a knock and has been playing with it for a couple of weeks, Phelan said. We decided he wasnt getting into the areas we wanted and wasnt getting chances, so we had to change it.         
	Owen Coyle, the Bolton manager, led the case for Rooneys defence. Its time for people to lay off him, Coyle said. I dont think what the lad is going through is beneficial for him or his country.         
	Meanwhile, Lionel Messi was named in Barcelonas 19-man squad on Monday for the trip to play Rubin Kazan in the Champions League.

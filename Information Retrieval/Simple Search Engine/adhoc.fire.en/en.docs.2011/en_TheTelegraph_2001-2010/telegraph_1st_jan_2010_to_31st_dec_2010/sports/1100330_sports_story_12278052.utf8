The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern storming on United mind

	Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney and defender Rio Ferdinand have travelled to Germany with the rest of the squad for their Champions League quarter final first leg against Bayern Munich.         
	Rooney and Ferdinand both missed Manchester Uniteds 4-0 win over Bolton at the weekend because of respective groin and foot injuries.         
	Top goalscorer Rooney, however, is likely to line-up as a lone striker at the Allianz Arena, while Ferdinand will join Nemanja Vidic in the heart of the defence.         
	As they look to reach their third European final in as many years, United veteran Ryan Giggs said the clash with Bayern has triggered memories of one the clubs most astonishing wins.         
	Although the 1999 Champions League was not won in Munich, the German citys famous Bayern were the victims of one of the most memorable finals in history.         
	I cant believe its 11 years ago, said Giggs. It was one of the greatest nights of my life and for many fans too, this will bring back a lot of happy memories.         
	We will settle for the same score as in 1999 too, but hopefully not leaving it as late as we did then.         
	Giggs has warned his teammates that they cannot afford to underestimate their German opponents as Uniteds track record proves results against Bayern are always close.         
	I am a little bit surprised about our overall record but it has always been tight, he continued. It is usually difficult against German sides, and against the top ones even more so.         
	We have won the European Cup three times. They have won it on four occasions so you are talking about two clubs with massive history; full of experience and full of great players so hopefully its going to be a great spectacle.         
	The team we played against in 1999 was really powerful. It had strength all the way through. Now Bayern have a lot of trickery with Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben, and some other individual match winners.         
	But our European record in recent times has been good and if we play to the best of our ability we really fancy ourselves.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson said: The history of playing Bayern in past European ties tells you its going to be very difficult for us. Relishing the encounter was Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who said: Since the 1999 final, playing United has always been a big thrill. This duel has history so Im looking forward to it.         
	Bayern, though, could not have picked a worse time this season to face mighty United.         
	The Bavarians, who had enjoyed a successful run in three competitions following the winter break, are stuck in a rut after their second successive Bundesliga loss, 1-2 to VfB Stuttgart on Saturday. They could also be taking on United without their best player this season.         
	Dutch winger Robben pulled a calf muscle against Stuttgart and is doubtful for the match while midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is suspended.         
	Maybe it turns out not to be that bad but it looks difficult for the match against United, Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said. Robben was also outstanding in midweek, scoring the extra-time winner against Schalke 04 which sent Bayern into the German Cup final.         
	Van Gaal, however, does have playmaker Franck Ribery fit as well as central defender Martin Demichelis, who injured his face in Argentinas friendly against Germany this month. Striker Mario Gomez also looks to have recovered from a muscle injury, though he lacks match practice.         
	The other quarter final on Tuesday is the all-French tie between Olympique Lyon and Girondins Bordeaux.

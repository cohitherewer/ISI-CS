The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney is worn out: Donovan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney is worn out: Donovan
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Landon Donovan, the United States forward, has claimed that Englands World Cup prospects face being compromised by a worn out Wayne Rooney and excessive public expectancy on Fabio Capellos players.         
	The 28-year-old concedes that Manchester United forward Rooney has earned a reputation as one of the worlds top players this season.         
	But Rooney has been troubled by ankle and groin injuries in recent weeks and, having made 51 appearances for club and country this season, The USA striker believes that Englands leading player is already suffering from fatigue, a month before the World Cup is due to begin.         
	Donovan said: Rooney is a top player. In my opinion, he is one of the best players in the world right now.         
	But the other part of it is that he has played a lot of games and he is tired. He is probably worn out.         
	Injuries are a part of that because things happen when players are tired. When they just keep adding games to the schedule, it makes it difficult.         
	Any time you come into a World Cup, because of the timing of it, big players who play a lot of games in Europe are coming right at the end of their season, so it is always an interesting dynamic how to balance that.         
	Despite Englands dismal record in major tournaments  with the solitary success in the 1966 World Cup followed by a run to the semi-finals at Italia 90  the country rarely travels to a World Cup unburdened by great expectations.         
	And Donovan claims that the hype surrounding the England team will only serve to increase the pressure on Capellos squad in South Africa.         
	Donovan said: Of course there is more pressure on the English players (than the USA team).

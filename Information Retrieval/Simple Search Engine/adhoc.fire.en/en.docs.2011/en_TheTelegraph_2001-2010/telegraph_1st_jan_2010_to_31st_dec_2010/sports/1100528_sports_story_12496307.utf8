    - Date Krumm shown the door; Leander-Lukas in Round II      THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Andy Murray returns to Juan Ignacio Chela in Paris, on Thursday. (AP)                                 
	Paris: The opening four-and-a-half hours of day five were wiped out by rain but the weather seemingly only delayed the inevitable as former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic was crushed 6-3, 6-0 in the second round by No 28 seed Alisa Kleybanova, Thursday.         
	Ivanovic, 22, was not seeded for the French Open after falling to 42nd in the rankings and extended a sequence that has seen her fail to get past the fourth round of a major since lifting the title on Philippe Chatrier two years ago.         
	The Serbian produced another error-strewn performance against Kleybanova, dropping her serve five times in total, giving her opponent an easy passage to a third-round match against eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska or Yaroslava Shvedova.         
	Third seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy of the Czech Republic beat Jonan Brunstrom of Sweden and Jean-Julien Rojer of Netherland Antilles 6-3, 6-7(6), 7-5 in the first round.         
	Meanwhile, Japanese veteran Kimiko Date Krumms French Open adventure has come to an end following a 0-6, 3-6 defeat to Australian wild card Jarmila Groth.         
	Date Krumm, 39, returned to the sport in 2008 after 12 years in retirement and secured the biggest win of her second career by stunning ninth seed and former world No. 1 Dinara Safina in the first round.         
	Slovakia-born Groth, the world No. 107, also reached the third round at Roland Garros last year and will now face compatriot Anastasia Rodionova for a place in the last 16.         
	The match lasted barely an hour  brief enough to be completed between showers. Play was delayed for more than four hours at the start, and there were two more interruptions later in the day.         
	Date Krumm was severely hampered by a calf injury that flared up against Safina.         
	Nine other matches were completed, seven on the womens side. No. 4-seeded Jelena Jankovic and No. 11 Li Na won.         
	Three seeded women were beaten: No. 8 Agnieszka Radwanska, No. 21 Vera Zvonareva and No. 32 Kateryna Bondarenko.         
	Radwanska was upset by Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan 7-5, 6-3. Zvonareva lost to Anastasia Rodionova of Australia 6-4, 6-4. Bondarenko was beaten by Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada 6-4, 6-1.         
	Jankovic eliminated Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Na defeated Stephanie Cohen-Aloro following the long delay at the start of the day, 6-2, 6-2.         
	Its not very pleasant to have to wait, Cohen-Aloro said. But were all in the same situation.         
	On the mens side, No. 25 Marcos Baghdatis rallied past Marcel Granollers of Spain 4-6, 6-1, 7-5, 6-2.         
	Andy Roddick moved into the third round for the second year in a row. The sixth-seeded American beat 112th-ranked Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 in a match that started more than four-and-a-half hours behind schedule.         
	No. 4 Andy Murray beat Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2 while in a match that took two days to complete, Fabio Fognini of Italy beat No. 13 Gael Monfils of France 2-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 9-7. The match was suspended because of darkness on Wednesday at 5-all in the fifth set.         
	Sixteen singles were postponed, including those involving Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, meaning they wont play their second-round matches until at least Friday  the sixth day of the tournament. Nadal faces Horacio Zeballos, Djokovic plays Kei Nishikori, and Serena takes on Julia Goerges of Germany.         
	Twenty doubles matches were also postponed. During the first rain delay, the players cafeteria and lounge areas in the main stadium were packed with players and their entourages, and there were long lines at concession stands and souvenir shops. Several hundred fans sat under umbrellas on center court watching a video replay of last years final between Roger Federer and Robin Soderling.         
	Im on the floor of the lockeroom in my bed of towels playing Angry Birds, American doubles specialist Bob Bryan tweeted four hours into the delay. Anyone have 3 stars on all levels?         
	Rain fell with the tournament already behind schedule following three delays Wednesday, the longest of which lasted 90 minutes.         
	The only washout of an entire days schedule on record at Roland Garros occurred May 30, 2000. Even so, the French tennis federation has been pushing for a roof and has studied the possibility of moving the tournament, with a site next to the Versailles castle among the locations being considered.         
	A project announced last year to build a new court with a retractable roof less than 500 yards from the current center court was blocked because of political issues.         
	Wimbledon added a retractable roof last year atop a stadium that opened in the 1920s, and the Australian Open has retractable roof over two courts. But the French and US Open must wait when it rains.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Barreto after his goal, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The difference between the good and the great lies in the fact that often the latters worst is better than the formers best. And Jose Barretos greatness, in Indian football, is not because of his God-like status for Mohun Bagan fans, but because his on-field mastery, even at the age of 34.         
	Barreto scored one and paved the way for another in Bagans 4-0 victory over Kalighat Club, in a CFL Premier Division tie, on Saturday. The Brazilians strike partner Murithala Ali scored a brace while youngster Souvik Chakraborty netted one.         
	With this victory, Bagan have garnered 22 points from nine matches and are in the third spot in league standings, behind leaders East Bengal (33 points) and Aryan Club (24 points).         
	The goal-fest began in the 18th minute. Kinshuk Debnath, overlapping down the right flank, kept a neat centre in the Kalighat box. Barreto outjumped the defender but failed to connect his header. But, because he was positioned superbly, his missed header bounced off his shoulders to a lurking Souvik who coolly headed in.         
	The second, in the 30th minute, was stunning, to say the least. Bagan received a free-kick on the left edge of the rival box. Barreto stepped up, took the shot and Bagan were 2-0 up. His curling shot into the left corner was so perfect that none, including the goalkeeper, could move an inch.         
	Murithala, who was enterprising throughout the 90 minutes, scored his first in a weird manner. In the 38th minute, Gauranga Duttas cross from the left was chested in by Murithala as the hapless Kalighat defence served as the audience. The Man of the Match converted a penalty, in the 70th minute, to complete Bagans tally.         
	Kalighat keeper Sambhu Mistry had a terrible day as his every faulty rush-out and wrong positioning cost his team a goal.         
	For Barreto, however, the day was special. He dedicated his goal to his daughter Natalia, as it was her birthday. When reminded that it was also Diego Maradonas 50th birthday, a broad smile lit up the Brazilians face.

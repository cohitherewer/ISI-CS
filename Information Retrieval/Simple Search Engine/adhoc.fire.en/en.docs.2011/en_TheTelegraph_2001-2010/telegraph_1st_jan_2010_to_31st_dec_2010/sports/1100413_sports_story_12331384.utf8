The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lorgat: No IPL window 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lorgat: No IPL window 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday that there would be no separate window for the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Addressing a press conference during the unveiling of the World Twenty20 trophy, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: As I have said in the past, I dont envisage a window for IPL, which is a domestic event. Its difficult to incorporate all domestic tournaments.         
	The Future Tours Programme (FTP) schedules only international cricket, added the ICC official. In addition to that, IPL (governing council) has not sought any window.         
	He also praised the IPL saying the tournament is a great forerunner for the World T20. Lorgat disagreed with suggestions that T20 cricket may eat into the popularity of Tests and one-dayers. There is no question about T20s popularity and it has certainly taken off beyond expectations. But that doesnt suggest the other formats are not popular, he said.         
	When I took over as CEO, a lot of questions were raised on the existence of Tests and ODIs. However, in the last eight months, we have seen some fantastic Tests and exciting ODIs. When Sachin Tendulkar scored 200, most people were of the view that 50-over cricket would definitely survive. Its important how we manage the formats, Lorgat said.         
	The price of tickets in the World T20 beginning on April 30 would be cheaper than what it was in the last two editions, Lorgat informed.         
	We have learnt from the 2007 World Cup. Perhaps pricing of the tickets was the main reason behind the low turnout. The price of tickets was not affordable for a lot of people, Lorgat said.         
	Spelling out plans to woo the locals for the April 30-May 16 tournament, Lorgat said: While pricing of the ticket is the key, we are also retaining the Caribbean flavour this time. Every territory has its own style and culture, and we will encourage them to get involved in their own way. Im hoping they would come out in full swing and there will be a party atmosphere all around.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Total overhaul, slick football 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Total overhaul, slick football 
            JAYDEEP BASU                                      Edgar Davids    
	Durban: No one in the Dutch camp would be savouring the semi-final victory over Uruguay more than coach Bert van Marwijk.         
	Often condemned for rejecting the much-acclaimed system of Total Football, in favour of a rigid 4-2-3-1 formation, the pragmatic Dutchman found himself criticised by former players throughout the World Cup campaign.         
	Tuesdays victory that opened the gates for the Oranje to play their first World Cup final in 32 years has changed it all.         
	The same lot of former players, who constantly compared the present team with the one that lost to Germany in the final in 1974, is now praising the team for their wonderful journey to the title round.         
	Former star Edgar Davids, a permanent feature in the Netherlands midfield for more than 10 years and currently here as a television expert, is so impressed that he has no doubt about winning the Cup.         
	I am waiting for the Netherlands to win the title, said Davids during an interaction with The Telegraph.         
	Tuesday was a wonderful night for us There were sporting struggles till the final whistle. In the end, we won simply because we were a better team, said Davids, famous for the goggles he wears to protect his eye sockets after surgery on them for glaucoma.         
	What I like of this team is their sense of maturity and commitment, Davids said.         
	The coach is lucky to have players like Dirk Kuyt, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder, who can rise to the occasion in big matches.         
	Davids brushed aside the question that the Netherlands have moved away from the concept of Total Football. Like in life, in football too, nothing is static. Total Football was a great concept that was made successful by a great coach (Rinus Michels) and a great bunch of players. The most important thing is to remain focussed. These boys are doing their job fine, Davids said.         
	Any question on Total Football has somehow left Marwijk irritated throughout the World Cup. So much so that after beating Cameroon in the group league, the Dutch coach said: From Day One, I have told the boys to believe that second place is not enough.         
	During the 70s, when Michels game plan was creating waves around the world, the Netherlands twice reached the World Cup finals only to lose to Germany and Argentina.         
	What happened before my time, with all due respect, I do not look at it, Marwijk said. I do things my way, we play good football and sometimes beautiful football but, in the past, we started winning and got over-confident.         
	I try to tell my players there will always be a next match, Marwijk said after the victory over Uruguay.         
	Even Dutch legend Ruud Gullit, who described the Netherlands win over Brazil as so so, has now expressed hope that it will be third time lucky for the Netherlands in the final.         
	We have been twice to the final, said Gullit, a member of the Dutch side, which won the 1988 European Championship. The difference is, this time we wont play the hosts like in 1974 (Germany) and 1978 (Argentina). This is a great opportunity Everybody expects this to be the moment, said the former captain.         
	Johan Cruyff, the captain of the 1974 Dutch team and an all-time great, however, has singled out Dirk Kuyt as the brain behind the triumph.         
	Without belittling anyone, it is still nice to see how Kuyt has developed into one of the most valuable players, said Cruyff. There were doubts but he was ready as of the opening game.         
	Look at what he did. He started on the right, then forward and, against Brazil, on the left. Not only did he keep Maicon out of the game, he also set up the winner.         
	Someone like that is worth his weight in gold, Cruyff said.

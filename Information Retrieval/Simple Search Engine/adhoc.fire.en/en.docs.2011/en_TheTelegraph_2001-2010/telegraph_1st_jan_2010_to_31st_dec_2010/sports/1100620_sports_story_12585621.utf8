            OUR BUREAU                      
	The following is the summary of showcause notices served on Lalit Modi:         
	Showcause No.1: April 26         
	The BCCI served the first notice on Modi, a little past midnight on April 25, soon after the close of the third edition of the IPL. By suspending him as the IPL chairman and commissioner, as well as from other posts he held in the BCCI with immediate effect, president Shashank Manohar stopped Modi from attending the IPL Governing Council meeting that was held the same morning.         
	The notice gave Modi 15 days to reply to the charges of irregularities in the initial bids of Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab; irregularities in the broadcasting rights bid; bid rigging with regard to the two new franchises of Kochi and Pune as well as the Internet rights; and his behavioural pattern.         
	Showcause No. 2: May 6         
	This was issued to Modi based on an email received from Giles Clarke, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. According to the BCCI, Clarke alleged that Modi was involved in activities that were detrimental to Indian cricket, English cricket and world cricket at large. In his email, Clarke alleged that Modi held a meeting with officials of three English County Clubs  Yorkshire, Lancashire and Warwickshire  along with those of IMG in New Delhi on March 31 and discussed plans for an IPL-type T20 tournament in the UK without the sanction of the ECB.         
	Showcause No. 3: May 31         
	This BCCI notice on Modi, asked him to explain alleged irregularities in the sale of theatrical rights for the T20 tournament, which was won by Entertainment and Sports Direct with the highest bid of Rs 330 crore for a period of 10 years (2010-19).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Russia brand complaint primitive
                                                                                                                       7                                      Russia brand complaint primitive
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                       
	Englands complaint that 2018 World Cup bid rival Russia broke competition rules by criticising London was being studied by Fifa on Wednesday, as Moscows most senior football official branded the move absolutely primitive.         
	Fifa said in a statement that the dispute is currently pending and it had contacted both countries bid committees.         
	Englands bid confirmed on Tuesday that they filed an official complaint last week about reported comments by Russian bid leader Alexey Sorokin that London has a high crime rate and youth drinking problem.         
	England demanded a formal apology as tensions rise approaching the scheduled December 2 vote, which also involves Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.         
	Sorokin refused, saying his comments in a Russian newspaper were mistranslated and that he would explain the original statement if required.         
	Russia remained defiant on Wednesday, as a veteran of Fifa politics dismissed Englands case as destined to fail.

	I was really moved to see striker Fabio Quagliarella sobbing like a child after English referee Howard Webb had blown the whistle of death for the Italians at this World Cup. It will always be difficult for someone who hasnt played the game to understand a players psyche, the emotional turbulence that a player goes through when he ends up on the losing side even after giving his hundred per cent (Quagliarella scored an intelligent goal in the match).         
	In a match where the only thing that mattered was winning, Italy played like true world champions against the Slovaks for only the last 30 minutes. This after having played listless football for around 240 minutes prior to that in this tournament. However, the last 30 minutes on Thursday was the most entertaining football we have watched so far at this World Cup.         
	The Italians saved their best for the last but their best wasnt good enough to save them and take them through to the next round.         
	So adieu Azzurris. Just like France in 2002, the Fabio Cannavaros were knocked out in the group stages. For them, its time now for some serious self-introspection as to where they went wrong.         
	So, when I sit back to dissect Italys performance in the World Cup, what instantly comes to mind as something that affected their performance are the injuries to Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Pirlo. Italys biggest setback came the moment Buffon was ruled out with a back injury after the Paraguay game. Not only did they miss a leader, they also had to do without a quality man in the last line of defence.         
	With due respect, Federico Marchetti didnt deliver what is expected of the goalkeeper of a world champion team. The second and third goals that Italy conceded were due to some poor anticipation on his part.         
	For Vitteks second goal, Marchetti didnt have his near post covered while he charged out like a schoolboy when Kopunek scored the third goal. He didnt even have an idea of the bounce. Blame also goes to Daniele de Rossi for not having any inkling that there was a man lurking behind him.         
	Lets come to Pirlo now. He was introduced in the 56th minute and Italy looked a different team after he ran onto the pitch. There was someone who was suddenly controlling the game. Strangely, this was missing during the first half.         
	It really was disappointing to see the Italians not taking enough initiative in the first half in what was a do-or-die match for them. That was something the Slovaks did, keeping up the pressure on the four-time world champions for the better part of the game. They played positively and didnt try to play defensive after going ahead. They tried to look for more goals. Cheers to the Slovaks.         
	Italy should have learnt a lesson from Germanys match against Ghana. Three to five quick touches and suddenly you saw a build-up from the centre of the park to the attacking third. That is something that the Italians lacked. Not to forget the amount of misspasses made by the Italians.         
	Now coming to another important issue. The age factor, which seems to have had its role in the disaster. If you have two defenders  Cannavaro, nearly 37 and Gianluca Zambrotta (33)  whose combined age is 70, then you are asking for trouble.         
	Cannavaro has chased shadows whenever he confronted by a younger and agile striker. Wonder what would have happened had Italy qualified for the subsequent rounds and faced-off with teams like Brazil, Argentina and Portugal. There could have been nothing but humiliation in that case.         
	Similarly, the forward line, too, lacked the necessary spunk with both Antonio di Natale (33) and Vicenzo Iaquinta (31) being no more than mere pedestrians.         
	The Italians, despite their compact defensive strategy, have produced strikers like Paolo Rossi, Roberto Baggio and Alessandro de Piero to name a few. Sadly, this team lacked quality in attack.         
	Just like the French, the Italians will go through a transition phase where they will need a new breed of players to come up. With loads of top-class foreigners playing in the Serie A, it would be a big challenge for the Italian bosses to nurture and bring forth quality home-bred talent.         
	Both last editions world champions and runners-up are out. Lets hope some of the better teams progress from the round of 16 without a hitch.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Graeme Smith after his injury on Friday.   A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: Graeme Smith had actually been on crutches on the eve of the last India-South Africa Test at the Eden, in late November 2004. Yet, he still led his country the next morning.         
	Too much, therefore, may not be read into the ligament damage suffered by Smith on the little finger of his left hand. The injury occurred while fielding, at the Eden, on Friday morning.         
	An MRI scan (at Woodlands) ruled out a fracture and, so, the visitors medical staff is hopeful that Smith will be able to play in the second and final Test, from Sunday.         
	The little finger doesnt really come into play in a big way, but the swelling has to subside... The concern right now is the swelling... Our medical staff is confident that it would subside in the next 24 hours, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	According to the medical bulletin, put out soon after the scan (unlike the confusion which prevails when an Indian player gets injured), Smith will put his finger to test during Saturdays practice, at the Eden.         
	Given what happened in the winter of 2004, only the very brave would bet on Smith not featuring in the XI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yasir under ACSU scanner
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yasir under ACSU scanner
  - Pakistan opener likely to be asked to explain his match-fixing claims       Nick Hoult            Yasir Hameed                                 
	Yasir Hameed, the Pakistan batsman, faces being interviewed by the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) as part of its match-fixing investigation, but his reliability as a witness was called into question on Sunday by his own teammates.         
	The ACSU detectives will be free to talk to Hameed as he is not part of the criminal investigation being carried out by Scotland Yard and it is likely he will be asked to explain comments made on film to an undercover reporter at the weekend during which he stated Pakistan were fixing almost every match.         
	Hameeds comments added to the pressure around the Pakistan squad who are potentially facing the prospect of another player being charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) this week. It was revealed on Sunday that a fourth Pakistan cricketer was being investigated for match-fixing.         
	We want to be prompt and decisive on this matter, said Haroon Lorgat, the chief executive of the ICC. It is not something we want to drag our heels on and as soon as we are in a position to make charges and disclosures we will do so.         
	Hameeds nickname within the Pakistan team is Bachcha, which means child in Urdu, and his naivety in talking with such openness to a complete stranger just days after the story of spot-fixing during the Lords Test broke is startling.         
	Hameed, who played in the third and fourth Tests but is not in the one-day squad, was summoned to the Pakistan High Commission in London on Sunday for a meeting with Ijaz Butt, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.         
	Hameed later issued an affidavit through the High Commission claiming his comments to the News of the World were simply a repeat of the allegations made against Salman Butt, Mohammed Aamer, and Mohammed Asif that had already been reported by the media. He claims he was duped into talking to the newspapers investigative journalist, Mazher Mahmood, believing him to be a sponsor offering a 50,000 deal with the airline Etihad.         
	He said two days later the same man called him and offered 25,000 to give a statement against the three players under investigation, which he refused.         
	Hameeds statement gave the mobile phone number which sent the message. When called, the number diverted to the Metropolitan Police adding to the sense of madness around this case.         
	Hameed is shown on the hidden camera speaking casually about the case against the Pakistan team but goes further claiming he lost his place in the team because he refused to become involved in match-fixing. They offered me handsome money, Hameed is shown saying. I wouldve come to you in a Ferrari now. I mean there is enough so that your desires are fulfilled... buy a car, that is how much money they were giving. Man, theyve offered big, big money. Up to 150,000 He said the approach was made during the Champions Trophy in 2004.         
	It is an offence under the ICCs code of conduct for a player not to report a suspicious approach which would give the ACU enough reason to interview Hameed.         
	The idea of a match-fixing amnesty was put forward by the Professional Cricketers Association as a way of persuading more players to come forward with what could be valuable information.         
	This is the kind of thing that we need to consider if what we are trying to do is to root things out properly, said Angus Porter, chief executive of the PCA. It is not a firm proposal, just a suggestion that somebody may wish to take up as something that might be necessary as a way of helping to sort out the problem.         
	If Hameed is contacted by the ACSU he may have to face an independent commissioner who the ICC plan to appoint to head what will be the biggest ever probe into corruption in cricket.

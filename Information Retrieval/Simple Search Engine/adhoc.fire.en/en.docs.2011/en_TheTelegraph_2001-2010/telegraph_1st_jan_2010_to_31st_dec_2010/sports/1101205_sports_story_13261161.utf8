    - Indian Open Atwal, Jyoti at tied 12th on Day III; baek is sole leader           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: A stunning performance on the back nine saw Koreas Baek Seuk-hyun emerge the sole leader in the Hero Honda Indian Open golf, at the Delhi Golf Club, on Saturday.         
	At the end of the third round, the 20-year-old wide-eyed Korean produced a spectacular finish, which included an eagle and four late birdies, for an overall 10-under 206 to take a one-shot advantage over Swedens Rikard Karlberg in the $1.25 million tournament.         
	Despite the seesaw battle between Baek and Karlberg that saw both the players playing some sparkling golf late in the afternoon, the focus remained on the two local players  veteran Mukesh Kumar and young Manav Jaini  who are tied third and very much in contention with an overall six-under show.         
	The tournaments top draws, local hero Arjun Atwal and three-time champion Jyoti Randhawa, will enter the final day six shots off the pace but their hopes will come up against an inspired Baek.         
	Randhawa, Atwal and Ashok Kumar are all tied 12th at four-under, and Shiv Kapur is tied 20th at three-under.         
	Overall, I felt much better than first two days, said Atwal, who had five birdies and an eagle against a couple of double-bogeys and a bogey on Day Three.         
	The feel is coming and I just need to avoid those double bogeys. I had two of them today (Saturday). Other than that I played really well. I had some good putts. I holed a 45-footer on the 12th and that gave a good feeling, said Indias only PGA Tour winner.         
	Back to the leaderboard, while 27-year-old Jaini , who learned his golf under Nonita Lal Quereshi in Chandigarh is looking for his first professional trophy, Mukesh Kumar, 45, has every major title on the domestic tour under his belt except the Indian Open.         
	Given the way Jaini played on Saturday, he could have ended with better scores but the three bogeys in the 7th, 11th and the 16th hole had a negative effect on the four birdies he had.         
	The one bogey in the 11th hole was really a foolish job, Jaini said later. The story was no different for Mukesh Kumar. He looked in fine touch in the front-nine but a couple of bogeys in the later part of the day saw him going down the ladder.         
	But things are not going to be easy for the two Indians as both Baek and Karlberg are going great guns at the tight DGC course. Baek remained cautious and said he would go all out on Sunday.         
	Its only a one-shot lead. I know I will be nervous tomorrow but I will concentrate on my own game and not look at the crowds. Its a perfect course ands I hope to finish perfectly, said Baek.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Losing Ashes may cost captaincy, says Ponting
                                                                                                                       7                                      Losing Ashes may cost captaincy, says Ponting
                      
	London: Australia have twice lost the Ashes under his captaincy and Ricky Ponting fears he might have to look for another job if the team fails to win back the coveted urn this November.         
	Id probably be looking for a new job if we lose again, said Ponting. The Ashes would be preceded by a tour to India and followed by the 2011 ODI World Cup, making the next eight months the biggest of his career, said Ponting.         
	It doesnt get any bigger than that and everything I do between now and April will be geared at getting the most out of myself and, most importantly, the group, he told an Australian daily         
	If Im able to do that I think there are some pretty special things on the horizon for this team, he said.         
	Asked if the Ashes and the World Cup win would be a perfect send-off for him, the 35-year-old was non-committal and said he would continue playing as long as he can keep on improving.         
	I dont know if theres ever a perfect time to go, said Ponting.         
	Well see. Ive always said if I dont feel I can play the way I want to or if I cant improve any more then it will be time to look at what Im doing.         
	But Im definitely as motivated as ever and as hungry as Ive ever been. And after scoring runs at the Oval Im feeling more like my old self, too, said Ponting, who scored a 93-ball 92 in the fourth ODI against England.         
	The right-hander said he was not under any pressure and was looking to do his best in the coming eight months.         
	I havent thought about any added pressure on me, he said.         
	Im just thinking about being the best player I can be and having a significant impact on the Ashes series as a batsman and as a leader, he said.           (PTI)

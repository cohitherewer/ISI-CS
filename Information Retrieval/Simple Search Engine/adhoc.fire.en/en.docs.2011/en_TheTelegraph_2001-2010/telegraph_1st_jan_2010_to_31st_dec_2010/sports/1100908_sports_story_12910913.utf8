    - pakistan cricket board is concerned, not alarmed           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Salman Butt            Mohammed Asif             Mohammed Aamer                            
	Calcutta: Scotland Yards preliminary report into the spot-fixing scandal may be released by Friday.         
	Weve been given to understand that it could be out within 72 hours, a top source, in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Speaking from London, he added: Frankly, till the findings are known, well just be waiting and watching... Its not for us to comment on a live investigation. It wouldnt be proper either.         
	Asked if the report may get delayed, the top source replied: Its possible... Investigators enjoy the right to consume time and we cant push anything. Obviously, wed like everything to be thorough.         
	Reacting to a question on the mood within the PCB, he said: Were concerned, yes, not alarmed... I say that because if Scotland Yard had anything substantial, something strong, then our players (Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Aamer) wouldnt have been let off after questioning.         
	Provisionally suspended by the International Cricket Council, the trio will remain in London till such time that they could be required for further investigations.         
	That actually suits the tainted players, for its not the best of times to return home. The public, after all, wouldnt mind lynching them.         
	One learns that the sense of outrage has been far greater this time when compared to earlier instances of match-fixing allegations, in the latter part of the 1990s.         
	The top source remarked: We havent really given much thought to their going back to Pakistan... Theyll have to stay here till the investigators make it known that their presence isnt mandatory. Right now, our worry is over what the preliminary findings may contain.         
	He confirmed that the PCB had no plans to withdraw Kamran Akmal from the squad currently touring the UK.         
	The controversial keepers name cropped up in the days immediately after the News of the World expose, on August 29.         
	Moreover, the world bodys Anti-Corruption and Security Unit has asked Akmal (and Butt) for cellphone records during the last Asia Cup, hosted by Sri Lanka, in June. Bookie Mazhar Majeed had been spotted during the tournament.         
	Status quo remains... Akmal stays with the squad, take that from me, the top source signed off.         
	Incidentally, legal adviser Tafazzul Rizvi, who is helping the PCB and the three players, comes from a family of legal eagles with roots in Patiala.

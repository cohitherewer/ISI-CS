                                                                                                                       7                                        Botha gets SA T20 captaincy
            A STAFF REPORTER            Johan Botha                           
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced the appointment of Johan Botha as captain of the Proteas Twenty20 squad, on Saturday, according to a media release.         
	He succeeded Graeme Smith, who stepped down as the T20 and one-dayers captain earlier in the week.         
	Johan was the unanimous choice of the Board, said CSA chief Gerald Majola. We have every confidence that he will do an excellent job leading up to the next edition of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2012.         
	Bothas appointment is for the T20 squad only. The captain to succeed Smith in the ODI format will be announced later. Smith will retain this captaincy until the end of the ICC World Cup next year.         
	Botha said he was excited at the challenge posed by the captaincy and was also humbled by the honour bestowed on him.         
	I really enjoyed the captaincy when I stood in for Graeme before, he said. I am proud to be offered the job now.         
	As far as the 50 overs captaincy is concerned, I will have to see how my own form goes and how the team performs. If everything goes according to plan I would like to think I have a chance of captaining in the 50-over format as well when Graeme stands down at the end of the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt refuses   to step down
                                                                                                                       7                                      Butt refuses   to step down
                            
	London: A defiant Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt on Sunday refused to step down from his post despite his name cropping up in a spot-fixing scandal that has plunged the game into a crisis.         
	Asked whether he would consider quitting the job, which was given to him only last month, Butt merely said, Why?         
	These are just allegations, anyone can say anything about anyone, that doesnt make them true, he fumed in a brief post-match press conference with team manager Yawar Saeed by his side.         
	 Definitely we have given our best, its just that the conditions have been difficult for the batsmen, Butt added.         
	Manager Saeed, on the other hand, was left to deal with queries on whether the two Twenty20 Internationals and the five-match ODI series against England starting September 5 is still on in the current scenario.         
	As far as Im concerned, the one-day series is on, he responded.         
	Meanwhile, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt and the team management will take a call on Monday on whether to send home the accused players and to fly in replacements for them.         
	Pacer Mohammed Asif said: I have spoken to the management and they have told us something happened, but not what. The management will tell us about it later.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss said that allegations of spot-fixing have taken the gloss off his teams comprehensive series triumph. I dont think anyone wants to finish a Test match in that scenario, Strauss said.

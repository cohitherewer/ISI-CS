The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan and Aisam win maiden title
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rohan and Aisam win maiden title
                      
	Johannesburg: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam Qureshi Sunday clinched their first Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour doubles title after a hard-fought 2-6, 6-3, 10-5 victory over Karol Beck and Harold Levy in the final of $442,500 South African Open.         
	Unseeded Bopanna and Qureshi finally won an ATP doubles title together in their third attempt, having finished runners-up in both the previous final appearances  in Mumbai (2007) and at Newport (2008).         
	The Indo-Pak pair had a dream run last year, winning three ATP Challenger events, but were unable to clinch a Tour event.         
	For Bopanna, though, this is his second ATP doubles title after the LA Open triumph in 2008 partnering American Eric Butorac.         
	An elated Bopanna said, Both of us are thrilled to have won this tournament. We had a great 2009 together, winning three ATP Challenger events, but were not able to clinch a Tour event. Its great to have begun this year on such a positive note by winning our first ATP World Tour trophy.         
	Bopanna and Qureshi, who had defeated second seeds Johan Brunstrom and Jean-Julien Rojer and the third-seeded Eric Butorac and Rajeev Ram earlier, will pocket 250 ranking points and share $24,350.

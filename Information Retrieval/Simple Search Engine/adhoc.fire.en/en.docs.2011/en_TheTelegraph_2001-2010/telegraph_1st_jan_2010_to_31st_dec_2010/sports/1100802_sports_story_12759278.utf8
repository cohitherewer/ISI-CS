            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India captain Bhaichung Bhutia will be leaving for Portugal, where Bob Hoghtons men are undergoing a preparatory camp for the 2011 Asian Cup, on Wednesday. Bhutia, who came back days after reaching Portugal as he complained of sudden weight loss, is now fit and fine.         
	I will be leaving on Wednesday for the camp. Right now, I am hale and hearty. There is no problem with me right now. Everything is fine, he said on Sunday.         
	Bhutia has got the green light from his doctor that he was fit enough to undergo Bobs training regime.         
	Bhutias return will be a double bonanza for Houghton, since Chetri also will be joining the camp soon.         
	India have began their preparation on a right note with two wins against Desportivo das Caldas and Desportivo Monsanto.

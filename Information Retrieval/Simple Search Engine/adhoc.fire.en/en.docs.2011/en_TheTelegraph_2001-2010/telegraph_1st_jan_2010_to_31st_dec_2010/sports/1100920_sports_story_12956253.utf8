	Madrid: Juanma Mata and Pablo Hernandez scored first-half goals as Valencia maintained their perfect start to the Spanish league season with a 2-1 win at Hercules on Sunday.         
	Spain forward Mata opened after two minutes before Hernandez made it 2-0 from a free kick in the 24th minute.         
	David Trezeguet scored his first goal for Hercules with a penalty before halftime.         
	Also, Nilmar scored two first-half goals to lead Villarreal to a 2-1 win at Levante, which pulled one back through Felipe Caicedo in stoppage time.         
	Henrique and Ariel Nahuelpan scored second half goals as Racing Santander beat Zaragoza 2-0.         
	On Saturday, Cristiano Ronaldo scored with a deflected free-kick to earn Real Madrid a battling 2-1 victory at promoted Real Sociedad.         
	His wayward shots, exaggerated complaints to the referee and occasional wild challenge had fans at the Anoeta howling until he struck a fierce free-kick which ballooned off the wall and past a stranded Claudio Bravo after 75 minutes.         
	Argentina winger Angel di Maria  a 25-million-euro summer signing from Benfica  had put the visitors in front at the start of the second half only for Raul Tamudo to level soon after.

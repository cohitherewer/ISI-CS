	Wozniacki controlled the second set earning the decisive break to go up 5-3 then held serve to seal her spot in the final. It was tough for both us, weve been waiting two days, Wozniacki told reporters.         
	Ill just relax right now and eat something, put my feet up and try to get as much energy as possible.         
	Zvonareva and Azarenka each traded a pair of breaks in the opening set of their match that took 70 minutes to complete with the Russian eighth seed prevailing in a tiebreak.

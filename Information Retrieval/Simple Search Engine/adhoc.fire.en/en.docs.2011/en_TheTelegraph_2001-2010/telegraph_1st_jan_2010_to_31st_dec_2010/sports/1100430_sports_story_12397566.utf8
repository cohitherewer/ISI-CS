The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In-form Black Caps are favourites vs Sri Lanka
                                                                                                                       7                                      In-form Black Caps are favourites vs Sri Lanka
                      
	Providence: Less than five days after a high-octane Indian Premier League, another Twenty20 extravaganza begins here from Friday as the worlds top cricketers assemble for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean with no team being tipped as clear favourites.         
	The 17-day tournament begins with a double-header at Guyana National Stadium here, with New Zealand taking on Sri Lanka in the opener, followed by a match between hosts West Indies and Ireland under lights.         
	The Black Caps can take heart from the fact that they are the veterans in the shortest format of the game having played more T20 Internationals than any other nation in the world.         
	Led by Daniel Vettori, the side boasts of several potential match-winners.         
	A 40-run victory in their opening warm-up match against Ireland and then sneaking past the hosts by seven runs in the second match have shaped up their preparations quite well. The two warm-up victories ensure that they go into the tournament full of confidence.         
	In the batting department, Brendon McCullums dazzling form in this format this season should augur well for Vettoris side.         
	Sri Lanka, on the other hand, look a little unsettled and that has been evident from their experimentation with different team combinations. But then, the core of Kumar Sangakkaras side remains the same and that should help the team gel well.         
	A talented bunch of youngsters, led by all-rounder Angelo Mathews, add that extra zing to Sangakkaras side.         
	The Lankans, finalists in the last edition of the tournament in England, would definitely want to get it right from the very first match this year.         
	West Indies are not to be discounted either, and they have two of the world crickets most dangerous players in captain Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard who have shown their prowess in the IPL III for the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians respectively.         
	Besides the home advantage and crowd support, they will also be strengthened by the return of fast bowler Jerome Taylor and veteran batsman Ramanaresh Sarwan.         
	The hosts would start as the favourites against Ireland in the second game on Friday but they would take the Europeans lightly at their own peril.         
	Ireland have good memories of the Caribbean following a couple of upsets in the 2007 ODI World Cup over Pakistan and Bangladesh.           (AGENCIES)

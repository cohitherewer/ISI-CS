  - RED AND GOLD BRIGADE TAKE ON AL QADSIA IN AFC CUP TIE TODAY       A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Yusif Yakubu (left) and Syed Rahim Nabi at the club ground, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: East Bengals AFC Cup campaign this year has been similar to their archrivals Mohun Bagans last year.         
	When Bagan played in the last edition of the AFC Cup (by virtue of winning the Federation Cup), they conceded 19 goals in six matches. Phillippe de Ridders boys have already conceded seven goals in their two defeats. They lost to Al Ittihad of Syria 1-4 at home, and then lost to Al Nejmeh of Lebanon 0-3 in Beirut.         
	On Wednesday, when East Bengal take on Al Qadsia of Kuwait in a Group D encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium, the red-and gold players would have to play out of their skin to stem the rot. Going into an international match with a winless streak of 10 matches is not a very pleasant proposition. Yet, it will be a match where East Bengal would try to salvage some pride. Even a draw will give them requisite confidence to get their I-League campaign back on track.         
	While East Bengal are yet to log a point in the AFC Cup, the Kuwaiti side have drawn both their matches. First they drew 1-1 at home against Al Nejmeh and then held Al Ittihad to a goalless draw in an away match.         
	De Ridder has had a rough journey since the Federation Cup triumph. The team have been going through a lean patch. With no Bhaichung Bhutia , it will be really surprising if the red-and-gold brigade is able to pull off an upset. However, skipper Syed Rahim Nabi who missed the last I-League game against Air-India due to side strain, will be back in action. Right back Nirmal Chetri, though will be out due to a double booking.         
	Neither De Ridder nor the boys have a clear idea as to how they should go about their AFC Cup campaign without losing focus in the I-League. There were ominous signs and the inevitable happened. Neither did they do well in I-League nor are they doing anything notable in AFC Cup.         
	De Ridder has cited two reasons for his teams failure. First, the fatigue due to the travelling for AFC Cup matches. Second, lack of quality replacements. But one cant ignore the fact that his boys have put up some shoddy performances of late.         
	A lot will depend on how the Ghanaian duo of Yusif Yakubu and Abel Hammond play. They will be up against a decent side, which has won the countrys premier league 12 times (Kuwaiti Premier League). They have also played in the quarter finals of the AFC Champions League in 2008. Al Qadsia are coached by Mohammed Ibrahem, who is a former player of the club, and also the coach of the national team. They are the reigning national champions. Their key player is Ibrahima Keita of Ivory Coast.

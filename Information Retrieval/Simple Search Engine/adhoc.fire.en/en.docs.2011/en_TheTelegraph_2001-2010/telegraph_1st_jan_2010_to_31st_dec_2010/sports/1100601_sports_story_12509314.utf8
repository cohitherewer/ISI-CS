The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB coachs contract wont be renewed
                                                                                                                       7                                      EB coachs contract wont be renewed
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The East Bengal executive committee has decided not to renew Phillippe de Ridders contract for the upcoming season, a top club source, said on Monday. The officials, who met at the club tent, deliberated for around three hours before it was decided that the time was up for the Belgian.         
	As of now, British coach David Booth is the club managements top choice for the hot seat. Under Booth, the disbanded Mahindra United finished fourth in the recently-concluded I-League.         
	According to the source, the club has entrusted football secretary Santosh Bhattacharya to contact Booth and find out whether the venerable coach is interested in taking up the assignment.         
	The official version, though, was that the club was yet to decide on De Ridders future.         
	The source said that other than Bhattacharya, the man who brought the Belgian after the October 25 debacle, De Ridder didnt have too many backers.         
	The football secretary was the lone supporter of De Ridder but gauging the mood of the other members, he gave in. The committee asked him to e-mail Booth at the earliest (by Tuesday). We will have to think of the financial aspect also, the source said.         
	In case Booth demands something unreasonable then we have to look for an Indian coach. Also the fact that Booth is an AFC A licence holder makes our job easier.         
	This year, the AFC rules will be very stringent and we cant have any slip-up regarding the norms, he further added.         
	The source also revealed that the A licence is just an excuse to remove the Belgian.         
	The main reason is our teams poor performance under him. We played badly and the team never showed any character, he said.         
	For the record, East Bengal did win the Federation Cup under De Ridder, but finished ninth in the I-League and third in the Calcutta Football League.

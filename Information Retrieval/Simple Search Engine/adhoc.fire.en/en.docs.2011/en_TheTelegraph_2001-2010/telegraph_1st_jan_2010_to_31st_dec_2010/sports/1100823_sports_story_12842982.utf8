The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer ends title drought
                                                                                                                       7                                        Federer ends title drought
  - Cincinnati Masters Bhupathi and partner Mirnyi storm into final             Roger Federer                           
	Mason: World No. 2 Roger Federer comfortably beat Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 6-4, 6-3 on Saturday to set up a meeting with American Mardy Fish in the final of the Cincinnati Masters. Federer had had an easy route to the last four after a bye, a retirement and a walkover allowed him into the last eight without a full set of tennis.               
	Roger Federer ended a seven-month title drought with a 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 win over Mardy Fish in the final on Sunday. Federer captured his 63rd title in his 90th final and the victory was his fourth at Cincinnati               
	But the Swiss, the defending champion and a finalist in Toronto last week, looked in good form, playing with the ease and flow for which he is noted, and at the perfect time in his preparation for the US Open.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and Belarussian partner Max Mirnyi reached their third ATP World Tour final of the year together, beating fifth seeds Lukasz Kubot and Oliver Marach in straight sets here. The fourth seeded pair defeated the Polish-Austrian duo of Kubot and Marach 6-3, 6-4 in the semi-finals. In the final, they face second-seeded American twins Bob and Mike Bryan, who clocked a 7-6(8), 7-5 win over Wesley Moodie and Dick Norman.         
	The Indo-Belarussian pair saved four of the five break points they faced and broke serve three times from eight opportunities as they wrapped up victory in 73 minutes.         
	They are through to the Cincinnati final for the second time after finishing runners-up to James Blake and Todd Martin in 2002.         
	Bhupathi and Mirnyi, currently ninth in the 2010 ATP Doubles Team Rankings, are looking to win their first team title since Rome in 2004, having lost in the finals of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments in Miami and Monte Carlo earlier this year.         
	The Bryans, who will go to number one in the ATP Team Rankings on Monday, have a 46-9 match record on the season and they are coming off their 63rd career title last Sunday in Toronto. The Bryans are appearing in their fifth straight final in Cincinnati, winning last year and reaching the final from 2006-08.         
	I didnt get broken, so that was a first in this Northern American tour for me. It came at the right time, Federer told reporters. I thought I played a good match. I was able to mix up my serve well and always kept him off balance. So it kind of worked for me.         
	Federer has met Fish six times, with the American winning just once, in their most recent meeting in Indian Wells in 2008.         
	Fish had been on the verge of defeat against Roddick before a short rain-break offered him a glimmer of hope. The game had been tight in the first set until a 40 minute rain-break disrupted proceedings.         
	With Fish about to serve to stay in the match, rain returned, albeit only for 10 minutes, but once again the stoppage had an impact when they resumed.         
	Fish held serve then broke Roddick and pushed the set to a tiebreak which he won in style against a floundering opponent. A visibly riled Roddick never regained his composure and there was only ever one winner in the third set as Fish cruised to a 6-1 victory.

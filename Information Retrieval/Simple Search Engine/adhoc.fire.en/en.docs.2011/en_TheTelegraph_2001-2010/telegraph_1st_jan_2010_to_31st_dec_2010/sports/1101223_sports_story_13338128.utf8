The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An all-round show is on Chawlas mind
                                                                                                                       7                                        An all-round show is on Chawlas mind
                  Piyush Chawla                     
	New Delhi: Making a comeback into the Indian team after spending nearly two years in wilderness, Uttar Pradesh leg-spinner Piyush Chawla is keen to make the most of the opportunity and wants to cement his place as an all-rounder in the national side.         
	Chawla has been picked for the five ODIs and a Twenty20 game against South Africa, beginning January 9.         
	The spinner lost his place in the Indian one-day team in 2008, his last international being against Pakistan in Karachi.         
	I know the all-rounders spot in the Indian team is vacant. However, my first job is to take wickets. The selectors have shown faith in my bowling for my performance during the Ranji season I want to make this opportunity count, Chawla said.         
	If I bat at No. 7 or 8 and score quick 30-40 runs for the team, then it will be like a bonus for my side and I am preparing myself for that, he added.         
	Chawla said that the ODI series in South Africa is a good opportunity to test his skills before the 2011 World Cup in the sub-continent.         
	He is placed second in UPs list of top run-getters with 305 runs in six matches, including a maiden century in Ranji Trophy. He has so far taken 14 wickets in six matches at an average of 44.07 this season.         
	I did well in the tour game against Australia and the Irani Trophy. I may not have got many overs to bowl in Ranji, but did a good job with the ball. Also, I scored some runs for Uttar Pradesh, he said.         
	Chawla is in the list of 30 probables for the World Cup, announced recently by the national selectors.         
	The Aligarh-born cricketer, who first made it to the Test squad against England, at Mohali in 2006, said he is confident of his success on bowler-friendly South African pitches.         
	Its a great opportunity for me. I will do my best if given the chance. My preparation is good and I am looking forward to contribute with both bat and bowl during the series, he added.

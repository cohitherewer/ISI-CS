            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/London: Jolted by the match-fixing scandal that has tarnished the image of the game, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is planning a technology-oriented review of its anti-corruption measures.         
	The ICC could bring in British intelligence agency MI6-style code-breakers in a bid to root out corruption in the game, The News of the World reported.         
	Quoting ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat, the newspaper said the governing bodys officials have spent the past three weeks locked in discussions with their own Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), along with national boards and players unions.         
	One of the authorities biggest headaches is restricting players communicating information from within the dressing room to unscrupulous third parties. Tracking that data is also becoming more difficult.         
	With fixers becoming increasingly sophisticated, ACSU bosses intend to recruit specialist code breakers to decipher the most complicated communications, the report stated.         
	ACSU chief Ronnie Flanagan said the ICC will have to be technologically updated to track down corrupting influences on the game.         
	The British government, meanwhile, is planning to institute a new intelligence unit to capture international gangsters and corrupt sportspersons.         
	In his analysis on sports betting, Liverpools former chief executive Rick Parry has recommended that a specialised unit be formed to tackle illegal activities in all sports.         
	Match-fixing is a cancer that destroys the integrity of sport and we are determined to do whatever we can to stamp this out, Minister for Sport and the Olympics Hugh Robertson said.         
	The British government will also get in touch with Indian authorities to work out modalities for international co-operation.         
	Robertson has written to the Indian sports minister M S Gill to put the topic high on the agenda at the meeting of Commonwealth Sports Ministers at next months Commonwealth Games in Delhi.         
	He is also planning to meet the International Cricket Council president Sharad Pawar at the Games to discuss the issue.

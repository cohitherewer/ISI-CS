	Christchurch: Defending champions India continued their rampaging form and hammered Hong Kong by nine wickets in their rain-truncated second Group A match of the ICC under-19 World Cup here Sunday.         
	Opting to bowl in the 34-overs-a-side match, India first skittled out Hong Kong for 143 before getting to the target with 10 overs to spare.         
	Indian openers Mayank Agarwal (63) and Rahul Kannaur (62 not out) hit twin half-centuries to fashion their second successive win.         
	Man of the Match pacer Sandeep Sharma ripped through Hong Kongs top order with his miserly seven overs during which he scalped three wickets for just 11 runs. Poor running between the wickets also proved to be Hong Kongs bane as they lost three of their batsmen to run-outs.         
	Hong Kong started disastrously after India captain Ashok Menaria had put them in, losing opener Alex Smith when he was run out by Mandeep Singh.         
	Wickets continued to tumble thereafter and Hong Kong were reeling at 19 for four by the ninth over of the match. Sandeep used the overhead conditions effectively, getting a number of deliveries to fizz past the outside edge of the rival bats.         
	Hong Kong made a brief comeback with a strong fifth wicket partnership of 54 between Mark Chapman and Jamie Atkinson.

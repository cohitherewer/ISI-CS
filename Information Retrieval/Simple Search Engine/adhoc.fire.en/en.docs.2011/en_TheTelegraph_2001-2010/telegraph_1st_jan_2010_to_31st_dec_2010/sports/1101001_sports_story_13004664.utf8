	Jaipur: Ousted from the national team, Yuvraj Singh would launch his desperate comeback bid when he leads defending champions Rest of India against Ranji Trophy winners Mumbai, in the Irani Cup at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, here, Friday.         
	The match would be a perfect stage for talented youngsters, fringe players and Yuvraj, who is desperately trying to stage a comeback, to get back his Team India berth.         
	Ranji champions Mumbai would try and win the Irani Cup after a gap of 12 years.         
	Subramaniam Badrinath and Saurabh Tiwary will be keen to establish their credentials in the longer form of the game while Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Manish Pandey have enough experience to steer the Rest of India batting.         
	Lower down the order, all rounder Ravindra Jadeja, spinner Piyush Chawla and wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel are no novice with the bat.         
	Rest of India includes medium pacers R. Vinay Kumar and Abhimanyu Mithun, who were impressive in the Indian Premier league.(PTI)

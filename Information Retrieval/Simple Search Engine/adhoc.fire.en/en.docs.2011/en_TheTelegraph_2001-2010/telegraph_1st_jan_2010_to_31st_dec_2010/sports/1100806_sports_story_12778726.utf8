The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 275 will be good target: Malinga
                                                                                                                       7                                      275 will be good target: Malinga
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Lasith Malinga told the reporters during a press conference that 275 will be a good enough target for the Indians in the fourth innings on a track that is offering turn for spinners.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On successfully handling short-pitched stuff         
	I try to bowl as many wicket-taking balls as possible. If I think I can get a wicket with a bouncer, I will bowl that delivery. I do what I am capable of. On that occasion (Dhonis dismissal), I thought bowling short would be effective thats why I bowled. The best thing to do against Indian batsmen is to bowl short. Thats why I used the short bowl more than usual.         
	On completing 100 Test wickets         
	I have always been keen to get wickets in Test matches. I was injured for nearly three months and was out of action. Before that I had taken 92 wickets from 28 Test matches. I have completed 100 wickets in 30 Tests and I am extremely happy with my effort. I am the third bowler in Lankan cricket history to take 100 Test wickets. (after Murali and Vaas).         
	If he has cut down on pace         
	I am trying to bowl as fast as I can but the wicket is getting slower. There are times when due to the state of the wicket, the speed lessens after pitching. I dont deliberately bowl slow. Normally, when a bowler comes back from an injury, he plays a few first class matches before playing in a Test match. I played in ODIs and T20s but I was confident that I could survive the rigours of a Test match. That is why I played in Galle and got wickets. But because, I was playing Test cricket after a long time, it became strenuous.         
	Expectations from Lankan batsmen in 2nd innings         
	We have batsmen capable of playing according to the situation and score runs even on tricky pitches. I stiIl think if we can bat the whole of fourth day, we can set a target and put India under pressure. Suraj (Randiv) and Ajantha (Mendis) are getting the ball to turn and be effective on a turning wicket. They can pose challenge to the Indian batsmen. I think this will turn out to be an interesting contest on the final day. A score of 275 could be a challenging target for India.         
	Advice from his coach Champaka Ramanayake         
	Champaka has been coaching me from my younger days. He told me to stick to basics. If I do that, then I can be as asset to the team.         
	Lack of support from the other end         
	When I get support from the other end, my bowling is more effective. But unfortunately, Chanaka Welegedara didnt have a good game. That doesnt mean, he is a bad bowler. He can always come back and get wickets in the second innings.

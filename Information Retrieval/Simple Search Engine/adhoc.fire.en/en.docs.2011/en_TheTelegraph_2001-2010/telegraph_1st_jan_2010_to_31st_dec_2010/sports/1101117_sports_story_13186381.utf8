	Doha: Looking to put their World Cup blues behind them, Brazil and bitter South American rivals Argentina play an eagerly anticipated friendly in the Gulf which also heralds the return of playmaker Ronaldinho in a yellow shirt.         
	Wednesdays match will be a key test for Brazil coach Mano Menezes and Argentinas Sergio Batista as they gear up for the Copa America in July 2011, which Argentina will host.         
	Since the World Cup, both teams have shown impressive form with Brazil easily beating the United States, Iran and Ukraine while Argentina have beaten Ireland, Spain and Japan.         
	Brazil won their last clash 3-1 in Rosario in World Cup qualifying. Argentina havent beaten Brazil since 2005.         
	It will be Batistas first match since taking permanent charge of the team, but he was without injured players Esteban Cambiasso and Fernando Gago. He will, however, have Lionel Messi. The Barcelona forward said in an interview on Fifas website this week that he was looking forward to the friendly because he has yet to beat Brazil in a senior international.         
	Itll be special thanks to the team were playing and also the fact Ill come face to face with Ronaldinho, a person Ive got great affection for, Messi said. To me, hes truly like a brother and someone who, along with Deco, helped me so much when I was starting out at Barca. I care about them a lot and always wish them the best.         
	Do you know what? Ive never beaten Brazil with Argentinas senior side, including that defeat in the Copa America final in Venezuela (in 2007). I think its about time I broke my duck.         
	Ronaldinho, for his part, said he was just happy to be back in the national side. The 30-year-old AC Milan midfielder played in the 2002 and 2006 World Cups but missed out this year.         
	Ronaldinho hasnt played for Brazil since a World Cup qualifier against Peru in 2009.         
	The Selecao jersey is my second skin, quot; Ronaldinho said in a Italian newspaper.         
	I hope to play in and win the next Copa America. I would also like to play in the London Olympics. I dont look at my ID card (for age), I look at my enthusiasm. (agencies)

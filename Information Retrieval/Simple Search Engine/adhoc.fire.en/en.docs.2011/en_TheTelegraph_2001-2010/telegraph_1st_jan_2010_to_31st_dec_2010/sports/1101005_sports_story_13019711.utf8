The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj piles   on agony   for Mumbai
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yuvraj piles   on agony   for Mumbai
                    Yuvraj Singh                                  
	Jaipur: Out of the Indian Test team, Yuvraj Singh Monday hit an unbeaten double century, showing signs of regaining form, as Rest of India set an improbable target of 782 runs for Mumbai to win on the penultimate day of the Irani Trophy match here.         
	Mumbai were at 79 for no loss, with opener Sushant Marathe retiring hurt after injuring his finger, when stumps were drawn on the fourth day at Sawai Man Singh Stadium.         
	Rest captain Yuvraj, who looked in sublime touch during his unbeaten innings of 204, hit 10 exquisite boundaries and clobbered five sixes.         
	Resuming the day at individual score of 10 and team total of 45 for one, the stylish left-hander did not make any mistakes and reached the 200 mark with a boundary at mid-wicket.         
	Abhinav Mukund (63) and S. Badrinath (61) ably supported Yuvraj.         
	The Rest captain was in such an authority that he plundered over 190 runs in just two sessions, with Rest of India declaring at 387 for three at tea.         
	This left Mumbai, which already suffered a 394 runs deficit in the first innings, to chase a victory target of 782 runs. The teams cause was not helped by listless performance of their bowlers, with Ramesh Powar being the most successful with two scalps.         
	The 39-time Ranji champions suffered a blow when Marathe injured his finger and had to retire hurt. Wasim Jaffer (46) and Ajinkya Rahane (21), who were at the crease at the draw of stumps, will have to bat sensibly.

	Mysore: Bowled out for a modest 233 in the first essay, Mumbai came out all guns blazing as they skittled out Karnataka for a paltry 130 in their first innings on the dramatic second day of the Ranji Trophy final at the Gangotri Glades here Tuesday.         
	However, having conceded a 103-run lead, Karnataka seamers hit back to have the Mumbaikars in a tizzy at 51 for five.         
	Abhishek Nayar (batting 32) and Daval Kulkarni (batting 35) pulled the visitors out of woods, posting 57 runs for unbroken sixth-wicket. At draw of stumps, Mumbai were 108 for five, leading by 211 runs, with five wickets remaining.         
	As many as 14 wickets tumbled in the absorbing contest between bat and ball, with Avishkar Salvi, who produced his seasons best figures of 5 for 31, and Abhimanyu Mithun producing outstanding spell in the second innings.         
	Mithuns second innings burst (four for 30) saw him share the honour of being the seasons highest wicket-taker with R Vinay Kumar. Both have bagged 44 wickets each.         
	Vinay Kumar and Dhawal Kulkrani were never short of effort and strived to get wickets with every delivery they whirled at the frazzled batters.         
	Resuming at their overnight 15 for one, Karnataka lost wickets in a heap as an accurate Salvi and Kulkarni (two for 52) produced wicket to wicket spells.         
	Salvi used the overcast conditions to good effect as he swung the ball both ways creating trouble for the in-form Karnataka batsmen. The likes of Manish Pandey found it difficult to cope with Salvis swing. Only KB Pawan made a hung on grimly for around 116 minutes and scratched around to score 33. The youngster played some crunchy cover drives before being superbly gobbled up by Romesh Powar off Salvi at mid-off.         
	Batting a second time round, Mumbai lost Wasim Jaffer (8), Ajinkya Rahane (4), Omkar Khanvilkar (0) quickly to an inspired Mithun with barely 18 runs on board. Karnataka were back in the reckoning when Suhil Kukreja was caught at short-leg by Ganesh Sathish off Vinay Kumar, and Vinayak Sawant fell to short ball off Mithun.         
	But Nayar and Kulkarni put the brakes on Karnatakas resurgence. With fortunes swinging like a pendulum, the title could be wrested by the team which shows more resolves and applies itself to the task on the morrow. At this moment though, Mumbai are clearly ahead of Karnataka.           (PTI)

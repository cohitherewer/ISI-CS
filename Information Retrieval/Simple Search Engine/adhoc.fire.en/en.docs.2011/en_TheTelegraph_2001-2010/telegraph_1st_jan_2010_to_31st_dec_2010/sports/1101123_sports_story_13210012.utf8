The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swann scoffs at Doharty call-up 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Swann scoffs at Doharty call-up 
                      
	Brisbane: England spinner Graeme Swann has questioned the selection of his uncapped Australian opposite Xavier Doherty for the first Ashes Test, adding a new edge to pre-match sparring four days ahead of the opener.         
	Left-armer Doherty is likely to make his Test debut at Brisbane, on Thursday, after winning selection in Australias first Test squad at the expense of Nathan Hauritz.         
	The 28-year-old Tasmania has only 84 first class wickets at an average of 48, but Australias selectors believe his orthodox left-armers, turning away from right-handers, might trouble Englands batsmen more than Hauritz.         
	Swann batted back that theory, on Monday, saying Englands Kevin Pietersen could destroy left-arm spinners and England was unconcerned by the Australian gamble.         
	Theres a new guy going to come in who I dont know anything about, Swann said. We obviously had planned for playing against Hauritz. Its not a concern for us because weve seen Kev (Pietersen) destroy left-arm spinners.         
	Any batsman can get out to any bowler any time. I know it doesnt worry Kevin and it doesnt worry the rest of us, he added. (Agencies)

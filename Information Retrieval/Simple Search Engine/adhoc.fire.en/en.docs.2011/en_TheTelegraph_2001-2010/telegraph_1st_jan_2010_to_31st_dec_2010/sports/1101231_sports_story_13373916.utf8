            OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES            Umpire Steve Davis                           
	Calcutta/Johannesburg: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has rubbished reports that Cricket South Africa (CSA) had lodged a complaint against umpire Steve Davis.         
	An Afrikaans daily claimed that the home cricketers would lodge a complaint after they spotted umpire Davis drunk on the eve of Durban Test. Davis had controversially ruled AB de Villiers out in the hosts second innings.         
	When contacted by The Telegraph, both the ICC and CSA squashed the report.         
	No allegations have been made The CSA hasnt told the ICC anything. Its all nonsense, Colin Gibson, ICCs head of media and communications, said.         
	Michael Owen-Smith, CSAs media officer, confirmed that no complaint had been lodged with the ICC.         
	According to the report, the Proteas reportedly saw the 58-year-old umpire in a drunken condition at the hotel where both teams and match officials had stayed during the Durban Test.         
	Sources in the Proteas camp, on condition of anonymity, said that Davis was regularly seen in a particular bar over the past week. They said he was also seen stumbling into the Sandton Hotel in the early hours of the morning during the first Test in Centurion last week.         
	Davis, along with his Pakistani colleague, Asad Rauf, committed quite a few umpiring blunders during the second Test, with lbw decisions involving de Villiers and Mark Boucher being the most important ones.         
	Television replays showed that both decisions were wrong.

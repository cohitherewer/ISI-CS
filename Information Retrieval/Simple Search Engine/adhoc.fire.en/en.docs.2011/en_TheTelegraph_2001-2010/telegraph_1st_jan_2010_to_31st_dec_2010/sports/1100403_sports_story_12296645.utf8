The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes, Dlouhy in title round
                                                                                                                       7                                        Paes, Dlouhy in title round
                  Tiger Woods wife Elin and son Charlie during the Miami Open, on Friday                     
	Miami: Kim Clijsters won a dramatic semi-final battle of the Belgians against Justin Henin to reach the final of the Sony Ericsson Open on Thursday.         
	The 6-2, 6-7, 7-6 victory means Clijsters will play for a 37th career title on Saturday against Venus Williams, who earlier cruised to a 6-3, 6-4 win over Frances Marion Bartoli.         
	Meanwhile, Leander Paes and partner Lukas Dlouhy breezed past Spaniards Nicolas Almagro and Tommy Robredo to storm into the doubles final here.         
	Paes and Dlouhy, winners of French Open and US Open last year, needed just 42 minutes to score a 6-3, 6-0 victory over the Spaniards, dropping just nine points in the second set.         
	Meanwhile, fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi came through a close battle with French duo Arnaud Clement and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 6-7(5), 10-4 in one hour and 38 minutes to reach the semi-finals, where they play Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski.         
	If Bhupathi and Mirnyi win their semis match, they will meet Paes and Dlouhy in the final.         
	Clijsters dominated the opening set of her encounter with Henin but then, having been 3-0 up in the second, lost out in a tie-break to allow the game into a decisive third set.         
	Neither of the two former world No.1s, who have both made comebacks to the game, dominated on serve and Clijsters produced a double fault when serving for the match.         
	In the mens singles, Czech Tomas Berdych fought back from a set down to beat Spains Fernando Verdasco 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 and earn a place in the semi-finals.         
	Berdych struggled in the opening set but came out on top in the tiebreak in the second and produced an aggressive display in the deciding third set. (Agencies)

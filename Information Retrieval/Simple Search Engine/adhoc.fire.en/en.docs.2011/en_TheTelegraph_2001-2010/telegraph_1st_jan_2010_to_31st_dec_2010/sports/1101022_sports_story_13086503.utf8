The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal have the edge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bengal have the edge
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Buoyed by their morale-boosting victory over Assam in their first match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament, Bengal will aim to continue their good work when they take on Jharkhand, in Cuttack, on Friday.         
	Bengals bowling, led by Ashok Dinda and Shami Ahmed, had an impressive outing against Assam bowling them out for a paltry 99.         
	Jharkhands meek surrender to Tripura, on Thursday, as they folded for 96, makes Bengal the favourites for the match.         
	The Manoj Tiwary-led sides batting too looked sharp in the last match as they notched up the winning runs losing just two wickets.         
	A lot will again depend on the openers  Sreevats Goswami and Arindam Das  to provide the middle-order with a platform to launch later.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Mumbai: Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble Friday said his team would not be overawed by Mumbai Indians knack this season of posting 200-plus totals when the two sides meet in the Indian Premier League on Saturday.         
	The T20 format is such that the bowlers have a big challenge to defend even 200-plus totals. The batsmen go after the bowlers and even 215 or 218 may not be enough, Kumble said after his teams match-eve practice session.         
	Mumbai Indians vice-captain Zaheer Khan echoed his former teammates thoughts.         
	Some teams have chased big totals and some have defended small totals. Its too early to predict what total would be the safest, the hosts pace spearhead said.         
	Zaheer said his teams biggest positive from the two wins so far was the performance of young guns Saurabh Tiwary and Ambati Rayudu.         
	The young brigade is the key for us. We are happy to see Saurabh and Rayudu perform the way they have done so far. They are match winners, Zaheer said.         
	And Abhishek Nayar has yet to play. R. Sathish is another player to watch out for. He is a finisher.         
	Kumble, too, took pride in his teams performance.         
	Our batsmen were exceptional against Kings XI Punjab and our bowlers were exceptional against the Rajasthan Royals. To restrict Royals to a score of 90 in Thursdays game was an exceptional performance. It was a perfect bowling performance from our team, he said.         
	Weve won two games at home and now want to win Saturdays away game too.

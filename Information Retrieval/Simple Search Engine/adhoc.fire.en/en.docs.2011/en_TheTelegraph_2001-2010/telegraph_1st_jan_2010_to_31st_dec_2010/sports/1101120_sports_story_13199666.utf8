The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Van Jaarsveld suspension lifted by CSA
                                                                                                                       7                                      Van Jaarsveld suspension lifted by CSA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport (SAIDS) have decided to lift the provisional suspension on Nashua Dolphins player Vaughn van Jaarsveld.         
	The suspension arose from an adverse analytical finding (AAF) on a sample collected during a domestic game.         
	A three-person tribunal will hear Van Jaarsvelds case in Durban next week to determine whether this constitutes an anti-doping rule violation and the consequences thereof, if any, said the CSA in a media release on Friday.         
	The AAF was for Sibutramine, a weight loss product which was prescribed to Vaughn by a specialist physician, clarified SAIDS chairman Dr. Shuaib Manjra.         
	Vaughn declared the product on the doping control form prior to his test and has produced a prescription from the doctor in his defence. The doctor in question has acknowledged fault in that he prescribed the drug after checking an outdated list of prohibited substances.

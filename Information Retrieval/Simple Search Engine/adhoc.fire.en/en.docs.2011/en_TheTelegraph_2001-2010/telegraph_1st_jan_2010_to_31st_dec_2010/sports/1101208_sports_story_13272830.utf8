  - Champions League Mourinho-less Real look to stay undefeated             Arsenal players during a training session, in London, on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	London: Arsenal are in danger of becoming the highest-profile casualty of the Champions League group stage but manager Arsene Wenger has guaranteed his stuttering team will not stumble at the final hurdle.         
	The English side have lost their last two matches in Group H  away to Shakhtar Donetsk and Braga  to leave the pool wide open heading into the final round of matches on Wednesday.         
	Shakhtar, who are on top with 12 points, are three clear of Arsenal and Braga, and both qualifying places are still up for grabs.         
	A win for Arsenal against already-eliminated Partizan Belgrade, who are at the bottom and without a point so far, will secure their passage through to the last 16 for the 11th successive year. Anything less could see the Gunners eliminated.         
	That will be a massive game for us, said Wenger, whose side went top of the English Premier League at the weekend. We know that we will be under pressure to deliver on the night but we will. Im confident we will deliver the required performance and the qualification.         
	Braga visit Shakhtar in the other match and there will need to be a dramatic turn of events if the Portuguese team are to qualify.         
	If Arsenal win as expected and Braga also beat Shakhtar, all three sides would be level on 12 points. It would then boil down to goal difference in games between them.         
	In that scenario, free-scoring Arsenal would go through and Braga would need to win in Ukraine by at least a four-goal margin to also advance.         
	No team in Champions League history has ever failed to qualify after picking up 12 points in the group stage.         
	Elsewhere, Real Madrid, who are without coach Jose Mourinho, will look to knock Auxerre out of European play with a victory in their group closer on Wednesday.         
	Madrid have already clinched the top spot in Group G and are joined in the knockout stages by second-placed AC Milan.         
	Auxerre trail Ajax by one point for the third place, which offers direct passage into the Europa League.         
	Auxerre will advance only if Ajax lose and they manage to at least draw at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, where Madrid have won all 10 games played over all competitions.         
	Mourinho is serving a one-game ban for deliberately instructing players to incur red cards in a victory at Ajax.         
	On the field, Madrid are without Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos to suspension, while striker Gonzalo Higuain is out with a back complaint. Cristiano Ronaldo  who leads Madrid with three goals  is within a booking of being banned for the Spanish clubs first knockout-stage game.         
	A fifth victory would allow Madrid to close unbeaten in their best-ever finish in the current Champions League group format.         
	Meanwhile, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba will try not to let his heart rule his head when he makes his eagerly awaited comeback at the Stade Velodrome for Wednesdays clash against Olympique Marseille. The Ivory Coast international again leads the line for the Londoners who have decided to rest his attacking partner Nicolas Anelka and left back Ashley Cole.         
	Drogba spent only one season in Marseille but made an unforgettable impact as he helped the club to the Uefa Cup final in 2004 and quickly became the darling of the fans.         
	He joined Chelsea in the same year but said later he had wanted to stay at Marseille for the remainder of his career.         
	I am a bit overwhelmed by all this but its okay, Drogba told Marseilles website on Tuesday. I try not to mix everything but I am so overwhelmed by so many emotions I dont really know how to deal with this situation. It feels funny. It is the first time I have been in this kind of situation.         
	Drogba has not been at his best recently, scoring only two goals for his club from open play since August.         
	Marseille and Chelsea have already qualified for the Champions League knockout stage. (Agencies)

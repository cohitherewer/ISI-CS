The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena turns on the heat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Serena turns on the heat
            NYT NEWS SERVICE AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Paris: She should no longer be a mystery at this point, but even after all these years and all those championships, it can still be difficult to figure out Serena Williams.         
	Despite all her Grand Slam championships, Serena adds intrigue to any tournament she plays because tennis often seems like just another way to fill her schedule until the major tournaments come around.         
	That adds an element of surprise wherever she goes. After winning the Australian Open in January, Serena did not play a match again until this month, saying she was resting a sore left knee.         
	During her time away, she travelled to Kenya to open a school in her name and took courses to become a nail technician.         
	I was injured, and then I was twiddling my thumbs at home, Serena, 28, said last week. I had nothing to do. I was just working out and just trying to get better. I was bored, and thats how I got into nail school.         
	Serena has become a busy tweeter, too, and many of her observations have little to do with tennis.         
	Omg! There is a condom dispenser on the streets of paris?? she posted a few days ago. Am I being nave to be shocked??? Wowzers.         
	Nothing should surprise those who have followed Serenas career. Eight years after winning her lone French Open  the only major title that she has not won at least three times  Serena is the No. 1-ranked player and the top seed at Roland Garros.         
	Yet she may not be the favourite. After all, she has not advanced past the quarter finals at Roland Garros since 2003  a match best remembered for a dust-up with the eventual champion, Justine Henin, over whether Henin had raised her hand to call for time as Serena missed a serve. The chair judge did not see it, and Serena fumed  and lost.         
	Still, no player on the womens side can match Serena when she is healthy and motivated. Even now, it is hard to tell if she is both, or either.         
	Serena, who declared herself fully healthy before the tournament began, struggled to wriggle past Switzerlands Stefanie Voegele on a hot afternoon at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday.         
	For a time, Voegele, ranked 76th, matched Serenas big serves and powerful forehands and the occasional overhead smash, and there was a buzz over whether Serena would be the first big-name player to tumble from the tournament.         
	Voegele pushed Serena to a first-set tiebreak. Along the way, the taut back-and-forth occasionally elicited the type of emotional fist pumps and screams that the American unleashes when provoked.         
	Serena surged to score seven of nine points to capture the set. Having found her footing, and perhaps having broken Voegeles spirit, Serena cruised to a 7-6 (2), 6-2 victory.         
	Most other upset hopes on Monday evaporated in the heat. Roger Federer, the mens No. 1 seed, coolly handled the Australian Peter Luczak, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.         
	Its always important coming back as defending champion, trying to get off to a good start, he said. It was like a perfect match to get off the French Open campaign.         
	With warm temperatures on a second successive cloudless day in Paris, Federer lost his cool for only a moment. Speaking to the chair umpire in French and wagging his index finger, he disputed a line call on a Luczak serve, then waved his arms in disgust as he walked back to the baseline.         
	On one point Federer started behind the baseline, sprinted to chase down a drop shot near the net post, slid into his forehand and flicked it from ankle level crosscourt for a winner.         
	Andy Murray was nearly the first major casualty in the mens draw. The British player had to rally from two sets down for the fourth time in his career to beat Richard Gasquet 4-6, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2, 6-1.         
	Third-seeded Novak Djokovic took an extra set to dispense the Russian Evgeny Korolev. The womens third seed, Caroline Wozniacki, breezed to a 6-0, 6-3 victory over Alla Kudryavtseva.         
	Venus, the French Opens second seed, won her first-round match on Sunday and watched Serena in the stands with other family members. The last time the two were the top two seeds at a Grand Slam event was at the 2003 Australian Open.         
	The legacies of the Williams sisters are still unfolding, but they are the dominant female players of the centurys first decade.         
	On paper, because Venus Williamss seven Grand Slam victories do not include wins at either the French or Australian Opens, Serena Williams may be the more accomplished one. Yet, eight years after her only win at Roland Garros, she may be as much a mystery as ever.

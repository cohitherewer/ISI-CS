	 Spain           
	With wins in each of their ten games, La Roja were the European Zones second top-scorers with 28 goals and conceded no more than a miserly five at the other end. Maturity, resilience and the ability to overcome adversity were the qualtities much in evidence during their campaign, and few national teams in world football are blessed with squads of such depth and sheer talent. The question merely is how much they really want it?  
	Road to South Africa         
	Ticket to South Africa was assured with two rounds to spare after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Estonia. Spain capped a flawless campaign with victory in Armenia and a 5-2 rout of Bosnia-Herzegovina.         
	Coach         
	Vicente del Bosque has continued predecessor Luis Aragoness faith in the one-touch style that has characterised Spains play and which relies upon midfielders of the highest quality.               
	Star player         
	Midfield string-puller Xavi Hernandezs inch-perfect passing and vision is vital to the teams fluid style and the Barcelona man appears to be at the top of his game right now.         
	Record         
	Spain have taken part in 12 and have not missed a single edition since failing to reach Germany 1974.         
	XAVI HERNANDEZ         
	Date of birth: January 25, 1980         
	Height: 5 ft 7 in         
	Position: Midfielder         
	Club: Barcelona         
	Goals: 8         
	First Int: Vs The Netherlands in 2000               
	Switzerland           
	Switzerland will be appearing at the finals for the ninth time when the World Cup gets underway in South Africa, where coach Ottmar Hitzfeld and his men are aiming for more than just a supporting role. The Swiss boast a healthy blend of youth and experience, combining talented younger players such as Eren Derdiyok, Tranquillo Barnetta and keeper Diego Benaglio with seasoned campaigners like Alexander Frei and Blaise NKufo.  
	Road to South Africa         
	A 3-0 victory in Luxembourg and a goalless draw with Israel in Basel sealed top spot in European Group 2 and confirmed a place in South Africa for Frei and Co.         
	Coach         
	Ottmar Hitzfeld is one of Europes most highly regarded and successful coaches. He is one of only two men to guide two different clubs to Champions League glory (Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich).                 
	Star player         
	Alexander Frei is the undisputed chief on and off the field. The Basel striker, the countrys all-time highest goalscorer, was Hitzfelds natural choice as national team captain.         
	Record         
	In South Africa, Switzerland will be appearing at the World Cup for the ninth time. The Swiss reached the quarter finals in 1934, 1938 and 1954.         
	ALEXANDER FREI         
	Date of birth: July 15, 1979         
	Height: 5 ft 10+1/2 in         
	Position: Striker         
	Club: FC Basel         
	Goals: 40         
	First Int: Vs Yugoslavia in 2001               
	 Honduras           
	Honduras reached the finals of the World Cup for only the second time in their history in dramatic fashion, an equaliser in the dying seconds of USAs clash with Costa Rica triggering frantic celebrations from Los Catrachos fans thousands of miles further south. Yet despite having squeezed into the finals, coach Reinaldo Ruedas talented team will not be going to South Africa just to make up the numbers.  
	Road to South Africa         
	A run which included wins over El Salvador, Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago gave Los Catrachos the opportunity to clinch their passage to South Africa in the penultimate round of qualifying against the US.         
	Coach         
	After taking the job in early 2007, Reinaldo Ruedas professionalism struck a chord with the powers that be in Honduran football. Rueda repaid that faith by guiding his adopted country to South Africa 2010.                 
	Star player         
	 Los Catrachos key man in qualifying was 36-year-old forward Carlos Pavon. In typically clinical fashion, it was the well-travelled goalgetter who fired in the winner in El Salvador to ensure their place at the World Cup.         
	Record         
	Honduras return to global footballs top table after 28 years away. Their only previous appearance at the finals came in 82.         
	CARLOS PAVON         
	Date of birth: October 9, 1973         
	Height: 5 ft 10 in         
	Position: Striker         
	Club: Real Espana         
	Goals: 57         
	First Int: Vs USA in 1993                 
	Chile    
	Chiles recent renaissance has been capped by a return to the World Cup after a 12-year absence. In the wilderness since France 1998, when Marcelo Salas and Ivan Zamorano showcased their consummate finishing skills, Chile believe they have the resources to repeat that feat and advance beyond the group phase. Coached by Argentinian Marcelo Bielsa, the Chileans qualified with some ease, atoning for their failure to do so in 02 and 06.  
	Road to South Africa         
	Chile finished second in the continental qualifying group, just one point behind Brazil. In total, the team won 16 of their 33 points away from home, an impressive statistic that underlines the resolve of the team.         
	Coach         
	Marcelo Bielsa was the man in charge of Argentinas ill-fated bid for glory in 2002. But the man nicknamed El Loco (The Madman) has a shot at redemption after engineering Chiles unlikely revival.                 
	Star player         
	The experienced Humberto Suazo is a lethal finisher with a killer instinct. He scored ten times in qualifying and the team anxiously wait on the Zaragoza striker as he recovers from a hamstring injury that might see him miss a couple of matches.         
	Record         
	Chile will be taking part in the World Cup for the eighth time in 2010. Their best show was in 1962 when they hosted the tournament, finishing third.         
	HUMBERTO SUAZO         
	Date of birth: May 10, 1981         
	Height: 5 ft 7+1/2 in         
	Position: Striker         
	Club: Real Zaragoza         
	Goals: 18         
	First Int: Vs Cyprus in 2006

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | FA chief quits in protest 
                                                                                                                       7                                      FA chief quits in protest 
            Paul Kelso                      
	Zurich: In an extraordinary step, acting Football Association chairman Roger Burden stood down in protest at the first-round rejection of Englands bid, claiming he wanted nothing more to do with them [Fifa].         
	Burdens disgust at Fifas decision was echoed by England 2018 chief executive Andy Anson, who repeated his assertion that the bid had been deceived by executive committee members and said England was unlikely to host the World Cup in his lifetime unless Fifas processes changed.         
	The bid team returned home on Friday nursing a deep sense of injustice after they polled just two votes despite Fifas report judging them to be the best technical and most commercially sound bid.         
	The distaste at the decision was heightened by the choice of Qatar to host the 2022 tournament, which has fundamentally undermined the credibility of Fifas decision-making in the eyes of many.         
	Right now dont bother (bidding) until you know that the process is going to change to allow bids like ours (a chance) to win, Anson said. They have to take a look at their processes....         
	Asked if England would host the tournament in the foreseeable future, Anson said: Not unless the process changes dramatically. I think the next one will be in Antarctica, in heated stadiums. That was a reference to Qatars plans to defy the desert heat with air-conditioned arenas.         
	The backlash strengthened as details emerged of the numerous broken promises that left England eliminated in the first round with just two out of 22 votes on Thursday.         
	It also emerged that Fifa president Sepp Blatter had warned executive committee meetings about the evils of the British media shortly before they voted, an intervention seen as a deliberate attempt to damage the bid.         
	This paper understands that four senior Fifa officials promised England prime minister David Cameron or Prince William in person that they would support Englands bid only to renege on the commitments when it came to the vote. A fifth member gave personal commitments to Englands executive committee member, Geoff Thompson, but also let him down.         
	The perceived betrayal outraged Burden, who said that he could not consider taking on the FA chairmans role if it meant he had to work with people he could not trust.         
	Im concerned about the way Fifa have conducted themselves, Burden said. An important part of the FA job is to liaise with Fifa, and I want nothing more to do with them. Its not the way Im used to doing business, making promises to the future king of England and the Prime Minister and not keeping their word.         
	In his letter to the FA board Burden wrote: I am not prepared to deal with people whom I cannot trust and I have withdrawn my candidacy.         
	Burdens withdrawal comes with the FA under increased pressure to reform in the wake of defeat. The government is pushing for a credible independent chairman and was suspicious of the apparent coronation of Burden. His honourable withdrawal will be privately welcomed.         
	David Dein, the 2018 bids international president, is an obvious candidate despite the bids failure. The former Arsenal vice-chairman worked tirelessly for, and helped improve, its international profile, though it was not reflected in the final vote.

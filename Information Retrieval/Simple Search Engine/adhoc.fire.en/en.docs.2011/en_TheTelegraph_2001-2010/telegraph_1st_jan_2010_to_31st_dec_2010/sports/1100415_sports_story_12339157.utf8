The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods is set for US Open 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods is set for US Open 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Tiger Woods has taken the first step toward playing the US Open by sending in his entry form.         
	The US Golf Association (USGA) said it received Woods entry on Monday, one day after he tied for fourth in the Augusta Masters. It was his first competition in five months since revelations surfaced about his string of extra-marital affairs.         
	Even players such as Woods who are exempt from qualifying for the US Open must apply to play. The deadline to enter is April 28.         
	The US Open will be held from June 17-20 at Pebble Beach, where 10 years ago Woods won by 15 shots and tied the tournament scoring record.         
	Also present will be Tom Watson, who has been granted exemption from qualification to compete in his fourth US Open at Pebble Beach, where he won the title in 1982.         
	I am deeply grateful to the USGA for extending me the invitation to play in the US Open at one of my favourite golf courses in the world, said Watson, who last competed in the meet seven years ago.         
	Watson has won eight major championships and came agonisingly close to adding a ninth when he finished runner-up at last years Open. He finished joint 18th at the Masters.

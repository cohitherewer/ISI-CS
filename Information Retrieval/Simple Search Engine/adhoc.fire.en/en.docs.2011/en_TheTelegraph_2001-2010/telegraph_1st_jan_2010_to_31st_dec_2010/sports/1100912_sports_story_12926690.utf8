The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fergie spares Rooney the taunts

  - Wayne left out as United manager feared lsquo;terrible abuse rsquo; at Goodison Park
                  Wayne Rooney                     
	London: Wayne Rooney missed Manchester Uniteds 3-3 draw at former club Everton on Saturday because manager Alex Ferguson feared fans would abuse the striker who is facing an alleged sex scandal.         
	Rooney has faced lurid headlines since a prostitute claimed in several papers last Sunday that he cheated repeatedly on his then-pregnant wife Coleen with her last year.         
	The Rooneys, who married two years ago, issued a statement on Friday, which referred to many inaccurate and intrusive stories as they appealed for privacy to resolve any issues.         
	By dropping the 24-year-old Rooney from Uniteds squad on Saturday, Ferguson spared him the hostile reception he was likely to receive at Everton, the Premier League rival he left in acrimony six years ago.         
	We made the decision simply because Wayne gets terrible abuse here and were not going to subject him to it, Ferguson said. We have got a fantastic squad, so we are using it. Wayne will play against Rangers in the Champions League on Tuesday.         
	Rooney put the issue behind him last Tuesday, scoring his first goal for England in a year to help the team beat Switzerland 3-1 in a European Championship qualifier.         
	Reports said that Ferguson gave the beleaguered striker a dressing down on Friday and asked him to mend his ways. Ferguson was really upset with Rooney and told him in as many words to mend his ways, a source said. Another report claimed Rooney is living in fear that his sessions with the prostitute could have been secretly filmed for a tape that might wreck his marriage.         
	He is terrified that underworld crooks linked to the prostitute could have obtained footage. A British news channel also reported that there were animated stories of Rooneys philandering making rounds in the web world.         
	The England stars private life has been laid bare in an animated retelling of the recent newspaper related stories.         
	Dubbed Randy Rooney Scores Own Goal, the video pictures Wayne in a series of compromising positions. They also showcased his infamous encounter with an ageing prostitute as a 16-year-old, which the footballer wrote about in his autobiography.         
	The creators of the animated footage also imagine the reaction of his wife Coleen upon reading the papers, ending with Rooney being kicked out of house and home.         
	And they even take a swipe at the stars football abilities, picturing him failing to hit a barn door from 12 yards in tribute to his stunted World Cup displays. The video is the latest in a long line of visually realised stories by an online news site based in Taiwan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Renault to pay Piquets damages 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Renault to pay Piquets damages 
                      
	London: Renault have agreed to pay what they call substantial damages to former driver Nelson Piquet Jr and his father over allegations they lied when they accused the Formula One team of orchestrating a crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.         
	After they dropped Piquet last year, Renault claimed the pair made up the story of a deliberate crash to blackmail the British-based team into keeping the driver.         
	The allegations surrounding the crash that allowed Fernando Alonso to win the race turned out to be true, with Renault managing director Flavio Briatore and executive director of engineering Pat Symonds both banned from F1.         
	Piquet Jr and his father, three-time F1 world champion Nelson Piquet, to pursue a libel case through Britains High Court to get an apology.         
	These serious allegations contained in the press release were wholly untrue and unfounded, and we withdraw them unequivocally, Renault said in a statement.         
	We would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Piquet Jr and his father for the distress and embarrassment caused as a result. As a mark of the sincerity of our apology and regret, we have agreed to pay them a substantial amount of damages for libel as well as their costs, and have undertaken not to repeat these allegations at any time in the future.         
	The Piquets lawyer, Dominic Crossley, said both men had been treated appallingly by Renault. Crossley said in a statement that the apology was the start rather than the end of the long journey they are both taking to correct many of the wrongs that took place during last years crashgate scandal.         
	FIA banned Briatore from motor sports in September 2009 for allegedly ordering Piquet Jr to crash his car to help his teammate.         
	In a deposition given to FIA investigators in exchange for his immunity, Piquet Jr. said Briatore and Symonds ordered him to crash where it would take the most time to clear the damaged car and result in the longest possible delay.         
	The deployment of the safety car caused the field to bunch, wiping out the leaders advantage over Alonso, who went on to win.         
	Renault escaped severe punishment from FIA, receiving only a suspended ban from F1. The F1 governing body is appealing this years ruling by a French court to overturn Briatores lifetime suspension.         
	Unable to secure a F1 drive after the controversy, Piquet Jr. switched to the Nascar-Camping World Truck Series. He finished No. 46 on the money list this year with $62,600. Piquet Jr said he was on the verge of finalising a deal for a full season next year and made clear Formula One was in the past.         
	I am just a bit realistic, he said. F1 is F1. You dont just go in when you want to. It didnt work out and Im not going to keep begging and putting in money to drive.

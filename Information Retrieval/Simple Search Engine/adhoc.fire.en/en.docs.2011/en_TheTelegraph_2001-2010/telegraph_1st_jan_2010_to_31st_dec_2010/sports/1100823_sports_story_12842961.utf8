The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina confident ahead of Paris test
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina confident ahead of Paris test

	Paris: Saina Nehwal will carry a billion hopes when she takes the court in the World badminton Championship but the ace shuttler remains quietly confident about her chances in the event which gets underway here, Monday.         
	Saina, presently ranked No. 2 in the world, has got a bye in the first round and will take on Hsiao Huan Chen of Chinese Taipei in the second round on Tuesday in the womens singles.         
	In the mens singles, Chetan Anand, who has just recovered from a knee injury, and P. Kashyap will try to bring honours to India.         
	While the 14th-seeded Chetan will face Ong Zhao Ashton Chen of Singapore, Kashyap will be up against Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk of Thailand in the first round.         
	Overall, it is a very good draw for India. Aditi and Kashyap have got challenging draws but rest of the players such as Saina, Chetan and the mixed doubles pair of Jwala and Diju have got decent draws, national coach Pullela Gopichand said.         
	Kashyap has been playing well. But the last two tournaments, he didnt do that well. However, that is not much of a concern. Chetan has not played that much in the last month and it would be a good opportunity for him to start on a good note. Jwala and Diju have played against all these players who are there in their half, so they should do well, he added.         
	Asked about Saina, who has to battle past three Wangs from China  Wang Shixin, Wang Xin and top seed Yihan Wang to win the title, Gopichand said the 20-year-old was at her best at the moment.         
	Saina is in the bottom half of the draw and there are players whom shes never met before. However, she is in her best form so should do well. She has to perform on court to win this tournament, Gopichand said.         
	A title triumph will also pave the way to the numero uno status in world rankings but Saina said she was only focussing on the matches here and not rankings.         
	I am no longer scared of the Chinese players. I have put on a lot of hard work with Gopi sir. I just want to concentrate on the game and not worry about the title, Saina said.         
	In the womens singles, Aditi Mutatkar will play 10th-seeded Japanese Eriko Hirose in the first round, while the 15th-seeded duo of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas will face off against Nigerians Ola Fagbemi and Jinkan Ifraimu in the mens doubles.         
	The ninth seeded pair of Jwala and Diju will face the English duo of Chris Adcock and Gabrielle White in the first round, while 16th seeds Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa will clash against Samantha Barning and Eefje Muskens of the Netherlands.

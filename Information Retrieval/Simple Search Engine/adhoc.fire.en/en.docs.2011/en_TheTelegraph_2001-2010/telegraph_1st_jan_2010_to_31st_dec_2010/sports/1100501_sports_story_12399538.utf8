The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jyoti, Shiv have poor 1st round
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jyoti, Shiv have poor 1st round
                      
	Seville: Indian golfers Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur turned in over-par cards to make disappointing starts at the European Tours Open De Espana here.         
	While Randhawa carded a one-over 73, Kapur was even worse at five-over 77.         
	Randhawas round comprised three birdies against four bogeys.         
	Kapur, on the other hand, endured a torrid day as he stumbled to four bogeys and a couple of double bogeys against three birdies at the Real Club de Golf de Sevilla.         
	Both of them will have to raise their game considerably to remain in the hunt for weekend action.         
	At the top of the heap, Argentine Ricardo Gonzalez set a hot early morning pace with a 7-under 65 which his rivals failed to overtake throughout the rest of the opening day on Thursday.         
	Paul Waring of England was a stroke behind and the only golfer within two shots of Gonzalez.         
	Spain has been good for Gonzalez as the 40-year-old Argentine has achieved half of his four European Tour career victories in the country. He also already has a taste for the Real Club de Golf de Seville having won the Seville Open in 2004. On Thursday, he produced eight birdies and only one bogey on a course fringed with penal rough.         
	Gonzalezs nearest rival Waring, the former English Amateur champion from Liverpool, scored a 6-under 66 despite having his travel arrangement to Spain badly disrupted by volcanic ash plane delays.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anti-doping code from August 1
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anti-doping code from August 1
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has come out with its anti-doping code, to be effective from August 1, with modified whereabouts requirements. The original clause stipulated by the Wada had met with disagreement, mainly because of the opposition from the BCCI.         
	The ICC said in a statement Friday that it has concluded whereabouts rules to support out-of-competition testing with all the member cricket Boards agreeing to them. The rules establish a two-tier approach to whereabouts filing with players who would be tested falling under two main pools: the International Registered Testing Pool (IRTP) and the National Player Pool (NPP).         
	Players who are known offenders or who may be of higher risk will be in IRTP. Players in NPP, which will comprise 88 internationals (11 from each of top-eight ODI teams according to ICC rankings), will need to submit cricket whereabouts information rather than that of their personal whereabouts.         
	After lengthy discussions with the member cricket Boards, the ICC came out an Anti-Doping Rule in its Singapore annual conference early this month. The ICC whereabouts rules will strengthen our out-of-competition testing programme as we strive to ensure that cricket remains drug-free. We now have a tough and practical set of rules that will support our zero-tolerance approach to doping in our great sport, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said.         
	We know this is a complex area for players and administrators and I wish to thank all our members for their willingness to find a workable solution, Lorgat said.

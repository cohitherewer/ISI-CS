	The old warhorses, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, saved India from humiliation in the recently concluded Indo-Russian Davis Cup tie held in Moscow, when they annihilated the Russian pair of Igor Kunitsyn and Teimuraz Gabashvili in straight sets in the doubles.         
	The 32 Russian victory in the tie sounds close, but Indias second win was notched up by a rampant Rohan Bopanna against Gabashvili in a truncated best of three-set encounter, when the Russians had already won the tie.         
	The pull out due to injury of the 38th ranked Igor Andreev just before the first match raised Indian hopes as he was replaced by the lowest ranked Russian  Kunitsyn (102). Somdev Dev Varman, the lone Indian hope in singles, seemed to be right on track in the opening match but folded up to lose in 4 sets. Somdevs tactics baffled me.         
	Kunitsyns errors were coming from his forehand, which had become shaky. But instead of peppering the forehand, Somdev started playing more to the Russians steadier backhand and this, I believe, cost him the match. Thereafter, the writing was on the wall. Mikhail Youzhny smoothly and easily demolished the blustering firepower of Bopanna.         
	On the third and final day, one was hoping for a good show from Somdev. Even the grim-faced Indian non-playing captain SP Misra announced that he would consider putting in Paes for the fifth rubber if Somdev could pull off a victory against Youzhny in the fourth match! But Youzhny, in a stunning display, ruthlessly exposed the gulf that exists between Somdev and players of top-10 calibre. .         
	The successful use of the drop shot exposed two short-comings in Somdevs game. Firstly standing too far behind the baseline to play his ground shots and secondly not keeping a good enough length on his shots. It is not possible to do an effective drop shot of a deep shot. Even if you can do it, the extra distance the ball travels, gives the opponent enough time to run it down.         
	Even though Somdev lost both his singles, he seems to have improved over the past few months. With consistency, well-grooved ground shots, strong physical condition, Somdev has the foundations of a good player. But, more is needed if he is to climb higher in the rankings. More power and depth in his ground shots and service need to be added by getting physically stronger. Also, by adjustments to his technique. For instance, I noticed that Somdev does not arch his back while serving  this could add more speed to his service.         
	Somdevs second serve was demolished by Youzhny. There is an old saying that a player is as good as his second serve. Somdevs was pathetic. At 25 he still has many years of tennis ahead of him. With his dedication I am sure that he will grind his way to higher rankings and anchor the Indian Davis Cup team for many years to come.         
	There are a limited number of youngsters who can measure up to Davis Cup standards in the current tennis scenario. The Indian tennis system has not been able to produce players of reasonable international calibre.         
	The big names and the greats of the past have come by family-promoted efforts and sacrifice. This is no longer possible from middle class families .         
	The rich very seldom have the resolve, sacrifice and perseverance required to reach the top.         
	In short, the solution lies in a lucrative Indian circuit, perhaps with limited foreign participation. This will attract youngsters from middle class families, help develop their talents and relieve parents of financial strain. If this doesnt happen, there will never be an abundance of available talent for the Indian Davis Cup team.

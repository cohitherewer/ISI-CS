            A STAFF REPORTER            Dipendu Biswas and Musibau Adebayo on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Thursday rode on their luck to win against Southern Samity in a CFL Premier Division match. Syed Nayeemuddins boys ended the day on a winning note after Southern Samity players were denied by horizontal at least four times.         
	Mohammedan Sportings 2-1 win was courtesy a 93rd minute strike by Nigerian recruit Misibau Adebayo.         
	Though Nayeemuddin said, fortune favours the brave on Thursday, his team did not deserve to win.         
	His counterpart I.M. Vijayan can only curse his luck as he saw Francis Xavier failing to nod the ball home in an open goal. Prior to that, Xaviers shot went way over the bar when he had Mohammedan Sporting custodian Manash Barua at his mercy.         
	The black and white brigade started off on a positive note when veteran striker Dipendu Biswas stabbed home from close range from a Hatchibuddin Mondal flag-kick.         
	Southern could have equalised in the 19th minute but their captain Marcos Perreiras header hit the cross bar.         
	The Brazilian made amends in the 31st minute with his trademark free-kick that found the back of the net with goalkeeper Manash failing to move an inch from his position.         
	In the 69th minute, Southerns Adebayo Adewusis free-kick hit the horizontal and Franciss header off the rebound also hit the cross-piece.         
	In the very next minute, Marcoss shot was intercepted properly as Manash came out of his charge.         
	Southerns saga of misses continued when the fateful crossbar again denied them a winner in the 89th minute. This time it was Marcos free-kick that hit the bar.         
	Against the run of play, it was Musibau who scored the winner as Kartick Kisku essayed a splitting through pass. Musibau entered the box and slotted home with a left-footed placement.

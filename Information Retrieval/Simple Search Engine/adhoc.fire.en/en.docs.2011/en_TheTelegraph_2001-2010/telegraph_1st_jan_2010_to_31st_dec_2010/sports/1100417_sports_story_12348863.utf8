	Monte Carlo: Juan Carlos Ferrero had high hopes of advancing into the semi-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters but instead smacked into an impenetrable brick wall named Rafael Nadal on Friday.         
	Nadals shock fourth round defeat at last years French Open was long forgotten as the claycourt master, four-times a winner at Roland Garros, powered past his fellow Spaniard 6-4, 6-2.         
	In the other part of the draw, top seed Novak Djokovic scored an impressive 6-2, 6-3 win over Argentine David Nalbandian. Ferrero, who had won 17 of his 18 matches on the slow surface this season, tried to attack Nadals backhand. Nadal in turn reacted by stifling Ferrero.         
	The second seed, looking for a record sixth win in Monte Carlo but a first ATP title in 11 months, will next face compatriot David Ferrer, a 7-5, 7-6 winner over German Philipp Kohlschreiber.

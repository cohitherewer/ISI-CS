The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ take on Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                      NZ take on Pakistan
                      
	Bridgetown: Perennial dark-horses New Zealand would be up against unpredictable defending champions Pakistan in a must-win Super Eight Group E match Saturday as the race for the semi-finals heats up at the World Twenty20 here.         
	Both the teams are coming off losses in their opening Super Eight matches, and would be desperate to bring their campaign back on track. While New Zealand were handed the first defeat of the tournament by South Africa, Pakistan were upstaged by England.         
	Both the teams are grappling with identical problems. The batting line-ups of both are brittle and rely too much on a few power-hitters, who cannot be expected to deliver in every game.         
	Here to defend their crown with a new-look team after some prominent names were banned for indiscipline, Pakistan have lived up to their reputation of being consistently inconsistent.         
	En route to the Super Eight, they beat minnows Bangladesh but lost to Australia after that. Before the start of the tournament, they were stunned by Zimbabwe in a practice match. Pakistans batting has not been too impressive barring Salman Butt, and to some extent, Umar Akmal.

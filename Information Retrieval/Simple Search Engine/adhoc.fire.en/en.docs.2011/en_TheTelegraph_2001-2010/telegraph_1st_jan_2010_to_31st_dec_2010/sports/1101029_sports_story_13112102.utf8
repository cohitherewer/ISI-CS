                                                                                                                       7                                      A Thai treat on Tigers mind 
                      
	Bangkok: Tiger Woods says hes looking forward to giving something back to Thailand when he makes a quick visit to his mothers home country for the first time in 10 years to play a one-day skins tournament next month.         
	The November 8 event is part of celebrations to mark King Bhumibol Adulyadejs 60th year on the Thai throne. The last time I played in Thailand was in 2000. I am really looking forward to coming back and hopefully win it all! Woods said in a statement released, on Thursday, by the organisers.         
	The 14-time major winner is without a tournament victory this year after being out for nearly four months in the wake of the infidelity scandal that caused a marriage break up and marred his image. The Thai people never fail to impress me with their warm and genuine hospitality. This is indeed a good opportunity to give something back to them, Woods said.         
	Paul Casey of England, Camilo Villegas of Colombia and Thailands top player, Thongchai Jaidee, will also compete for total prize money of $300,000. All players have agreed to donate their prize money to charity projects overseen by the king, organisers said.         
	Woods stay in Bangkok will last about 24 hours. He flies into the Thai capital the night before the tournament, after competing in the HSBC Champions in Shanghai.         
	He will make an early morning visit to pay respect to the ailing 82-year-old King Bhumibol, who has been admitted at a Bangkok hospital for more than a year, by signing a get well book at the hospital along with Thongchai, organisers added. He will then meet Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva before proceeding to the Amata Spring Country Club in Chonburi, a seaside province southeast of Bangkok, for the tournament.         
	All golfers will wear pink golf shirts, a sign of respect for the king that symbolises wishes for good health. Woods is scheduled to leave Thailand later that night for Australia to compete in the November 11 to 14 Australian Masters in Melbourne.         
	Woods first played in Thailand in 1997, when he won the Asian Honda Classic.         
	An American whose mother is Thai, Woods last played in Thailand in 2000, winning the Johnnie Walker Classic. He also won the inaugural event in 1998. (Agencies)

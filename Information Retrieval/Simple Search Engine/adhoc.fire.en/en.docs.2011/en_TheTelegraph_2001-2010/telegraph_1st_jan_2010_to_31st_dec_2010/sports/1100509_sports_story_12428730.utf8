	Bridgetown: Kevin Pietersen smashed 53 off 33 balls to lift England to 168 for 7 off 20 overs against South Africa in the World Twenty20 Super Eight match at Kensington Oval on Saturday.         
	The tall right-hander cracked eight fours and one six to anchor the innings. He shared a second-wicket stand of 94 with fellow South Africa-born batsman, Craig Kieswetter, who scored 41 off 42 deliveries.         
	England lost Michael Lumb for 3 after winning the toss. The left-hander was leg before to Johan Bothas quicker ball in the first over.         
	But South Africa wasted a few chances to make further inroads and Kieswetter and Pietersen took advantage.         
	Kieswetter was caught off a Morne Morkel no-ball on 8 and Pietersen, then 12, edged between wicketkeeper Mark Boucher and first slip Jacques Kallis in the same over.         
	Kieswetter was also dropped on 29 by JP Duminy at deep midwicket off Botha.           (AGENCIES)

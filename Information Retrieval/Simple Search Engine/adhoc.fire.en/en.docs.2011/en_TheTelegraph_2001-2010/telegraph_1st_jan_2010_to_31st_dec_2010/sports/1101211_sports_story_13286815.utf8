The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy with my Cup preparations: Yuvi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Happy with my Cup preparations: Yuvi
            A CORRESPONDENT              Team India players and support staff with the trophy, after thrashing New Zealand by eight wickets, in the fifth and final one-day International, in Chennai, on Friday. India won the ODI series 5-0. (PTI)                            
	Chennai: Indias eight-wicket win Friday completed a 5-0 rout of New Zealand and the whitewash not only projects a resurgent India, but a team set on the right course before next years World Cup. Stand-in skipper Gautam Gambhir smashed two consecutive centuries in the one-day series and the likes of Virat Kohli and Yusuf Pathan bolstered chances for a World Cup call with resounding hundreds.         
	Yuvraj Singh produced a brilliant all-round performance and Ravichandran Ashwin earned praise for his economical bowling. Gambhir, who earned the Man of the Series award for scoring most runs (329 runs) in the series, hailed Indias overall performance at the post-match presentation ceremony.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Gautam Gambhir (MoS): It was an absolutely professional performance today. As I said at the toss, its an international game and were up to it. It was fantastic to see the bowlers performing so well in the fifth match when we had sealed the series 4-0. I think the credit goes to the entire bunch of boys  they have been pretty professional, always looking forward and were excited to play for the country... The way it started to turn in the first over, I thought the spinners would do their job. All the spinners, especially Ashwin, Yuvi and Yusuf did a fantastic job and a lot of credit goes to the fast bowlers as well. Praveen Kumar and Ashish Nehra were brilliant and, overall, it was a great effort from the bowlers in the series. Ashwin, for sure, was most impressive. He is a quality bowler even as we saw in the IPL. If you have an off-spinner, who can bowl well in the Power Plays and the slog overs, he can be an asset for the team. We are a young side and everyone was excited to play this series So, it was an overall effort. I always felt the players have the talent and they showed enough quality to finish the series 5-0.         
	I think we need to improve our fielding. If we compare ourselves to New Zealand, they were far more brilliant on the field. If we can improve as a fielding unit, we will be strong contenders for the World Cup as we have a very potent batting and bowling line-up.         
	The South Africa series is a great challenge for me. I have never been to South Africa and this will be my first Test series there. Hopefully, I can continue the same momentum there. But its going to be a different ball game. Hope I can deliver it for the country.         
	Daniel Vettori: It was an incredibly difficult wicket... We always knew with the dew its going to be tough, but we failed to put up a decent score and defend it... But India played really well and they have played well in the entire series. They have been outstanding and we have been beaten in all departments.         
	Yuvraj Singh (MoM): Thank God, he gave me a very good birthday gift (December 12)... I am happy with the performance. We have been working hard for the past six-eight months, so its coming good now. The ball was turning and gripping and everything happened on the wicket. The early wickets didnt let them (New Zealand) have a partnership, and that was the key. I have played three Ranji Trophy games this year and that has helped me a lot. I am very happy with my preparations for the World Cup and winning this series 5-0 will give the entire team a huge lift. The boys are raring to go and, hopefully by the World Cup, Ill be super fit.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Football Association (IFA) has been slapped with a Rs 75,000 fine by the disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for their failure to provide adequate security during I-League matches.         
	There were incidents of stone throwing and other security problems in at least five matches in Calcutta, Barasat and Howrah, said an AIFF official.         
	The disciplinary committee had no other option but to fine IFA.         
	Crowd trouble in another match, involving Sporting Clube de Goa in Goa, prompted the committee to impose a fine of Rs 2 lakh on the club and Rs 50,000 on the Goa Football Association (GFA).         
	Churchill Brothers goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya and JCT defender Daljit Singh have been fined Rs 25,000 each for unsporting behaviour.         
	Curiously enough, the committee has let off with a warning Churchill patron Churchill Alemao who had severely criticised the standard of refereeing in India.

	New Delhi: After four postponements in the last 10 months, the much-awaited elections to Hockey India (HI) are set to take place in the capital on Thursday.         
	Elections will be held this time, said HI secretary Narendra Batra, who, has teamed up with Vidya Stokes as they contest the posts of secretary and president, respectively. Running against Stokes is former India captain Pargat Singh, a candidate believed to have the sports ministrys backing. The Supreme Court has permitted HI to go ahead with the elections but restrained it from implementing the results.

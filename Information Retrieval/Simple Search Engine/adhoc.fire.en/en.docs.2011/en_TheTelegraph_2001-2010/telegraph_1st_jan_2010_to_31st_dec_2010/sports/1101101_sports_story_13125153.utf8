                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak duos appeals rejected
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Dubai: Michael Beloff, chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) code of conduct commission, Sunday dismissed the appeals of Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer against their suspensions for alleged spot-fixing.         
	The world governing body of the game had suspended the Pakistan trio  Butt, Aamer and Mohammed Asif  last month when a British tabloid claimed that they were involved in spot-fixing.         
	However, Asif, who had also challenged the suspension, had later withdrawn his appeal. The chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct Commission, Michael Beloff, QC, has heard in Dubai the challenge by two Pakistan players  Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer  against the provisional suspensions imposed on September 2, under the ICC Anti-Corruption Code.         
	After considering all the evidence, Mr Beloff has rejected both challenges. As such, the players remain provisionally suspended from all cricket pending the outcome of the independent anti-corruption tribunal which will hear their disciplinary cases in due course, the ICC said in a statement, on Sunday. As he chose not to challenge his provisional suspension, Mohammed Asif also remains provisionally suspended, the statement added.         
	Beloff, however, refused clarify whether the Pakistan players were guilty.         
	It was not up to me to decide whether they committed any crime The commission will establish their guilt and if they are found guilty and then they will be given punishment as per the ICC code of conduct, he said.         
	The Pakistan duo were accompanied by their lawyers  Butt by Khalid R Anjha, a former law minister, and former Pakistan player Aftab Gul, while Aamer was with Shahid Karim. Gul, described the hearing as fair but said he was disappointed with the outcome.         
	Ranjha, Butts other lawyer, said that their concern now was to get the case heard at a tribunal, adding that the allegations published by the tabloid were rubbish.         
	None of the players spoke about the hearing before leaving the ICC headquarters. But asked if he would play cricket again, Butt responded: Yes, definitely.

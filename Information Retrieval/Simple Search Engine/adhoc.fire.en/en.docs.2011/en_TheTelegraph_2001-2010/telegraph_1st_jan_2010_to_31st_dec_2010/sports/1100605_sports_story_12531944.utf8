The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stanley high on hope
                                                                                                                       7                                      Stanley high on hope
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan unveiled new chief coach Stanley Rozario at their club tent on Friday. The former East Bengal and Lajong coach waxed eloquent about the club, its history and its legacy, going to the extent of describing Bagan as my favourite club since childhood.         
	While the media interaction was predictable, what received little attention was the list of the 34 footballers for the coming season that is easily one of the weakest Bagan squads of recent times.         
	Outside the big-name stars like Jose Ramirez Barreto, Edeh Chidi and prize catch Subair Murithala Ali, it was evident that the Bagan officials have failed to make any significant inroads in the inter-club transfer market.         
	Apart from the five players poached from Chirag United, the Bagan squad distinctly lacks quality in midfield and defence. Rozario, though, was looking only at the positives.         
	I am very satisfied with the squad. Its good that the squad has 20 Bengali footballers. The supporters are able to connect more with local footballers and they are able to gel quickly as a cohesive unit, Rozario said.         
	Rozario went on the defensive the moment the uncomfortable question about Lajongs relegation from the top flight cropped up. Look, it was an entirely new team. Save Daniel Bidemi, none of the boys had an iota of idea about the level of competition in the I-League.         
	About the pressures of being a Bagan coach, Rozario said: My aim has always been to coach a team that has quality players and big stars. I know my job well. The training starts on July 17. As we train for some time, I will get to know them better and it will help us in our aim of earning laurels for this club.         
	The squad         
	Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukherjee, Shilton Paul, Pralay Dutta, Sudipta Banerjee; Defenders: Surkumar Singh, Sheikh Azim, Sagram Mandi, Karan Atwal, Kingshuk Debnath, Rahul Kumar, Asian Quota (yet to be announced), Habibur Rahman, Biswajit Saha, Parminder Singh, R. Dhanarajan, Najimuddin Mullick; Midfield: Ishfaq Ahmed (captain), Rakesh Masih, Snehasish Chakraborty, Manish Mathani, Souvik Chakraborty, Dipendu Dowary, Jayanta Sen, Sheikh Jewel Raja, Gouranga Dutta, Satish Kumar Jr., Santosh Oraon, Suman Dutta, Surabuddin Mullick, Forwards: Jose Ramirez Barreto, Chidi Edeh, Subair Murithala Ali, Ashim Biswas, Jagatar Singh, Jacken Sebastian.         
	Coach: Stanley Rozario.

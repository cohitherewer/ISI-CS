The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An auction has its own dynamics: KKRs CEO
                                                                                                                       7                                        An auction has its own dynamics: KKRs CEO
  - All options are open... Its impossible for anyone to say for sure whats going to happen       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            A file picture of Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan, principal owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), has declared that he would certainly push for one-time icon Sourav Ganguly at the forthcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) auction, but his No.1 man in administration hasnt made a firm commitment.         
	All options are open... Its impossible for anyone to say for sure whats going to happen on January 8-9... An auction has its own dynamics... Ultimately, it will be a financial decision, Venky Mysore, CEO and MD, told The Telegraph.         
	For the record, KKR had the opportunity to retain Sourav, but decided against doing so, as it wouldve entailed forking out $1.8 million.         
	Asked if the fan base would take a hit in Souravs absence, Mysore countered: Over time, fans attach themselves to a team... By nature, sports franchises are going to see changes in players from time to time... Fans get connected to what a franchise stands for.         
	Mysore, who came on board recently after around 25 years in the financial services industry, pointed out that KKR had consistently been opposed to the retention bit as it didnt make financial sense for most franchises.         
	Even Gautam Gambhir, for example, has been freed by the Delhi DareDevils.         
	We consciously decided to take to the auction with a full purse ($9 million) and see how things play out... We realise it will be a very competitive environment... We cannot but have an open mind and realise that there could be surprises...         
	Clearly, a strong line-up has to be put together, how to go about it is a financial challenge... Wed like some predictability in how KKR performs... Honestly, Im confident Brand KKR is going to go from strength to strength, Mysore, who turns 52 in a few days, added.         
	For that to happen, though, KKR must deliver and, after three poor years, give its followers something to actually talk about.         
	Mysore, incidentally, played for Madras University as a No.3 batsman and an off-spinner. His skills as an all-rounder will soon be put to test in Bangalore, which hosts the auction.         
	Footnote: All businesses have ups and downs and the IPL is also going through a phase. (Any) Change provides an opportunity to strengthen the foundation of the businesses and to build a stronger structure, is what Mysore said on the IPL being caught in litigation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Resigned due to lack of time: Stokes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Resigned due to lack of time: Stokes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In a surprise move, Hockey India (HI) president Vidya Stokes resigned from her post just three months after winning a bitterly fought election against former India captain Pargat Singh.         
	Secretary general Narinder Batra will discharge the additional work of HI president till necessary arrangements are made by the executive board.         
	While Stokes, 83, a veteran Congress politician from Himachal Pradesh, said she was not in a position to take the burden of presidency, HI sources indicated that the national body, most likely, had come to an understanding with the ministry of sports over the government guidelines.         
	As per the guidelines, no person above the age of 70 is eligible to become an office bearer in national sports federations.         
	Though the HI defied it during elections, now they are falling in line to get the required recognition from the government without which it would be difficult for them to function or get funds, said an HI official, who is also a former player.         
	Another section of people in the HI, however, felt that the entire thing was a ploy to install a man of their own choice at the helm of the affairs.         
	Hockey was hijacked by a section of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials in 2008 in the name of improving its standard. Stokes resignation could only pave the way for a senior IOA official to step in as the HI chief, said a former Bhopal based India captain.         
	Though neither HI officials nor Stokes admitted there was any difference of opinion among them, contradictory statements from both the parties made it clear that not everything was right within the national association.         
	A statement from the HI said Stokes stepping down was a foregone conclusion as she had already apprised the sports minister of her intentions to quit as early as in February, when she was serving as the interim president.         
	This is as per her commitment made to the union sports minister at the inauguration of the High Altitude Synthetic Pitch at Shilaroo, Himachal Pradesh, in February this year, the statement said.         
	Stokes had said then, that she would step down as president only after the Commonwealth Games, as India was the host for the prestigious Games, the statement added.         
	Stokes vehemently contradicted the HI statement and said paucity of time was the main reason behind the resignation.         
	I am going to China for 13-14 days and then I would be going to Europe for about seven days.         
	I have been visiting my constituency regularly too, so it is not possible for me to spare so much time.         
	I must clarify that no one told me to resign, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gul claims six wickets in Pak win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gul claims six wickets in Pak win
                      
	London: Umar Gul took six wickets in a devastating display of quick bowling as Pakistan kept the one-day cricket series alive with a 23-run victory over England at the Oval on Friday.         
	Fawad Alam made 64 as Pakistan set England a seemingly unimposing total of 242 for victory.         
	The hosts began their run chase in confident fashion with opener Andrew Strauss making 57 from 54 balls, but they lost five wickets for 68 runs as Pakistan tightened the screw.         
	Eoin Morgan, in tandem with Luke Wright, steadied the England ship but Gul, who had earlier claimed the wickets of Strauss and Michael Yardy, tore through Englands lower order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahroof took it away, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahroof took it away, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said Man of the Match Fervez Mahroofs five-wicket haul, including a hattrick, changed the course of the game on Tuesday. India slumped to a seven-wicket defeat against defending champions Sri Lanka in an inconsequential match of the Asia Cup in Dambulla.               
	The following are excerpts                     Mahroof       
	Dhoni: We got off to a decent start 180-odd on the board with six wickets in hand, we were looking at 270-odd But Mahroof came on and turned it around completely. We did not have much chance after that. We have done well so far, the batsmen have got runs... Would have been nice to carry the confidence into the final, but unfortunately that did not happen. The final is in a couple of days and we have to work on the areas where we can improve. I dont think will have much of an impact on the final and dont think it will hamper our confidence Im happy with the way the youngsters have responded. The World Cup is not too far away and this will add to their experience.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (Lanka captain): Very happy with the fact that we won so well in the end. Kapugederas run out (of Dhoni) turned it around, and then Mahroofs hattrick, what can you say! We just tried a new combination today, and Im very happy with the way they have performed. We have got to do it again in the final. This win gives us confidence, but the final is a finals We have got to start from scratch. It was pretty good to chase under lights today but probably easier to bat during the day         
	Mahroof: Ive done really well through the series the hard work has paid off. To be honest, I had not planned for the hattrick. Just wanted to keep it in good areas and it worked. In Dambulla, when you hit that line and length there is always something for the bowlers. Sangakkara took a marvellous catch to give me the hattrick...

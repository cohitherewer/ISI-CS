            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Faced with an uphill task in the trials to be held on Tuesday, 2004 Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore may find himself out of the national shooting squad for the Commonwealth Games.         
	According to National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) sources, Rathore, who is not in his best form now, will have to come up with exceptional scores in the trials to make the two-member squad for the double trap event. There are only two spots available in the double trap team and the people with best scores will compete in Commonwealth, said an NRAI official.         
	Currently, Ranjan Sodhi, who twice won World cup gold medals but was not picked up for Beijing Olympics, is leading the table with an average score of 140. He is followed by Vikram Bhatnagar, who has an average score of 136. Rathores average score is around 130.         
	Sodhi and Bhatnagar have pulled themselves out of the trials and have written to NRAI to consider their average scores. Rathore will now have to shoot a score of more than 140 to be selected.

	New Delhi: Former India cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin may contest for the post of president in the elections for the Badminton Association of India (BAI) scheduled on June 13.         
	According to BAI sources, Azharuddin is likely to receive support from a section of the BAI members. These members are of the opinion that the current president, VK Verma should not continue in his position any more. Verma is already there for 12 years and a large number of members want him to vacate the post now, sources said.         
	BAI sources further claimed that Azharuddin also enjoys the support of the sports ministry in his endeavor.

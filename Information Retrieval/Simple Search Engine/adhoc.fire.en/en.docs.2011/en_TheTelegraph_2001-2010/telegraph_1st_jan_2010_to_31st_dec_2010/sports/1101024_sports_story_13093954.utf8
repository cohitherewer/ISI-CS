The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AFC begins recce
                                                                                                                       7                                      AFC begins recce
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A six-member team of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), assisted by the All India Football Federation, on Saturday, began a recce of I-League clubs beginning with Mohun Bagan, East Bengal.         
	The inspection was in accordance with the AFCs effort to professionalise club football teams and will visit all the I-League clubs in the country before submitting a report at a workshop at Football House in New Delhi on November 2.         
	They will meet representatives of every club and give them suggestions for implementing the AFC Club Licensing criteria, I-League CEO Sunanda Dhar, who along with senior manager of the I-League Sujesh Rajan, is assisting the AFC team, said. The clubs have to fulfil the criteria by December 31, failing which they will not be eligible for I-League 2011-12, Dhar said.         
	One of the criteria is that cross ownership of clubs is not allowed. But the chairman of the board of directors of the big two of the city is the same. The AFC members have not mentioned anything about it but changing the chairman of board of directors of one of the clubs is likely to solve the issue.         
	The AFC Club Licensing criteria say that a club should have a licensed coach, an owned ground or at least on lease, it has to be a corporate entity and should have a junior programme also.         
	This will open the doors of professionalism in football, Dhar hoped.         
	On Sunday, the team will visit the Salt Lake Stadium, and the Chriag United office. On Saturday, the Salt Lake Stadium lift and the air conditioner in the media centre were being repaired. So much so to impress the inspection team.         
	With Chirag the six-member team will have to go to Shyamnagar in North 24 Parganas, the club registered office, from their to Barasat, which Chirag are showing as their home ground and then to Central Park in Salt Lake the team generally practices.         
	They will also visit the Mohun Bagan ground to watch the home team take on Eastern Railway in a CFL Premier Division encounter.

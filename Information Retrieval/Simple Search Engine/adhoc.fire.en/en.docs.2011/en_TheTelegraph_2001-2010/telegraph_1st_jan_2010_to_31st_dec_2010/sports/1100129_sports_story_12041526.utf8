The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ryder to miss IPL III
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ryder to miss IPL III
                      
	Christchurch: The Royal Challengers Bangalore will miss Jesse Ryder in this years Indian Premier League (IPL) as the New Zealand all-rounder is struggling with a groin injury.         
	Ruling the burly youngster out of IPL III, general manager of New Zealand Cricket (NZC), Geoff Allott said Ryder was taking longer-than-expected time to recover, and his target was to get fit before the ICC World Twenty20 in May.         
	The board is now eyeing the World T20, in April and May, as Ryders comeback. The event in the West Indies would be his first cricket in six months.         
	Jesse is understandably disappointed about not going to India for the IPL, but he is realistic about returning too early and aggravating his groin injury, said Aaron Klee, manager of the cricketer.         
	He (Ryder) is more interested in recovering quickly and playing a full tournament in the West Indies, than risk rushing back to play IPL and jeopardising his involvement in both tournaments.         
	Asserting that Ryder would not rush a comeback and put national duty above everything else, Klee said: He had a taste of the IPL last year and he certainly wants to earn his place in the 2011 tournament.

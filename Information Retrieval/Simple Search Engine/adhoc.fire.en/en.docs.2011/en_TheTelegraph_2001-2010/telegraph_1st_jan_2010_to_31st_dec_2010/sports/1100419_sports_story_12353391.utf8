The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights on mission impossible
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights on mission impossible
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The moment Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit Irfan Pathan out of the ground, the 56th and last league match of the third edition of the Indian Premier League, between Kolkata Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians, was virtually rendered inconsequential.         
	As Dhoni murdered the bowlers with the precision of a surgeon, it was an anxious last few overs for the Knights  most of them glued to the television sets in their hotel rooms. They came out of their rooms once the match was over, glum expression saying it all.         
	The Knights campaign in this edition was as good as over even before their final match. Theoretically though, they are still in with a chance, if they can surpass the Royal Challengers Bangalores net run-rate.         
	To go past fourth-placed Royal Challengers (NRR +0.219) they must beat the Mumbai Indians by a margin of at least 175 runs, something that appears next to impossible. Neither would batting second make much difference.         
	It will now require a monumental effort from skipper Sourav Ganguly and coach Dav Whatmore to lift the sagging spirits of the players so that they can put up a spirited show and, as principal owner Shah Rukh Khan tweeted, give their fans something to cheer about.         
	For Sourav  a fiercely proud competitor who has led his team by example (461 runs from 13 matches with four half-centuries)  it is always going to be difficult to accept that they have to depend on other teams in order to qualify. It is not something that a fighter like Sourav would like.         
	As far as the match is concerned, it holds contrasting meanings for Mondays rivals. For the boys in purple and gold, the primary endeavour will be to end the tournament on a high. The Mumbai Indians have no such worries as they sit pretty on the top of the table with 20 points.         
	The only aspect they would look to focus on is the momentum, which they would want to keep going. A loss before the semi-finals would certainly upset the fantastic rhythm they are in.         
	Success, at times, comes with a dash of arrogance; if you are a Mumbai Indians player, one cannot really complain if theres a hint of arrogance in your stride.         
	May be that is the reason why skipper Sachin Tendulkar has decided against playing an inconsequential match. If sources are to be believed, even pace spearhead Zaheer Khan is not interested in featuring in Mondays tie.         
	That the Knights have failed to beat them in their previous five meetings could also be another reason why the superstars in the Mumbai side are not too interested in making the trip to Calcutta. But more than that, such is the balance in this Mumbai outfit, they can even beat the Knights comprehensively if their second string step up to the challenge.         
	So, as the Knights face the table-toppers on Monday, MI, for all practical purposes, stands for Mission Impossible.  
	The key men  Kolkata Knight Riders  Sourav Ganguly: The captain has undoubtedly been the standout performer for his side; whenever Sourav has been in supreme touch, KKR have won. Underlining the impact he has had is a piece of statistic: after him (461), the one who is the second-highest scorer for the Knights (Chris Gayle, 292) hasn rsquo;t even touched 300. He also has a tendency to do a Jonty Rhodes in the most spectacular fashion.   Chris Gayle: Although he has been a bit patchy, it is never wise to count Chris Gayle out. If KKR need to step up on the pedal in order to improve the net run-rate, the West Indies skipper rsquo;s big-hitting prowess is sure to come in handy. He also has his fast off-breaks which are a good bet in tight situations.  Shane Bond: The team rsquo;s biggest signing in IPL III, Bond would definitely like to do an encore after Saturday rsquo;s show against the Rajasthan Royals. Monday will be the last time Bond plays at the Eden this season. In front of his lsquo;home rsquo; crowds, the New Zealander would like to end with a bang.
  Mumbai Indians  Kieron Pollard: The West Indian fits the bill perfectly as a complete all-rounder. Although he is yet to get a half-century, sweet cameos of the sort he is known to essay make him a dangerous customer, just ask Gautam Gambhir. He is also quite effective with the ball and is their fourth-highest wicket-taker this season after Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Lasith Malinga.  Saurabh Tiwary: The Jharkhand skipper has been a revelation for the Mumbai Indians this season. Easily one of the biggest hitters among the new crop of Indian players, one could well find Tiwary hitting a few of those towering sixes on Monday.  Ambati Rayudu: Has played some crucial knocks in this edition, which should again give him confidence after the indifferent showing in the last two seasons. Credit should be given to this former India colts captain as he showed a lot of heart in keeping wickets despite not being a specialist in that role.    
	SRK hopes...  
	The following is the tweet posted by the Kolkata Knight Riders rsquo; principal owner Shah Rukh Khan on Sunday:  
	 ldquo;Have no idea on run rates etc but hope we can give kkr followers something to cheer about tom. Last match at home..will miss it all rdquo;

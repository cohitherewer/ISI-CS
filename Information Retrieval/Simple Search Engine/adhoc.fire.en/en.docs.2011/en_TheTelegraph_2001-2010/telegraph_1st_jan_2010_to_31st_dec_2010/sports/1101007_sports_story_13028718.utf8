The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians to face the Aussie challenge
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indians to face the Aussie challenge

	New Delhi: A winning start is always good for ones confidence but then, Thursday will be the real test. Yes, we are talking about Indias hockey match against Australia.         
	A 3-2 win against Malaysia should give India something to smile about but against Australia, everything can come to zilch. The overwhelming favourites in hockey  the Ric Charlesworth-coached Australians  have very little to worry about. It will be the Indians who will have to raise the bar if they harbour any hope of leaving the field with a beaming face.         
	We have a battle in hand. The Aussies have a very good team and we will have to play out of our skin on Thursday, said coach Jose Brasa after Indias 3-2 win over Malaysia.         
	Indias performance against Malaysia was not that impressive, particularly the flanks where Prabodh Tirkeys showing was below par. The goals that India conceded were mainly because of Tirkeys defensive frailties. If Malaysia can catch India off-guard on the break, just think of what the mighty Australians can do.         
	We have to be more compact in the defence. Otherwise we have no chance against Australia, Brasa said.         
	On Wednesday, at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, Australia were clear about their intentions as they thumped Scotland 9-0 in the Pool A match. As Australian captain Jamie Dwyer said in the mixed zone on Wednesday: We are here to win the fourth goal on the trot. And on Thursday, we have an important match against the Indians. They are very unpredictable and can punish if you relax even for a second. Every tournament that you go in, you want to win. We have had a great 22 months and we want to finish off on a good note.         
	On Tuesday, three players looked impressive in the Indian ranks. Bharat Chetri was brilliant under the bar, Sandeep Singh was confident in defence while Sardara Singh worked tirelessly up front. Others at best can be given pass marks. Rajpal Singh conceded that they have to improve on Thursday. We have to raise our game.         
	Crowd support will be one thing India can count on. On Tuesday, the vociferous crowd was enough to see Malaysia off. The drums, the bugles and banging of bucket seats made the mood electric at the National Stadium.         
	It is disappointing not to see the crowds as there are some quality teams here. But we expect a good crowd on Thursday, Charle-sworth said.         
	One V.V.S. Laxman played through pain to script a historic win over Australia. Can Rajpal Singh amp; Co. do something similar? Tall order no doubt on that.         
	Match starts: 6 p.m.

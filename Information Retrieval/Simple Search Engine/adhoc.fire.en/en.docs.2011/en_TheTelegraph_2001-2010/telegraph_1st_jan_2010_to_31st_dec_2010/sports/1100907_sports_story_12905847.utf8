The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran: Get country in order first
                                                                                                                       7                                      Imran: Get country in order first
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Perhaps, only an Imran Khan could be so forthright.         
	In the midst of relief work in the southern parts of the Punjab province, he voiced the sentiments of countless Pakistanis  if the country is in order, then our cricket, too, will be in order.         
	While cricketer-turned-politician Imran didnt name President Asif Ali Zardari, who also happens to be the Pakistan Cricket Boards patron, its obvious he had him in mind.         
	Fiercely anti-Establishment, the 57-year-old Imran didnt contest the last general elections, in protest, but remains a huge crowd-puller and continues to be idolised by the youth.         
	He speaks in the voice of the masses, raising issues which need to be addressed... Today, as a politician, hes much more mature, a confidant told The Telegraph from Lahore.         
	Imran took to politics in the summer of 1996 (four years after lifting the World Cup), when he launched the Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, and was a member of the National Assembly from 2002-2007.         
	The spot-fixing scandal involving Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer has, by the way, made Imran again highlight his favourite issues: An end to corruption and far greater accountability.

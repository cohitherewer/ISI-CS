                                                                                                                       7                                      Hitting with Andy helped: Somdev
                      
	Paris: Somdev Dev Varmans French Open adventure ended on Sunday when he lost a topsy-turvy first round match against Swiss Marco Chiudinelli.         
	First Indian to qualify in the singles main draw since Leander Paes in 1997, the Texas-based Indian lost to 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 but now he is close to breaking into the worlds top 100.         
	Having former world No 1 Andy Roddick as his practice partner certainly helps his chances. We are on different schedules but I play with Andy whenever I can, said Somdev, who grew up playing on slippery clay courts in Chennai.         
	When his tournament starts in Roland Garros. Ill probably be watching from the stands. We spent the last two off-seasons together and trained hard with him. Its fun to watch a guy whos been in Top-10 for the last eight years in running. To see what he goes through and how much work he puts in and how intense he is. He kind of leads me by example. Its great to see a guy like that go to work.         
	In the ATP rankings released Monday, Somdev gained a spot to be ranked 108.         
	Meanwhile, defending mens doubles champions Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy have been seeded third and will open their French Open campaign against Swede Johan Brunstrom and Jean Julien Rojer of Netherlands A here.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and his Belarussian partner Max Mirnyi have been seeded fifth and are pitted against Jurgen Melzer of Austria and Philipp Petzschner of Germany in their opening match.         
	Another upcoming pair, Indian Davis Cupper Rohan Bopanna and Pakistans Aisam Ul Haq Qureshi will take on Italian Fabio Fognini and American Michael Russell.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil are on right track: Bebeto
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazil are on right track: Bebeto
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: When you are sandwiched between two big-bodied security guards, even a 5ft 10 inch frame appears pint-sized. But the moment Jose Roberto Gama de Oliveira or Bebeto, as he is known worldwide, walked through the main entrance of the media and broadcast centre of Moses Mabhida stadium, there were scrambles to have a glimpse of him.         
	Bebeto, is no ordinary man. He was the star of Brazils successful World Cup campaign in 1994 where Bebeto scored three goals. With 39 goals international goals in 75 matches, Bebeto is qualified enough to talk about the coaching credentials of his one-time teammate Dunga.         
	In Durban, on Friday, to watch the Brazil play against Portugal, Bebeto supported Dungas style of coaching stating that the five-time champions are on right track in their bid to win the sixth title.         
	Ask him to predict and you would get a straight answer. Do I need to say that Brazil will win the World Cup. This is a great team and should win the Cup.         
	Nattily dressed in his designer suit, Bebeto always maintains a shyl smile.         
	Those who are talking against Dunga are not doing the right thing, he said. He understands the pulse of the team and is doing a good job. Otherwise, how could we win the Copa America and the Confederations Cup, he asked.         
	Bebeto, went to the extent of comparing the current Brazilian side with the side that won the Cup in 1994.         
	At that time, we also were together for many days before the World Cup. The current lot are an extremely hard-working unit, said Bebeto.         
	In World Cup, you need experience, he said. Luckily, this team has that quality. There are at least three players in the team  Kaka, Robinho and Luis Fabiano  who can make all the difference in the current competition, he added.         
	Everyone thought Luis Fabiano was not in his element before the World Cup. But he proved them wrong. Kaka was injured but he has come back well. Robinho has the ability to change the complexion of any match, Bebeto said confidently.         
	Like the class of 94, this team also has a good defence and midfield. That can prove to be the crucial factor, feels Bebeto. And that starts with our goalkeeper, he pointed out before being whisked away by the organisers.

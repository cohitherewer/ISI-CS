The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mueller aims to get back at Maradona 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mueller aims to get back at Maradona 
            JAYDEEP BASU                                  Mueller        
	Erasmia: Thomas Mueller has a score to settle with Argentina at Cape Town on Saturday.         
	A couple of months before the World Cup, Germany met Argentina in a friendly in Munich. At the post-match news conference, Diego Maradona walked in briskly but was made to leave when he found the young German striker sitting on the dais.         
	If he is there, then I am going, Maradona reportedly said. Mueller got up to avoid a scene and left the hall for the Argentine coach to address the media.         
	It wasnt a pleasing experience, Mueller said here on Wednesday. Beating Argentina would be a great job certainly. Who doesnt want to win against a team that has Maradona as coach and Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez as forwards?         
	The 20-year-old Bayern Munich attacker scored twice in Germanys 4-1 win over England and is hoping to add a few more to his tally.         
	Two goals in a World Cup match do not happen too often, Mueller said.         
	But now I want more. I want to score five or six goals here, may be a few of them against Argentina, he said with a laugh.         
	Mueller said he was aware it would be a tough game against the South Americans, adding that the England win was in the past now.         
	I cannot buy myself anything with what I did if we fly out in the last eight, Mueller said. Now weve got five-six days to rest and prepare for our next match, we should be able to beat them and book our place in the semi-finals.         
	Muellers teammate, Bastian Schweinstiger went into attack mode when quizzed about the German defences ability to stop Messi and Tevez.         
	I think the Argentine defence should be more bothered about us. Why dont you notice that all our players are in good form and scoring goals?         
	So much has been written on Messi. What he has done so far? He is yet to score a goal here said Schweinstiger.         
	The Argentine coach, I believe, is criticising the referees for not being able to pull up the defenders for fouling Messi. Thats unfair on the defenders. Messi keeps the ball for long periods. So, what are the defenders supposed to do? You cant ask them to stop tackling Messi, said the lanky midfielder.         
	Neither did Schweinsteiger have kind words for the team as a whole.         
	You could see their behaviour at half-time of the game against Mexico, Schweinsteiger said. When you look at their body language and gesticulation, the way they try to influence the referees, they have no respect. Its their mentality and character and well have to adjust to it.

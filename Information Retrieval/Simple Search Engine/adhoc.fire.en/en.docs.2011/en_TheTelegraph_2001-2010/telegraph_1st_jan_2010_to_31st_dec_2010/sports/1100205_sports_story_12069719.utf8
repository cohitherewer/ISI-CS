            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Thursday saw reserve wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha get tips from his India captain (as also keeper No.1), Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Dhoni spoke to me in the morning... Among other things, he pointed out that theres a big difference between domestic cricket and playing for the country at the highest level, Saha told The Telegraph.         
	He added: Dhoni talked about being mentally strong, as well... Of being prepared to handle the pressure of international cricket...         
	Saha, incidentally, was clubbed with Dhoni during the days practice. They featured in the second group.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand lets Topalov off the hook
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand lets Topalov off the hook
  - World chess championship 
  -  Advantage now with the Bulgarian after ninth game ends in a draw                                     Viswanathan Anand and Veselin Topalov, on Thursday. (AFP)        
	Sofia: World champion Viswanathan Anand missed out on a chance to score a crucial victory and had to settle for a draw against challenger Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the ninth game of the world chess championship.         
	Anand and Topalov are locked at 4.5 each with just three more encounters remaining in the 12-game rubber.         
	Anand, who blundered from a drawn position in the eighth game, came back strongly on Thursday and threatened to post his third victory in the match.         
	He got Topalov in the opening phase of the game but did not find the best manoeuvres to retain his advantage.         
	For the first time in the match, Anand allowed Topalov the Nimzo Indian defence.         
	So far, all the games had been fought in the Catalan opening and Anand had secured two victories with that, besides the two draws.         
	However, following the seventh game, when Anand played white, the pundits had been predicting another change in Anands guard since Topalov had reached a comfortable position. And that is precisely what happened.         
	Anand went for the Classical system, an opening that has been played for ages at all levels, and the players followed the book till the 17th move.         
	The Indian was the first to introduce a variation while Topalov treaded cautiously in the opening phase of the game. As a result, the Bulgarian had taken up close to 50 minutes by the time the new move was played by Anand.         
	The novelty as it tuned out was a knight retreat to which Topalov replied confidently. But only a few moves later Anand was fighting for the initiative after parting with his queen for two rooks.         
	The Bulgarian took an adventurous gamble with his queen on the queenside to get some counter play and the stage was set for a spectacular finish.         
	Anand played his 38th move confidently. But when Topalov came up with his next move, the Indian missed out on his best manoeuvre that could have caused maximum trouble to his opponent.         
	As it happened in the game, Topalov crawled back in quick time. Not only that, even after sacrificing his last remaining minor piece the local hero was in the game, thanks to his double passed pawns on the queenside.         
	The game continued for a long time thereafter even though the outcome was hardly in doubt. The longest game of the match so far was drawn after 83 moves. (PTI)

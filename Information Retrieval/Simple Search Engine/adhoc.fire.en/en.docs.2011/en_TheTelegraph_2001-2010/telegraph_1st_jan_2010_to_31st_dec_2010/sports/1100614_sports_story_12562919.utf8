The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gerrard, the only lion in Africa 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gerrard, the only lion in Africa 
            Henry Winter                      
	Rustenburg: Only one English lion looked like he belonged in Africa. Only Steven Gerrard really rose to the occasion of an opening World Cup game, scoring for England and driving the team on but too many of his team-mates faltered on the high veldt on Saturday.         
	Englands manager, Fabio Capello, has long been urged to find a way of bringing the best out of his best two players, Gerrard and Wayne Rooney, and the solution has to be the get them closer together. Even when stationed far apart, the Merseyside pair sought to find each other.         
	With Emile Heskey, barring a couple of good touches, so lacking in punch upfront, Capello could consider pushing Gerrard up against Algeria in Cape Town on Friday but the likelihood is that Peter Crouch will start.         
	Yet this showed how reliant England are on Gerrard, how Capello needs to design a better system. Gareth Barry should be fit to start and that would allow Gerrard to move up, although possibly to a left-sided station. He deserves better.         
	Gerrards focus had been unmistakable in the tunnel, the England captain ignoring his US counterpart Carlos Bocanegra, breaking his concentration only to shake hands with the passing subs with their purple Fifa bibs. In dressing-room parlance, Gerrard was so up for this. He had known the eyes of the nation were upon him, that there were those who questioned his right to be considered one of the worlds best.         
	Determined to channel all his energies into the tournament, avoiding the distractions that scarred Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, he had studiously forbidden any discussion of his future. Yet that composed finish showed why Real Madrid crave his signature, why Jose Mourinho hopes to make it third time lucky in attempting to work with Gerrard.         
	It was not simply the assured way he controlled the lay-off from Heskey, guiding the ball into a prime shooting position, that so impressed.         
	It was the intelligence of the run, the realisation that gaps were opening through the middle as the Americans struggled to regroup when Glen Johnson took a quick throw-in and Frank Lampard helped the ball on to Heskey.         
	Englands captain said he would lead by example and he was true to his word. Shortly after sliding on his knees across the pitch in celebration, Gerrard was tracking back, sliding in to nick the ball away from the flying feet of Robbie Findley.         
	On his 81st international appearance, Gerrard was everywhere, one moment putting in a thumping tackle on Clint Dempsey, the sandy soil flicking up into the air, and the next skilfully turning Jay DeMerit. He was such a force between the areas, dropping deep to make himself available for a pass from John Terry, who was under pressure and looking to offload quickly.         
	Gerrard has waited for his St-Etienne moment with England. For all Gerrards exhortations, England looked listless. The captain was even booked for foot up on Dempsey. Still he refused to hide, still he showed for the ball, creating from the deep, and urging the subdued Frank Lampard forward.         
	When Glen Johnson cut his lip, having to leave the field for some attention, Gerrard slotted in at full-back. All very team-minded, but Capello needs to construct a platform that consistently serves his captain.         
	Gerrard cannot be in two places at once. Yet he almost forced a breakthrough after 70 minutes with a sweeping cross from right to left which Rooney just failed to connect properly with.         
	Such was Gerrards enduring threat that Findley caught him nastily on the ankle with his right boot.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

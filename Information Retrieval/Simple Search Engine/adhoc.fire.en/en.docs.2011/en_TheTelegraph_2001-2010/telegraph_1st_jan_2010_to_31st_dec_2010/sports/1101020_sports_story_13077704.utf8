The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A rough ride for Bengal
                                                                                                                       7                                        A rough ride for Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: If a new coach and a new captain werent enough for Bengal, the Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) ensured that they experience a new ride on their way to practice.         
	The Bengal players, who are in Cuttack for the East Zone matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy Twenty20 tournament, rode auto-rickshaws to their practice venue on Tuesday.         
	Cricket in India, these days, is a synonym of prosperity and players riding auto-rickshaws to practice in a BCCI- organised tournament is a bumpy experience!         
	And if that wasnt enough complication for Team Bengal, on the eve of their first match against Assam, the players on reaching the ground found the practice pitch to be wet. The result: no batting and bowling practice.         
	However, Ashirwad Behera, secretary of OCA, played down both the incidents. The rain hampered our preparations and so the wicket was wet. And because of the festive season there was some miscommunication over the transport But things have been sorted out, Behera said.         
	Appointment of Manoj Tiwary as the captain, in the presence of last seasons captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla in the team, fuelled speculations. While some said a young captain was chosen keeping the energy level of T20s in mind, majority indicated that a good show by Manoj, as the captain, may give him a long term appointment.         
	That, therefore, makes the Woorkeri Raman-coached teams season opener all the more important.         
	But it certainly wont be a cakewalk for Bengal. Last year, in the same tournament, Assam humbled Bengal by 35 runs, thanks to a blistering knock by youngster Parvez Aziz. Bengal, in fact, had a disastrous tournament as they managed a single victory, losing the rest of their matches.         
	Manoj has a young side at his disposal. While the captain himself, along with Wriddhiman Saha, Sreevats Goswami and Abhisekh Jhunjhunwala are expected to handle the batting department, Ashok Dinda and Sourashish Lahiri will have to make good use of their experience in the bowling unit. Bengals leading pacer Ranadeb Bose has been rested in this meet keeping the Ranji Trophy in mind. Shukla with his big-hitting skills and useful medium pace, perhaps, will be the most crucial component of the team.         
	Assam, apart from Aziz, boast of couple of experienced campaigners in Amol Muzumdar, Sridharan Sriram and Dheeraj Jadhav.         
	Lets hope that Bengal have a smoother ride in their match on Wednesday.

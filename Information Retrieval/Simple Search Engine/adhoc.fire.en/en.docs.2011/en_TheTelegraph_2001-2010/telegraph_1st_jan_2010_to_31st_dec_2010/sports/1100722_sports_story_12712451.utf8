The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashes kept from 47!
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ashes kept from 47!
                      
	Melbourne: Pooran Singh, whose ashes will be collected by Kapil Dev on Sunday, had wished that they be immersed in the Ganges. Honouring his last wish, Alice Guyett-Wood, the present owner of the funeral company where Pooran was cremated, and her family preserved his ashes for 63 years.         
	Pooran, who migrated to Australia 111 years ago, worked as a hawker selling goods laden in his horse-drawn cart. Reacting to Kapils gesture, Alice said, it is fantastic and an emotional moment for us to have his last wish fulfilled.         
	Alice added the ashes were passed from generations and she and her brother took care of them after her father Jack Guyett died in 1986.         
	We didnt have the authority to dispose them off, so we just held them. We were not able to locate his relatives, she said.         
	Pooran was cremated in June 1947 with his relatives in India being notified of his death by telegram. Although no one has come forward to collect the ashes, they have been preserved for their final journey to India and accorded pride of place at the Warrnambool cemetery.         
	Alice also informed that the wagon used by Pooran for selling goods is now showcased in Flagstaff Hill.           (PTI)

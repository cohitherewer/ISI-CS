	Calcutta: Southern Samity rode on Brazilian frontliner Edmilsons hattrick to beat Mohammedan AC 4-2 in a Calcutta Football League match, at the Kalyani Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	The former East Bengal and Chirag United striker, who recently joined the team coached by former India captain I. M. Vijayan was in his element throughout the match.         
	He scored the first two (37th and 57th) through penalties and got his hattrick five minutes before regulation time.         
	Compatriot Marcos, a former Mohun Bagan midfielder, netted the other one for Samity in the 72nd minute. Abiola (seventh minute) and Sujoy Datta (61st minute) were the scorers for Mohammedan AC.         
	Mohammedan AC goalkeeper Satya Pal was hospitalised after Edmilson allegedly fouled him after the first penalty. Southern Samity officials though denied the allegation and the referee also did not even book the Brazilian.         
	In another match played at the East Bengal ground, Aryan blanked Railway FC 5-0. Stanley scored a brace, while Mohan Sarkar, Babatunde and Pankaj Moula netted once each.         
	BNR and Kalighat MS played out a goalless draw while the tie between Kalighat Club and Eastern Railway finished 1-1.         
	Felix and Jaydeep Bose were the scorers for Kalighat and Eastern Railway Railway respectively.

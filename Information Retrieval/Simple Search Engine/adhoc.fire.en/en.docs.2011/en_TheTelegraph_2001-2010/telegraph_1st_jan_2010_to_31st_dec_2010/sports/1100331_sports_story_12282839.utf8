The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Caddie hopes for respectful Augusta
                                                                                                                       7                                      Caddie hopes for respectful Augusta
                      
	Wellington: Tiger Woods will be judged by his golf rather than taunted for his extra-marital affairs when he returns to action at next weeks US Masters, according to his caddie Steve Williams.         
	New Zealander Williams told TVNZ on Tuesday that the crowd at Augusta National would be too respectful to barrack Woods who has admitted he was nervous about the reception he would receive after his four-month break from the game.         
	They (Augusta) are very specific with whoever they let in there, so they are genuine golf fans, said Williams.         
	I dont really expect any of those people having any problems. I think they will be very happy to see Tiger playing at Augusta where hes been successful.         
	Woods, 34, has not played this year following revelations that he had a string of affairs. The world No. 1, a four-time Masters champion, has said he is undergoing therapy for sex addiction.         
	The people that are going to watch Augusta, they call them patrons there, not spectators. They are all golf fans and it is a very difficult tournament to get in, added Williams.         
	It is the only golf tournament in the world there is waiting list to get in to.         
	Williams, hired in 1999 by Woods who has since won 13 of his 14 major titles, said the big challenge for his boss was simply concentrating on his game.         
	Just focus, I think that is going to be the big thing, he said. Tiger hasnt played competitively in four months, hasnt played any warm-up tournaments going into a major championship.         
	They (majors) are difficult tournaments at the best of the times so having not played a practice tournament or a pre-tournament, it is going to be difficult.         
	So just to keep his focus on what we are doing, that is going to be the foremost thing in my mind, he said.         
	Williams, looking relaxed and tanned in a T-shirt bearing the insignia of Woods sponsors, said the players two recent televised interviews show his readiness to return to action.         
	Basically, I think his intention is that he is getting himself ready to play. Tiger doesnt play in golf tournaments unless he believes he can win.         
	By granting those media interviews and taking those questions about the Masters indicates to me that he really is getting ready and feels like he is going to be able to compete, he said.         
	Every player has got a view of that differently but Tigers key strength as we all know is his mental strength and he is going to need it all through this period. I believe going back to his Buddhism is going to help that, he added.         
	Woods will face the media on Monday next week, a departure from his usual Tuesday news conference, before the start of the years first major.         
	He will be the only player to hold a news conference on that day, according to a schedule released by Masters officials.         
	The Masters runs from April 8-11.           (REUTERS)

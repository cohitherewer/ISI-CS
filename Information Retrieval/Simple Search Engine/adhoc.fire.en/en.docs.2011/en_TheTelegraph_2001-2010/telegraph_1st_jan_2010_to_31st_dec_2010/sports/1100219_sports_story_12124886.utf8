            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India retained the No.1 spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship after winning the Eden Test by an innings and 58 runs Thursday.         
	India were in danger of losing their top spot after South Africa won the Nagpur Test last week, but Indias victory here meant the series ended 1-1, prolonging Indias reign.         
	Even though India managed to maintain the pre-series status quo in terms of positions, they slipped to 124 ratings points after conceding one ratings point.         
	The series result means Mahendra Singh Dhonis side will not only retain the Mace but will also pocket a cheque worth $175,000, which is presented to the side that reaches the April 1 cut-off date as toppers.         
	The side that finishes on top of the ODI Championship table on April 1, will receive a shield and a cheque of $175,000 while the second-placed side will receive $75,000.         
	Australia are guaranteed No.1 finish with 131 ratings points. But the side that wins the three-match ODI series between India and South Africa, will finish second.         
	Rankings         
	Team: 1. India (124); 2. South Africa (120); 3. Australia (116); 4. Sri Lanka (115); 5. England (107); 6. Pakistan (83); 7. New Zealand (81); 8. West Indies (77); 9.

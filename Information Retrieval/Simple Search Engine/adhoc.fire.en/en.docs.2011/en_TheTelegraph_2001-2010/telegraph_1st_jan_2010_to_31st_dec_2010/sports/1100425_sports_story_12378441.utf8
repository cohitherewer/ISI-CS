The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney   in doubt 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney   in doubt 
                            
	London: Wayne Rooney could miss the final two games of Manchester Uniteds challenge for a fourth successive Premier League title after suffering a groin injury, manager Alex Ferguson said on Saturday.         
	The England striker watched from the stands at Old Trafford as United beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 to go two points clear of Chelsea with two games remaining.         
	Ferguson said Rooney, a talismanic figure for England as they prepare for the World Cup starting in South Africa in June, had picked up the injury on Thursday, adding he could not say when he might return.         
	Its difficult to say, groin injuries are groin injuries and I think it probably will take two to three weeks to be honest, he said.         
	Asked whether he would play again this season, the Scot added: Well try. Obviously well give him every chance and Wayne will be desperate to play himself. But well just have to wait and see.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Casillas   bad press slammed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Casillas   bad press slammed
                            
	London: The Spanish wife of Britains deputy prime minister has hit out at claims Spain captain Iker Casillas was distracted by his TV reporter girlfriend at the World Cup.         
	Goalkeeper Casillas conceded in the opening game loss to Switzerland while girlfriend Sara Carbonero was working on the touchline. Carbonero later berated Casillas in an interview which became front-page news in Britain.         
	But London-based lawyer Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, wife of deputy premier Nick Clegg, was so incensed that she has complained to the The Times, London (newspaper) now the tournament is over, with Casillas keeping five clean sheets.         
	Now that Spain have won the World Cup and Iker Casillas demonstrated on Sunday that he is an outstanding goalkeeper regardless of whether his girlfriend, Sara Carbonero, watches him from the touchline or not, it may be time for you to eat a bit of humble pie, Gonzalez wrote in a letter published in Tuesdays editions.         
	Trying to blame Sara for Spains initial lacklustre performance, while she was simply doing her job, was not worthy of a newspaper that should treat women for who they are and not simply for what their male partners do.         
	The Times defended its coverage, with editor James Harding adding: We are not over-fond of humble pie but if you, Sara Carbonero or Iker Casillas are ever passing, please do drop by for a slice of tortilla.         
	Casillas has returned to Spain to find that his relationship with Carbonero is intriguing the world. Their passionate televised kiss in the aftermath of the World Cup final has become a runaway success on YouTube, with more than a million hits  more than the footage of Andreas Iniestas World Cup-winning goal.

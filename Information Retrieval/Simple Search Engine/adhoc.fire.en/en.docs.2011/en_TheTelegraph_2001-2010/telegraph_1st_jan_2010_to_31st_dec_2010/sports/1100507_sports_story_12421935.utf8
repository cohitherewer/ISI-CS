The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians pip England women
                                                                                                                       7                                      Australians pip England women
                      
	St Kitts: Australia edged past defending champions England on boundary countback after the match and the super over finished in a tie in the Womens World T20 here.         
	Both sides scored six for two in the Super Over but Australia won on countback because they had hit the only six in the match.         
	Chasing 104, Australia needed eight off the last over with a wicket in hand and looked on track when a no-ball from Charlotte Edwards was hit for four. But, with the scores level and three balls remaining, Rene Farrell was run out by Beth Morgan. After the tie in the Super Over, Jess Camerons six, hit off England left-arm spinner Holly Colvin, won the day for Australia as it was the only shot to clear the ropes.         
	Thus the womens World T20, running alongside the mens event in West Indies, is turning out to be quite an exciting affair.         
	On Wednesday, West Indian Deandra Dottin became the first woman cricketer to hit a Twenty20 International century when she blasted a 40-ball unbeaten 112, which is also the fastest century at this level, against South Africa in the World T20 here. Riding on her heroics, the hosts beat South Africa by 17 runs.         
	Dottin completed her century off just 38 balls, with nine sixes and five fours, and later added two fours from as many balls as the womens World T20 got off to a stupendous start on Wednesday.         
	Batting at number six, the 18-year-old from Barbados eclipsed the fastest hundred in the mens game hit by her compatriot Chris Gayle. Gayle had taken 50 balls to get his century, also against South Africa, in 2007. Dottins first 50 came off 25 balls; in this she took three more balls than her own record of 22 balls set last year. But the second 50 took just 13 deliveries. Dottins sixth wicket partnership of 118 with Shanel Daley is also the highest-ever in a Twenty20 match. It beats the earlier record of 77 set by Australias Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey in Auckland in 2005.         
	West Indies total of 175 for five was also the highest total by any womens team in this format. (PTI)

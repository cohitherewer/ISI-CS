	East Bengal surged ahead in the 35th minute when man-of-the-match Budiram Tudu overlapped from the left and kept a measured cross for Riston to head home. George goalkeeper Swarup Das made a couple of impressive saves in the first session as the glamour outfit failed to increase their tally further in the first half.         
	Budiram, who worked tirelessly before the change of ends got his name in the scoresheet at the start of the second half. In the 48th minute, he weaved past a couple of players to shoot home. Nirmal Chhetri missed a sitter in the 63rd minute. However, the easiest of chances was missed by substitute Hammond in the 70th minute when he failed to score from a Malswamkima assist with only keeper Swarup at his mercy.         
	In the 74th minute, Budiram scored his second goal of the match when Hammonds powerful shot was parried by Swarup on first attempt. Budiram slotted home off the rebound. Swarup made another good save in the 78th minute when he saved Sanju Pradhans attempt from a Malswamkima shot.         
	The fourth goal came in the 82nd minute when Hammond made amends with a nice placement past Swarup Das.         
	This was Raghu Nandys last match as George Telegraph coach. Nandy who has been associated with George for more than a decade will coach Aryan next season.

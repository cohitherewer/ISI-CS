The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One run too many for SA
                                                                                                                       7                                      One run too many for SA
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Jaipur: The South Africa tailenders threatened to spoil the Indian party before the home team managed an exciting one-run victory in the opening encounter of the Micromax Mobile Cup at the jam-packed Sawai Man Singh Stadium here on Sunday.         
	Defending a total of 298, the Indians bowled with purpose to restrict the South Africans till the 43rd over when the visitors were 225 for eight.         
	But Wayne Parnell (49) and Dale Steyn (35) launched a fantastic counter-attack to take their team within a sniffing distance of victory.         
	Save stand-in captain Jacques Kallis (89) who looked at ease while batting, the other top and middle-order batsmen found it difficult to get going against the Indians who were missing two of their frontline bowlers in Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh.         
	The Parnell-Steyn partnership, which put on 65 runs off only 37 deliveries, should be a lesson for the other Proteas batsmen for the remaining two ODIs.         
	Parnell was run-out off the last ball of the match when he went for an impossible second run in his bid to tie the match.         
	Steyns knock was also an impressive one as his 35 runs came off just 19 deliveries with the help of three huge sixes and a boundary.         
	When Praveen Kumar came on to bowl the final over, the South Africans needed 10 runs with a couple of wickets in hand.         
	Praveen cleaned up Steyn with his second delivery of the final over raising Indian hopes.         
	With seven runs remaining from two deliveries, last man Charl Langeveldt pulled one over short fine-leg. But, a diving Sachin Tendulkar denied the South African a boundary, stopping the ball inches from the rope.         
	The visitors ran three as the television replays were inconclusive as to whether Tendulkars hand had touched the rope while saving the boundary.         
	It finally came down to the visitors needing a boundary off the last delivery.         
	Praveen bowled a widish delivery which beat Parnell. However, with the umpire signalling for a wide, the visitors were left to score three off one.         
	As a desperate Parnell went for a slog, the ball hit the toe of his bat and flew off to the third-man region.         
	With the South Africans attempting an impossible second run in their bid to at least tie the match, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni whipped off the bails off a Sreesanth throw from the deep to snatch a narrow victory.         
	When the South Africans came out to bat, except for Kallis, none of the other batsmen managed to stay at the wicket for a considerable length of time.         
	At least three South Africa batsmen  opener Loots Bosman (29), Herschelle Gibbs (27) and AB de Villers (25)  showed early promise but were out after getting well-set.         
	Removing the two top order batsmen  Gibbs and De Villers  was the turning point and credit should go to Man of the Match left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja for doing the trick.         
	Egged on by the crowd, Jadeja, who played for the Rajasthan Royals in the last two seasons of IPL, struck in the 12th and 20th overs to break the visitors backbone.         
	While all other batsmen departed without any significant contribution, Kallis remained the tragic hero for the losers.         
	After the stand-in skipper won the toss and put India in to bat, Kallis was definitely the most convincing among all the bowlers.         
	And when he came out to bat, Kallis was a picture of patience and skill. Pity, none of his teammates shared his grit and determination.         
	Earlier, during the Indian innings, southpaw Suresh Raina slammed a strokeful 58 to help India post a challenging total.         
	Raina arrived at a time when the South Africans looked like being in the drivers seat after capturing three quick wickets in a span of nine overs. However, the Uttar Pradesh batsman took the battle to the rival camp with some delectable shots.         
	If the bowlers brought an end to South African ambitions, it was Rainas 15th half century that steadied the Indian innings.         
	Raina, who dominated the 66-run fifth-wicket partnership with Virat Kohli (31), looked good for a three-figure knock before Boucher caught him off a Kallis delivery in the 44th over.         
	The Indians should blame themselves for not being able to get past a score of 300. Both Virender Sehwag (46) and Dinesh Karthik (44) were milking runs when they departed.         
	The visitors were indeed lucky to get the prized wickets of Sachin Tendulkar and Sehwag, both victims of unfortunate run-outs.

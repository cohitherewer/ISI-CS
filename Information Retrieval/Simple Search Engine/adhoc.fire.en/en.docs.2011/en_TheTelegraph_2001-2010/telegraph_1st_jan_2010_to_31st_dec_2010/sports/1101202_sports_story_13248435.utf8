	Mumbai: Justice B.N. Srikrishna on Wednesday recused himself from the arbitration proceedings in the Kings XI Punjabs appeal against their termination from the IPL by the BCCI.         
	Yes, I have recused myself from the case. I disclosed to the parties the fact that I had represented the Wadia group in a case (nearly 35 years ago). The BCCI said they had reservations against me hearing the case, so I withdrew, Justice Srikrishna told The Telegraph.         
	Srikrishna had on Tuesday stayed the termination of Rajasthan Royals from the IPL for six weeks, enabling the latter to participate in the January 8-9 players auction. The BCCI terminated the franchise rights of both the Royals and Kings XI Punjab on October 10,.         
	Meanwhile, welcoming the interim order of Justice Srikrishna, a Royals spokesperson said that the ruling has paved the way for it to take part in players auctions and IPL 4 next year.

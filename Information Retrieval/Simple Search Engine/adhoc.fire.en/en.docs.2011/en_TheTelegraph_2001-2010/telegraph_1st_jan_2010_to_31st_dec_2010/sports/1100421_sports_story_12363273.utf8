The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robin: No home advantage for us
                                                                                                                       7                                      Robin: No home advantage for us
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians coach Robin Singh on Tuesday said that his team neither carried the home advantage nor the pressure of playing in the semis for the first time when they take on Royal Challengers Bangalore on Wednesday.         
	A semifinal is a semifinal. Its a knockout game, its a one-off game and every game is a pressure game, Robin said on the eve of the match at the DY Patil stadium.         
	I dont think we have an advantage anywhere. We just want to go out and do well. Every team has been beaten at some stage in the tournament. And every team has shown the ability to beat anyone on a given day.         
	The former India international did not believe in the argument that the defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on Monday had snapped their momentum.         
	 I dont think so, it hardly matters. We wanted to give everyone rest, and we could afford to do that, he said.         
	We rested players taking into account what combination we would be playing here (on Wednesday).         
	Mumbai had rested skipper Sachin Tendulkar, deputy Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga, Kieron Pollard and Harbhajan Singh. Robin said the players were hardly affected by the off-field controversy surrounding the IPL. Actually we have been on the road and so have read or seen less about it, he said.         
	He said Mumbai were prepared to set a target as well as chase down one.         
	Whether you bat first or chase, you have to play well. The teams who are best prepared for the last two games would win the tournament, he said.         
	Robin would not reveal who would open the batting with Sachin.         
	The team has found some success with Shikhar Dhawan but it would a big decision to leave out veteran Sanath Jayasuriya for the big occasion. Let Royal Challengers give me their playing eleven, I will give you ours, he said in jest.

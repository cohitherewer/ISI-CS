The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill look to top pool
                                                                                                                       7                                      Churchill look to top pool
                      
	Panaji: Churchill Brothers were aiming to top Group B as they left for Kuwait to play their last league match of the AFC Cup against Kuwait SC on Wednesday.         
	Churchill, who have been inconsistent in the I-League, now want to put their past behind and continue their good show in the AFC Cup. The Goan outfit, who had drawn at home against Kuwait SC, are leading the table with seven points. They have two wins and a draw to their credit.         
	They now require a draw against second-placed Kuwait SC to top the group, which will give them the advantage of playing the pre-quarter final at home.         
	Kuwait SC, who gave some torrid time to Churchill in the second half Churchills home match, had eventually found the equaliser in the dying minutes. Churchill will have a tough time in the absence of their costliest recruit, striker Okolie Odafe, who will not play due to double booking.         
	Coach Carlos Pereira knows that beating the Kuwaiti team at home would be tough, but thinks he has enough resource to surprise them.         
	My boys have given a good account of themselves so far in the AFC Cup, winning both their matches against Al Hilal of Yemen. Hopefully, theyll continue to play in the same way, said Pereira.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | God has been kind, it just happened: Tendulkar
                                                                                                                       7                                        God has been kind, it just happened: Tendulkar
    - Maestro to fulfil charity commitments during break           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Gwalior/On board Flight CD 8818: The Ravi Shastris have run out of adjectives, but the phenomenon of our times, Sachin Tendulkar, continues to epitomise modesty.         
	So much so that his day-after reaction was no more than God has been kind... It just happened...         
	Off the field, too, Sachin doesnt cease to amaze.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph in the VIP Room of the Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Terminal in Gwalior, on Thursday afternoon, Sachin said: Of course, it feels very nice, but that moment is over now...         
	The moment in question being his becoming the first, in four decades of ODIs, to score a double hundred (against South Africa, at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium).         
	As the three-match series is already in the bag, Sachin wont be seen in action in the concluding ODI, on Saturday.         
	Waiting to board Flight CD 8818, to New Delhi, en route to Mumbai, Sachin informed that hed probably take a 10-day break.         
	Some charity commitments are pending... I havent had the time this season... Ill try and fulfil whatever I can over the next few days... After that, Ill begin preparing for the IPL, perhaps around March 5...         
	One such commitment is expected to involve a days coaching to the winners of the online auction during The Joy Of Giving Week (September 27-October 3) last year.         
	Proceeds will go to the Mumbai-based Apnalaya, an institution which is special for the Tendulkars.         
	The living legend, incidentally, has been overwhelmed by the messages of congratulations sent directly and indirectly. By people known and unknown.         
	I havent seen them personally (as yet), but have been told that the President and Prime Minister have sent messages... The nation, I know, is happy, Sachin remarked, as another batch of Mirage 2000s took off for a day-time sortie.         
	Flight CD 8818, operated on an ancient ATR 42-320, finally took off 100-odd minutes behind schedule and once the cruising altitude was achieved, Captain Norman Sanson, a New Zealander, gave a special welcome to our cricketing heroes.         
	Also on the 55-minute flight were Virender Sehwag, Praveen Kumar and Abhishek Nayar, all of whom have fitness issues.         
	Captain Sansons announcement was greeted with a spontaneous round of clapping.         
	While Sachin obliged the autograph-seekers on board, even while engrossed in the music emanating from his massive headphones, Sehwag didnt seem inclined to make somebodys day.         
	There may be similarities in their batting, but theres not much in common otherwise.         
	On landing in the national capital, Air India officials greeted Sachin with a bouquet of roses. The usual requests followed before a tarmac-transfer was effected to allow Sachin catch his Jet flight to Mumbai.         
	Everybody has always wanted a piece of the 36-year-old, Indias pride with a capital P. After the 200 not out, that demand has become greater.

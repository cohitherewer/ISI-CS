The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan win 2-1
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan win 2-1
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The future, which comes with its mystery tag, intensifies the present. But once you know your predicament, the present loses its sheen. Mohun Bagans 2-1 victory over BNR in a Calcutta Football League Premier Division match, on Monday, highlighted that.         
	With the league title already lost to arch-rivals East Bengal, Bagans lack of motivation was as evident as the deserted stands of the Salt Lake Stadium. Coach Stanley Rozario, however, defied the lure of resting his key players and instead started with the Jose Barreto-Edeh Chidi duo upfront.         
	But that didnt inspire the green and maroon brigade to rise above the average as they failed to find the net almost for the entire first-half. Just when it seemed that the teams would go into the half-time goalless, Bagan unlocked BNR defence to strike twice in quick succession.         
	While the first one, in the 43rd minute, had luck written all over it, the second, in the next minute, was all about Barretos precision. Bagan went 1-0 up when Jayanta Sens weak grounder from the edge of the box took a wicked deflection off a rival defender to fox the keeper.         
	The second goal, however, once again proved that Barreto may have lost some of his pace, but nothing of his precision. Edeh Chidi did all the hard work as he kept a host of BNR defenders out of his away, ran down the left edge of the box and then essayed a cross. The Brazilian who was lurking near the goal, pounced on the ball and his thunderous volley beat the keeper hands down.         
	The glamorous outfit managed a few other adventures into the rival box in the second half, without a fruitful result though. Manish Maithani goofed up the easiest of chances failing to convert from point blank range. However, Bagan didnt manage to keep a clean slate as BNRs Krishanu Banerjee scored a brilliant goal late into injury time to make it 2-1.         
	With 40 points from 16 outings, Bagan will thus have to be satisfied with the second-best tag in the CFL.

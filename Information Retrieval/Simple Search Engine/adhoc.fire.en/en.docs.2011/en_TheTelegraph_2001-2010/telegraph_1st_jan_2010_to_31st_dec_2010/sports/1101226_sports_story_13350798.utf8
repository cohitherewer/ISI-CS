The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Patience will be crucial for England, says Strauss
                                                                                                                       7                                        Patience will be crucial for England, says Strauss
  - Anderson declared fit for Boxing Day Test; Ponting confident of playing       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND AGENCIES    
	Melbourne: Andrew Strauss has told his team they cannot afford to be overwhelmed by the once-in-a-lifetime experience of playing in front of almost 100,000 people at the MCG on Sunday and warned that patience will be key as they continue their pursuit of the Ashes.         
	But with the series tied at 1-1 with two to play, he has also identified a patience game as the way to succeed at a venue where seam and swing can hold sway and there are pitfalls for batsmen who try to attack too early.         
	Similarly, rewards are likely to come to bowlers who stay calm and do not start banging the ball in halfway down the wicket.         
	James Anderson appears sure to be leading Englands attack, having been declared 100 per cent fit by Strauss, following a niggle in his side  while Australia captain Ricky Ponting is confident he too will be able to lead his country after recovering sufficiently from a broken left little finger.         
	Whoever takes part, though, Strauss is convinced the main requirement is to avoid being sucked into too much adventure because of the inevitable noise and the size of the occasion.         
	Asked what he sees as the key quality at a ground where he made a first-innings 50 four years ago, the England captain replied: Patience  which can be quite hard when theres a big crowd here and youve got a bit of adrenaline going through your blood.         
	To remain patient and calm is quite tough.         
	England will be well aware, after their dour draw in a tour match against Victoria here two weeks ago, that flashy players will have to rein themselves in.         
	A lot of patience is needed. Sometimes it can be pretty tough to score here, Strauss added. Youve got to be prepared to suck it in a little bit, absorb some pressure for a while and then hope to come out the other side as a batting unit.         
	The general consensus at the MCG is if you go too hard at it too early youre going to be back in the hut.         
	In case England needed any reminder of the partisan element in an expected 90,000-plus crowd, Ponting provided it this morning by agreeing the visitors may be intimidated by the occasion.         
	Im sure he does, Strauss countered. But I dont think we will, no. One of the things thats important is that youre ready for it, and not surprised by it.         
	Thats one of the messages weve been trying to get across  be prepared for it; its going to be quite a big spectacle, and its out of the ordinary.         
	We dont usually play in front of that number of people.         
	Andersons fitness allows more leeway for England to rest leading wicket-taker Steven Finn, and Strauss long answer to whether that may happen was confirmation enough that selection for this pivotal match is far from straightforward.         
	The key before every Test match is to try to get the balance of attack that you think is most likely to work on any given wicket, he began.         
	Weve had to think long and hard about that. Finnys done some really good things on this tour, and taken quite a few wickets.         
	Ponting will take the precaution of fielding away from his usual position in the slips to try to keep his finger out of the firing line.

	Nagpur: Anil Kumble, now at the helm of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, spoke to The Telegraph (from Bangalore) on Monday night.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How did your first day in office go?         
	A (Laughs) Went off well... More than feeling any different by sitting on the presidents chair, I was trying to understand what needs to be done in the lead-up to our immediate challenge  the smooth conduct of the December 7 ODI against New Zealand.         
	Did you wake up feeling different?         
	Not really... As the kids prepared to leave for school, I had fatherly duties to perform... Having got back home very late, I couldnt drop them, though... If there was a difference, it was that I didnt have to fine-tune campaigning for the day.         
	Team Kumble won 21 of the 24 seats on the management committee... Did you expect this near clean sweep?         
	Perhaps not this margin... Im glad we were able to convince a huge majority of the voters... We presented ourselves as a team and spoke of our vision... Cricket in Karnataka had, over the past three years, suffered because there were two factions... We werent part of either and projected ourselves as a cricket group, highlighting that our goal was exclusively to improve cricket.         
	Your own election was rather close, with the incumbent (Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar) getting over 500 votes...         
	Didnt come as a surprise... The Maharaja is, after all, a highly respected figure in Karnataka and hed already been there for one term.         
	Did your predecessor congratulate you?         
	We could let this pass.         
	With the ODI just over a fortnight away, when are you actually getting down to business?         
	The new committee meets, for the first time, on Wednesday. Some systems are in place and so thats going to be of help. Improving the infrastructure, setting up academies across the state... Those things will take time and are going to be addressed after December 7.         
	Will you, perhaps, have a time-bound programme?         
	There will be accountability... A time frame has to be there, otherwise whats the point in occupying positions... More systems will be put in place and, as I told you the other day, meritocracy is going to matter... Good governance is a promise weve made. We have a reputation to keep.         
	I assume different people will be assigned different tasks...         
	Of course... We wont be hierarchy-driven, I dont believe in that... Id like my colleagues to be leaders in their own right... Ill have to sit down and work out who ought to be doing what task.         
	You have a three-year term... Is that time enough to effect changes?         
	The process is important... Everything definitely wont happen in three years, but because of the clear mandate, decisions will be taken quickly and people are going to be held accountable. There will be boxes to tick and well assess where weve reached.         
	Reflecting on the win, how would you compare it with on-field achievements?         
	Id say weve had a fantastic victory... We treated the elections like a match, planned for it and our execution was almost perfect... A group of nearly 40 people worked hard for weeks... We had to use our skills as the voters were all intelligent and our vision had to be sold to them... That the likes of Vishy (Gundappa Viswanath) and Brijesh (Patel) extended support made it easier.         
	Is your success going to inspire former cricketers in some of the other states?         
	Havent thought about it... Havent reflected on whether Ive enthused or inspired others... My concern is to quickly get our act right. We need to deliver and the expectations, believe me, are high.         
	The last one... Do the Karnataka politicians need to learn from you?         
	(Laughs) I think I should answer this one after three years, once our report card is ready and the boxes have been ticked.

	Melbourne: Part of the African bloc that thwarted John Howards bid for the International Cricket Council vice-presidents post, Zimbabwe Cricket chief Peter Chingoka said the former Australian Prime Minister was rejected as he was not experienced enough for the job.         
	Chingoka said it goes without saying that Australia and New Zealand have to put forth an experienced name and the candidate should be somebody whos come through hands-on in cricket.         
	There is a lot of talent in Australia and New Zealand. I could give you at least six names from Australia who have been on the Australian Board or the Board of the ICC who are very competent and would be immediately suitable I can give you two or three names from New Zealand who would be immediately suitable, he added.         
	However, former ICC president Ehsan Mani says Cricket Australia has every reason to feel bitter about Howards rejection for the post of ICC vice-president as Pakistan and Bangladesh made unexpected U-turns after assuring support.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victors are feted in sorry show
                                                                                                                       7                                      Victors are feted in sorry show
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The intent was there but the execution went horribly wrong.         
	That, in a nutshell, was the felicitation ceremony of the Santosh Trophy-winning Bengal squad, organised by the Indian Football Association (IFA) on Thursday.         
	The state association tried its best to make the event a grand success but total mismanagement led to the programmes being below par.         
	However, the whole Bengal squad, along with the hero of the final, Denson Devadas, lapped up each and every bit of praise and attention showered on them. Its yet to sink in. I havent slept in the past few days. I really feel like a star now. Thanks to IFA for providing me with an opportunity to play for Bengal, a beaming Devadas told mediapersons while being congratulated by international paddler Poulami Ghatak and GM Dibyendu Barua.         
	All the members of the squad are richer by Rs 1 lakh after receiving the sum from the IFA. What really became embarrassing was that neither P.K Banerjee nor the two other Olympians present  Chuni Goswami and Sailen Manna  were called on the dais to give away the cheques and mementoes.         
	Poor anchoring and sound system in the hall made matters worse.         
	City police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakraborti, on behalf of his force, handed a specially designed police cap to the members of the victorious squad. The most endearing part was when Devadas and Dhanarajan, did a little jig to a popular Nachiketa number.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lankan player under scanner
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lankan player under scanner
                      
	London: The ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit has been monitoring the unusual activities of a leading Sri Lankan player after team members alerted their skipper Kumar Sangakkara of his late-night activities with a man believed to be an illegal bookmaker.         
	Sri Lankan players passed on their concerns to the captain, who followed ICC protocol by contacting the ACU. The player has since been investigated by Sri Lankan police, although no charges have been laid, a British daily reported Sunday.         
	However, Sri Lanka Cricket has kept the entire matter away from the public spotlight by concealing the police investigation surrounding the player.         
	The player concerned has been under the ICCs scanner since the T20 World Cup in England in 2009.         
	The officials from the ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit are said to be dismayed at the lack of progress. The (Anti-Corruption Units) working is not that of a policing agency or a newspaper. They have no power to arrest or seize, or carry out a sting operation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL auction in Bangalore
                                                                                                                       7                                        IPL auction in Bangalore
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                  Brian Lara amp; Adam Gilchrist                           
	Mumbai/ Delhi: The IPL player auction to be held on January 8-9 has been shifted from Mumbai to Bangalore with more than 400 players expected to go under the hammer.         
	Yes, the auction will be held in Bangalore, Sundar Raman, Chief Executive Officer of the IPL, confirmed on Monday.         
	The IPL governing council had earlier decided to hold the auction in Mumbai and the tournament to run from April 8 to May 22 with a total of 60 matches.         
	But that was before Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals, won a stay on their termination through an interim order from the Bombay High Court.         
	Meanwhile, Brian Lara and Adam Gilchrist are among overseas players who have been put in the top bracket base price.         
	However, Mitchell Johnson, Michael Clarke and Ricky Pontings name do not figure in the list that the IPL governing council has sent to the franchisees.         
	Around 400 foreign players have expressed their willingness to be a part of the cricketing extravaganza. They have been classified in six brackets ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 400,000.         
	The Australians have only three players  top scorer in IPL-I Shaun Marsh, Gilchrist, the captain of second edition champions Deccan Chargers and speed merchant Brett Lee in the top bracket base price. The Hussey brothers Mike and David are in the second base price bracket of $300,000 while T20 and ODI specialist David Warner is in the third bracket with a base price of $200,000.         
	However, it was surprising that Lara, who last played a ODI back in 2007, has been classified in the top bracket.         
	Brian Lara is a big brand. Also he would not have been too comfortable being bracketed in a lower base price category, an IPL source said today.         
	Chris Gayle is the only other West Indies player in the top bracket.         
	Defending World T20 champions England have six players Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Luke Wright and Michael Yardy in the top bracket. New Zealand have their skipper Daniel Vettori, deputy Ross Taylor and wicketkeeper batsman Brendon McCullum in the top rung.         
	Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara is, however, missing from the elite group as only two Sri Lankans Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekaratne Dilshan have found place. South African captain Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers are in the top bracket too.

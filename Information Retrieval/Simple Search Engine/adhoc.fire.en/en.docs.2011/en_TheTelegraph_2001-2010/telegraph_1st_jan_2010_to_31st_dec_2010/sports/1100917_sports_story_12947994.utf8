The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royal challenge for Redbacks
                                                                                                                       7                                      Royal challenge for Redbacks
                      
	Durban: A battle of strategy is on the cards when in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore take on an impressive South Australia Redbacks in the Champions League Twenty20 Group B encounter here Friday.         
	Both the teams have started their campaign in the T20 championship on a winning note and would strive to register another victory Friday to consolidate their position.         
	Anil Kumble-led Bangalore side, who finished third in the Indian Premier League III earlier this year, started their journey in the tournament by crushing a low-profile Guyana by nine wickets.         
	On the other hand, South Australia first snatched an 11-run victory over Lions and then inflicted a humiliating five-wicket defeat on another IPL side, Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians.         
	For Kumbles men everything fell into place against Guyana and now they have to guard against complacency before Fridays tough encounter.         
	Experienced all-rounder Jacques Kallis commendably led Bangalore bowling attack, while pacer duo of Dale Steyn and Praveen Kumar had extended excellent support to him.         
	Kumble, who had managed just one wicket against Guyana, would now expect another all-round performance by his bowling department to break South Australias batting line-up. Kallis and Rahul Dravid had also clicked with the bat and produced a 78-run opening partnership, while at one-down Robin Uthappa cracked a quick unbeaten 25 off just eight balls to complete the task. But other batsmen, including New Zealander Ross Taylor and Virat Kohli should also be ready this time make a decent contribution with the bat.         
	Captain Michael Klinger and his opening partner Daniel Harris have played crucial roles in South Australias consecutive wins.         
	The duo had shared a 112-run partnership against Mumbai Indians to lay the foundation stone for their second win in the showpiece event.         
	But their middle-order batsmen have not done much in the so far.(PTI)

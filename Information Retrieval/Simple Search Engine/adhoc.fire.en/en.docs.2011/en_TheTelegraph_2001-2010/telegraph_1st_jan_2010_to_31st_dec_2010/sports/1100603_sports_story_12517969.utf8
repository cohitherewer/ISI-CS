The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Slow recovery for Woods 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Slow recovery for Woods 
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Ohio: Tiger Woods is recovering nicely from a neck injury that forced him to pull out of a tournament last month but will probably not be 100 percent for the upcoming US Open, the world No 1 said on Wednesday.         
	My neck feels pretty good, still not where I want it to be, but the inflammation has calmed down a bit, he said on the eve of the Memorial tournament at Muirfield Village. It will be his only competitive tune-up for the US Open at Pebble Beach in two weeks.         
	Woodss decision to quit during the final round of the Players Championship was surprising because only a couple of days earlier he had said his physical health was fine. Asked why he had not been more forthcoming earlier, he quipped: You dont need to know.         
	Woods said his neck first starting bothering him before the US Masters in April.         
	The symptoms were such that it could have been anything, he told reporters. I had a hard time turning back (and) turning through and the headaches were just unreal at times. The MRI just showed a lot of inflammation in the joint (which) has since calmed down.         
	Its a little sore after a hard day of practice but I can recover for the next day, which is good. Ive got range of motion. Im good enough to play, definitely.         
	If Woods was revealing, belatedly, about his neck injury, he was tight-lipped about his coaching situation. Three weeks have passed since instructor Hank Haney severed ties with the 14-times Major winner after a relationship of more than seven years.         
	Woods said he had no plans to replace Haney anytime soon and was currently assessing his swing by monitoring video.         
	With his neck still not fully healed and his personal life far from settled, it is doubtful Woods will be at his best at Pebble Beach, where he won the US Open by a record 15 strokes in 2000. He noted that he has played only nine competitive rounds this year, hopefully 13 by the end of this week.         
	Its going to take a little time and hopefully that time will be short, he said. Its great to hit it at home but I need to bring it out here. Ultimately, once you bring it out there youve got to bring it to a major championship. Once you do that, youve got to bring it to the major championship on the back nine.

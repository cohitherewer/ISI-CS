The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir: Can save the Test 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir: Can save the Test 
                      
	Centurion: It was a disappointing end to a wonderful start that Gautam Gambhir got in Indias second innings on Saturday. The Indian opener, who got out on five in the first innings, went on to score 80, before being rapped on the pads by a Dale Steyn delivery.         
	India got off to a good start, but the loss of Gambhir and Virender Sehwag pulled back the momentum slightly in the hosts favour. Gambhir felt the wicket has changed drastically from the opening day and India have a chance to save the match.         
	We always thought that it is going to be a good wicket to bat on. Unfortunately, we lost the toss and had to bat first on the wicket. That time the wicket was bit damp and the ball was really moving around. We believe that we can bat long to save this match, Gambhir said on Saturday.         
	We have done the same thing in Napier. It gives us backing that if we have done it in the past we can do it again. If we can draw this match then the series can turn in our favour, he stressed.         
	The southpaw backed Virender Sehwag (62), who once again got out playing a rash shot. (PTI)

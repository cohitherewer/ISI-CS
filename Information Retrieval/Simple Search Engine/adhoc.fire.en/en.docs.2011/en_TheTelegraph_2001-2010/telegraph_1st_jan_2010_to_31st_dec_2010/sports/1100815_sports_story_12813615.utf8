The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zulqarnain doubtful for third Test 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zulqarnain doubtful for third Test 
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan wicket-keeper Zulqarnain Haider, who made an impressive debut in the second Test, against England, at Edgbaston, is a doubtful starter for the third match starting at the Oval next week due to a finger injury.         
	Pakistan manager Yawar Saeed confirmed from England that Zulqarnain had suffered a hairline fracture in one of his fingers while playing in the match.         
	We dont know how serious the injury is right now but we will have him checked up in London by a specialist to find out if he can play or not, Yawar said.         
	Pakistan has already lost pacer Umar Gul, who has been ruled out of the series due to a hamstring injury which he picked up during the second Test in Birmingham.         
	Zulqarnain, who replaced the seasoned but out-of-form Kamran Akmal as keeper in the second Test, scored an impressive 88 runs in the second innings.         
	His batting impressed many ex-players and commentators with former captain Moin Khan predicting a bright future for Zulqarnain.         
	He showed great temperament and batted with lot of guts under great pressure in the second innings and if he continues to work hard he will improve further and establish himself in the national team, Moin had said.         
	Yawar said if Zulqarnain is unable to play, Kamran would replace him in the side.         
	He picked up the injury and played with it in the Test and he is keen to play the third Test as well But we will only play him if he gets medical clearance, Yawar said.         
	Zulqarnain had replaced Kamran for the second Test after the latters poor performance with bat and behind the stumps in the earlier Test matches.         
	Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Mohammed Yousuf boosted his chances of a Test recall with an impressive unbeaten 40 on a rain-hit opening day of the two-day tour match at Worcestershire.         
	Only 28.1 overs were possible at New Road, during which the tourists finished on 112 for two with the 35-year-old Yousuf hitting eight fours in 54 deliveries.         
	The appalling weather was irritating for the veteran batsman who is aiming to make his Test comeback at the Oval next week.         
	Yousuf has been working hard for the last week or so. Hes mentally stronger now and it was his decision to get out of retirement and play for the country again, said Pakistan associate manager Shafqat Rana. He is stronger and his reputation is at stake now. Hes a world class cricketer and we want him to bat for a long time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Feeling bad: Bhutia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Feeling bad: Bhutia
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The football fraternity reacted, on Friday, with shock and dismay as Mahindra Groups decision to disband its football team came out that decided to disband its football team from the next season.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically):         
	Bhaichung Bhutia (India captain): You cant question the corporate strategy of a company. If its not club with a big supporter base, then the companies can think of shutting it down. But as a footballer, I really feel bad as Mahindra United were among the best club teams of India.         
	Like only supporter base doesnt help your cause, similarly corporates also need to churn out new ideas regarding running of a football team.         
	It also depends on the vision of the corporate bigwigs. What exactly do they want while running a football team? Whether their vision is short term or they are thinking on a long term basis. For example, Pune FC have solid corporate backing, they are trying to build their own fan base. All these aspects count a lot. As far as the players are concerned, their contracts in any case would have ended and most of them must have good offers from other clubs.         
	Alvito DCunha (East Bengal player): Its a very bad news. Mahindra United have made a significant contribution to Indian club football. If they are shutting down, its an option closed for talented players emerging from that region.         
	Sandip Nandy (Former Mahindra United goalkeeper): This is one of the saddest days in Indian football. I am very disappointed. I have played there for five years and it was one of the best periods of my career. We won everything in Indian club football  the National League, Federation Cup, Durand Cup. Memories keep flooding back.         
	Mohammed Rafi (striker, Mahindra United): We have three matches remaining now. What effort will the players put in? Its bad for Mumbai football. The mood in our camp is downcast. Some of us have been in the team for five years now. Even though we might get offers from other teams, its really a bolt from the blue.

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES              Lewis Hamilton with the trophy after winning the Turkish Grand Prix, in Istanbul, on Sunday. (Reuters)                      
	Istanbul: Lewis Hamilton won the Turkish Grand Prix ahead of teammate Jenson Button after Red Bulls Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel blew a one-two finish.         
	Australian Webber, who started on pole and Germanys Vettel collided with 18 laps remaining while running first and second.         
	Vettel, who had tried to pass Webber on the inside heading into turn 12, spun and retired on the spot with a punctured rear tyre. Hamilton under pressure to claim win Championship leader Webber, who had led from pole position, went off the track briefly and dropped to third place behind the McLaren pairing of 2008 and 2009 world champions Hamilton and Button.         
	Vettel twirled his finger around his head as he trudged away from the car as if to say crazy while team boss Christian Horner watched from the pit lane wall and shook his head in disbelief. Red Bulls designer and technical head Adrian Newey simply put his head in his hands.         
	Webber had won the last two races in Spain and Monaco but had to settle for third place, although his podium finished put him out in front of his rivals at the top of the drivers championship. He said: Seb had top-speed advantage. He then went down the inside, we were side by side, it looked like he turned quick right and we made contact. Its a shame for the team and not an ideal day. It can happen sometimes and when you are at the front its difficult.         
	There was a long way to go into the race, so it wasnt a guaranteed victory, but it was an interesting few metres on the track between us.         
	Hamilton dedicated his victory to his father, who is celebrating his 50th birthday. He said: It was quite an exciting race actually. I dont know what happened to those guys (Red Bull), but we got through and then I had a great battle with Jenson.         
	Button added: It was good fun, but then after Lewis got past I was into fuel save mode as well. The race was a lot quicker than we thought it would be, but three weeks ago who would have though we would battle with the Red Bulls like we have.         
	Vettels accident allowed the rest of the field to move up one spot as Michael Schumacher finished fourth ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg. Robert Kubica of Renault was sixth ahead of Ferraris Felipe Massa.         
	Vettel jumped ahead of Hamilton out of the start to sit behind Webber but Hamilton quickly regained his place soon after, as did teammate Button by the last corner of the first lap after Schumacher had got ahead.         
	Hamilton tried in vain to pass Webber on the anticlockwise track but the Australian driver held him off until the 16th lap, when the front two pitted. Hamilton re-emerged behind Vettel, who had changed tires one lap earlier.         
	Hamilton, with Button behind him, pressured Vettel throughout but could not go past.

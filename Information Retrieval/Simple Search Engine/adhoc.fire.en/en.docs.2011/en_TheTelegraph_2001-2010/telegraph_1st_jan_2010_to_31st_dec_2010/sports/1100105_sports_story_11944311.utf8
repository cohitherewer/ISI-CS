	Bangalore: Rahul Dravids unbeaten 209 put Karnataka in the drivers seat on day two of their Ranji Trophy semi-final against Uttar Pradesh at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium Monday.         
	Resuming at their overnight 255 for four and running up a mammoth first innings score of 575 for seven declared, Karnataka struck twice in seven overs to have Mohammed Kaifs Uttar Pradesh staggering on the ropes at 11 for two.         
	Shivkant Shukla (0) was done in by a direct hit by Amit Verma from short covers as he scampered to the non-strikers for a sharp single. A wee bit later, Bhuvaneswar Kumar (0) was beaten for pace and trapped right in front of the wickets by the genuinely quick Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	Mondays double hundred was Dravids fifth in Ranji, following his 200 not out against Andhra, 215 vs Uttar Pradesh, 210 vs Hyderabad and 214 vs Mumbai.         
	While lasting 500 minutes at wicket and consuming 340 deliveries, the Karnataka skipper took his aggregate to 4874 runs in 48 matches. Dravid was at his stodgy best, grinding the UP attack to dust on a wicket where the ball rarely rose waist high.         
	Though run-making was difficult, the soon-to-be 37-year-old dug his heels in to ensure that Karnataka ran up a huge total and set themselves up for a place in the January 11-15 final. Dravid was the cog around which the Karnataka innings thrived.         
	He was involved in three substantial partnerships  100 for the sixth wicket with Amit Verma (42), 107 for the seventh with C.M. Gautam (44) and an unbroken 101 for the eighth wicket with Sunil Joshi (41 ..).         
	Amit enlivened the game in the first session with some enterprising strokeplay, but eventually was stumped by Amir Khan, giving Piysuh Chawla his only wicket.         
	Wicket-keeper-batsman Gautam got his eye in, but failed to take a leaf out of ebullient partners book of patience.         
	Having made 44, he fell to the listless left-arm spin of Praveen Gupta.           (PTI)

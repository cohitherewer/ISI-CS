The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Appeal against 3-match ban
                                                                                                                       7                                      Appeal against 3-match ban
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Shivendra        
	New Delhi: Indias hockey World Cup campaign received a severe jolt on Monday when ace striker Shivendra Singh was handed a three-match suspension for deliberately hitting Pakistan midfielder Fareed Ahmed with the hockey stick, an incident later viewed on video by the International Hockey Federation (FIH).         
	India play Australia, considered the toughest team in Pool B, on Tuesday. Shivendras absence will surely be felt as the striker played a key role in the match against Pakistan. Shivendra had never been booked in his 110-match international career and, even in this case, the incident was ignored by the on-field umpires.         
	Minutes after tournament director Australian Ken Read announced the decision, Hockey India (HI) secretary general Narendra Batra filed an appeal against the ban. A decision on the appeal would be taken soon, Read said.         
	While a livid India coach Jose Brasa said Shivendra was penalised for no fault of his, Read said he was confident the foul was deliberate.         
	There was a clear breach of the code of conduct. There is no dispute over the facts of the case. He will be suspended for the next three matches. The Indian team have appealed and we hope to know the jurys ruling soon, Read said.         
	Read said there was no need for the stick to be lifted and that the behaviour of Shivendra was reckless to the safety of Ahmed. The Pakistani player suffered a small cut above the eye. Brasa, on the other hand, blasted the FIH saying it was a very harsh decision that would affect his teams performance.         
	I havent seen such things at any world-level meet, said the experienced coach. To suspend someone for three matches in a seven-match tournament is very harsh and demoralising for the team. The problem is that I am now left with only 15 players for the match against Australia.         
	I know the FIH has the right to do such things during the course of a tournament. But why pick on our team only, asked the Spaniard. Even the other two matches of the day were very physical. No one bothered to keep a check on those.         
	Brasa said he himself watched the video and found nothing wrong with it. The umpires ignored it and there was no complaint from the Pakistan side. Then why did they take away half the World Cup from one of my best players?         
	The FIH has also suspended Pakistans Irfan Mohammed for a game for wearing unapproved gear in the match versus India. Pakistan manager Asif Bajwa has been severely reprimanded.

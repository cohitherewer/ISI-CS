                                                                                                                       7                                      Youngsters are ready to step in, feels Harbhajan
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Harbhajan Singh      
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh feels, unlike Australia, India will have a smooth transition once the senior players quit the international stage.         
	Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath were a huge threat to the opposition. No wonder Ricky Ponting is finding it tough to cope with their absence. The Australians have lost a lot of players and are finding the going tough Hopefully India wont face such a problem. Weve got young and talented players who are confident and ready to take on responsibility. Im confident well do well The youngsters did well in the Test series and the one-dayer versus Australia in Visakhapatnam, Harbhajan, in the city for a promotional organised by i-Core, said.         
	The off-spinner said he was looking forward to Sachin Tendulkars 50th Test hundred.         
	Its going to be the biggest thing Were waiting for him to reach that milestone he has showed that nothing is impossible. Im looking forward to be part of the celebrations and hopefully it will be achieved in Ahmedabad.         
	On the series against New Zealand, Harbhajan said: To be honest, were high on confidence. Weve done well against the Australians and will do well against the Black Caps too.         
	He said the team were not taking the Black Caps lightly, despite their 0-4 loss to Bangladesh. Their 4-0 loss was shocking But we should also remember that Bangladesh are an improved side and other teams need to be careful against them. Bangladesh can be dangerous at home.         
	But, it doesnt mean we can beat them easily. If we stay focused and play to our potential, we will do well, Harbhajan explained. He said he wasnt aware of any move to send some of the players to South Africa early in preparation for the Tests. I dont know I dont have a clue about it as to who is going early and who will be joining late.         
	But he felt the move would help the players acclimatise to the conditions well. Its always nice to go on a tour where you get enough practice before the matches start. It will definitely be a good move because there is hardly any time for preparations.

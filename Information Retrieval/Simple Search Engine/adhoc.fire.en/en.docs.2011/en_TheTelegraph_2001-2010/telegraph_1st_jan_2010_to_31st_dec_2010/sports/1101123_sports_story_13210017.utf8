The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal look for win vs Braga
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arsenal look for win vs Braga
                      
	Braga: Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger will look to lift his teams spirits after a bitterly disappointing weekend in the Premier League when they visit Braga in the Champions League on Tuesday.         
	A victory would put Arsenal through to the knockout stages from Group H, and the odds are stacked in Wengers favour. His side thrashed Braga 6-0 in London in September and the Portuguese team, who are 10th in their domestic league and coming off a 2-1 defeat by Guimaraes, will be without goalkeeper Joaquim Sampaio Quim and striker Paulo Cesar due to injury.         
	However, Wenger expressed his frustration at Arsenals lack of killer instinct after surrendering a 2-0 first-half lead against archrivals Tottenham Hotspur in Saturdays 3-2 derby defeat.         
	Bragas medical director, doctor Joao Pedro Araujo, said Quim was still recovering from an Achilles injury and Brazilian striker Paulo Cesar was battling a left thigh strain.         
	We are all very concentrated and working very hard so that our team can get a good result on Tuesday, said Brazilian striker Elton, recruited earlier this year from Vasco da Gama. I am fully focussed on helping the team and pleasing the fans.         
	Arsenals Moroccan international, Marouane Chamakh, said it was good that his team should be faced with a tough match so quickly after the defeat to Spurs.         
	It will help us to forget the Tottenham game, and we must focus on Braga and get a victory, Chamakh said.         
	Chelsea have already secured a spot in the last 16, but the pressure is building on manager Carlo Ancelotti ahead of Tuesdays Group F home match against Zilina.

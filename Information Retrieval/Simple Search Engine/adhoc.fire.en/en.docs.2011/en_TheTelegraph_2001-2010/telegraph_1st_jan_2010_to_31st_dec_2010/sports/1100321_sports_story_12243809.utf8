The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bollinger puts Aussies on top
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bollinger puts Aussies on top
                      
	Wellington: After being overwhelmed by Michael Clarke and Marcus North in the field, New Zealand watched their top order fail to leave them facing a massive task to save the first Test here.         
	Clarkes outstanding 168 and a career-saving century by North allowed Australia to declare at 459 for five before the hosts limped to 108 for four at stumps Saturday, the second day of the match, according to Cricinfo.         
	Doug Bollinger struck in the first over of New Zealands reply and they were reduced to 43 for four when the left-armer removed Ross Taylor. Daniel Vetori, the No.6, scored an entertaining 42 to limit the damage, with the more subdued Martin Guptill, who had 19.

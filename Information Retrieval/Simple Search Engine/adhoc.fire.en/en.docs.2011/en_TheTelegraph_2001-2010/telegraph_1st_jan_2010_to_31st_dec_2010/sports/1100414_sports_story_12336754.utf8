	Calcutta: Youngster Budiram Tudu struck twice in either half while veteran Rennedy Singh scored once as East Bengal beat Mohammedan AC 3-1 in a Calcutta Football League (CFL) Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium, here, on Tuesday. With this win, East Bengal have 25 points from 12 games. Mohammedan AC also have the same number of points but have played one more game.         
	On Tuesday, Phillippe de Ridders boys gave the usual lacklustre account of themselves.         
	Two of three goals were scored courtesy spot-kicks. It didnt matter in the end as they were facing an opposition who were below par  a team which really have no motivation left to do well in the league after having saved relegation.         
	The red-and gold brigade sealed the deal within 23 minutes when they went 2-0 up. In the 12th minute, Budiram, who was about to score, was brought down by Tapan Giri. Referee Minangshu Bhattacharya promptly pointed at the dreaded spot and Rennedy Singh didnt make any mistake in converting the penalty.         
	The second goal was mainly due to poor anticipation by the Mohammedan AC goalkeeper, Sanjib Kumar Singh, who came out of the 18-yard box and then failed to clear the ball. Budiram, who got the ball from Mumtaz Akhtar, nearly made a mess of it before slotting home.         
	In the 32nd minute Subhas Singh made a mess of an easy chance when he had the rival goalkeeper at his mercy.         
	The second session became a dull and boring affair as the red-and gold brigade didnt press hard enough to increase their tally.         
	The third goal was again through a spot-kick when Prashanta Sarkar brought down Mumtaz inside the box. This time it was Budiram who converted it.         
	Mohammedan AC got a consolation goal in the 84th minute when Mohammed Yasins powerful shot went in.

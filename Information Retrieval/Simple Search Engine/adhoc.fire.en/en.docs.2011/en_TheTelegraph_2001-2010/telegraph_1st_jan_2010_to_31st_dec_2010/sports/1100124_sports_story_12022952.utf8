The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijay, Pragyan in side
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vijay, Pragyan in side
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: With more than one reason at play, the India XI will see as many as four changes when the second and final Test gets under way, in Dhaka, on Sunday.         
	Having won in Chittagong by 113 runs, the visitors are ahead in the series.         
	Regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh have regained fitness  the former had back spasms, while the latter a stiff neck. Then, Murali Vijay is the injured V.V.S. Laxmans replacement and Pragyan Ojha has been chosen to take Amit Mishras place.         
	Vijays an opener, but will bat in the middle-order as the hugely successful Virender Sehwag-Gautam Gambhir partnership wont be disturbed.         
	Gambhir has the chance to emulate Sir Donald Bradmans incredible feat of a hundred in six consecutive Tests.         
	The other two wholl be missing from the XI which did duty in the first Test are Dinesh Karthik (Dhonis replacement) and Sreesanth.         
	Sreesanths injured, but even if he wasnt, its quite likely that he wouldve been dropped and Ishant Sharma retained. The think tank has, after all, gone back to a conventional 2-2 attack.         
	The changes were confirmed, from Dhaka, by a well-placed source of The Telegraph.         
	As for Bangladesh, its learnt that Zunaed Siddique could replace the out-of-form Shahriar Nafees, who was a disaster at No.3 in Chittagong.         
	In contention, too, is all-rounder Naeem Islam, who has been added to the hosts squad.         
	Wanting to attract crowds, and to encourage youngsters, the Bangladesh Cricket Board has announced that the Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium would be free for schoolchildren.         
	They will, of course, have to be in uniform and must carry their ID card.         
	Meanwhile, according to manager Arshad Ayub, Sreesanth returned home on Saturday; Laxman comes back on Sunday.         
	TEAMS         
	INDIA: Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Murali Vijay, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma.         
	BANGLADESH (likely from): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Zunaed Siddique, Mohammed Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Shakib-al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah Riyad, Shahadat Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Rubel Hossain, Naeem Islam.         
	Match starts: 9 am (IST).

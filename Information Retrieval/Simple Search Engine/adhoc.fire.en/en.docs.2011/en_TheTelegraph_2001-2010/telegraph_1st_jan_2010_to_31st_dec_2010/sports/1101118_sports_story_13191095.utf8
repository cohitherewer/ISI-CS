The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi puts it past Brazil
                                                                                                                       7                                      Messi puts it past Brazil
                      
	Doha: Lionel Messi scored a superb goal two minutes into added time to give Argentina a 1-0 win over arch-rivals Brazil in a friendly at Qatars Khalifa International stadium on Wednesday.         
	Messi played a one-two in the middle of the pitch with substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi and raced through the Brazil defence, cutting across to the left to send a low, diagonal, left-footed shot past the diving Victor into the bottom far corner.         
	The match, in which Ronaldinho made a promising Brazil comeback, was a first victory for Argentina over their great South American rivals in six meetings since 2005.         
	Ronaldinho, overlooked for the 2010 World Cup finals, might have scored with a cheeky backheel in the first half but Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero was alert and saved.         
	Messis goal was the first conceded by the new Brazil side coached by Mano Menezes, who had won their three previous friendlies.         
	Sergio Batista was making his debut as Argentina coach after friendly wins over Ireland and world champions Spain and a defeat away to Japan in an interim capacity.           (REUTERS)

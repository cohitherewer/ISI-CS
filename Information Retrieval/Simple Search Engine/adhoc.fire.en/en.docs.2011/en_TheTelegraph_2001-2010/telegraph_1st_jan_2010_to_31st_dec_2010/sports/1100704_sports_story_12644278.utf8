	Sneijder gets a late goal         
	Johannesburg: Wesley Sneijder has been credited with the Netherlands first goal in the 2-1 quarter final win over Brazil.         
	Sneijders cross in the 53rd minute glanced off Felipe Melos head into an unguarded goal in Fridays match and was announced as an own goal by the Brazil midfielder. Fifa says the cross was goalbound and should be credited to Sneijder, whose 68th-minute header then sealed the victory for the Dutch.

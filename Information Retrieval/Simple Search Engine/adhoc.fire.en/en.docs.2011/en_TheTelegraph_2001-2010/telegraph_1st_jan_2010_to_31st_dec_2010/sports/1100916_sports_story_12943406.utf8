  - Dejected Namibia coach criticises free-kick decision              OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            India captain Bhaichung Bhutia (right) and Sunil Chetri during the friendly against Namibia, in New Delhi, on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: A goal in either half from midfielders Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Anthony Pereira helped India salvage some prestige when they defeated Namibia 2-0 in a friendly encounter at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Despite the victory, there was depressing news in the Indian camp when Bhaichung Bhutia fell down while running for a ball during the injury time and had to be replaced by Mohammed Rafi.         
	According to a visibly worried coach Bob Houghton, the captain may have suffered a hamstring injury though it will only be confirmed after a MRI scan on Thursday.         
	Returning to the match, having slid to 160 in the Fifa rankings after two consecutive defeats against Thailand, the home team were under immense pressure to perform, but they came up with a reasonably good display to please their ardent supporters.         
	On the other hand, Namibia, placed 44 places above India in the rankings, dished out a moderate display and only looked good in flashes. The Namibians, despite missing eight professionals, looked an athletic lot because of their impressive height and physique, but the Indian defenders countered the visitors with quick clearances and positional play.         
	The match looked evenly balanced till the 27th minute when Mehrajuddin put India ahead with a rather lucky goal.         
	The relentless East Bengal footballer chased almost every ball that went through the middle and was rewarded with a goal that caught the Namibian goalkeeper Attiel Mbaha on the wrong foot.         
	Mehraj took a snap shot from around 25 yards and as Attiel got himself on the line of the ball, it deflected off the defender Steven Goagab before going into the net through the far post.         
	The second goal from India that came off a free kick when stand-in captain Abhishek Yadav was brought down near the Namibian box was far more convincing. Pereira, who showed good ball skills, took a right footer that curled into the net leaving the rival goalkeeper totally stranded.         
	The Namibian coach, Tom Saintfiet later said he was not happy with the referees decision to award India the free kick.         
	There was no foul, the striker fell down on his own. I dont want to comment on the referee much but I was surprised with some of his decisions, he said.         
	Saintfiet also praised goalkeeper Subroto Paul, who had yet another great day under the bar. Like in the match against Thailand, Paul came up with a couple of exceptional saves that left the Namibian strikers frustrated.         
	Despite the victory over a team that stand higher in the international arena, the grey areas in the Indian midfield remained a matter of discomfort.         
	While Houghtons plan to replace his regular ones with players like Mehraj and Clifford Miranda paid dividend, the lack of a playmaker remained the biggest problem.         
	Teams         
	India: Subrata Paul; Surkumar Singh, Anwar (N.S. Manju 90+), Gourmangi Singh, Mahesh Gawli; Anthony Pereira, Clifford Miranda, N.P.Pradeep, Mehrajuddin Waddoo (Renedy Singh, 82); Sunil Chetri, Abhishek Yadav (Bhaichung Bhutia, 65th, Mohammed Rafi 90+)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Wriddhiman Saha at the JU Salt Lake campus ground, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Ajit Wadekar would be proud to hear of Wriddhiman Sahas dedication towards Mohun Bagan. The former India skipper once rued of the depleting interest among senior Indian cricketers to represent their clubs in domestic or local matches.         
	Wadekar, who represented Shivaji Park Gymkhana for 20 years, ensured he was always available for his club when not on national duty. He, in fact, made his presence doubly sure if they played against arch-rivals Dadar Union.         
	Wriddhiman is neither an India-regular, nor has he spent more than three years in any club in his fledgling career.         
	But his decision to play in the A.N. Ghosh Trophy semi-final against East Bengal, on Sunday, was special given that he returned from Vadodara early morning and straightaway headed to the ground for the match.         
	I always try to play for my club. I was planning to fly in early for the match since day before yesterday. As soon as the tickets were confirmed for the morning flight, I was sure that I would play. Its a big match for us, Wriddhiman said after Mohun Bagan posted a challenging total of 395 for four on Sunday.         
	Though the Bengal wicketkeeper-batsman got run out for a measly 36, he looked cheerful throughout. And, why not? Wriddhiman is India skipper MS Dhonis back-up in the South Africa Test series beginning December 16. He also played the first three ODIs against New Zealand.         
	Theres always a positive feeling when you have been with the Indian team. I am sure the experience will be handy in the South Africa series, he said.         
	Wriddhiman said though he doesnt have time to prepare before leaving for South Africa, the team would get enough time to get used to conditions there.         
	I came today morning and played the match Will leave for Mumbai on Tuesday and next day well be off for South Africa. So, whatever practice is needed will happen there.         
	I am not trying to make any special changes to my keeping for the South Africa series. I dont think the bounce will be too much of a factor. I have played in South Africa during the IPL.         
	So, I have some knowledge of the wickets. We are reaching early before the Test series. The extra time will help us in preparing better for the conditions there, he said.         
	Wriddhiman refused to dwell on the World Cup selection as he felt his immediate concern should be the South Africa Series.         
	Its more important for me to concentrate on the forthcoming (South Africa) series right now. I am not really bothering myself thinking about the World Cup selection. The call will come if it has to come, he said.

	Melbourne: U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro held off James Blake in a marathon five-setter Wednesday, while Justine Henin advanced in her Grand Slam comeback with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) win over fifth-seeded Elena Dementieva.         
	Fourth-seeded del Potro beat his 30-year-old American rival 6-4, 6-7 (3), 5-7, 6-3, 10-8 in 4 hours, 17 minutes on Hisense Arena, the second showcourt at Melbourne Park.         
	Seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Henin, meanwhile, was producing the biggest win of her comeback from 20 months in retirement with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) defeat of Dementieva in the night match on Rod Laver Arena.         
	The win for the unranked Henin was another step closer to a possible quarterfinal match against U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters, who scored a 6-3, 6-3 win over Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand.         
	It was very emotional for me on the court at the end because there was so much intensity, Henin said. Its magical to win this kind of match in this kind of atmosphere.         
	It was Clijsters U.S. Open title only three tournaments back from two years in retirement that inspired Henin, her fellow Belgian, to return to the Tour.         
	Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick had earlier continued their paths towards a possible semi-final matchup.         
	But the thread that ties Nadal and Roddick together from 2009  Roger Federer, who beat Roddick in the semis last year before losing to Nadal in the final - will likely still have something to say about who the eventual champion is on January 31. The top-seeeded Swiss star is on the other side of the draw and couldnt meet either Nadal or Roddick until the final.         
	Nadal breezed to a 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 second-round win over Lukas Lacko of Slovakia while Roddick was equally untroubled by his opponent in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Brazils Thomaz Bellucci.         
	Britains Andy Murray, who could meet Nadal in the quarter finals, advanced to the third round after beating Marc Gicquel of France 6-1, 6-4, 6-3. Murray is attempting to win his first Grand Slam title and become the first British man in more than 70 years to win a singles Major.         
	Del Potro, who beat Federer in last years U.S. Open final, had a chance to serve for the match at 6-5 in the fifth after breaking Blake. However, Blake broke back immediately, helped by two errors from the 21-year-old Argentine.         
	Del Potro again broke Blake for a 9-8 lead and another chance to serve it out. He closed with a big serve out to Blakes backhand side on his first match point.         
	Blake fell to 4-13 in five-set matches. Its tough to rank them, Blake said of his losses over the distance. But right now it hurts pretty bad.         
	Del Potro has been bothered by tendinitis in his right wrist that first cropped up late last year and caused him to pull out of the semi-finals of the Kooyong exhibition tournament last week.         
	When asked if he was in pain, he said: A little bit. But I can play.         
	Roddick argued with the chair umpire, Fergus Murphy of Ireland, over a disputed call at a critical time that was ruled out when it was eventually shown to be in. Roddick felt he possibly could have returned the ball if it had not been called out, and let the umpire know in no uncertain terms.         
	The Hisense Arena crowd didnt appreciate Roddick continuing the verbal jousting with Murphy after the match ended and booed the American.         
	The former No. 1-ranked Roddick took time to review video after the match, and was conciliatory in a news conference that followed.         
	Next up for the 26-year-old Clijsters will be No. 19 Nadia Petrova, one of the Russian women already into the third round along with French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, last years Australian Open runner-up Dinara Safina and Maria Kirilenko.         
	Third-ranked Kuznetsova beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 6-2 and No. 2 Safina had a 6-3, 6-4 win over Barbora Sahlavova Strycova.         
	In a late match, Croatias Marin Cilic survived a titanic battle with tyro Bernard Tomic to reach the third round.         
	The tournaments 14th seed was pushed to the brink by the 17-year-old Australian before his superior experience helped him seal a 6-7, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory.         
	Cilic, who is undefeated this year after successfully defending his title in Chennai, twice fought his way back from a set down and then fought off three break points late in the fifth set before getting the vital break himself.         
	I feel very tired, Cilic said after a match that lasted almost four hours and did not finish until after 2am local time.         
	Meanwhile, Somdev Dev Varman and Prakash Amritraj fought their way into the second round of the mens doubles event of the Australian Open but Rohan Bopannas challenge came to an end with a first round defeat.         
	Wild card entrants Somdev and Prakash had to dig deep to beat Americans James Cerretani and Travis Rettenmaier 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in their opening round at Melbourne Park.         
	In contrast, Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi squandered one set lead to lose 6-4 1-6 6-7(6) to South African Rik de Voest and Scott Lipsky of the United States. (Agencies)

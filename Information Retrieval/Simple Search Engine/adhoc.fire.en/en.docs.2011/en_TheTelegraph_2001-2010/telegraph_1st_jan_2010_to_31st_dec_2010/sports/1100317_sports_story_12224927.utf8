The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Masters return at Augusta
                                                                                                                       7                                      Masters return at Augusta
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                                        Tiger Woods        
	Tiger Woods has confirmed he will return to golf at The Masters next month. Woods will tee it up at Augusta National on April 8, more than five months after the infamous car crash outside his Florida home that which led to a series of revelations about the world No1s infidelity, and, eventually, his withdrawal from the sport and a spell in rehab.         
	Woods has been pictured practising, leading to speculation he could return to action in the Tavistock Cup next Monday and Tuesday, or the Arnold Palmer Invitational later the same week.         
	However, Woods has now confirmed that Augusta will be his first tournament back  a decision which will anger many of his fellow professionals.         
	When I finally got into a position to think about competitive golf again, it became apparent to me that The Masters would be the earliest I could play, said Woods in a statement.         
	I called both Joe Lewis and Arnold Palmer and expressed my regrets for not attending the Tavistock Cup (next Monday and Tuesday) and the Arnold Palmer Invitational (from March 25-28).         
	I again want to thank them both for their support and their understanding. Those are fantastic tournaments and I look forward to competing in them again.         
	I would also like to thank the Augusta National members and staff for their support.         
	I have deep appreciation for everything that they do to create a wonderful event for the benefit of the game.         
	Augusta National chairman Billy Payne said in a separate statement: We support Tigers decision to return to competitive golf, beginning at this years Masters tournament.         
	Additionally, we support and encourage his stated commitment to continue the significant work required to rebuild his personal and professional life.         
	Making the first major of the season  an event Woods has won four times  his first tournament back will anger many players, who are asked about Woods wherever they go.         
	World No. 2 Steve Stricker said at the weekend: Whenever he comes back its going to draw a lot of attention to that tournament.         
	I dont know if Augusta would like that to happen, you know? To turn it into Tigers Comeback Tournament instead of the Masters tournament, itself.         
	Hopefully, he comes back before then. Youd think, as a player, being gone for so long, hed want to come back before.         
	The exclusivity of Augusta National, which counts Bill Gates and Warren Buffet among its members, would presumably have appealed to Woods as he seeks to ease his way back into the limelight.         
	Press accreditation is notoriously strict, while fans  or patrons, as they are referred to  are less rowdy than at other tournaments.

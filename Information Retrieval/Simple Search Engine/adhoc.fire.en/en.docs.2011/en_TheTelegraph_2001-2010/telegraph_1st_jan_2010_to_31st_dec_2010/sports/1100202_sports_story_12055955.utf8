                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand ends   joint 4th
                            
	Wijk Aan Zee: World champion Viswanathan Anand failed to replicate his superb form of the last few rounds as he drew his final game in the A group against Loek van Wely of Holland to finish joint fourth in the Corus Chess tournament here.         
	Anand, who had beaten strong opponents Vladimir Kramnik of Russia and Alexei Shirov of Spain, tried his best with black pieces but Van Wely was quite up to task in defending and the game was eventually drawn.         
	World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen of Norway won the title after a draw with Fabiano Caruana (PTI)

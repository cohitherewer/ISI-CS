The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haney is happy he said bye to Woods
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haney is happy he said bye to Woods
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH amp; AGENCIES                                Tiger Woods      
	sTiger Woods former swing coach, Hank Haney, says he is relieved to have parted ways with the world No. 1 after six years of working together.         
	The 54 year-old decided to quit last week after Woods failed to publicly reject the storm of criticism directed at Haney in the wake of the world No 1 missing the cut at the Quail Hollow Championship. Haney insists that he had not even been working with Woods at the time.         
	I wish he had stood up in a press conference and announced, at the very least, that he was sick of all the criticism, that he backed me and that he believed in me, says Haney. But he never did.         
	The experienced coach made the decision to end his association with Woods after the golfer instead insisted that the pair were still working together.         
	It was a tough decision, one I went back and forth on many times, Haney said. I sent him a text. I wished him the best and told him I hope he finds someone else to help him.         
	He first responded: Thanks. Then two seconds later he said again: Were just taking a break right? I told him: No, were done.         
	When all is said and done, Im better off out of it. Thats the bottom line. It is a huge weight off my shoulders.         
	Despite their split, Haney  who won six Majors with Woods  hopes his former client can rediscover his best form after a troubled return to the US Tour.         
	My record with him is what it is; it will never be approached, he said. In the past two and a half years Tiger has won 44 per cent of his tournaments. Hes been in the top 10 for 85 per cent of the time. All I can say is: Good luck.         
	Tiger Woods and I will always be friends, but I believe that there is a time and place for everything, and I feel at this time in my life, I want to move forward in other areas, Haney added.         
	As we all know, Tiger has been through a lot in the last six months and I believe that given the chance, mind-free and injury-free, we will all see (him) play once again like we all know he can.         
	Meanwhile, Woods has added the July 15-18 British Open to his playing schedule for this year, though he is still sidelined with a lingering neck injury.         
	According to his website, Woods will compete in the years third major at St Andrews in Scotland, having already committed to the June 17-20 US Open and the July 1-4 AT amp;T National.         
	Woods has lifted the prized claret jug the last two times the British Open was held at St Andrews  in 2000 and 2005.

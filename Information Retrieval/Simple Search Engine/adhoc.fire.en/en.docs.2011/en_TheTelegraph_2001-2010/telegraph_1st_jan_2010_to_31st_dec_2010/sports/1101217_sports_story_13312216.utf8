The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan: We will strike back
                                                                                                                       7                                      Harbhajan: We will strike back
                      
	Centurion: India might have been reeling at 136 for nine on the first day of the opening Test but spinner Harbhajan Singh said the match is still not over and that Indians have enough ammunition to strike back.         
	The senior off-spinner said the toss played a crucial role in the opening Test, which was delayed by four hours because of overnight and early rain at the SuperSport Park.         
	It was bad day for us. Losing toss was the most crucial blow as the wicket was clearly damp. Ball was doing quite a bit. It was swinging and cutting too, Harbjhajan said after the match.         
	But I would like to say that still the match is not over. We will strike back. We need to collect as many runs as possible and then try and bowl well to restrict them in the first innings. We have a very good and experienced batting line-up. They will score good amount of runs in the second inning. I only hope that this wicket will keep on assisting bowlers.         
	Asked about his bizarre dismissal, Harbhajan said it was very disappointing as he was batting well.         
	He also heaped praise on South African bowlers for exploiting the seaming conditions well. (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Morgan has a dream
            A STAFF REPORTER            Trevor Morgan at the East Bengal ground, on Saturday                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan is not thinking much about the red and golds recent abysmally bad performances. Instead, he is confident that he would be able to pull the team out of the rut they have found themselves in, for the last few seasons.         
	At his first media conference at the club tent on Saturday, which, in fact, clashed with the Diego Forlan Show, the former Hull City development squad coach, said he was looking forward to his stint with the Alvito DCunhas.         
	Morgan, however, didnt seem to have much idea about Indian football, except for some information on the Internet and a few clippings of derby ties on YouTube.         
	Every team has a dream. We would want to win every match and play in the AFC Cup.         
	Morgan will meet the East Bengal players Monday.         
	Goalkeeping coach Atanu Bhattacharya and assistant coach Tushar Rakshit will continue to be part of the support staff, while a full-time physical trainer will be appointed soon.

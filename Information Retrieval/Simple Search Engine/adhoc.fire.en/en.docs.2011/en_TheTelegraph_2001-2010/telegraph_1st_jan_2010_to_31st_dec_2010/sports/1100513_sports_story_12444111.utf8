The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | After a good day in office, it was fruit punch for Kumar
                                                                                                                       7                                        After a good day in office, it was fruit punch for Kumar
    - We know what England are capable of, says Sri Lanka captain             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kumar Sangakkara                                 
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): After an excellent day in the office, on Tuesday, it was time for Kumar Sangakkara and his men to unwind.         
	They did so at the bar of the Bay Gardens Beach Resort, being together for an hour or so before breaking off dinner.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph over fruit punch, a visibly delighted Sangakkara said: There was no question, we were going for a win (164 the target)... While that had been the message to the team, the management did also look at the possibility of getting past 143, at least...         
	He added: Frankly, with the start India got, Id been preparing myself to chase 180 or so... The bowlers did a great job and, then, two young players (Angelo Mathew, Chamara Kapugedera) took on a leadership role to guide us through...         
	Looking ahead, to Thursdays World Twenty20 semi-final against England, Sangakkara made the point that it would be a fresh start with no carried-over baggage, good or bad.         
	During our conversation, Sangakkara phoned the manager, Anura Tennekoon, to say that the bills at the bar be debited to his captains allowance account.         
	Grinning, he said: The Board gives me an annual allowance and I spend the amount at team dinners and during celebrations such as this evenings... Its all for the boys.         
	A couple of minutes later, it was time for Sangakkara to receive a call  from wife Yehali. It was as early as 5.30 in Sri Lanka (on Wednesday) and he suggested that she go back to sleep and call later.         
	Daughter Swyree, one of the Sangakkara twins (the other being son Kavith), had woken up her mother.         
	Meanwhile, interacting with the media on the eve of the semi-final, Sangakkara felt the current England team had a lot more balance. We know what theyre capable of.         
	Asked if conditions here would suit his attack more, Sangakkara replied: Id like to think so, but well have to execute the plans to our strengths... At the end of the day, were in the West Indies to do a job... We had a good day yesterday and, now, I hope we have a better one tomorrow...         
	When informed that Englands key player Kevin Pietersen would be jetting in later in the day, in time for the face-off, Sangakkara remarked: Hell be a huge source of strength for his team and will give us something more to think about.         
	Pietersen, a former captain, went home for a few days as wife Jessica was to give birth to their first child. A son, as it turned out.

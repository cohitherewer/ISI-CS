The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Eagles aim to soar vs Greece
                                                                                                                       7                                      Super Eagles aim to soar vs Greece
                      
	Bloemfontein: Nigeria are keeping everyone guessing about their plans for the World Cup Group B match with Greece on Thursday, training in seclusion on the Indian Ocean coast since their defeat by Argentina.         
	Both sides desperately ne-ed points from the clash in Bloemfonteins Free State Stadium to keep alive their hopes of reaching the second round. The omens do not favour the Greeks. Nigeria have largely kept their own counsel at their camp at Richards Bay north of Durban, where the British army planned its campaign against the Zulus in the 19th Century.         
	The Super Eagles could take some encouragement from Saturdays 1-0 defeat against an adventurous Argentina side in Johannesburg, a game lit up by Lionel Messi.         
	Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama made a series of excellent saves, a stubborn defence helped keep the score down, and the attack caused the South Americans sporadic problems. Fortunately, full-back Taye Taiwo recovered quickly after being taken off injured and resumed training on Sunday.         
	Nigerias Swedish coach Lars Lagerback will have to decide whether to stick with Chinedu Obasi on the right side of the attack, after he started promisingly but tired quickly and was replaced by the experienced Peter Odemwingie on the hour.         
	Although a perennial powerhouse in African soccer, Nigeria have struggled to blend seasoned veterans with the younger generation. Lagerback was appointed in February after Shaibu Amodus sacking but has only worked with the players since May.         
	However, they can count on the support not only of the many Nigerians in South Africa but also across a continent dreaming of an African triumph in the first World Cup it has hosted. All four of Nigerias World Cup wins have been against European opposition including a 2-0 win over Greece in 1994.         
	For the Greeks, the fact a side built on solid defence let its guard down in a 2-0 defeat by lively South Korea in Port Elizabeth on Saturday is a worry.         
	Coach Otto Rehhagel has warned his players they cannot afford another lapse in concentration.         
	Greece have yet to score at a World Cup and failure to do so against Nigeria would leave them staring elimination in the face ahead of their last group game against Argentina.         
	Rehhagel is likely to make several changes, adding some muscle with centre-back Socratis Papastathopoulos and Sotiris Kyrgiakos.

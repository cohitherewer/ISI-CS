The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saha keen to prove mettle
                                                                                                                       7                                      Saha keen to prove mettle
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Wriddhiman Saha got his maiden Test cap for India by chance, but the wicketkeeper, who has been picked for the first two ODIs against New Zealand in the absence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, said he would prove his mettle to cement his place in the side.         
	This will be an excellent opportunity for the youngster because if he proves himself in these two matches, there is a good chance that he will be retained for the remainder of the one-day series.         
	A last-minute injury to Rohit Sharma had handed Saha an unexpected Test debut earlier this year against South Africa. Even for the New Zealand series starting Sunday, he has been picked after Dhoni was given a break.         
	Picked ahead of the more experienced Dinesh Karthik for the first two ODIs and the Test series in South Africa, the Bengal player, who is fresh from a brilliant 178 not out against Assam in a record 417-run stand with Laxmi Ratan Shukla, says he is not under any pressure.         
	Hopefully, I can contribute in both the departments (wicket-keeping and batting) of the game and help the team win the first two ODIs, he said.         
	Honestly Im not thinking about the World Cup at the moment. I dont want to lose focus and dont want to think much. The idea is to stay pressure-free. My job now is to perform in the first two matches, Saha said. Keeping the wickets will be my main job. Obviously, I have to contribute with the bat as well depending on the team situation. I would look to improvise.

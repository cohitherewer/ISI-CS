The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali faced no racism: Waugh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murali faced no racism: Waugh
                      
	Chandigarh: Showering praise on retired Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, former Australian captain Steve Waugh said, on Monday, that there was no racist angle involved in chucking allegations which the bowler had faced earlier.         
	Muralidharan brought down the curtains on his glittering 18-year-old Test career after reaching 800-wicket mark in his swansong Test against India last week.         
	Murali is a great player who has created an unbeatable and amazing record of 800 Test wickets. We admire the skills he has brought to the game.         
	Some people had some things to say, but at the end of the day, he is a different element, who has on 67 occasions taken five wickets in a game, Waugh told the media.         
	When asked that it was the Australian umpires, who had called him for throwing after which chucking allegations were levelled against Muralidharan and if all these had been racially motivated, Waugh said, forget racial thing, that card always gets played.         
	It was certainly not a racist thing. We should celebrate that he (Murali) has played so successfully, he said.         
	Waugh said there were consequences to the decision of the umpires, which was a big decision which they had taken and one could always debate about that.         
	Along with Muralidhran, Waugh said players such as Sachin Tendulkar were rare to find. He added the way the master batsman was going, he could soon reach his 50th Test hundred.         
	He also rated the current crop of spinners including Englands Graeme Swann and Aussie Nathan Hauritz as promising. He also praised Indias off spinner Harbhajan Singh, though he said he was somewhat inconsistent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB flip-flop on match-fixing
                                                                                                                       7                                        PCB flip-flop on match-fixing
                  Kamran Akmal is under the scanner                     
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt did a flip-flop on Friday by first telling a press conference that two Pakistani cricketers are suspected of match-fixing and then denying the statement and claiming that he had been merely referring to old cases.         
	The PCB chief stirred a hornets nest when he told a press conference in Lahore that two players were suspected of being involved in match-fixing.         
	We are waiting for a report from the inquiry committee we have set up to probe into the teams poor performances in Australia, Butt said.         
	Once the inquiry committee gives it report, I will comment further on this issue, he said.         
	Butts remarks came on the same day that a section of the Pakistani media reported that wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal is being investigated for his alleged involvement in match-fixing.         
	The media reported that Akmal came under the scanner for dropping three crucial catches and missing a clear run out chance in the second Test against Australia in Sydney.         
	If he fails to prove his innocence, Kamran may be overlooked for the ICC World Twenty20 Cup in the Caribbean where Pakistan will be looking to defend their title this May, a source was quoted as saying.         
	Butt subsequently changed his stance and claimed he had basically spoken with reference to some old cases. I was not talking about current players at all, people have misunderstood me and misquoted me, he said.         
	PCB general-manager (media) Nadeem Sarwar sprang into a damage control exercise, claiming the press had misinterpreted the whole affair.         
	The chairman was asked a question on the issue of match-fixing and he spoke with relation to old cases and said that the ICC had, at one time, conveyed to the PCB the names of two players who were suspected of being involved in match fixing, Sarwar said. He was speaking in context of old cases and not about any current player, he claimed.         
	It is entirely wrong to interpret that Ejaz Butt has said that two current players were involved in match fixing, Sarwar said.         
	The inquiry committee is looking at the teams performances and cases of discipline. Match-fixing is not its domain. Ejaz Butt spoke about the committee in that reference not in reference to any match fixing issue, the PCB official said. (PTI)

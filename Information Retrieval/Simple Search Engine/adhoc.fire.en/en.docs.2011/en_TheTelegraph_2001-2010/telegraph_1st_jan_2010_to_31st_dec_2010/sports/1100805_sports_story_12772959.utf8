The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirdi in final talks to buy Liverpool
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kirdi in final talks to buy Liverpool
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	London: Syrian businessman Yahya Kirdi said on Wednesday he was in the final stages of negotiations to buy Liverpool, as reports mounted of a wave of bids to buy the Premier League club.         
	Kirdi said in a statement agreement had been reached on all major terms including the purchase price, repayment of the existing bank debt... and financing of a new stadium in Liverpools Stanley Park.         
	A formal purchase agreement between the parties is in the final stage of negotiation, the statement read. Canada-based Kirdi was also widely talked of as a possible purchaser in April without a deal emerging and a local newspaper and other media reported as many as six potential bidders.         
	Earlier, Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, who was widely reported to be close to a purchase earlier this week, issued a statement denying he had made any formal offer.         
	Huang, a Guangdong-born U.S. citizen who already has interests in Chinese baseball and U.S. basketball, had a statement issued on his behalf by his Hong Kong representatives.         
	Huang would like to emphasise that he has registered interest in investing in Liverpool FC but has made no formal bid, it said.         
	There has been much speculation and commentary from a wide array of people, many of whom have little knowledge of the facts Unless there is a statement that specifically comes from Mr Huang or his authorised representatives... we would suggest such comments should be given little credence, it added.         
	A source close to Huang told the media earlier that talks to buy Liverpools  237 million debt with major creditor Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) were underway, as a first step towards acquiring control of the 18-times English champions. RBS denied any talks on a sale.         
	Liverpool owners Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett, who bought the club in February 2007 from former owner David Moores for 218.9 million, instructed Barclays Capital in April to find a buyer.         
	They have appointed British Airways chief Martin Broughton as chairman to oversee the sale. Amidst the takeover drama, a sign of encouragement came from Fernando Torres. The striker from the World Cup-winning side brought months of speculation to an end by committing his immediate future to Liverpool as the prospect of an end to the clubs three years of financial plight under Hicks and Gillett.         
	 My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed, Torres said.

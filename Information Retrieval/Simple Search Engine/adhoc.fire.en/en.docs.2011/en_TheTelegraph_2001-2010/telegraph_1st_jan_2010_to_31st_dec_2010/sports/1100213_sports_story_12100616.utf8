The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods treated rehab as a joke
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods treated rehab as a joke
                                  Tiger woods      
	Tiger Woods has treated his sex addiction rehab as a joke. A British tabloid reported that the golfing superstar, who stayed in the clinic for six weeks, was angry and hostlie throughout.         
	He exploded with rage at a woman patient, leaving her in tears a source was quoted as saying. And, while in rehab, Woods never admitted having a problem. His so-called rehabilitation is a joke, the source added.         
	The 34-year-old checked into the clinic to save his marriage after 14 women said they had affairs with him.         
	Tigers wife Elin though has started digging into something that could put the brakes on all those stories of reconciliation, a celebrity website has reported.         
	And for that, blame it on the information former madam Michelle Braun has been revealing over the past month.         
	Braun claimed Tiger paid hundreds of thousands for call girls and required various favours (you know what) from the women he hired. According to Braun, Woods shelled out more than $250,000 in one year for high-end prostitutes she supplied.         
	Initially Elin ignored all the reports but later on was intrigued by those juicy stories.         
	Shes confronted Tiger about it, and I dont think she was happy with his answers or excuses. Its more proof that he will probably never change, no matter how much he says this is all in his past, a source revealed.         
	Meanwhile, Tigers friends in the fairway are surprised to have not heard from Woods in the last two months.         
	Im disappointed, Meara told a website. Im disappointed for my friend. I was shocked like the rest of us were shocked. I dont think anybody would agree with what happened.         
	For those who came in late, the two-time Major winner guided Woods through the early part of his career and used to be a neighbour at Isleworth.         
	I think hell probably do something with the media eventually. I think people will forgive. But its going to be hard to forget for sure.         
	The 53-year-old said he tried to reach him after those stories came out of the closet because he was concerned for his well-being. I am really concerned, he said.         
	Well, the entire world is, actually.           (AGENCIES)

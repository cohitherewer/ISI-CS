The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Third career victory for Mark Webber 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Third career victory for Mark Webber 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Mark Webber after his win, on Sunday                           
	Mark Webber became the first driver to win from pole this season at the Spanish Grand Prix while late catastrophe struck Lewis Hamilton. The 33-year-old Australian, starting from his third pole position, made the most of that advantage to hold his place in the crush on the opening lap, resisting all attacks at the first corner, and streaking clear of the field.         
	It was the third win of his career and first since last years Brazilian Grand Prix after he had become the first Australian victor since Alan Jones in 1981 when he claimed his maiden win in Germany  and will have injected priceless belief in his bid to challenge for the championship.         
	Webber came home 24 seconds clear of home hero, two-time champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso of Ferrari, who profitted from two dramatic late incidents to climb from fourth and give the big Catalan crowd good reason to celebrate.         
	Lewis Hamilton of McLaren looked certain to finish second until he suffered a puncture on his penultimate lap of the 66-laps contest and crashed off the track, his front left wheel almost wrenched off his car.         
	This gave Alonso his second place and also enabled Webbers Red Bull teammate German Sebastian Vettel to take third despite having to take an additional pit-stop in the closing stages after he had gone off into a gravel trap.         
	Seven-time champion German Michael Schumacher, 41, came home fourth ahead of fifth-placed defending champion Briton Jenson Button in the second McLaren.         
	Adrian Sutils seventh place finish brought Force India back among the points again but Hispania driver Karun Chandhoks hopes of a third successive finish were dashed after a tangle with Toro Rossos Jamie Alguersuari.

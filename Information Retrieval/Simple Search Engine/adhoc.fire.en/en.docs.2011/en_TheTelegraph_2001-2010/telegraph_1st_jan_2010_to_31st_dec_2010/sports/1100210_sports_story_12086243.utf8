                                                                                                                       7                                        Australians make it 2-0

	Adelaide: Four West Indian wickets had fallen for 16 runs and the visitors were subsequently all out for 170 in 39.4 overs in the second ODI against Australia Tuesday which the hosts won by eight wickets and 141 balls to spare.         
	According to Cricinfo, the match was effectively sealed from the first ball when Chris Gayle fell and Australia ran over a disappointing West Indies to earn a 2-0 lead in the five-match ODI series.         
	The tourists were out-classed by pacer Doug Bollinger who scalped four for 28 runs including openers Gayle and Runako Morton.         
	Chasing, Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting skipped to half-centuries as the win came in the 27th over. The Aussies produced another relentless show.

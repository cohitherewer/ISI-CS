                                                                                                                       7                                      French, Czech are 1-0 ahead
                      
	Lyon: Michael Llodra produced some fine attacking tennis to put France 1-0 ahead against Argentina in their Davis Cup semi-final, with a 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Juan Monaco, on Friday.         
	World No. 30 Llodra went to the net, served well and recovered from a second-set hiccup to prevail after three hours and 21 minutes. Llodra cancelled out an early break to bag the opening set with a superb forehand down the line, triggering wild celebrations in a packed Palais des Sports. Llodra conceded the second set as Monaco peppered the court with forehand winners.         
	Llodra continued to attack and broke Monacos resilience on his fifth set point to move ahead courtesy of a dazzling backhand down the line.         
	The Parisian stayed hot in the fourth set, dropping only five points on his serve to end the contest with his 22nd ace.         
	Meanwhile, Radek Stepanek fought back from a set down to beat Viktor Troicki 4-6 6-2 6-4 6-4 and give the Czech Republic a 1-0 lead over Serbia, in the Davis Cup semi-final match.         
	Troicki, who stood in for Novak Djokovic after the world No. 2 pulled out of the opening singles rubber with gastro-enteritis, was thoroughly outplayed by Stepanek after winning the opening set.         
	Djokovic, who was exhausted on arrival in Belgrade from New York late on Wednesday after losing the US Open final to Rafael Nadal, said he hoped to be fit for Saturdays doubles.

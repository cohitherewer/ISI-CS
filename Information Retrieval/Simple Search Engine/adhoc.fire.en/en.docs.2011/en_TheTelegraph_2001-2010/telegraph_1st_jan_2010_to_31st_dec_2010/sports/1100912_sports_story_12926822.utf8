	London: Mohammed Aamers alleged involvement in the spot-fixing scandal has cost the Pakistani teen pace sensation a possible 100,000 contract with English county side Yorkshire.         
	Aamer, along with Pakistan Test skipper Salman Butt and fellow pacer Mohammed Asif, was suspended by the International Cricket Council after his name cropped up in a betting scam exposed by a British tabloid.         
	The 18-year-old, who flew back to Pakistan with Butt and Asif, was Yorkshires choice to be the overseas player for 2011.         
	But the plan was scuppered as soon as Aamer was charged by the ICCs anti-corruption unit, an English newspaper reported.           (PTI)

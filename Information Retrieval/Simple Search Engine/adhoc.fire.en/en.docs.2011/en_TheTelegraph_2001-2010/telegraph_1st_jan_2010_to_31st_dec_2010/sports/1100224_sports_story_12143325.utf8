The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Know what went wrong: Van Zyl
                                                                                                                       7                                      Know what went wrong: Van Zyl
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gwalior: South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl on Tuesday said that the team is hoping to draw level in the one-day series. At a press conference, he said that they faltered in batting and bowling in the first one-dayer in Jaipur.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The reasons for Jaipur defeat         
	I think in two of the three departments, we didnt do the basics well. I thought our fielding was exceptional, but in batting and bowling, there were certain basics that we just didnt adhere to Thats why we were on the wrong end of the result.         
	Batting in the first ODI         
	Everybody knows that having wickets in hand is really important for any team in one-day cricket, and unfortunately, we lost too many wickets.         
	If the South African batsmen are disappointed with themselves         
	I am sure theyre a little disappointed, but thats cricket. My role is to try and get them to perform and get them back to their previous form. They are aware of that, they are working really hard. Their work ethics have always been good. Ive always maintained that when you have quality players like JP Duminy and AB de Villiers, form is temporary, and class will come through eventually.         
	Not picking Hashim Amla in Jaipur         
	Hashim wasnt originally selected for the one-day series. He came in once Graeme (Smith) was injured. So I think its only fair on the other guys who were selected that they get the first chance. But we are going to give everybody a go.         
	If Amla would find a place in the team Wednesday         
	We are a group of 16 players on this tour... This is the place where the 2011 World Cup is going to happen. We would like to see how the players in the current group perform in these conditions. So rotation is definitely a policy for the remainder of this series.         
	Any specific plan for Virender Sehwag considering the short boundaries here         
	Whether it is a big field or a small field, the ball still needs to be hit in exactly the same place We just got to make sure that we bowl in the areas that we have decided on, the rest we cant determine. Remember hes not the only batsman, there are others who can hit the ball out of the ground.

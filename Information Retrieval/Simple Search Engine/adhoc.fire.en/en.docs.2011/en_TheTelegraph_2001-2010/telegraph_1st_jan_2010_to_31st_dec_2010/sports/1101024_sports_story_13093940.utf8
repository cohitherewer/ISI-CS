                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal make final round
            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: Bengal continued their good run in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament, picking up their third victory on the trot as they beat Tripura by 45 runs, in Cuttack, on Saturday.         
	The win earned Bengal a place in the knockout stage tournament.         
	 [Orissa, too, made it to the next round with their third straight victory, beating Jharkhand by five wickets.]         
	Batting first, Bengal rode on some solid batting performances by opener Sreevats Goswami (39) and captain Manoj Tiwary (40) to put up 123 for six in their 20 overs. The duo shared a 69-run third wicket partnership.         
	For Tripura, medium-pacers Rana Dutta and Rajib Saha took three wickets each.         
	The Bengal bowlers, who are having an excellent tournament, once again put up a match-winning show with their controlled line and length.         
	They restricted Tripura to a measly 78, with six of the batsmen managing single-digit scores.         
	Tripura briefly put up a fight, moving to 47 for three, before losing five wickets for 10 runs to virtually extinguish their chances of making it to the knockout stage.         
	Four members of the Bengal attack had economy-rates below four as they stifled Tripura. Left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena was the most successful, finishing with three for 14.         
	Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman said that the decision to drop opener Arindam Das was taken keeping the Ranji Trophy in mind.         
	Anustup Majumdar opened the innings with Goswami against Tripura.         
	We wanted to have a look at the others. Also we didnt want Arindam to get too much into the T20 mode since the Ranji Trophy is coming up, Raman said.         
	Raman also lauded his spinners for their brilliant effort on Saturday.         
	Bengals last match is against Orissa, on Sunday.

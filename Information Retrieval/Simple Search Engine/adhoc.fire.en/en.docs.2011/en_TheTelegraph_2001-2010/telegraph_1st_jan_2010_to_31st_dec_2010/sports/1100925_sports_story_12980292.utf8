	Durban: Chennai Super Kings rode a superb unbeaten 94 from Suresh Raina to reach 174 for four in a rain-shortened semi-final against Royal Challengers Bangalore, in the Champions League T20 match, on Friday.         
	The match was reduced to 17 overs for each team after rain played spoilsport.               
	At the end of 13 overs, Royal Challengers Bangalore were on the verge of losing to the Chennai Super Kings. Requiring 175, they were 90 for six. Manish Pandey and Praveen Kumar were at the wicket.               
	Raina, who cracked five fours and six sixes during his breezy stay in the middle, produced an 81-run second-wicket partnership with opener Murali Vijay to help the Indian Premier League champions accumulate a challenging total.         
	Vijay also extended fine support with a 32-ball 41, which he made with the help of four fours and a six.         
	Earlier opting to bat, Chennai were 15 without loss in 2.5 overs, with Vijay and Michael Hussey (6) on the crease, when rain started and the players ran for cover.         
	The proceedings resumed after a two-hour-and-36-minute delay and Chennai suffered their first loss when medium pacer R.Vinay Kumar capitalised on the sodden track in the fourth over.         
	Hussey tried to send the ball across the rope over the long off but South African Dale Steyn took a beautiful catch.         
	Suresh Raina then joined Vijay in the middle and the duo started attacking the RCB bowlers on a sodden Kingsmead pitch, where the balls were coming to the bat a bit slowly.         
	In the sixth over, Raina cracked two huge sixes off Virat Kohlis medium pace. Raina took aerial route to send the second ball of the over to the gallery and then struck him over long on for the maximum again four balls later.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis side were 90 for one after 10 overs.           (AGENCIES)

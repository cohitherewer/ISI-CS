	London: Frank Lampard has followed up his return to action after a three-month absence by predicting that Chelsea will retain the Premier League title if they reproduce the spirit shown in Sundays 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur.         
	Lampard, out since August with groin problems, came on for the last 12 minutes at White Hart Lane and was buoyed by his teams performance. If we play with the spirit we showed, I have no doubt well win the league, because weve got the quality in our team, he said.         
	Injuries have been tough on us, certain moments have been tough on us. But with the spirit and ability weve got in our team, if we play like that, Ive got all confidence that we can do it. Man City are there now, Man United, Arsenal and teams like Tottenham are pushing behind. So we have to be at our best, Lampard asserted.

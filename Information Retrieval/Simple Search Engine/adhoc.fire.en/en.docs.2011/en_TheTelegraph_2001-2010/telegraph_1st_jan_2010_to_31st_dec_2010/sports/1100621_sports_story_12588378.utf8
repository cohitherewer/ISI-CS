	Horns not a spot of bother  
	Johannesburg: The World Cups local organising committee are confident that vuvuzela-blowing fans will respect the tension of penalty shootouts once the tournament reaches the knockout stages.  
	I must say that spectators have been receptive to announcements in the stadiums to keep quiet when they are asked to do so, and they respect what is going on on the pitch, communications chief Rich Mkhondo said.         
	Class appeal         
	Dhaka: A top public university in Bangladesh closed indefinitely after students clashed over whether to cancel classes to watch the World Cup. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology asked students to leave dormitories by Sunday to calm the situation, said Habibur Rahman, pro-vice chancellor of the university in the capital.         
	Muti in play         
	Johannesburg: In order to increase Bafana Bafanas chances of making it through the first round of the tournament, people of South Africa are burning, brewing and smoking. Muti, or traditional medicine, is very much in use in modern-day South Africa. Traditionalists believe a mixture of herbs, plants and animal parts, such as vulture brains and aloe, can be used to change luck, heal sickness or enhance performance.         
	Cup amp; bottles         
	Johannesburg: Fifa is examining stadium safety in Rustenburg after plastic beer bottles were thrown on the pitch during Australias 1-1 draw with Ghana at the World Cup. Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot says it will take a closer look at the incident in the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday.         
	One for red         
	Johannesburg: Fifa says Australias Harry Kewell will only serve a one-match ban for being shown a red card for a hand-ball against Ghana. Fifas disciplinary committee announced the suspension on Sunday, ruling Kewell out of Australias final Group D match against Serbia at Nelspruit on Wednesday.         
	Big bang         
	Johannesburg: Police say a controlled explosion at an explosives factory was the source of a blast heard by journalists Sunday at the World Cups main media centre.

	Lahore: Suspended Pakistani cricketer duo of Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer will leave for Dubai on Friday to attend a crucial two-day ICC hearing, which would decide their future in international cricket.         
	Lawyers for the two players, who were suspended by the ICC in September for their alleged involvement in spot-fixing and violating the ICC anti-corruption code, will accompany them for the hearing that will be presided over by Michael Beloff QC.         
	Pacer Mohammed Asif, who has also been provisionally suspended by the ICC, has withdrawn his appeal against the suspension and would not be attending the hearing.         
	We leave tomorrow and we have prepared a lot for this hearing that is very important for the two players. We are confident of having the suspensions removed, Aamers lawyer Shahid Karim said.

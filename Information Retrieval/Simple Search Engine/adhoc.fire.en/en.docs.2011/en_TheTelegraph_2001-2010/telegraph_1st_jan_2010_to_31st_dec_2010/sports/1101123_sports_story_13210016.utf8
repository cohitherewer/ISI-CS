            OUR CORRESPONDENT                       
	Nagpur: Dilip Vengsarkar was among the many who came to the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, on Monday, anticipating Sachin Tendulkars 50th Test century. Obviously, he had to return disappointed.         
	The Little Master was unbeaten on 53 and it was expected that he would finally get to the magic figure Monday morning. But Andy McKay played a perfect party pooper by dismissing the maestro with a peach of a delivery. While the debutant was over the moon scalping Tendulkar as his maiden Test victim, spectators at the stadium sat back with drooping shoulders, though India piled on the runs.         
	People may argue that the expectation of scoring his 50th Test hundred may be getting to Tendulkar. But Vengsarkar refused to believe that the Little Master was weighed down by the burden of expectations. I dont think hes under pressure 50 is just a number for him, Vengsarkar said.         
	Im disappointed at Sachin missing out on the opportunity today. He was batting well. But we should also remember that he was dismissed by an outstanding delivery, he said.         
	At 37, hes playing excellent cricket. Just look at his record this year Amazing. I think hes at the peak of his career.         
	The former selection committee chairman is also happy with the 17-member squad selected for the tour of South Africa.         
	Its a good squad. Theres balance. Umesh Yadav and Jaydev Unadkat have been good inclusions. I am hopeful of the side doing well in South Africa, he said. Vengsarkar, who is a vice-president of the Mumbai Cricket Association, also welcomed the newly-formed body of the Karnataka State Cricket Association.

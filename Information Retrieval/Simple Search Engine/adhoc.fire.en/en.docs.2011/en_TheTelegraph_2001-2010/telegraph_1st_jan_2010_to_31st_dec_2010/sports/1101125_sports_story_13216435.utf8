	Guangzhou: Their dream to win an Asian Games gold medal shattered, the Indian mens hockey team will now look to redeem their pride by getting the better of formidable South Korea in the bronze medal play-off, on Thursday.         
	The shock defeat at the hands of lower-ranked Malaysia through Mohammed Amins golden goal in the second semi-final, on Tuesday, has led to resignation of national coach Harendra Singh, leaving Rajpal Singhs side with the enormous task of beating the defending champions.         
	After their hopes of a direct berth into the 2012 Olympics went up in smoke, India will have to be at their best against the speedy Koreans, and should not commit the errors that led to their shocking defeat in the last-four stage.         
	Leading 3-2, and with hardly few minutes to go for the hooter, India were well on their way to the final, but the old habit of giving away the ball did them in.

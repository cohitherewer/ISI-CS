The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Senior pros may not be picked for Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                       7                                        Senior pros may not be picked for Zimbabwe
    - Suresh Raina a top contender for stand-in captains job           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Suresh Raina                                 
	New York: The national selectors may rest most of the senior cricketers when they pick the Indian squad for the May 28-June 9 tri-series in Zimbabwe and the two T20 Internationals in that country after the 50-over tournament.         
	Sri Lanka will also feature in the tri-series.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten, it appears, have already had a word with chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth. It seems his colleagues  Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat  too dont have an issue with giving the top guns a break.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, Sachin Tendulkar (who isnt available for the shortest version anyway), Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Dhoni himself could be rested, given the rather demanding calendar in the lead-up to the 2011 World Cup.         
	Virender Sehwag, in any case, is unfit.         
	Should the selection-script unfold that way, then Suresh Raina and, possibly, even Virat Kohli would be contenders for the stand-in captains job.         
	While Kohli has led India to an U-19 World Cup triumph, in 2008, Raina captained the Chennai Super Kings in a few matches during IPL III  when Dhoni was injured.         
	In fact, Rainas excellent run of late is bound to work to his advantage in a big way. Assuming, of course, that the seniors do get a break.         
	The squad is likely to be picked in a weeks time.

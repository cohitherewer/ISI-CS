	New Delhi: Parupalli Kash-yaps smile finally emerged after 59 minutes of play. The 24-year-old needed a lot of patience to get the better of world No.19, Mohammed Haf-iz Hashim 19-21, 21-19, 21-16, at the Siri Fort Complex on Monday.         
	This win kept him in contention for his maiden Commonwealth Games medal as he progressed to the semi-finals of the badminton event.         
	Playing the last match of the day, top-seeded Saina Nehwal beat Canadian Anna Rice in her quarterfinal clash 21-7, 21-10 in just under half an hour.         
	Ive been waiting for the CWG for four years, I couldnt let this opportunity get away from me, said Kashyap.         
	Hashim is a fantastic player on the sides but not as fit when made to play front-back. I knew I had to play accordingly and keep pushing him with drop shots. he said.         
	The crowd went berserk with every move Kashyap made. When you play in Malaysia or Indonesia, the home crowd will support their players just like this, he said. Kashyap will face Englands Rajiv Ouseph in the semis.         
	He (Ouseph) had not been expecting it. I came in and played aggressively in the last match. But this time, hell be prepared. I will have to decide on my strategy later when I talk to my coach, added Kashyap.         
	Indias mixed doubles duo V.Diju and Jwala Gutta lost in the quarters to the Malaysian pair of Kien Keat Koo and Eh Hui Chin 21-13, 21-19.         
	Aditi Mutatkar bowed out to second-seeded Mew Choo Wong 8-21, 12-21. Mens doubles duo of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas lost 16-21, 15-21 to Chayut Triyachat and Zi Liang Derek Wong.         
	Chetan Anand beat Carl Baxter 21-7, 21-9, while, in the womens doubles, Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa beat Heather Olver and Mariana Agathangelou 21-9, 21-4.         
	Chetan will meet world No. 1 Malaysian Lee Chong Wei in the semis.I will be under no pressure. Lets see what happens! he quipped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More trouble for Lalit Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                        More trouble for Lalit Modi
  - BCCI issues another showcause after complaint from ECB       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Lalit Modi Giles Clarke                                  
	Bridgetown: Lalit Kumar Modi, who has been suspended by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), wanted to destroy officially-sanctioned engagements internationally by staging a six-month league in England.         
	According to a well-placed source, Modi had started negotiations with three Counties (one, believe it or not, being traditionalist Yorkshire), prompting the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, Giles Clarke, to complain to the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar.         
	The other Counties in the dock are Lancashire and Warwickshire.         
	Clarke emailed the complaint a couple of days ago and, on Thursday evening, the BCCI slapped another showcause notice on the former Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner.         
	Action wasnt immediate, The Telegraph learns, as Manohar is on his annual vacation.         
	Modi has time till Monday to reply to the first showcause, emailed to him on April 26. This time, too, he has 15 days to give his side of the story.         
	The well-placed source said: Modi met the Counties representatives in New Delhi, on March 31... Hes understood to have proposed a T20 tournament on the lines of the IPL... Thats not all, he made it clear that the Boards would be sidetracked if they didnt give the green signal... The question is: Who gave him the authority to talk in the manner that he did?         
	Apparently, Modi told the three Counties that players could be bought with fancy sums and they would even be tempted to bid goodbye to Tests, ODIs and T20 Internationals.         
	It would, in effect, be a rebel league.         
	Besides severely hurting bilateral matches and multi-nation tournaments, the Modi-conceived league would cause havoc on the County cricket. Thats the top reason why Clarke complained.         
	Clarke, of course, timed his complaint to coincide with Modis fall from grace. As for the BCCI, its another stick to thrash Modi with.         
	For the record, the BCCIs media release, announcing the showcause, didnt go beyond saying that Modis activities were detrimental to Indian cricket, English cricket and world cricket at large...

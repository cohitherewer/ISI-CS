	London: Chelsea have begun the defence of their Premier League title like a fizzy-pop fuelled teenager at the controls of his Playstation.         
	West Bromwich Albion and Wigan Athletic have played the role of compliant little brother perfectly so far, slinking away crestfallen after 6-0 drubbings and next in the firing line for some punishment are struggling Stoke City on Saturday.         
	Carlo Ancelottis side have notched an astonishing 29 unanswered goals in five league matches, including their charge to the title in May, and while the Italian knows the fantasy football will make way for reality sooner or later, Stoke look ripe for picking.         
	Didier Drogba, Florent Malouda and Nicolas Anelka account for eight of Chelseas 12 goals so far and that trio will have their fingers poised on the shoot button against win-less Stoke, a team the champions thrashed 7-0 at home, in May.         
	While the strikers have been gaining the plaudits, midfielder John Obi Mikel has also made a strong start, providing a solid base for Ancelottis marauders to drive on.         
	Arsenal dissected Blackpools fragile defences six times at the Emirates last weekend and will hope to maintain that form at Blackburn Rovers in Saturdays early kick-off.         
	Newcastle United also joined the Six Club last Sunday when they crushed Aston Villa. England manager Fabio Capello will be hearted by the form of Arsenal winger Theo Walcott and Newcastles giant No. 9 Andy Carroll, who both scored hattricks last weekend.         
	Tottenham Hotspurs Peter Crouch was another striker who hit three, firing his side on Wednesday into the Champions League group stage. The Spurs face Wigan, who they beat 9-1 at home last season, on Saturday. Manchester United take on West Ham United at Old Trafford, on Saturday. United manager Alex Ferguson will be eager for Wayne Rooney to join the goal-scoring circus sooner rather than later.         
	The England man has not scored since March and will need to rediscover his spark if United are to keep pace with leaders Chelsea and resist the challenge of Arsenal and Manchester City.         
	Rooney did not play in the 2-2 draw at Fulham last weekend but with Michael Owen poised for a return, Mexican Javier Hernandez settling in and Dimitar Berbatov offering his usual dash of style, United still have plenty of attacking options.

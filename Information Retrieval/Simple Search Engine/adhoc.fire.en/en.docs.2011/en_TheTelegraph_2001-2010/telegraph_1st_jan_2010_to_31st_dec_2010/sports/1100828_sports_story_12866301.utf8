The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Final should be interesting
                                                                                                                       7                                        Final should be interesting
  - Sachin Tendulkars best wishes are with team india         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, crickets senior-most pro and Team Indias mascot, expects Saturdays tri-series final, in Dambulla, to be interesting and close.         
	It should be interesting... A close one, too... Needless to say, Id like India to win and my best wishes are with the boys, as they prepare to face Sri Lanka, Sachin told The Telegraph in the lead up to the tournaments title-round clash.         
	Sachin, who had to miss the tri-series on account of a groin strain, added: Viru (Virender Sehwag) has been in great form and our pacers did an excellent job in the last match, against New Zealand... I hope they repeat their performance.         
	Ashish Nehra, Munaf Patel and Praveen Kumar really turned it on, helping India win the virtual semi-final by 105 runs.         
	When it was pointed out that only Sehwag has been among the runs in the tournament, with no other India batsman even coming close to totalling 100, Sachin replied: It can happen, but they have it in them to come good. I wouldnt read a lot into what has happened... Lets hope well see them getting big runs in the final... quot;         
	Sachin signed off saying: Im sure the boys are going to be charged up and will be high on motivation... Ill be watching the telecast, thats for sure.         
	India and Sri Lanka played each other twice in the tri-series league stage, sharing honours. In their last title-round clash, the Asia Cup (just a shade over two months ago), India won big.         
	The ongoing tournament has, effectively, marked the start of the 2011 World Cup preparations by India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand.         
	Footnote: Nobody confirmed, but a well-placed source indicated that had India not made a late entry into the final, a request wouldve been put out, through proper channels, for Sachin to make himself available for the title-round. His last ODI was back in February.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am still in shock, says Emmanuel Adebayor
                                                                                                                       7                                        I am still in shock, says Emmanuel Adebayor
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            A TV grab shows Emmanuel Adebayor being comforted by a teammate, outside a hospital in Cabinda, on Friday. (Reuters)                           
	Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor has revealed that the terrifying attack en route to the teams base in the Cabinda province lasted 30 minutes.         
	Adebayor recounted what had happened when the team bus reached the border between DR Congo and Angola.         
	He said: We saw military people dressed like they were going to war and it was a little bit of a shock at the beginning, but I thought okay, its for security which is normal, because we are players here for a big tournament and we are like ambassadors for Africans so its normal that security is big.         
	We went through the border and got into Angola and, I dont know, 5km away from the border we started hearing shooting on the bus, for no reason. At the end of the day we got a lot of (people) injured.         
	One of our second goalkeepers got a bullet in his body. Our press and communications guy has got injured; hes not even conscious now, we dont know if hes going to survive or not.         
	These are the things we keep saying, keep repeating  in Africa we have to change our image if we want to be respected but unfortunately thats not happening.         
	We have a chance with one of the biggest tournaments in the world, the World Cup. Can you imagine whats happening now? Im disgraced and, I dont know, its unfair.         
	Adebayor hailed the security who were trying to protect the team.         
	To be honest, without the security then I would not be here talking. Maybe you would be talking to my dead body. The security have done their job quite well, he said.         
	The thing we dont understand is why they shot on our bus, thats the question now. Theres no one who has got a reason for that. Its not only one guy, or two guys shooting one time or two times on our bus.         
	Can you imagine, we have been in the middle of that for 30 minutes, even a little bit more. Our bus had been stopped and people had been shooting on our bus for 30 minutes.         
	If you can imagine, the silence on the bus was unbelievable.         
	Adebayor did not know whether the attack was personally aimed at him, as one of Africas most high-profile players, or his country in general.         
	He added: I dont know whether I am the target or not, but I know my team or my country is the target  why, I dont know.         
	We waited in hiding for 30 minutes because the bus had nowhere to go. Our driver was dead. He had the steering wheel in his hand but he had passed away. After that there were about seven or eight 4x4s arriving and we had to go out from the bus and climb into that car.         
	Following the journey to the hospital, Adebayor was involved in helping carry his injured teammates and federation staff from their transport to the hospital. It was like we were still living in a dream, Adebayor added.         
	I was one of the people who had to carry the injured players and injured staff into the hospital. Those are the times that you realise what is happening really.         
	Everyone was crying and calling their family, I think this was the worst moment of this day. I am still in shock because I dont know whether it has really stopped or not or if we are still a target.         
	Fifa also released a statement speaking of their concern about the attack.         
	Fifa and its president, Joseph S. Blatter, are deeply moved by todays incidents which affected Togos national team, to whom they express their utmost sympathy, said the statement.

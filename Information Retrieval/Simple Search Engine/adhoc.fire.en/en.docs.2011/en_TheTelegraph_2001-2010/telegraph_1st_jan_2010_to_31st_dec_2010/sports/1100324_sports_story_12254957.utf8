The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin firm   on no T20   for India
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin firm   on no T20   for India
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                       
	Calcutta: Some pundits are calling for Sachin Tendulkars inclusion in the India squad for the World T20, beginning next month, but there are good reasons why he wont figure in the line-up.         
	No.1 is that Sachin isnt among the 30 probables for the tournaments third edition.         
	Then, Sachin is himself not keen on making himself available, even if the Board of Control for Cricket in India pulls strings to have an exception made for the top batsman of the modern era.         
	Indeed, in response to an SMS from The Telegraph, on Tuesday evening, Sachin responded with an unambiguous No.         
	Sachin, it may be recalled, featured in Indias first T20 International, against South Africa (late 2006), but never played again.         
	During last years IPL, in South Africa, selector Yashpal Sharma did ask Sachin to review his decision, but the maestro stayed firm.         
	Sachin is understood to have told Yashpal that he didnt wish to disturb a well-settled young bunch.         
	The young bunch didnt deliver in the World T20s second edition, last year, but Sachins position hasnt changed.         
	Clearly, Sachins focus is Tests and ODIs, the two forms where hes not only the highest run-getter, but is the No.1 in the number of hundreds, too.         
	Sachin, who turns 37 next month, scripted a brilliant 71 not out in Mondays Mumbai Indians versus the Kolkata Knight Riders IPL clash.         
	The selectors, meanwhile, will be picking the World T20 squad on Friday. India won the inaugural edition, under Mahendra Singh Dhonis captaincy, in 2007.

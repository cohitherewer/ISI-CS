                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev refuses to shorten his schedule
                      
	New Delhi: Injuries have wrecked his season, but Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh, who had to pull out of this weeks Indian Open due to a back problem, on Tuesday said he would not cut down on the number of tournaments.         
	Jeev, who had also nursed a shoulder injury earlier this year, had to pull out of an event, which he considers the fifth Major after picking up the back injury last week during a tournament in Japan.         
	I injured myself in May (but) came back early. Then had a shoulder injury, again came back early. I have been on painkillers and I have never felt this kind of pain in my life before, Jeev said at the Delhi Golf Club here.         
	I am very disappointed to miss the Indian Open. I consider it the fifth Major. I was playing well also, said the golfer who was visibly ill at ease while addressing the media.         
	But the Chandigarh-pro refused to shorten his schedule to reduce the load on his body. I cant cut back on tournaments. I think its a tough call. The season has ended now and I have got five weeks. I just have to work on my posture. Every physio in this world has told me that my posture is not good. If I need to last 10 years, I have to get my posture right, he said.         
	I am a firm believer in yoga. I do practice it and I am looking at a few more postures to add to it, he added.         
	Next year, Jeev plans to focus more on the European Tour. I have a medical exemption in the PGA Tour. I would focus more on the European Tour and Japan. I will play on the Asian Tour as well, the co-sanctioned ones. (PTI)

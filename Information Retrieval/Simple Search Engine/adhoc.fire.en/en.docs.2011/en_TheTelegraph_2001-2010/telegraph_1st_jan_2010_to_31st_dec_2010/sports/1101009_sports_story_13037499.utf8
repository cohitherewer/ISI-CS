            OUR CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: Kavita Raut got Indias first medal in the athletics event of the Commonwealth Games, when she won a bronze in the womens 10,000 metre race at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, here on Friday. She also became the first woman to win a medal in the track event.         
	Draped in the tricolour Kavita was soaking in all the attention and adulation she was getting.         
	I still cant believe this. I am happy to make my parents proud, she said.         
	The 25-year-old tribal girl from Harsul, near Nashik was first spotted by coach Vijender Singh, and in this hour of glory she did not forget to mention Vijenders name.         
	Whatever I am today its because of him, she said.         
	So what about the future?         
	I am targeting a gold in the Asian Games in November, she announced proudly.         
	Earlier in the womens triple jump event, the focus was on Mayookha Johny but her friend Prajusha Malaikal hogged the limelight. She broke Mayookhas national record of 13.58 metres with a leap of 13.72. But that was not enough to give her a bronze, and she had to remain content with the fourth place. Mayookha finished sixth.         
	The 29-year old Nancy Langat led the way for Kenya with a Games record time of 4 minutes 5:26 seconds, beating New Zealands Nikki Hamblin and Scotlands Stephanie Twell.         
	Other Indian athletes on Friday had a dismal day. In womems 400m Mandeep Kaur finished sixth, Bengals Jhuma Khatun finished 12th in womens 1500m, Narayan Singh finished ninth in mens hammer, Bharat Inder Singh finished eighth and Vinod Joseph finished 10th in decathlon, Ankit Sharma and Maha Singh qualified for the finals in long jump.         
	Overall, on Thursday, Indias gold tally went up to 20. They have 15 silver and 12 bronze medals. In the last edition, India won 22, so in the XIX Commonwealth Games they are all set to surpass that.         
	In boxing, world No. 1 Vijender Singh (75kg) enthralled everyone with a convincing win in just about five minutes, to enter the quarter finals, along with Asian silver medallist Jai Bhagwan (60 kg) and Dilbag Singh (69 kg), on yet another superb day for the Indians.         
	In table tennis, the Indian womens team had to be content with a silver medal, after going down 0-3 to top seeds Singapore, in the final, while their male counterparts lost the semi-final to England and crashed out.         
	In badminton, Saina Nehwal came, saw and conquered. Yet, her efforts went in vain as the Indian team could only manage silver in the mixed team event, at the Siri Fort Stadium, on Friday. However, it was better than the bronze they won in their last outing, in Melbourne.         
	India lost 1-3 to Malaysia, and the worlds top team defended their gold.         
	In womens hockey, captain Surinder Kaur scored four goals as India thrashed a hapless Trinidad and Tobago 7-0 in a pool A match to stay in hunt for a semi-final spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rot in PCB plays hand
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rot in PCB plays hand
    - Absence of a powerful captain, in Imran mould, has made things worse           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Imran Khan                                 
	Calcutta: A heavily politicised administration and the absence of a powerful captain, in the Imran Khan mould, are factors which have contributed to Pakistan cricket being scalded yet again.         
	Its because the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is deeply mired in politics, with its chairman a political appointee, that the managerial structure has been hit for a six.         
	Most feel the rot set in after Arif Ali Khan Abassi, who is related to Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, stepped down as the PCBs chief executive soon after the 1996 World Cup.         
	Abassis resignation allowed politicians to extend their influence, much to the detriment of the countrys cricket.         
	If anything, flip-flops on disciplinary measures have made things worse. Indeed, the PCB has reduced to an absolute joke the business of banning cricketers and, then, lifting their punishment!         
	Compromising on discipline is a sure means of inviting big trouble. Ijaz Butt, the PCB chairman, must take responsibility for tolerating indiscipline and, after Sundays expose in the UK, should put in his papers.         
	That there hasnt been a captain like Imran, in whose presence even Javed Miandad never raised his voice, has caused its own problems. Nobody wouldve dared to mingle with dubious characters had an Imran been at the helm.         
	From moments of brilliance on the field to shady dealings off it, theres never a dull moment in Pakistans cricket... Envied and despised, almost in equal measure.         
	How strange.         
	Clearly, theres something terribly wrong, otherwise why is it that, invariably, cricketers from Pakistan only come under a cloud?         
	Making an example of former captain Salim Malik alone hasnt served any purpose. Quite a few got away, encouraging others to follow in their despicable footsteps.         
	Regulars on the circuit are aware that cricketers from the subcontinent, in particular, are easy to befriend and its not unusual for most of them to be guests at (for example) dinners hosted by new friends.         
	To an extent, that actually has something to do with the daily allowances. While the accommodation and eight pieces or so of laundry are taken care of, the cricketers have to make do with around $75 on all the days.         
	Thats okay when a match is on, but not so otherwise. Just one proper meal in either the West Indies or England would finish off that allowance.         
	A sponsored dinner, therefore, isnt exactly unwelcome for many. But, yes, the lets-go-everywhere trend of the 1990s has changed. Thanks largely to the match-fixing scandal which erupted in the summer of 2000, with Hansie Cronje, now no more, holding centre stage.         
	With no background checks run by the IB, its possible that, at such dinners, cricketers get exposed to people (including women) who may have a totally different agenda.         
	Also, if hotels dont put calls through to the cricketers, the cellphone is always there. Everybody uses one on tour and, so, nobody has to fret over access  for whatever reason  to X or Y.         
	Significantly, theres a limit to what the International Cricket Councils anti-corruption sleuths can do. We do observe closely, but cant infringe on a cricketers privacy, is how somebody associated with the world body put it, during a recent chat with The Telegraph.         
	It would be foolish to assume that match-fixing will cease, for the simple reason that the proverbial black sheep are going to be there. At best, the damage may be limited.         
	Footnote: Following the sting operation in the UK, Suraj Randivs no ball to Virender Sehwag, on August 16, which left him stranded on 99, can again come under scrutiny. It was, after all, a deliberate act which influenced the result of that tri-series match.

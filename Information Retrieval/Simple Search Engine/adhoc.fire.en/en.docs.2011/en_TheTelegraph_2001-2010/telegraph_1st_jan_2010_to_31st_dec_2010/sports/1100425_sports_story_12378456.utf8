                                                                                                                       7                                        Champions League berth is for RCB
            OUR CORRESPONDENT              The Royal Challengers Bangalore rsquo;s Jacques Kallis is congratulated by Anil Kumble after the dismissal of Anirudh Singh of the Deccan Chargers, in Navi Mumbai, on Saturday. (PTI)                       
	Mumbai: Royal Challengers Bangalore extracted sweet revenge for last years loss in the final as they pummelled the Deccan Chargers into submission to record a nine-wicket victory in the IPL play-off here on Saturday.         
	Electing to bat, the Chargers were skittled out for a paltry 82, the lowest score of the tournament this season, thanks to some uninspiring performance from their batsmen combined with the Royal Challengers Bangalores tidy bowling.         
	Anil Kumbles men had little problems in overhauling the target with more than six overs to spare. Rahul Dravid made an unbeaten 35 and Kevin Pietersen 29 not out.         
	The win meant that the Royal Challengers clinched the third slot in the Champions League T20 from the IPL.         
	For the Chargers, the defeat capped an otherwise inconsistent season in which they lost four matches in a row at one stage before registering five wins on the trot to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	But their winning run was snapped by the Chennai Super Kings on Thursday and they clearly lacked the fire in the belly to bounce back from that defeat and produce their best within 48 hours time.         
	The Royal Challengers clearly had the appetite to finish the tournament on a winning note and that came through in their performance.         
	Captain and Man of the Match Kumble led from the front with figures for four for 16 while Praveen Kumar (2/18) and Dale Steyn (1/11) provided him ample support.         
	The Royal Challengers domination could also be seen from the fact that there were two wicket-maiden overs in the innings, for the first time in three seasons of IPL, bowled by Jacques Kallis and Steyn.         
	The other notable aspect of Bangalore teams performance was the Nottingham-born Nayan, son of former India spinner Dilip Doshi, finishing with a miserly one for 17.         
	When Gilchrist crunched a Kumble full toss to the cover boundary, the prospects were promising for the Chargers. But two balls later, a similar full toss on the knees, and Gilchrist swung it straight to the fielder at deep mid wicket.         
	From there on, it was all down hill for the last years winners.         
	The two Sharmas, Monish and Rohit, were dismissed for nought while Andrew Symonds and Dwayne Smith failed to reach double digits.         
	Mishra departed for a first-ball duck at the same score of four in the first ball of the second over when he was trapped plumb in front by Praveen Kumar.         
	Praveen added another to his kitty when he sent back Rohit Sharma too, also for nought, in his next over to leave Deccan at a sorry score of 15 for three.         
	Things failed to improve for Deccan though left handed Anirudh kept them afloat with some diligent batting as they lost two more wickets cheaply.         
	Andrew Symonds, dropped on one by Steyn, feel to the South African pacer - undone by the pace and lift of the ball that he edged behind.         
	Deccan plunged further into trouble at 35 for five with Kumble rattling Dwayne Smiths timbers .         
	The only bright phase of the innings was the 43-run partnership for the sixth wicket between Anirudh Singh (40) and Venugopal Rao (24).         
	Anirudhs was a measured knock which contained four boundaries and a six, but more importantly, 17 dot balls. Rao, too, curbed his attacking instinct although his first scoring shot was a six off Kumble.         
	Kallis broke the partnership in the 16th over by going through Anirudhs defence.         
	The wicket triggered another collapse with the last four Deccan batsmen departing in the space of 13 balls.         
	The Royal Challengers, in keeping with the dull proceedings, made a sedate start.         
	Kallis departed after making a 32-ball 19 but Dravid and Kevin Pietersen made sure there was no further damage before the target was overhauled.

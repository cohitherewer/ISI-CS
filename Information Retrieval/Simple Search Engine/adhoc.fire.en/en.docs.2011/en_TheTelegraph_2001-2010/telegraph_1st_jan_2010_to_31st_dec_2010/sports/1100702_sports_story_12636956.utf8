  - Leander, Cara reach mixed doubles semis             Serena Williams                           
	London: Defending champion Serena Williams withstood stiff early resistance from unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova before winning 7-6, 6-2 to reach her sixth Wimbledon singles final on Thursday. She will meet 25-year-old Russian Vera Zvonareva who beat unseeded Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.         
	I definitely worked really hard, Williams said in a courtside interview. I didnt expect to get as far at the beginning of the tournament. Its such a blessing to still be in the tournament.         
	Kvitova, the world No. 62, had been expected to be little more than a sacrificial lamb on Williams route to a fourth crown at the All England Club, but the feisty Czech gave as good as she got in a tight first set. She broke the Williams serve in the fifth game but the American levelled and took the tiebreak 7-5. Kvitova battled defiantly in the second set but a double fault to hand Williams a double break at 5-2 meant there was no way back.         
	She served out for the match, clinching victory when a stone dead net cord fell short of Kvitovas outstretched racket after an hour and 33 minutes.         
	Her opponent Zvonareva was happy to talk about Dutch soccer, education, even a little tennis after Thursdays victory over Pironkova but she drew a line at the global economic situation.         
	The confident 21st seed recovered from a slow start against Bulgarias Pironkova to show some of the form that had already seen her defeat Serb Jelena Jankovic and US Open champion Kim Clijsters at the All England Club. She would have expected to field questions on her plans to topple 12-time Grand Slam winner Williams, but instead it was her education that drew the focus.         
	Zvonareva, who has a degree in physical education, is now studying international economic relations in Russia with classes and exams looming upon her return. Asked if she cared to give her view on the global economic crisis, she declined gracefully with a smile:Maybe when I graduate, I will be able to answer that better.         
	I always love studying. It was always very important for me to keep my head busy with something else, she explained. Travelling around the world, meeting different people, I just thought that international economic relations is something interesting.         
	Indias Leander Paes and his Zimbabwean mixed doubles partner Cara Black made it to the semi-finals on Thursday. They beat Australias Paul Hanley and Chan YungJan of Taiwan, the 12th seeds, 6-4, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3 on Court 2.

  - Lalit Modi absent; Next hearing to be held in New Delhi on July 27
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Lalit Modi on Friday earned a major concession from the BCCI disciplinary committee which allowed him to be represented through his lawyers during the course of the proceedings, but his demand to reconstitute the probe panel is likely to be rejected.         
	The committee took a fair, and without doubt lenient, view of the suspended IPL chairman sending a team of advocates instead of him being present at the first hearing at the BCCIs headquarters here.         
	The three-member panel agreed with Modis lawyers, Venkatesh Dhond and Mehmood Abdi along with two others, who argued that the allegations involved several contracts that required careful legal interpretation.         
	The disciplinary committee includes legal luminary Arun Jaitley.         
	Mr Dhond, advocate appearing for Mr Modi along with Mr Abdi and his colleagues has submitted that the allegations against Mr Modi are of a serious nature.         
	Complex legal issues are involved particularly in relation to interpretation of the contract documents. He has further submitted that one of members of the disciplinary committee himself is a person with a legal background, the committee said in a statement.         
	We asked for a response from Prof. R. S. Shetty, representing the BCCI, and he has left the matter for the consideration of the disciplinary committee.         
	We have considered the submissions of Mr Dhond and are of the view that his pleas have substantial merit in them... Even though BCCIs memorandum, rules and regulations do not contain any stipulation for representation through lawyers of a person against whom the enquiry is being held, it is a matter of the discretion of the disciplinary committee, the statement added.         
	In view of the complex nature of certain issues involved, interpretation of documents required, and additionally that one of us on the committee has a legal background, we feel that it would be just and fair that Mr Modi be allowed to be represented through a lawyer in the enquiry.         
	The committee then asked Dhond and Abdi whether Modi would be appear in person if it required questioning him in the future. The lawyers replied that Modi had not given them any instruction on this issue and they would give the reply in the next hearing, according to the statement.         
	The next hearing has been slated for July 27 in New Delhi.         
	We have informed Mr. Dhond and Mr. Abdi that the disciplinary committee may require to question Mr. Modi in person.         
	We therefore wanted to know if Mr. Modi would be available for that purpose on such dates as and when required. Both have informed us that at this stage they have no instructions to this effect and they would inform us on the next hearing of the committee.         
	Since we are allowing Mr Modi to be represented by a lawyer, it would be fair and proper to permit BCCI also to be represented through their lawyer and its authorized representative in the same manner as Mr Modi has been permitted.         
	However, the committee was yet to decide on Modis demand that two of the three members on the panel, Jaitley and Chirayu Amin, recuse themselves from the inquiry.         
	Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia is the third member.         
	The committee said that it had asked the BCCI to give its views on the issue by July 25, two days before the next hearing.         
	Mr. Dhond wanted to file some additional plea in this regard to substantiate his request for recusal of members. It has been decided that the supplementary plea may be filed by Mr Modi before 18th July 2010.         
	The consolidated response to this from BCCI should reach us along with advance copy to the representatives of Mr Modi by 25th July 2010, the statement said.         
	They (Jaitley and Amin) are going to be there, a BCCI source said when asked about Modis plea.

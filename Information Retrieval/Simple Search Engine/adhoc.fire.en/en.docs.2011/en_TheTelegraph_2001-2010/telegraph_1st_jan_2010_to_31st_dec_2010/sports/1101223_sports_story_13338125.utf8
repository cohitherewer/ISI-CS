 - Armans 498 is the highest individual score in school cricket             OUR CORRESPONDENT            Arman Khan Jaffer                           
	Mumbai: Arman Khan Jaffer, 13-year-old nephew of former Test opener Wasim Jaffer, set a record by scoring a marathon 498 in an inter-school cricket tournament here on Wednesday.         
	The seventh standard student from Rizvi Springfield High School set the record for the highest-ever individual score in school cricket against IES Raje Shivaji Vidyalaya in a three-day match in the under-14 Giles Shield tournament at the historic Cross Maidan.         
	I am happy I got the record, but I am also upset that I missed the 500 by just two runs, the right-handed batsman told The Telegraph after the days play.         
	Spread over two days, Armans innings surpassed the previous best of 461 by 15-year-old Ali Zorain Khan in an inter-academy tournament organised by the Vidarbha Cricket Association in Nagpur earlier this year.         
	Incidentally, before Ali Zorain, Armans schoolmate Sarfaraz Khan held the record after smashing 439 in an under-16 Harris Shield match last season.         
	Arman, whose batting style resembles his uncles, cracked 77 fours en route to his gargantuan total.         
	The 13-year-old played elegant strokes without ever lofting the ball in his eight-hour-and-20-minute knock.         
	Armans innings ended when he edged medium pacer Akshay Pagare to Sandesh Pendnekar at first slip.         
	My coach (Raju Pathak) told me to bat on as long as I wanted and not worry about the declaration. First, my aim was 400, and then 450. Then, (at 498) I tried to play a cover drive but the ball cut away, said Arman, who was 295 overnight.         
	Both my dad and uncle always tell me to keep the ball down to the ground, he said of his no-six approach.         
	Armans father, Khaleem Nayeem Jaffer, whos is Jaffers elder brother, said he did not want to have any expectation about his sons future.         
	This is just a starting stage and its a long journey. I am looking at this as just the first step. I am not thinking anything, Khaleem said.         
	Coach Pathak, understandably, praised his ward profusely.         
	He is a long-race horse. He has the temperament to play long innings, reads the pitch conditions well and knows which ball to attack, he said.         
	For the record, Rizvi declared their first innings at 800 for eight in 145 overs. At close on the penultimate day, IES Raje were 57 for two.

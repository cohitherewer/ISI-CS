            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Chennai Super Kings batsman Subramaniam Badrinath Saturday said that his team had a slight edge over the Mumbai Indians as they have the experience of playing in the final, in the inaugural edition of the IPL.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Super Kings chances         
	We might have a slight edge having played a final earlier and Mumbai havent been in a final before. We have been there and we have experienced the final situation. But we also have to play good cricket on the day.         
	The teams form in the lead-up to the final         
	It has been up and down in the league phase. But at the end of the day, we made it to the final. It all comes down to performing on the big day. We have form on our side and, hopefully, we will take that through to tomorrow.         
	On Mahendra Singh Dhoni skipping practice         
	He had a rest because it was an optional nets session.         
	On Doug Bollinger and R. Ashwin opening the bowling         
	They have been tremendous, especially Ashwin, being a spinner These two have done well in the Powerplays.         
	Mumbai Indians         
	They have a strong side Their combination is working. We also have played good cricket. So, there is no reason why we cant fancy our chances as well.         
	On doubts over Sachin Tendulkars fitness         
	If he is not playing, any opposition will be happy... We dont know whether he is fit or not. Personally, I am looking forward to the clash.

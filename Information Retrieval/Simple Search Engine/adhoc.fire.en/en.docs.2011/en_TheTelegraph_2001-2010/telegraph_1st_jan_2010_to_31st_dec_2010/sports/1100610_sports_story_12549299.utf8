The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | THE INVISIBLE FORCES
                                                                                                                       7                                      THE INVISIBLE FORCES
            The procession of stars who will miss the action even as the world waits on the Drogbas and the Robbens to recover                            
	Javier Zanetti (Argentina)         
	Right-back Zanetti played a key role in Inter Milans great run in the Champions League and, although he has been an important figure for Argentina in the past, he found no place in Diego Maradonas scheme of things and was surprisingly dropped.               
	Esteban Cambiasso (Argentina)         
	The Inter Milan midfielder scored a memorable goal against Serbia and Montenegro in the 2006 World Cup  the one that famously took 32 passes before finally going in, but has been ignored ever since Maradona took over. Neither did a brilliant season with Inter help his cause.               
	Ronaldinho (Brazil)         
	One of the heroes of Brazils World Cup triumph in 2002, Ronandinhos exclusion by coach Dunga has come as a shock for the fans. The skillful Brazilian has been questioned in recent years for his fitness and desire, but many tipped him for inclusion in the squad after a stunning season for AC Milan.               
	Adriano (Brazil)         
	Like Ronaldinho, another big name that will be missing from the Brazilian squad is Adriano. The experienced player couldnt play his way into the national team, even though the move back to Brazil from Italy helped him rediscover his scoring touch. The strikers failed time at Inter Milan still lingers on Dungas mind, and questions have been asked about his attitude.               
	David Beckham (England)         
	David Beckhams dream of playing his fourth successive World Cup were dashed after the England midfielder injured himself during a Serie A match between AC Milan and Chievo. The 35-year-old has now joined Fabio Capellos backroom staff and is expected to be a link between the squad and the management to identify and solve problems.               
	Samir Nasri (France)         
	One of Arsenals shining stars, Nasri misses out on the showcase event even though he is one of the most promising young French footballers at the moment. The creative midfielder had a great start to his Arsenal career but was not at his best this season. He is upset at being dropped by Domenech and said he wanted to know why the coach had omitted him.               
	Karim Benzema (France)         
	Karim Benzema, one of Real Madrids big money summer signings, has been dropped by Domenech after a poor season with the Spanish giants. The striker, who was one of the hottest properties in world football a year ago, would be looking to use this free time to get back his touch.               
	Patrick Vieira (France)         
	Like Del Piero of Italy, Patrick Vieira is an experienced player who will be missing the Cup. The omission more than likely signals the end of Vieiras international career, and the on-loan Manchester City midfielder will have to look back on, and not forward to, a glittering international career.               
	Michael Ballack (Germany)         
	The injury to Michael Ballack a few days before the start of the World Cup is a big setback for Germany. The 33-year-old national team captain was injured playing for Chelsea in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth. An MRI scan on Ballacks ankle later revealed serious ligament damage.               
	Christian Traesch (Germany)         
	Midfielder Christian Traesch will miss the World Cup after injuring his right ankle in a training game against a local selection in northern Italy. It is yet another blow to the three-time world champions who have been hit by a series of injuries to key players. Traesch twisted his ankle and needs at least a four-weeks rest.               
	Heiko Westermann (Germany)         
	Defender Heiko Westermann will miss the World Cup because of a foot injury, adding to coach Joachim Loews mounting injury worries. The German camp could have done without an injury to the Schalke 04 man who broke a bone in his left foot late in Germanys 3-0 win over Hungary in a friendly in Budapest. Westermann is the fifth German player to be ruled out due to an injury and the prove.               
	Michael Essien (Ghana)         
	Considered one of the biggest stars of world football, Michael Essien will miss the World Cup because of the injury he suffered during African Nation Cup in January. He missed the remainder of the Premier League season and could not recover in time forcing the Ghana coach to drop him from the squad. Although champions Chelsea might not have missed him too much, Ghana sure will.               
	Luca Toni (Italy)         
	Luca Toni, who helped Italy win the 2006 World Cup, made a last minute loan move to Roma from Bayern Munich with hopes of landing a spot on the Azzurri squad, but the move didnt pay off. The 33-year-old barely played in Bayern but had a good season at Roma. The prolific strikers form might have taken something of a beating, but to his fans, Tonis omission is a grievous mistake for which might well haunt the defending champions.               
	John Obi Mikel (Nigeria)         
	Among the few in the Nigerian squad with impeccable pedigree, the Chelsea midfielder is sure to be sorely missed when the Nwankwo Kanus lock horns with the worlds best. And no one would be more disappointed than Mikel himself, given that the tournament is being held in his continent for the first time. Moreover, he could have added to his EPL winners medal which he earned with Chelsea.               
	Nani (Portugal)         
	Disappointment for the Portuguese youngster in a year which has seen him strive aplenty to fill Cristiano Ronaldos shoes at Manchester United. His efforts for the club last season have been largely commendable making it all the more unfortunate that he should have to watch from home when his teammates challenge for the title. An injury to the left shoulder during practice means the winger has to wait for 2014.               
	Ruud van Nistelrooy (The Netherlands)         
	Another experienced star to miss the World Cup, he enjoyed success this season at German club Hamburg, but found his days for the Oranje were over after being told he will not be boarding the plane to South Africa.               
	Updated till Wednesday night

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sammy heroics not enough 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sammy heroics not enough 
                      
	North Sound: South Africa withstood a late West Indies fight-back led by Darren Sammy to prevail by 17 runs in the second one-day International on Monday and take a 2-0 lead in the five match series.         
	The South Africans appeared to be coasting to victory, when West Indies, chasing 301 for victory from their 50 overs, slumped to 236 for eight in the 45th over.         
	But the Proteas came under attack from Sammy, whose unbeaten 58 from 24 balls contained two fours and six sixes, as he dominated a ninth-wicket stand of 47 with Ravi Rampaul.         
	South Africa were fortunate however, when fast-medium bowler Ryan McLaren skilfully fielded a drive from Sammy on his follow-through, and Rampaul was run out off the last ball of the 48th over backing up too far.

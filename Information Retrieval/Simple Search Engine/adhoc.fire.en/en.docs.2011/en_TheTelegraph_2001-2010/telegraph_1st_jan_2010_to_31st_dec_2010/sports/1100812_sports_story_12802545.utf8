The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi has recusal request rejected
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modi has recusal request rejected
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi had his request for the recusal of Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin from the disciplinary committee turned down by the cricket board on Wednesday.         
	Setting August 18 as the next date for a fresh disciplinary hearing, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to oblige Modi but did not specify the reasons behind the rejection, which the sidelined administrators legal team described as unfair.         
	The request of Mr Lalit Modi for recusal of certain members of the disciplinary committee is rejected, the BCCI said in a statement.         
	The next hearing is fixed for Wednesday August 18 at Hotel Taj Palace, New Delhi, it added.         
	Modis lawyer, Mehmood Abdi, was quick to slam the BCCI for rejecting their demand and threatened to take them to court.         
	We dont consider it a fair order. We will take appropriate legal steps after consultations with senior counsels, said Abdi, reacting to the BCCI decision.         
	Asked whether that could mean going to a court of law, Abdi said that is not ruled out.         
	Apart from Amin (the interim IPL chief) and Jaitley (BCCI vice-president), the three-member panel also comprises Congress MP and Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association chief Jyotiraditya Scindia.         
	The panel has met thrice so far with Modi absent on all the occasions, leaving his legal team to argue his case on charges of financial irregularities.         
	The last hearing of the panel took place on August 1 after which the committee reserved its order on the contentious recusal issue.         
	Abdi had then stated that the arguments on their demand for the recusal of the said panel members were complete.         
	Modi insists Jaitley and Amin recuse themselves from the panel as they are also part of the BCCI, which has made the allegations against him.         
	The disciplinary committee has met thrice to investigate the allegations against Modi. The committee has until October 26 to submit its recommendations to the board.         
	The committee met on August 1 to discuss the recusal issue but adjourned the meeting without a ruling. Modi did not attend the meeting via video conferencing despite saying he was willing to do so.         
	The BCCI suspended Modi immediately following the conclusion of IPL 3 in April and charged him with financial irregularities relating to the bidding process for IPL franchises, the mid-over ad sales and the sale of theatrical rights. He was also charged with colluding to set up a rebel league in England.

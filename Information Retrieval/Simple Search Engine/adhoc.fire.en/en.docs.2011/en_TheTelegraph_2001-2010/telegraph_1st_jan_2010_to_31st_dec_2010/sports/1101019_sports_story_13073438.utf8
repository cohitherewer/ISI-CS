The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle sacked, Sammy   to lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gayle sacked, Sammy   to lead
                            
	St Johns: Chris Gayle was Monday dumped from West Indies captaincy and replaced by all-rounder Darren Sammy in a shake-up aimed at rebuilding the side which has been on decline for some years.         
	The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) announced the decision to sack Gayle, who has been captain since 2007, while naming the squad for the three-match Test tour of Sri Lanka next month.         
	Sammy, though, has not been a regular member of the Test side having played just eight matches after making his debut in June 2007.         
	Gayle, who recently refused new central contracts with the WICB last month along with Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard, is still in the squad as a batsman.         
	Gayle, Bravo and Pollard had refused central contracts which stipulated that they must make themselves available for the West Indies team at all times.         
	Bravo was also demoted from vice-captaincy with Brendan Nash taking over the job for the Test series in Sri Lanka, though he is still in the squad.         
	The sacking of Gayle, who led West Indies to three wins in 20 Tests as captain, and naming of Sammy and Nash into positions of responsibility was apparently done as WICB wanted stability in leadership from players whose availability was not in question.         
	WICB chief executive Ernest Hilaire thanked Gayle for leading West Indies during a challenging period of the game in the country.         
	Chris Gayle, the former captain, led the West Indies during a challenging period and the board thanks him for stepping up then but it is now time to pass the mantle on as the West Indies rebuilds, said Hilaire.

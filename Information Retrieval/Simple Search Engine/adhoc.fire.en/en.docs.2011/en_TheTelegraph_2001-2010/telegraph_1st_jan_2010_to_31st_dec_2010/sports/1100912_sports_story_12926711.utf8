	Monza: Fernando Alonso marked his Italian Grand Prix debut for Ferrari on Saturday by taking pole position for the Formula One race.         
	The two-time world champion from Spain set the pace with a lap of 1 minute, 21.962 seconds for his 19th career pole. It was the Italian teams first qualifying win since the 2008 Brazilian GP  a span of 30 races.         
	It was a nice surprise, Alonso said. A much better feeling. This was a great achievement by the team  we proved that we were quick.         
	Defending world champion Jenson Button of McLaren finished just over one-tenth of a second slower to start on the front row for the first time in 23 races. Alonso and Button need strong showings in Sundays 53-lap race to stay close in the championship fight.         
	Felipe Massa of Ferrari and Mark Webber of Red Bull fill out the second row, while F1 leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren starts fifth. Sebastian Vettel was sixth for Red Bull, which had taken pole in 12 of the first 13 races this season.         
	Hamilton, the 2008 F1 champion, has 182 points to lead Webber by three. Vettel is third with 151 points, and faces a difficult task Sunday after his worst qualifying performance of the season. Button is next with 147 points, six more than Alonso.         
	Nico Rosberg of Mercedes was seventh in qualifying ahead of Williams driver Nico Hulkenberg and Robert Kubica of Renault, while 2009 Italian GP winner Rubens Barrichello starts 10th for Williams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mhambrey on CAB radar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mhambrey on CAB radar
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mhambrey                           
	Calcutta: With the gone by season being no less than a disaster, that the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will affect quite a few changes in and around the Ranji Trophy team is quite an easy guess.         
	The coachs post is one such spot as the CAB, as of now, is not much inclined to extend Roger Binnys contract. So who are the possible contenders for the post?         
	According to CAB sources, former Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey is back on the radar for the top job. But the problem is that Paras, who played two Tests for India, is a full-time employee with Reliance Industries at present. He is also the assistant coach of the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Mumbai Indians.         
	Hence, the coach who took Bengal to consecutive Ranji Trophy finals (2005-06 and 2006-07), might not be available for a full-time job.         
	When contacted by The Telegraph, Paras admitted that he has had an informal chat with the CAB brass. Yeah, there was an informal communication with CAB and I had told them that I would only be able to talk after the completion of (the third edition) the IPL. Actually, right now, Im associated with the Reliance Industries and am also the assistant coach of the Mumbai Indians, Paras said.         
	Apart from that, I am also entrusted with the duty of looking after the corporate team of Reliance. So, it will be very difficult for me to devote six-seven months for Bengal, he added.         
	When asked if there was a solution to the impasse, Paras said: If it is for a short-term consultants role, I may try and talk with my employers. I will only be too happy to work with Bengal again.         
	One has to wait and see if the CAB will be interested in such an option. But if that happens, dont be surprised if someone from the local fraternity gets the full-time coachs job.

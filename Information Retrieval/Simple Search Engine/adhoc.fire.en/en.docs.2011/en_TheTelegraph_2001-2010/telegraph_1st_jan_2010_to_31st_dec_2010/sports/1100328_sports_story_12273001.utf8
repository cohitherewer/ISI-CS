	Malaga: Shiv Kapur and S.S.P. Chowrasia bowed out of the Andalucia Open after failing to make the halfway cut on Saturday. Shivs followed his opening round of 71 with a level-par 70 and his 36-hole total of 141 was just outside the cut-off set at 140. Chowrasia had carded four-over 74 in the first round and exits despite an improved one-under 69 in the second.         
	South African Louis Oosthuizen and Englishman Sam Hutsby, meanwhile, continue to go neck-and-neck and they turned in an identical seven-under 63 to share the halfway lead at 10-under 130.           (PTI)

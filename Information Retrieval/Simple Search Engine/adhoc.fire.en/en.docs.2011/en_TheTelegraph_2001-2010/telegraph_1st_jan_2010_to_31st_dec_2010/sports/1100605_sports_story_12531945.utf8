The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am getting better: Kaka
                                                                                                                       7                                        I am getting better: Kaka
                  Julio Baptista and Kaka in a relaxed mood during Brazils practice session in Johannesburg, on Friday                     
	Johannesburg: Kaka isnt concerned with his fitness ahead of the World Cup, and said Friday he is ready to take on the responsibility of being Brazils leader at the tournament.         
	Kaka enters the tournament as Brazils biggest star, but he also arrives heavily affected by injuries that have put in doubt his performance in South Africa. The Real Madrid playmaker, however, is confident he will be in good physical condition when the World Cup begins.         
	I am getting better every day, Kaka said. The injury does not bother me anymore. Ive been doing everything planned so far and by the time we play the opener I will be in great condition.         
	Kaka is coming off an injury plagued season that kept him from playing at his best with Real Madrid. He sustained groin and thigh problems that kept him sidelined for 45 days at one point, unable to perform like the Fifa player of the year he once was.         
	Brazil doctors said the groin problem is not an issue anymore, and that the left thigh ailment should not keep Kaka from starting for Brazil in the teams World Cup opener against North Korea on June 15.         
	I was worried at first, Kaka said. It was very limiting, but now Im being able to move around much better. Im going through intense treatment and with 10 days left until the opener I will be fine.         
	Kaka has been practising normally with the rest of the Brazilian players since the team arrived in South Africa on May 27, but continues to receive separate treatment even when the other players get a break.         
	He played 45 minutes in Brazils 3-0 win over Zimbabwe in a warmup in Harare on Wednesday and said he felt fine. It wasnt my best match with Brazil, but it was very positive, the 28-year-old Kaka said. I was able to do a lot on the field without any problems.         
	It was his first match in more than a month, and coach Dunga also was pleased with what he saw.         
	Kaka was already a top player when he was with Brazil at the 2006 World Cup, but at the time he shared much of the spotlight with Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Adriano. Now, few players are attracting similar attention as Kaka. Wearing Brazils famed No. 10 jersey, Kaka knows all eyes will be on him this time.         
	Im ready to be one of the teams leaders, Im ready to take this responsibility, Kaka said. Ive always accepted this responsibility.

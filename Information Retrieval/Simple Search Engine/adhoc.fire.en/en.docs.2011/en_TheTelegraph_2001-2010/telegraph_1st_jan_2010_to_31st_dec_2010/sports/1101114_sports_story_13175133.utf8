  - Bindra eliminated controversially in the qualifying stage                             
	Guangzhou: Gagan Narang stole the show from star shooter Abhinav Bindra by clinching the silver in the 10m air rifle individual event after the Olympic champion was controversially eliminated in the qualifying stage due to a technical error over a particular shot.         
	Gagan combined with Bindra and Sanjeev Rajput to provide the country with their first medal, a silver, in the team event behind champions China.         
	Narang, Bindra and Rajput combined to tally 1783, only a point behind Chinas gold-capturing 1784.         
	Narang, the lone Indian to qualify for the individual finals, matched Chinas 2004 Athens Olympic champion Zhu Qinan shot for shot before the latter captured the gold by shooting past his Indian rival in the last three attempts.         
	The 27-year-old settled for the silver after giving Qinan a run for his money in the 10-shot finals. He tallied of 700.7 points behind Qinans gold-winning effort of 702. Korean Kim Kwon won the bronze with 700.0.         
	I am extremely happy to have carried the Indian flag in the opening ceremony on Friday and I am very happy that we have won two silver medals. There are two more events left for me and I am hoping for the best, said Gagan.         
	Narang also said that the range was a bit difficult as the back-lighting was a hindrance. He added that a one point lead going into the final was difficult to bridge against a top shooter like Qinan. Even if I had a 10.9 I would not have won it, he said.         
	But his feat was also overshadowed by a controversy involving Bindra. Indian coaches Sunny Thomas and Stanislaus Lapidus cried foul over Bindras 42nd shot in the 60-shot preliminaries.         
	The score given was a 7 but we were quite sure it was a 9. I went to Abhinav who also thought it was closer to 9 but was not sure about it. Had we protested, we would have lost two points as penalty. It was Abhinavs call who had the teams chances also in his mind, said Lapidus.         
	Thomas also said the score should have been a 9 and not 7. Bindra also thought that he shot a 9 but was given only a 7.         
	I shot a 9. I was shooting well till the incident happened. It was bad luck. But considering what happened my performance was good, said Bindra.         
	While Narang was one point behind the Chinese champion after the end of the qualifying stage, Bindra shockingly did not qualify after the controversial incident which, Lapidus said, affected his concentration in the five-man shoot-off to pick the last three competitors for the final.         
	Bindra and Rajput were tied with three others to gain the last three places in the final that led to the shoot off but both the Indians were eliminated.         
	While Bindra finished 10th with 593 points, Rajput signed off one rung higher with the same score and edged out his teammate 51.8 to 50.6         
	But other Indian shooters drew a blank with Omkar Singh ending seventh in the mens 50m pistol with 648.2 points. Compatriots Amanpreet Singh and Deepak Sharma finished 16th and 28th respectively and were eliminated.         
	The Indian team also ended fifth behind South Korea, China, Japan and Vietnam with 1646 points.         
	Veteran markswoman Suma Shirur shot one point better than her performance in last months Delhi Commonwealth Games but still failed to qualify for the finals of the womens 10m air rifle event while her teammates Tejaswini Sawant and Kavita Yadav finished way off the mark.         
	World record holder Suma shot 596 that included 33 perfect 10s, with sequences of 98, 99, 100 and 99 and was edged out of the qualification ranks.         
	Kavita, who finished 28th with 390 (96 98 98 98) had 27 perfect 10s while Tejaswini, who is the world champion in 50m prone, also tallied the same with 24 perfect 10s to finish a distant 33rd. She started brilliantly with a 99 but then fell off to bring off scores of 98 98 and 95.         
	Yi Siling led a Chinese 1-2 sweep of the individual medals that enabled the hosts to win the team gold with a tally of 1194, two better than Irans silver winning aggregate and a whopping 12 ahead of Uzbekistan who won the bronze.         
	On Sunday, four gold medals are at stake in the mens and womens 10m air pistol (team and individual).           (AGENCIES)

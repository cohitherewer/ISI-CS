                                                                                                                       7                                      Sharath, Subhajit make a point
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The moment Yang Zi hit the ball into the net on match point, the crowd at Yamuna Sports Complex erupted in joy. The giant screens at the stadium displayed the gigantic visuals  Sharath Kamal and Subhajit Sahas wild celebrations and the other team members wilder euphoria in the stands. Indeed, it was a special moment.         
	The duo earned Indias only gold in table tennis winning the mens doubles in five tough games, 9-11, 12-10, 11-4, 5-11, 11-8, outclassing Singapores Yang and Gao Ning. This gold medal means more to me than the singles gold I won at the Melbourne Games, said Sharath, on Wednesday evening.         
	In the last edition of the Games, apart from Sharaths individual triumph, the mens team had also picked up a gold, while the womens team had bagged a bronze. But this win, said Sharath, was an answer to those critics who had said that the earlier glory was a fluke. In Melbourne, we won as underdogs and people often say that we got lucky. We had to prove them wrong and with this gold, we proved our merit.         
	Just three hours prior to the doubles final, Sharath had lost to Zi 9-11, 11-8, 7-11, 11-7, 7-11, 11-5, 11-9 in the mens singles semis, setting up a bronze medal playoff date with compatriot Soum-yadeep Roy, on Thursday. It was extremely difficult to comeback from that loss. But, all credit goes to (Subhajit) Saha and coach Massimo Constantini, said the world No. 40.         
	Subhajit pointed out the fact that they had defeated the Singaporean team last year. We had beaten the same duo at Glasgow in the Commonwealth Championships last year. So, I told him to forget about the previous (singles) match and only concentrate on the doubles, he said.         
	Earlier, Soumyadeep, playing his maiden semis, lost tamely to world No.17 Ning. Soumyadeep took exactly 19 minutes to design his own destiny, as he went down 2-11, 2-11, 9-11, 7-11.         
	It was also curtains for Soumyadeeps fiancee, Poulami Ghatak, and her doubles partner Mouma Das. The womens doubles duo lost in straight games to Singapores Beibei Sun and Jiawei Li. The pair from Bengal gave up a 6-4 lead in the third game to go down 5-11, 6-11, 9-11 in the semi-finals.         
	In badminton, Parupalli Kashyap defeated Chetan Anand, 21-15, 21-18 in the mens singles bronze medal playoff tie, on Wednesday. Had I played even half of what I did today, I would have been playing for the gold medal tomorrow (Thursday), claimed Kashyap.         
	Indias total medal tally after Wednesdays action stood at 96 medals (36 gold, 26 silver and 34 bronze).

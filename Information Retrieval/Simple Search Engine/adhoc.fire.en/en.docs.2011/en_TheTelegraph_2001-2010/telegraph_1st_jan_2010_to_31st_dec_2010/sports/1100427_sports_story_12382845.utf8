	Lahore: A citizen has filed a petition in the Lahore High Court alleging Shoaib Malik and his family violated government regulations while organising the wedding reception of Shoaib and Sania, in Sialkot.         
	Hasan Shahzad, in his petition, has prayed that the High Court take notice of the fact that electricity was wasted and the one-dish rule for weddings was violated at the reception Sunday.         
	Basically the Lahore High Court will now decide whether the petition has merit to be admitted for regular hearing, a senior lawyer said.         
	The petitioner has said that during the wedding reception, Shoaib and his family, despite several warnings from the authorities, made extravagant use of electricity to decorate their house and the reception venue.         
	He has also alleged that while the government has made it mandatory that only one dish is allowed to be served at marriages, Malik and his family had several dishes on their menu.         
	There were reports that invitation cards for the reception had been sold by some people for between Pakistani Rs 5000 to Rs 10,000. A petitioner, on Monday, alleged that people who purchased invitation cards were not allowed entry, and their money should be refunded.         
	The reception largely turned out to be a mismanaged affair as the organisers claimed that hundreds of people showed up without invitation cards. The mismanagement forced the hassled newly-weds to leave the function before it was over. A private channel reported that Sanias family left for Lahore early.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India bow to Iranian class
                                                                                                                       7                                        India bow to Iranian class
  - Kazakhstan make short work of tired Pakistan       A STAFF REPORTER            Action during Indias match against Iran, at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: After the opening day high, the Indians were given a reality check by the mighty Iranians in the 3rd Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship (Central Zone), at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, on Saturday.         
	The hosts had to pay for their lack of swift on-court movement and failure to maintain hard-earned leads as they were humbled 16-25, 24-26, 25-23, 23-25 by Iran. The match was a closely fought affair and the Indians did have their moments.         
	The technically superior Iranians, however, ran through the first set before India could realise what hit them. The visitors took a 16-10 lead halfway through the set and maintained that all through to clinch the opening set.         
	But with a strong crowd egging on the Indians, the Sanjay Kumar-led side came back with a renewed gusto in the second set. The new-found energy saw the Indians time their blocks better and land their smashes perfectly as they surged to a 8-5 lead.         
	However, lapses in concentration helped the Iranians make it 8-8. From thereon, it was close encounter with both the teams matching each other in grabbing points. At match-point, the Indians faltered and Iran capitalised to bag the set.         
	The third set though belonged to the Indians. This time, it were the Iranians who lost focus with a few of their serves going wrong at crucial points.         
	While the crowd anticipated another comeback by the Indians to take the match to the fifth set, the clinical Iranians played spoilsport. They kept their cool when it mattered most to shut out the fourth set and the match.         
	One man who made the difference for Iran was their libero  Golmohammed Sakhavi. He was not only busiest player on the court, but also the key motivator of his team. His fitness impressed everyone and his energy provided his teammates with that extra stride.         
	For the Indians, all were good, but only in patches. The smashes feeble, the movement predictable and the blocks often had gaping holes. India will also have to improve on their serves in the crucial match against Pakistan on Sunday.         
	In the other match of the day, Kazakhstan made short work of Pakistan outclassing them in straight sets  25-11, 25-22. 25-23. The Pakistan side, who according to their coach are too tired to give their best, didnt manage to trouble the Kazakhs at any point.         
	However, a voltage fluctuation during the match caused some of the lights to go off. That held up play for 35 minutes.         
	After similar incidents at the outdoor venues of the Eden and the Salt Lake Stadium, we didnt really need such a shame at the indoor venues too.

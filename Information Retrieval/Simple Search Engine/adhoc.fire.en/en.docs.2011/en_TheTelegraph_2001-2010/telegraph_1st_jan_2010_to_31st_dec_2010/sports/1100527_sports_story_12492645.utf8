The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | County player was told to name his own price
                                                                                                                       7                                      County player was told to name his own price
  - Suspicion of match-fixing returns to haunt the game       NICK HOULT                            
	The suspicion of corruption hangs over the English domestic game again with the revelation that a senior County cricketer was told he could name his own price to fix a one-day match this season.         
	This newspaper can reveal a professional player, who has been advised to remain anonymous, has contacted the games authorities after he was approached by an Indian businessman seeking to fix the result of televised domestic one-day matches.         
	The player, who has more than 10 years experience in English cricket, was told that other County cricketers had accepted money from bookmakers and that things are already happening in County cricket. The Professional Cricketers Association was made aware of the approach on Tuesday and will be contacting the International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption Unit on the players behalf.         
	They basically told me I could name my price for providing them with knowledge of the result of the game and they made me believe other counties are already involved, the player said.         
	My worry with this is that there will be a situation where two of the smaller Counties play against each other in a televised game and they could come to an agreement and make about five times their salary from one match. This problem is a lot more serious than people think. Others could be out there naming their own price. It is a scary thought.         
	[The England and Wales Cricket Board has acknowledged that two players had reported attempted bribes by bookmakers.]         
	Match-fixing is closely linked with organised crime gangs and it seems players are reluctant to put their safety, and that of their families, at risk by publicly revealing approaches.         
	Ian Smith, the PCA legal director, said: The PCA are determined to work with the ACU to develop a workable protocol that allows players to come forward with confidence. We recognise that it is for the good of the game that players fulfil their duty to report approaches. We are aware of the concerns players might have over these issues and we will work with ACU to address those.         
	While the player has reported his concerns before discussions moved on to actually identifying a match to fix, it is likely that the game in question would have been a Friends Provident Twenty20 Cup tie. The competition starts next week with more than 30 matches televised live overseas.         
	It had been thought that cricket was now more vulnerable to spot fixing, where a player is paid to perform a specific act such as bowling a wide and Lord Condon, the outgoing head of the ACU, confirmed this at a press conference last week. Essex police are currently conducting an investigation into alleged spot fixing and recently two players, Mervyn Westfield and Danish Kaneria, were arrested and bailed until September.         
	But this latest approach, however ham-fisted, shows that fixing the result of a match remains an issue. Vast sums of money could be made by betting syndicates if they were to know in advance the result of a game, even one played away from the bright lights of international cricket.         
	It seems almost impossible to buy the silence of 11 players but the grooming methods used in this case show the lengths and element of risk the syndicates are willing to operate under. The player was left with the perception that if he did not take the money then somebody else would.         
	Their line of communication with me was that other people were already involved, he said. I dont know if they were just telling me that to persuade me to get involved or whether it was serious. The idea was that I would take the offer into the dressing room to get the others to agree.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steven Finn warms up   to banter
                                                                                                                       7                                      Steven Finn warms up   to banter
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	Steven Finn expects plenty more Ashes banter from Australian crowds, and is confident he will be able to deal with it too.         
	Finn, who got off to a slow start in Englands six-wicket victory in Perth last week but improved in the course of his first match Down Under, has also had his first taste of interaction with Australian supporters.         
	Finn is already well aware he can expect more of the same as the Ashes loom ever larger.         
	The 6ft 8in seamer spoke of the warm welcome England have received so far. But, at the suggestion there may be some more pointed remarks in the offing soon, he said: Im sure there will, and were prepared for that.         
	It will not be a problem for him either. We copped a bit of abuse at the Waca last week in that last innings, he added. Its something were prepared for, well embrace and were going to try to enjoy.         
	Friendly banter is good  to make sure were accessible as people, were human beings as well, and everyones got a sense of humour. You can see the funny side when people are chirping you. Its part of what we have to expect as international cricketers, and to be able to deal with that is important.         
	Finn was less amused by his first spell against Western Australia, when he appeared to struggle to keep his balance at the crease and over-pitched alarmingly at times.         
	He quickly overcame the problem, and was satisfied with his performance by the end of the three-day fixture.         
	I slid around in the footholds in the first innings a little bit  but I dont want to make excuses.         
	Im not the sort of person who is going to sit there and say it was because of the footholds I was bowling full.         
	It might have contributed. But I didnt bowl well in my first spell and went for three or four an over  which is something I dont want to do in Australia.         
	I adapted and managed to bowl better lengths. Its important that process happens quicker in future.

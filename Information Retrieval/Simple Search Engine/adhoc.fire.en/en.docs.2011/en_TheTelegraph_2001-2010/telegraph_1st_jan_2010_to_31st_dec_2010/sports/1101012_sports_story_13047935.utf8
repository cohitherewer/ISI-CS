The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla take 2-0 lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bangla take 2-0 lead
                      
	Dhaka: Shahriar Nafeess brisk half-century and three wickets by Suhrawadi Shuvo helped Bangladesh race to a seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in the third ODI here on Monday.         
	The left-handed opener cracked 13 fours in his 73 to help Bangladesh achieve a 174-run target with 10 overs to spare for a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. Left-arm spinner Shuvo, playing only his fifth one-dayer, finished with 3-14 off 10 disciplined overs to restrict the tourists to a modest total after the hosts elected to field on a slow track.         
	Bangladesh, who won just one of their 17 ODIs against New Zealand before this series, were put on course for victory by Nafees and Imrul Keyes, who added 127 for the opening wicket in 24.2 overs. Kayes hit four boundaries in an 83-ball 50, his sixth ODI half-century, before becoming off-spinner Nathan McCullums second victim of the innings.         
	Middle-order batsman Ross Taylor earlier top-scored for New Zealand with an unbeaten 62 with the help of four sixes, including two in an over from seamer Rubel Hossain.         
	He added 72 runs for the eighth wicket with Kyle Mills (26) after the tourists were reeling at 101-7. Mills smashed two successive sixes off spinner Shakib-Al-Hasan in his 28-ball knock.         
	Opener Jesse Ryder (33) and Bradley-John Watling (20) put on 55 for the second wicket before New Zealand struggled against spin in the middle overs.         
	Ryder hit two sixes and one four in his 42-ball knock, while Watling struck two boundaries in his 41-ball innings.         
	Spinners Mohammad Mahmudullah and Shakib grabbed two wickets apiece, while left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak took one wicket.           (AGENCIES)

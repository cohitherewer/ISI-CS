	Margao: East Bengal rode on their luck to beat Sporting Clube de Goa by a solitary goal in a 13th round I-league encounter at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Wednesday.         
	Clube missed a barrage of chances in the first session and had to pay heavily for their ineptness as the Federation Cup champions struck the winner through Yusif Yakubu five minutes before the end to compound further misery on the bottom-placed team.         
	The hosts created openings but striker Junior Ovagmiro wasted two decent chances midway through.         
	Vishwas Gaonkars side again came close to scoring in the 28th minute but the red and gold brigade defence managed a timely clearance.         
	After the breather, East Bengal recovered somewhat when Yakubu, latching on to a clever pass from Bhaichung Bhutia, almost broke the dead lock in the 55th minute had not Clube defender Mathew Gonsalves come up with a neat challenge to dispose the Ghanaian.         
	With the visitors also standing up to the challenge, the local side failed to create the openings which were coming easy in the first half.         
	With the match nearing the end, it seemed that the Goan side were at least good for a point, but Alvito DCunha had other ideas.         
	The former international, latching on to a forward pass from Syed Rahim Nabi, set up the ball for Yakubu. With rival keeper Felix DSouza out of place, Yakubu nodded the ball into an empty net with five minutes remaining of the match.         
	After the match ended, a section of the crowd vented their anger on the officials and assaulted referee A. Arjunan. However, police at the stadium were alert enough to arrest the offenders.

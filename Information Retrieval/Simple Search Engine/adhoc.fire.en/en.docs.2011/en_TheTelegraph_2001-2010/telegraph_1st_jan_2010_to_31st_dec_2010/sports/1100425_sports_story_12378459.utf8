The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL needs strict regulations
                                                                                                                       7                                          IPL needs strict regulations
  - Mess needs to be cleaned up for benefit of cricket, says former Team India coach       A STAFF REPORTER            John Wright in the city, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Former Team India coach John Wright said that the mess the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) has found itself into, should be cleared as early as possible.         
	You have to clean up this mess for the benefit of cricket. There should be more transparency, tougher regulations and governance so that this mud slinging game is not repeated. And I believe that it can be done, he said on Saturday.         
	In town to promote the John Wright Scholarship SIT (Southern Institute of Technology, New Zealand), the former Black Caps captain and opener said he did not agree with those who wanted to ban the IPL.         
	That should not be done. Its a commercially viable project for so many people and, most importantly, the fans love the concept. So why ban this tournament? So many professional leagues are being run all over the world. You just need some tougher regulations. Rest will fall in place, he said.         
	For someone who took over as the Indian coach when the cricket was facing the match-fixing controversy, Wright said he was confident that the game will be the winner once again. Yes I am confident about it.         
	Wright added that he was surprised by the fact that the International Cricket Council (ICC) was quiet over the raging IPL controversy. Yeah, I am surprised they are not reacting. But I think since this is a domestic tournament, they want the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to handle the issue.         
	With Saturday being Sachin Tendulkars 37th birthday, Wright wished the batsman a very happy birthday.         
	He is an incredible batsman. His joy and passion for the game has continued just like it used to be when he started 20 years back. He is very special for India. I hope he gets a even bigger birthday present on Sunday by winning the IPL final, he said.         
	When asked about the secret of Sachins longevity, he said hardwork and nothing else was the answer.         
	Wright also said it would not be fair to compare Sourav Ganguly with present Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Well, since my stint was with Sourav, I will definitely say he is the best captain India have ever seen. But then, I find Dhoni also very level headed.         
	On the upcoming World Twenty20, Wright felt that five or six teams are favourites. Its difficult to predict a winner in Twenty20. Whoever gets the momentum going will have the last laugh. But as far as India are concerned, Virender Sehwag will be definitely missed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terry set to follow in Woods footsteps
                                                                                                                       7                                        Terry set to follow in Woods footsteps
                  John Terry                     
	Sacked England captain John Terry could receive counselling similar to that which Tiger Woods is having for sex addiction, a British tabloid has reported. The Chelsea player might consider seeking professional help to deal with his off-the-pitch problems.         
	Terry was recently caught in a storm after his alleged affair with French model Vanessa Perroncel, 33, the former girlfriend of teammate Wayne Bridge, became public.         
	On Saturday, though, the 29-year-old was pictured with wife Toni Poole in Dubai as the couple relaxed with their two children by the pool of a five-star hotel. Terry is in Dubai after Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti granted him compassionate leave .         
	The pictures say more than words can say about how we are as a couple, Terry, who skipped Blues FA Cup match against Cardiff City, was quoted as saying. What me and Toni speak about, no one will ever know. No one will ever get close to knowing about how our life is. We are private people.         
	We know how we feel about each other and that is the main thing. Our relationship has never been knocked down. Were just so in love.         
	Photographs showed the pair enjoying the hot weather as they frolicked on sun loungers and swam in the pool. Were very strong as a couple  always have been. John came over to see me and the kids and enjoy a few days in the hot weather, Toni said.         
	They then went out as a family on a luxury cruiser and Terry and his wife went fishing.         
	So how was the boat trip? According to Terry, it was fantastic. Its like being on honeymoon again only this time with the kids, and its better!         
	The tabloid also quoted a holidaymaker as saying: What does that man have to do to upset his wife? Hes cheated on her and shes welcomed him back with open arms. She must be the most forgiving woman on the planet.         
	Its amazing how all seems forgotten so quickly. John must have something special. Tonis been all over him. She looked so miserable when she first arrived in Dubai. Watching the pair fooling around in the pool its difficult to believe its the same woman.         
	At one stage I thought theyd forgotten there were other people about  it was all getting a bit heated as Terry sank down on his knees in the water! I was amazed to see Tonis mum and dad playing happy families too.         
	Johns a lucky man. A less understanding father-in-law would have clocked him one! (Agencies)

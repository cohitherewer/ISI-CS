The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid goes under   the knife
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dravid goes under   the knife
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Rahul Dravid                                 
	Calcutta/Bangalore: Senior Team India pro Rahul Dravid underwent a minor corrective surgery on his injured left upper jaw at the Manipal Hospital Friday.         
	Dravid broke his jaw during the second Test against Bangladesh in Mirpur. The surgery was done by maxillofacial surgeon Dr Kishore Nayak.         
	[That the former India captain was set to undergo surgery had been reported by The Telegraph in Fridays edition.]         
	Rahul Dravid suffered a depressed fracture of the left cheek bone (left zygomatic arch bone) and this was corrected using a standard open approach. He will be discharged from hospital and can resume normal activities in about two days, said Dr H.S. Balal, the hospital medical director.         
	However, he has been advised not to play cricket or any contact sports for about 2-3 weeks by Dr Nayak. He will be assessed for fitness on a regular basis, he added.         
	The prolific India batsman had been hit on the jaw when he ducked into a Shahadat Hossain bouncer on Day II of the second Test against Bangladesh, in Dhaka. The right-hander was forced to retire hurt on 111, his 29th Test century.         
	Dravid had, by then, made his contribution to the Indian victory in the second Test and the clean sweep in the two-match rubber would have been a salve of sorts.         
	What would be really painful for Dravid would be the exclusion from the squad for the first Test versus the South Africans. The Wall has been one of the batting mainstays of Team India and it is almost unthinkable that he is missing from the side going into the biggest engagement for the Mahendra Singh Dhonis since they became the Test No.1.         
	The record holder (along with Sachin Tendulkar) for the highest number of hundred-plus Test partnerships will find it hard to watch on television as his teammates lock horns with the Proteas when the action gets underway at Nagpur on February 6.         
	The Proteas will also play a three-match ODI series against the Indians.         
	Dravid, who has been advised three weeks rest, has, for all practical purposes, been ruled out of the Test series against South Africa. He is expected to be fit for third edition of the Indian Premier League in March.

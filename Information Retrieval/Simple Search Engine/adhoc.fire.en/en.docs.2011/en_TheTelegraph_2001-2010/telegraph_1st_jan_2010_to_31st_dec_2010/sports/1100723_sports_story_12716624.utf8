The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting leads Aussie fightback
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting leads Aussie fightback
                                Ricky Ponting completed 12,000 runs, on Thursday      
	Leeds: Captain Ricky Ponting was unbeaten on 61 as Australia finished second days play at 136 for two against Pakistan, at Headingley, to leave the second Test delicately poised.         
	Ponting scored his runs from 103 balls and his innings was studded with six fours, leaving Australia 34 runs behind with eight wickets in hand.         
	Umar Amin and Mohammad Aamer were the only bowlers to take wickets, as Ponting and Michael Clarke batting on 32, advanced from 62 for two at tea.         
	Butts apparently charmed life on his debut as captain continued, when his decision to hand the ball to part-time bowler Umar Amin for the 16th over was instantly vindicated.         
	Amin, having removed North in the first innings, bowled Watson for 24, as he tried to cut the ball and played on to his stumps. As batting conditions improved in the evening, and with Pakistan setting defensive field, Ponting scored his 12,000th run in Test cricket with a four to third man off Aamer and brought up his 50, from 73 balls, with a single from Kaneria.         
	 Ponting and Clarke steadily eroded Pakistans lead, reviving memories of the Sydney Test in January, when Australia overcame a first innings deficit of 206 to beat Pakistan by 36 runs.         
	Aamer and Mohammed Asif bowled beautifully without reward, while Ponting lived dangerously, surviving another convincing shout for leg before and a stumping appeal before bad light halted play.         
	Earlier, Shane Watson took a career-best six for 33 as Australia dismissed Pakistan for 258 in its first innings  a lead of 170. Pakistan captain Salman Butt top scored with 45. Pakistan began on 148 for three. The morning session was delayed for 45 minutes due to rain but when play did begin, the opening over provided an explosive start as Mitchell Johnson conceded 11 runs before having Umar Akmal caught at mid-off from the sixth delivery.         
	Umar was given a reprieve as Johnson was called for a no-ball, although Umar Amin was nearly run out at the opposite end as he scrambled for a single. It proved to be a temporary stay of execution for Akmal, who was caught behind off Johnson for 21 in the 44th over, the fifth of the morning.         
	Amin was the victim of a freak dismissal for 25 in the 51st over, when he ducked under a bouncer from Ben Hilfenhaus but left his bat in the air. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unlucky to be drawn with giants
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                          Unlucky to be drawn with giants
      FREE-KICK -   P K BANERJEE                                                    
	There were some important developments in Indian football in the past couple of weeks that I followed with keen interest.         
	I went against my doctors advice and did not go to bed till the draw for the Asian Cup final rounds were held in Doha. India were drawn against Australia, Korea and Bahrain and experts said it was the toughest group of the tournament. No doubt, we were unlucky to be pitted against three of the top six teams in Asia.        
	But I couldnt help thinking about the days in the 50s and the 60s when we used to play against Australia and Korea. In Melbourne 1956, India defeated hosts Australia comfortably with Neville DSouza scoring a memorable hattrick, the only one by an Indian in the Olympic arena.        
	Those days, Korea were always scared of playing against India. We beat them in the 1962 Asian Games final and two years later when we met them in the Asian Cup, the Koreans lost again. We reached the final before losing to Israel in Tel Aviv.        
	Now, I should stop before being accused of trying to blow our own trumpet. I know there are some people who firmly believe that Asian football in our days was childs play and that was the reason why India won medals frequently.        
	Like others, I wasnt surprised when great coach Rahim Sahibs birth centenary went unnoticed last year or when I failed to spot any photograph of Neville DSouza on the walls of the federation office when I walked in there last time.        
	Perhaps I am deviating away from the actual subject. Back to Indias chances in the Asian Cup this time, beating Australia and South Korea may look impossible at the moment but never forget the fact that matches are actually won and lost on the field.        
	The prospect of Chirag United winning the Calcutta Football League (CFL) title is another thing that made me feel excited in the last few days. They could be the first team outside the three traditional majors to win the CFL since 1958 when Eastern Railway grabbed the top spot.        
	Again, I was lucky to be a member of the Eastern Railway team that won the league in 1958. Led by Pramatha Bose, a resounding stopper back and a pass out of the Railways Engineering College in Jamalpur, we had a team consisting of all local boys.         
	Some of them like goalkeeper Pradyut Burman, midfielders Taposh Shome, Nikhil Nandy, Prasanta Sinha and yours truly in the forward line played for India in their own rights.         
	I am happy to note that Chirag United are also using a lot of local talents besides their usual quota of foreigners.        
	While less is said about the two top Calcutta teams is better, I was disgusted by the way the East Bengals Belgian coach Phillippe de Ridder carried himself in the AFC Cup home match which they lost by four goals.         
	Tactically, he was certainly below par and I had a strange feeling from his words that he wasnt too perturbed by the defeat.        
	Personally, I have nothing against foreign coaches since I consider them as the part of my fraternity but by now, the club officials should know that there are some good local coaches still available in India.

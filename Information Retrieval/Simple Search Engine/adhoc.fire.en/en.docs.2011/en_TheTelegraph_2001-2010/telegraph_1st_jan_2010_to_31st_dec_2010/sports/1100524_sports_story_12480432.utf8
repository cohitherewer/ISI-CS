	Margao: Churchill Brothers squandered a golden chance to notch up the second spot after they were held to a 2-2 draw by East Bengal in a 25th round encounter of the I-League rescheduled match played at the Nehru Stadium, Margao here on Sunday.         
	East Bengal stunned Churchill Brothers bringing themselves back into the match after trailing by two goals. The Kolkata giants scored two goals in ten minutes to spoil Churchill Brothers party. Desperately looking for a win, Churchill started the match on aggressive note and scored the opener through their goal machine Odafe Okolie in the 36th minute.         
	Even though Churchill tried their best to take the match away from the visitors, their effort couldnt yield the desired results as the scoreline read 1-0 after the end of first half proceedings. The second half turned out be eventful one as Churchill doubled their lead in the 57th minute through Felix Chimaokwu spot-kick but their joy was short-lived as Mehtab Hussain pulled one back for the East Bengal few seconds later.         
	The goal pumped-up East Bengal as they levelled the terms in the 68th minute, when Sanju Pradhan converted from the spot.         
	Churchill now have 40 points from 25 matches, while East Bengal broke into the thirties but still find themselves languishing at ninth place.           (AGENCIES)

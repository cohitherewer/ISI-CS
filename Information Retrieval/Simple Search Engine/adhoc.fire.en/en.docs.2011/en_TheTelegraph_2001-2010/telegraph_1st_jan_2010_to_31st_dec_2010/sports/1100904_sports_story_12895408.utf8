The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB makes a mess of selections 
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB makes a mess of selections 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The senior selection committee was left red-faced while announcing the three CAB teams for the S.K. Acharya Challenger Trophy, on Friday.         
	The lack of co-ordination between selectors Sambaran Banerjee, Devang Gandhi, Mintu Das and Moloy Banerjee and convenor Biswarup Dey was exposed, when they officially named the various squads including the U-22 side that will take part in Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup tournament.         
	There were some very basic errors, which the committee wanted to downplay.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha and Ranadeb Bose will lead CAB Red, Green and Blue teams respectively.         
	Rohan Banerjee was named the captain of the U-22 team with Shreevats Goswami as his deputy.         
	On the day, when the chairman of selection committee Banerjee named the squad, it was noticed pacer Sami Ahmed had been included in both U-22 and CAB Red squads.         
	Realising the faux pas, Banerjee immediately struck off Samis name from the CAB Red list. If that wasnt enough, it was found out that the Red squad didnt have a single wicketkeeper.         
	Sufiyan Khans name was included in the end. It was just an unintentional mistake. Dont read too much into it, Banerjee reasoned.         
	There was more coming. Last years U-22 captain Arnab Nandy, who played a few List A matches was missing from the 39 names announced.         
	In a jiffy, the selection committee inducted Arnab in the Blue squad at the expense of Manojit Ghosh.

  - Iran begin in style as they thrash a struggling Pakistan side       A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: India began their campaign in the Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship (Central Zone) with a 25-18, 25-12, 25-22 victory over Kazakhstan at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Friday. In an earlier match, Iran thrashed Pakistan 25-21, 25-19, 25-18.         
	Kazakhstan tried to put up a fight in the first set after taking up an 8-5 lead at the first technical time-out. But the Indians came back strongly to wrap it up in 33 minutes.         
	The second set saw the hosts lead from the start to win in 23 minutes.         
	They, however, faced some tough opposition in the third set before coming back from 12-16 down to seal the issue in 25 minutes.         
	The first match jitters showed in our performance We made two/three mistakes today but recovered well in the third set. We will definitely improve from our next game on Saturday, said India coach Deshraj.         
	Were not happy with our blocking. Some things need to be worked upon.         
	Deshraj was hopeful of pulling up a victory against the formidable Iran Saturday. All the teams are equal in strength. We go into the match against Iran full of confidence Moreover well have the backing of the home crowd, the coach said.         
	India, though, will miss the services of the injured Gurchand Singh on Saturday. Gurchand, who led India to a historic bronze at Asian Cup in Iran last month, is expected to be fit for the match against Pakistan on Sunday.         
	Against Kazakhstan, India regained the lead 16-14 at the end of the second time-out and never looked back. Good blocking and spiking helped them dominate the proceedings.         
	Fine shows from captain Sanjay Kumar, Naveen Raja Jacob and M Ukkrapandian ensured India maintain the momentum in the second set.         
	They led 8-5 in the first time-out and by the second time-out had increased it to 16-9. Bad positioning by the Kazakhstan players also caused their doom.         
	Iran had an easy opener against Pakistan. Pakistan struggled with their service, while their libero Shahrukh was below par.         
	Iran, on the other hand, surged ahead with good smashing from Vali Nourmohammedi, while Alireza Mobasheridemneh was solid in defence.         
	Iran head coach Payman Akbari said they wanted to assess their opponents first before going all out.         
	Pakistan played well but their inexperience came to the fore, especially in service. We are satisfied with our show, Akbari said.         
	Pakistan, on the other hand, blamed the defeat on fatigue.

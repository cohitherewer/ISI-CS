The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil are good, but so are we: Somdev
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazil are good, but so are we: Somdev
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  Somdev Dev Varman        
	Chennai: Chennai has been a happy hunting ground for Somdev Dev Varman who has reason to hope that the team atmosphere in Davis Cup would bring added success to him and India in the World Group play-off against Brazil.         
	I love playing in Chennai and have had some good results here in the past. We have been having some really good practice sessions and we are all ready. Hopefully there will be a great crowd following and that could only help our chances, Dev Varman told The Telegraph on the eve of the tie.         
	Indias No.1 singles player looked fresh from a rare break from the circuit, spent with his parents and pets at his Guwahati home, before arriving in Chennai earlier this week.         
	I really enjoyed my time back home. Both my siblings also took some time off their work and made it back. So that was a lot of fun, he said.         
	I ate a lot of good food throughout the week and had fun playing with all the dogs at home. Its hard to explain but its just the kind of feeling you can only get when youre home.         
	The 25-year-old was least worried about the higher ranking of Brazils singles players, Thomaz Bellucci and Ricardo Mello.         
	They are both good players on clay court and hard as well. But so are we. Weve had good results on these courts in the past. Well have to play our best to beat them, he said.         
	He was all praise for his fellow singles player, Rohan Bopanna.         
	Hes playing with a lot of confidence. When Rohan plays well, hes a tough guy to beat. So this could only help our chances going into the tie.         
	Dev Varman denied that the controversy over pending money from the government towards Commonwealth Games had distracted the players. There werent any distractions, but its just nice to see our efforts being appreciated by the Indian government, he said.

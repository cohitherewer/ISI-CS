The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It could be unanimous
                                                                                                                       7                                      It could be unanimous
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Manohar        
	Mumbai: Having recused himself from the disciplinary committee, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar, may not be a very active participant during Saturdays Special General Meeting here.         
	The meeting has been called to endorse/reject the line of action being followed against Lalit Kumar Modi, who has been suspended from all posts, including those of vice-president (Central) and chairman-commissioner of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Modi is in the dock for plenty of wrongdoing, top of the list being the facilitation fee issue of a massive Rs 425 crore and the IPLs controversial contract with the Rajasthan Royals, a franchise where his relatives have big stakes.         
	Besides, Modi has much to answer for the commercial exploitation of 150 seconds, between deliveries in the T20 matches, arm-twisting the Kochi franchisee, misconduct and damaging the image of the BCCI.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, the IPLs questionable agreement with MSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte Ltd had a clause that if WSG Mauritius didnt get that astronomical facilitation fee, then the BCCI would terminate its contract with MSM and pay that amount to WSG!         
	Such clauses are unheard of and only strengthen the belief that Modi was involved in kickbacks. That MSM has agreed to pay Rs 425 crore to the BCCI, instead, is significant.         
	The script changed after some plain talking from Manohar, who wants to clean the mess and restore the BCCIs standing among institutions with a rich history.         
	Meanwhile, a senior member, possibly a vice-president, will take Manohars place on the committee.         
	A surprise, however, cant be ruled out.         
	Two of the vice-presidents, Arun Jaitley (North) and Chirayu Amin (West), are already on it. Modi is suspended, so either Shivlal Yadav (South) or Arindam Ganguly (East) could have a role in the expected expulsion of the man who did everything his way for well over two years.         
	The expulsion bit, though, wont come about till the procedures have been completed. Manohar, after all, doesnt want to give Modi any chance to cry foul. He may not even vote.         
	Not that such a decision would impact on the meetings outcome. Given the mood, the voting (possibly by a show of hands) could be unanimous. The BCCI has 30 affiliated units with voting rights, plus theres the president, who also enjoys a casting vote.         
	For the record, the agenda reads: (a) ratifying secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasans decision to refer Modis replies to the three showcause notices to the committee; (b) reconstituting the committee; (c) any IPL-specific decision which needs to be taken.

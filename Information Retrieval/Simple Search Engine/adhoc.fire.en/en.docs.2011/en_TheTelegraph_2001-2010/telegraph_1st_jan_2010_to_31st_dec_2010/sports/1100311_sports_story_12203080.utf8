The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pune FC hold Mohun Bagan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pune FC hold Mohun Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan were held goalless by Pune FC in a 15th round I-League encounter at the Howrah Stadium on Wednesday. The result meant that the Pune side maintained their unbeaten run in the second phase of the league and for Bagan, a golden opportunity to climb higher (and nearer to leaders Dempo SC) was lost.         
	The green and maroon brigade, missing the services of ace striker Edeh Chidi, faltered near the goalmouth to squander their chances.         
	In the 75th minute, Snehasish Chakraborty and Jose Barreto played a one-two before the Brazilian released Snehasish in front of the goal. With an advancing Pune FC keeper Subrata Paul at his mercy, Snehasish chipped the ball over the keepers head. Unfortunately lack of measure in his chip took it over the horizontal.         
	Again in the 85th minute, Marcos Perreira was the culprit of failing to score from a comfortable position.         
	Meanwhile, in another I-League match in Ludhiana, JCT drew 1-1 with Salgaocar SC.

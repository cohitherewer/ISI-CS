The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colin century on ODI debut 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Colin century on ODI debut 
                      
	Bloemfontein: Colin Ingram hit the second highest ever score in a one-day International debut to lead South Africa to 351 for six against Zimbabwe, in Bloemfontein, on Friday.               
	Zimbabwe were 181 for five after 35 overs. Brendan Taylor was batting on 87 with Elton Chigumbura (1).               
	Ingram made 124, and Hashim Amla 110, as South Africa powered to the imposing total in the opening game of a three-match series against their neighbours.         
	The left-handed Ingram, who made his international debut in the Twenty20 series last week, hit eight fours and two sixes in his 126-ball effort. Only West Indies great Desmond Haynes 148 against Australia in 1978 is a better score by a batsman in his first ODI.         
	Shingirai Masakadza took four for 86 for a Zimbabwe team that included veteran batsman Grant Flower in his first international match in six years.         
	Ingram, 25, became the highest-scoring South Africa debutant when he passed Shaun Pollocks 66. He then became just the sixth ever batsman to make a hundred on ODI debut.

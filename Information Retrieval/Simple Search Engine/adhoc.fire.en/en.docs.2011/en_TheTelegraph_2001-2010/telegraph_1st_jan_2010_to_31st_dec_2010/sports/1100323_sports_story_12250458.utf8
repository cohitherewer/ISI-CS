The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1st over set the tone, says Tendulkar
                                                                                                                       7                                        1st over set the tone, says Tendulkar
            A CORRESPONDENT            Chris Gayle in Mumbai, on Monday                           
	Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar led from the front as they inflicted a seven-wicket defeat on a hapless Kolkata Knight Riders in their Indian Premier League match in Mumbai on Monday.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, Sachin said his plan was to initially pick some quick boundaries to pressurise the KKR bowlers.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sachin: It was a good wicket to bat on I wont say the wicket was on the slower side. The ball was coming on (to the bat) beautifully. Shikhar Dhawan (23) batted well in the beginning In fact, the first over (of Shane Bond, which yielded 12 runs) set the tone for us. Initially, the plan was to pick some quick boundaries to put the opposition bowlers under pressure. Later, I just concentrated on staying till the end and letting the others hit some shots. (Dwayne) Bravo, (Ryan) McLaren, Zaheer (Khan), (Lasith) Malinga and Harbhajan (Singh) all bowled well and stuck to the plan. Also, our fielding was good today as we saved quite a few boundaries.         
	Kieron Pollard: We bowled really well today. We kept it in the right areas. The master was at work again and that took us to victory. We had lost the last match and so we had planned certain things for this one. Good that we implemented them. We had it under control during the chase.

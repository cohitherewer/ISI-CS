The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now I want more, says   a beaming Mueller
                                                                                                                       7                                      Now I want more, says   a beaming Mueller
                            
	Bloemfontein: Germany striker Thomas Mueller said he was just getting warmed up after dashing Englands hopes with a double strike in their 4-1 World Cup last 16 win on Sunday.         
	The 20-year-old Man of the Match, who only 14 months ago was playing in the lower divisions with Bayern Munichs reserve team, has now scored three goals in this World Cup after winning his first cap only three months ago.         
	Two goals in one World Cup match does not happen too often, Mueller said. But now I want more. I want to score five or six goals here.         
	Mueller was instrumental in his teams demolition of England, scoring twice and setting up another for Lukas Podolski.         
	Now I am in a party mood. I am obviously happy to have helped the team but I am more happy that the team worked so well today.         
	Mueller set up Podolski with a clever lob to score Germanys second goal.         
	He then initiated a quick counter-attack and finished it off himself to make it 3-1 in the 67th minute before adding another three minutes later with yet another quick break to complete a famous victory.         
	The counter-attacks worked perfectly. The whole operation of the team was much improved since our last match (against Ghana in Group D), he said.         
	Mueller, who has risen from the Bayern reserves to the national team, winning the domestic double and playing in the Champions League final in just over a season, said his performance would mean nothing if Germany lost their quarter final.         
	I cannot buy myself anything with what I did today if we fly out in the last eight, he said. Now we have five-six days to rest and prepare for our next match, the blond-haired striker said.         
	Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard say theyd like Fabio Capello stay on as England manager.         
	England captain Gerrard wants Capello to retain his post because hes a fantastic manager.         
	Lampard called Capello a top manager who hes enjoyed working with and that hed also like for the Italian to stay on.         
	Capello said he will discuss his future with the chairman of Football Association soon. Capello has a contract until after the 2012 European Championship.         
	Cappelo was obviously disappointed with Lampards 38th minute goal was disallowed by Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda.         
	Lampard thought hed equalised when his shot bounced off the underside of the crossbar and over the line, but Larrionda did not award a goal and Germany held their 2-1 lead until halftime.         
	Its incredible, Capello said. We played with five referees and they cant decide if its a goal or no goal. The game was big different after this goal. It was the mistake of the linesman and I think the referee because from the bench I saw the ball go over the (line).         
	That England win at Wembley 44 years ago included a similar goal off the crossbar that is still disputed to this day, with many Germans believing the ball never crossed the line. Now, England fans will have something to complain about for decades to come.         
	We heard that the ball was behind the line, that we were fortunate, Mueller said. Before the last two goals, the game hung in balance, England were putting on the pressure. Its an incredible feeling to score the goal that takes the pressure off your team.         
	I think if you look back at the game as a whole weve been beaten by the better team, Gerrard said. At 2-1, if Franks ball had stayed I think it would have been a nice turning point in the game.         
	Television replays clearly showed Lampards shot had crossed the line. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer collected the ball as England shouted for a goal, but the Larrionda motioned for play to continue.

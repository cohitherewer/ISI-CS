	Bangalore: A section of adamant owners and trainers refused to allow horses to enter the paddock area, onFriday, forcing the Bangalore Turf Club stewards to draw curtains on the summer season. The protestors were demanding two extra race meetings but stewards put their foot down. The season was, in anyway, scheduled to conclude on the day.

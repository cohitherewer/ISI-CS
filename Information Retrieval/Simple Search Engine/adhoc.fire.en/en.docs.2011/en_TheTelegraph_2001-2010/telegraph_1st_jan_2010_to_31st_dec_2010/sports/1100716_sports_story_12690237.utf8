	London: Pakistan reached 114 for one against Australia at stumps on day three of the first Test at Lords on Thursday in a world record run chase after being set 440 to win.         
	Australia leg-spinner Steven Smith claimed his maiden Test wicket by removing Imran Farhat (24) after tea. Salman Butt was unbeaten on 58 for his second half-century in the match and debutant Azhar Ali had 28 as Pakistan needed 326 more to win.         
	Farhat had just raised the 50 partnership with a well-drilled three down the ground when next over he dragged a short, unthreatening delivery from Smith to Shane Watson at mid wicket.         
	Batting was easier in the evening session under blue skies than under the murky black clouds that have hovered overhead for most of the game.         
	Pakistans hopes of registering a first Test win over Australia in 15 years seem unlikely considering their first innings of 148 in reply to Australias 253.         
	But the conditions will help Pakistans cause if the sun remains. Australia are chasing a seventh straight Test win.         
	Pakistan will need to break the world record run chase of 418 if they are to win, but have never successfully chased more than the 315 they scored against Australia in 1994 in Karachi.         
	Australia were all out for 334 in their second innings on the stroke of tea. The tail added vital runs on a sunny afternoon. Even No. 10 batsman Ben Hilfenhaus flourished, registering a Test best score of 56 not out from 84 balls.         
	Pakistan removed Simon Katich (83) and Marcus North (20), the unbeaten batsmen at the lunch break, without a run being added afterwards. It was the breakthrough Pakistan needed but were unable to push on, despite Umar Guls four for 61.         
	Katich pushed tentatively and edged a ball just outside off stump from Gul to wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, ending his 174-minute stay.         
	Left-handed opener Katich, who resumed on 49, made his fourth consecutive innings of 50 or more and is averaging more than 90 this year.         
	North followed him to the dressing room next over when he played a loose stroke to a delivery from Mohammed Asif that was much wider.           (AGENCIES)

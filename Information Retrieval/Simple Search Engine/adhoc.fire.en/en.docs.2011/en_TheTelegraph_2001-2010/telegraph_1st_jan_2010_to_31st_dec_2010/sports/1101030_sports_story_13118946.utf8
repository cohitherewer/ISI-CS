The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tsotsobe shines in SAs 8-wicket win
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tsotsobe shines in SAs 8-wicket win
                  South Africas Jacques Kallis en route to his 66, before retiring hurt due to cramps, in Abu Dhabi, on Friday                     
	Abu Dhabi: South Africa beat Pakistan by eight wickets at the Zayed Cricket Stadium Friday to take a 1-0 lead in their five-match series.         
	South Africa reached 207 for 2 in 39.3 overs to win the game after Pakistan, which won the toss and elected to bat, reached 203 all out in 49 overs.         
	Jacques Kallis scored an unbeaten 66 before he retired hurt while AB de Villiers made 51. South Africa skipper Graeme Smith also retired hurt on 18 after injuring his finger.         
	Earlier, lanky South African paceman Lonwabo Tsotsobe carried his Twenty20 form into the 50-over game with a career-best feat to derail Pakistan.         
	The 26-year-old from Eastern Province took four for 27 off his 10 tight overs as Pakistan lost their last eight wickets for a mere 46 runs after winning the toss and deciding to bat on a flat pitch.         
	Tsotsobe, who took five wickets in South Africas 2-0 win in the Twenty20 series which finished here on Wednesday, rocked the Pakistan middle-order with a burst of three wickets off just nine balls during his second four-over spell.         
	Tsotsobes effort backed by disciplined spin bowling by Johan Botha (2/40) put brakes on Pakistans innings after Mohammad Hafeez (68) and returning Younis Khan (54) put on 114 for the second wicket.         
	Tsotsobe removed opener Asad Shafiq (19) in the eighth over before Younis  returning to the side after being cleared by Pakistan Cricket Board last month following a ban on discipline violation, joined Hafeez in a damage repair act.         
	Hafeez hit seven boundaries during his 84-ball sixth one-day 50 before cutting Botha straight into the hands of Charl Langeveldt. Four overs later, Younis was trapped leg-before by Botha.         
	Younis hit two boundaries during his 75-ball knock.         
	Tsotsobes triple strike followed as he removed Misbah-ul-Haq (14), Shahid Afridi (1) and Abdul Razzaq (two) to complete Pakistans slide on a similar pattern of Twenty20 matches in which they were restricted to 119 and 120-9.         
	Tsotsobes previous best bowling figures were 4-50 against Australia on his one-day debut at Perth last year.           (AGENCIES)

	New Delhi: The opening round of the Hero Honda Indian Open golf was far from being a spectators delight as top draws, including Arjun Atwal, had a rather bumpy ride at the historic Delhi Golf Club (DGC), on Thursday.         
	On a chilly day when the tee-off was delayed because of thick fog in the morning, Korean golfer Kim Hyung-sung made his maiden appearance in the $1.25 million tournament a memorable one by taking the first round lead with a flawless five-under-par 67.         
	Its my first time to India and after todays good score, I think I like this course, said a smiling Kim, who has three wins under his belt back in Korea. My putting was very good. I holed three long putts from about 10 yards at the 17th, 18th and third holes. It was good to keep the card bogey free. Its a difficult course and your tee shots need to be good.         
	The picture was not too rosy from the Indian point of view as Atwal, the first Indian golfer to bag a PGA Tour title and the star attraction of the meet, returned a rusty 73 after bartering a couple of birdies for three bogeys. He found himself at tied 45th along with Digvijay Singh, Vijay Kumar and five others.         
	Among the other big guns, Shiv Kapur, Swedens Daniel Chopra and Irish star Paul McGinley failed to live up to their reputation. While Kapur rued a cold putter, McGinley shot 71s and Chopra, a two-time winner in the US, carded a 74.         
	Atwal, however, did not lose hopes and remained confident to make a comeback in the next three days. It was a good 73. I just did not hit well, I did not find the greens and I could not putt. Still a 73, which is why I say it is still good, he said.         
	Overall, 12 Indians shot under-par and another six, including Jyoti Randhawa, Vijay Kumar, Rashid Khan, were at par. Veteran pro Sanjay Kumar with a strong start that saw him card a 68 led the Indian challenge.         
	At the end of the day, Sanjay and four other players  Korean Baek Seuk-hyun, Thailands Namchok Tantipokakul, Australian Marcus Both and Jbe Kruger of South Africa  ended at four-under 68 an were closely following the leader.         
	Credit must go to Sanjay as he managed to stay steady under fading lights. ...I was feeling confident from the start, said Sanjay, who, like many other Indian pros, is extremely familiar with the DGC course.         
	Among the 49 Indians in fray, Ashok Kumar, Gaurav Pratap Singh and Ranjit Singh also opened with three-under cards to share the seventh spot with Shamim Khan. Shamim carded a three-under 69, which comprised five birdies and a couple of bogeys. Ranjit Singh also brought in a fine card of 69, after teeing off in the last group from the tenth.

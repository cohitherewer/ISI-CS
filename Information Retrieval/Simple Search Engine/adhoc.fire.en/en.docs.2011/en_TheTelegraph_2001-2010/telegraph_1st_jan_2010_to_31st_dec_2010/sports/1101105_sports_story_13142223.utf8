            - Dravid hits his 30th Test century, Sehwag slams 173       BIVABASU KUMAR              VICTORY!: Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag during their 237-run partnership for the second wicket, at Motera, on Thursday. (AFP)                       
	Ahmedabad: A Sehwag chant in the fifth over of a Test match is little too early to start celebrations or egg the player into playing a milestone innings. But the continuous sound of the conch probably warded off the evil to clear the Delhi dashers way for a prolific batting performance, at Motera, on Thursday.         
	The belligerent opener slammed his 22nd Test hundred and added 237 runs for the second wicket with Rahul Dravid (104) to take India to 329 for three at the end of the first days play of the opening Test, against New Zealand.         
	Ahmedabad was yet to break the morning slumber, but the few thousand spectators who had gathered at the Motera were delighted after Mahendra Singh Dhoni called it right at the toss. It didnt take a soothsayer to predict India would bat if they won the toss and the runs swelled as rapidly as the stands got filled by the afternoon.         
	The opening day featured two of the games true artists at their best. Sehwag, found out by the Aussies with well-directed short balls in the last series, avoided the tangle of any technical adjustment that entraps batsmen when in doubt. He rather took the attack to the opposition without any self-imposed restriction and constructed his 173 with shots all over the ground.         
	Rahul Dravid, on the other hand, played a cautious innings. He first made Indias outing memorable with a double century-stand with Sehwag and then scripted his 30th Test hundred.         
	Though the Black Caps debutant, Hamish Bennett, didnt experience sweaty palms, he surely was taken aback by the brute force of Sehwag. Bennett, who shared the new ball with Chris Martin, hurried Gautam Gambhir into his shots, but failed to trouble Sehwag.         
	Martin failed to get his line right, either pitching it too up helping Sehwag to unleash his drives or gave him enough width to play through the off side. Bennett employed the short ball, but never looked threatening.         
	The quickies failed to extract any early nip, forget inducing an edge. In fact, the stony impassiveness of the fielders and the hapless trudge of his pacers, forced skipper Daniel Vettori to introduce himself in the ninth over.         
	The left-arm spinner pulled things back temporarily and watching his pacers struggle, brought Ryder into the mix. And the all-rounders gentle medium pace accounted for Gambhirs wicket. The southpaw froze at the crease and his attempted drive sent an inside edge onto the stumps.         
	There was no demon in the Motera wicket. Batsmen who set themselves in, reaped rich dividends and both Sehwag and Dravid led by example.         
	Dravid looked tentative considering the pressure to perform, but he battled it out nicely to place his innings. His composure was a contrast against the panicking Black Caps whose butterfingers further hindered their cause.         
	New Zealand had as many as three opportunities to eliminate Sehwag, but fluffed each time to allow the Indian opener dominate. Martin Guptills spill of Sehwag in the 65th over was the most bizarre when he grassed one that was ballooned at midwicket.         
	Though Sehwag contained his aggression after the first session, India scored 116 runs between lunch and tea. His weary legs slowed him down and a pain in his right knee forced him to opt for a runner.         
	New Zealand tried one last time with Bennett but the speedster only succeeded in clattering Dravids helmet.         
	Smiles finally returned in the visitors camp when Vettori got Sehwag and Martin removed Dravid, but the Black Caps must have realised it will take a mammoth effort to derail India from this stage.         
	With VVS Laxman (7 batting) and Sachin Tendulkar (13 batting) to take guard on Friday, the visitors should brace for another day of toil at the Motera.

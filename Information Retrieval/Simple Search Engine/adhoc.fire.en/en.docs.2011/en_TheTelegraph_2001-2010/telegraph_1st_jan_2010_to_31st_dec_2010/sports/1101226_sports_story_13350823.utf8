	Mumbai: Unseeded PC Thulasi capped a brilliant run in the Tata Open India international badminton challenge by shocking top seed Fransiska Ratnasari of Indonesia in straight games to lift her first ever womens singles title here today.         
	The 19-year-old Kerala girl outclassed her more fancied foreign rival, ranked 42nd in the world, 21-15, 21-13 in 35 minutes at the Cricket Club of India. Thulasi, who scalped second seed Jindapol Nitchaon of Thailand and national champion Sayali Gokhale earlier, used the drop shots from the back court and some timely smashes to good effect to complete a memorable run in the tournament.         
	Later, in a high-class all-Indonesian mens final that saw breathtaking rallies, top seed Yunus Alamsyah overcame a first-game deficit to down fifth-seeded compatriot Tommy Sugiarto 11-21, 21-13, 21-17.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mourinhos like a crybaby, says Emery
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mourinhos like a crybaby, says Emery
                      
	Madrid: Jose Mourinho was branded a crybaby by Valencia coach Unai Emery, on Monday, following his criticism of the match referee after Real Madrids scrappy 1-0 home win over Sevilla on Sunday.         
	The Real coach waved a piece of paper listing 13 supposed errors by Carlos Clos Gomez at Sundays post-match news conference.         
	Mourinhos stance is that of a crybaby, Emery told reporters. We have reasons to draw up a list with errors and to make a public complaint for every time we have been adversely affected, but we dont.         
	Mourinho complained that the club needed to back him more by speaking out against perceived refereeing injustices.         
	My team needs to be defended, he said. If I say what I think I will be on the front pages and suspended. There is a club and a structure and I want them to defend my team from there.         
	Athletic Bilbao boss Joaquin Caparros labelled Mourinhos complaints a strategy.         
	I dont take any notice of it, he told reporters. Its all part of the world of football. I am sure that Sevilla will be preparing 20 points on the refereeing. (Reuters)

	Bangalore: Captain Jhulan Goswami and Gouher Sultana grabbed three wickets each as the Indian womens team thumped world champions England by 35 runs in a low-scoring first ODI of the five-match series here Friday.         
	Pacer Jhulan took for three for 16 and left-arm spinner Gouhar got her quarry for 36 runs as India defended a score of 199 for five by bundling out the visitors for 164 in 45 overs.         
	Earlier, Mithali Raj (62) and Priyanka Roy (69 ..) struck half-centuries as India put on a modest total on board after electing to bat.         
	Chasing 200 to win, England struggled on a slow-paced Chinnaswamy deck before giving India their 21st victory in 48 contests. Needing a little under four runs an over to record their 26th win over the rivals, England got off to a poor start.(PTI)

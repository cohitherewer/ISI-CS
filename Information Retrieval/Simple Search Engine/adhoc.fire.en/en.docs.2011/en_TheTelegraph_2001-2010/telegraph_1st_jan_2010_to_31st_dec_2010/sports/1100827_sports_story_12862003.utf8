The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting playing the mind game

	London: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has identified weaknesses in the England batting which he hopes his team can exploit when the Ashes series begins in just three months.         
	Englands batting has collapsed in all but one of their six innings of their ongoing series against an inexperienced Pakistan side. The latest capitulation featured seven wickets falling for just 28 runs at The Oval and allowed Pakistan to claim victory after two heavy defeats.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower have acknowledged the team needs to avoid losing wickets in clusters, and the fallibility has not been missed by Ponting, who is seeking to regain the Ashes after Australia were beaten 1-2 in 2009.         
	The series begins in Brisbane, Australia, on November 25.         
	There are probably a few little cracks starting to open up with England, particularly with the batting side of things, Ponting said on Thursday.         
	Strauss has been dismissed to left-arm pace bowling in his last five completed innings. Australia have two such bowlers with Mitchell Johnson and Doug Bollinger. Four of Englands top six are averaging less than 30, while Strauss is without a Test century in 13 months.         
	But Ponting believes England will keep faith with rookie No. 6 batsman Eoin Morgan rather than recall the established Ian Bell when he recovers from a broken foot.         
	Hes been impressive in a few games against us in ODIs, Ponting said of Morgan, who scored 130 in the first Test, against Pakistan, at Trent Bridge. I think they will play him at Bells expense. There seems to be a bit of a buzz around the country with Morgan. I think they liked his attitude more than anything else.         
	I think thats probably something theyd like for a big series.         
	Meanwhile, Kevin Pietersen has acknowledged that he is nowhere near the batsman he used to be  just three months before Englands first Test of their Ashes defence, in Australia.         
	Pietersen has not scored a Test century in 26 innings over 17 months and was out for 6 and 23 in the defeat to Pakistan, at The Oval last week.         
	He scored 80 in the second Test but was dropped three times in the innings.         
	A key figure in Englands 2005 Ashes win, Pietersen has two innings in the current match against Pakistan to turn his form around.           (AGENCIES)

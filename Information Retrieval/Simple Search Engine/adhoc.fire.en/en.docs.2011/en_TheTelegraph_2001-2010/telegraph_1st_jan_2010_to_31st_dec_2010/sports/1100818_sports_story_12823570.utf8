 - Former India striker tastes success in first match as professional coach            A STAFF REPORTER            Vijayan                           
	Calcutta: Instances of successful players transforming themselves into successful coaches are not uncommon. Former India footballer I.M. Vijayan on Tuesday made his debut as a professional coach. The occasion turned out to be a special one as his team, Southern Samity, beat Railway FC 2-1 in the first match of the 2010-11 Calcutta Football League Premier Division.         
	But then, which is the tougher job  foxing rival defenders on the ground or devising strategies from the sidelines? Vijayan, armed with his vibrant smile, said: Being a coach is tougher The tension is more and there is little you can do to help your team as you are not on the ground. I was very tense today.         
	An honest confession and with reason. Southern Samity did win the match but their performance at the Mohun Bagan ground was far from satisfactory. With quite a few big club rejects in their ranks, a better show was expected from the newly-promoted club. Of course, that might still happen if Vijayan manages to infuse his magic into the squad.         
	With few constructive moves in the first 30 minutes, it wasnt surprising that Southern Samity snatched the lead in the 33rd minute, courtesy a defensive lapse. Sheikh Sanjib was in the right place at the right time to knock the ball in, though, in the process, he injured his knee and was ruled out for the rest of the match. Railway FC restored parity in the 37th minute when Tarak Nath scored from the spot.         
	On the Maidan, it is generally only the Big Three who can talk of a fan base with the other clubs rarely enjoying any following. So, it was quite refreshing to see a small group of vociferous fans at the ground to cheer on Southern Samity. And their decibels soared further when substitute Francis Xavier netted the winner in the 90th minute. Speaking after the match, Vijayan said: Its always good to win your first match. My playing career in Calcutta started at the Mohun Bagan ground, and now my coaching career began at the same venue. Its special Some senior players are injured. I hope we will improve with time. Responding to reports that Subhas Bhowmick might be appointed Samitys technical director, Vijayan said: Thats something you will have to check with the officials.         
	Southern Samity, meanwhile, postponed the meeting scheduled for late on Tuesday where Subhas appointment was to be discussed.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Janata Dal (United) today iterated that Narendra Modi will not campaign in the Bihar elections.         
	The party hoped its ally, the BJP, would get the message, accept it and not make things difficult for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who is fighting hard to get another mandate on the planks of development and governance.        
	Dal (U) president Sharad Yadav was asked today if the Gujarat chief minister would be around in Bihar for the elections. His roundabout answer was: The same old arrangement will continue both in seat-sharing as well as the poll campaign. There is a limit to speaking on any issue and I will stop at this.         
	Asked if Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi would go to Bihar, Yadav asked: Who? Who are you talking about?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh admits sugar flop
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Singh admits sugar flop
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, March 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today admitted that the government had failed to keep sugar prices in check, promising to look for the means to prevent a recurrence of the crisis.        
	If there is a failure of economic policy, it is with regard to sugar.... We have not been able to find a practical and pragmatic way to deal with the cyclical behaviour of sugarcane production, Singh told the Rajya Sabha in his reply to the debate on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address.        
	Rising prices, with food inflation running at over 17 per cent, have been causing concern for some time now, inflicting more hardship on people than the effects of the economic slowdown.        
	Sugar prices have surged the most, reaching its peak at Rs 50 a kg, but coming off it now to Rs 43. I do admit weakness, the Prime Minister said, in recognising the cyclical nature of the crop that changes every two to three years.        
	Food and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has also been linking the soaring price to the cycle. If, however, there is a known crop cycle, the government might like to answer how it could have missed seeing it coming.        
	Singh said the government would take all practical measures to insulate the people from the rising prices of essential commodities, a promise that ministers and officials have made earlier, too, with little effect.        
	I will be the last one to deny that the behaviour of food prices in the last one year is something which does not worry us, Singh said in the Lok Sabha.        
	The worry could mount in the wake of the budget that raised petroleum product prices and rolled back the stimulus package cut in excise duty.         
	Today, truckers issued a threat to start an indefinite strike from next month in protest against the petroleum price increase.        
	Singh drew attention to the level of food stocks with the government to assert that there should be no panic on the food situation front, but the assurance might fail to allay apprehensions. Food prices have been rising despite the stocks.        
	He said rabi crop prospects were encouraging, which augured well for food price stability. Food inflation had touched a decade high of 19.7 per cent in December before dropping to about 17 per cent in recent weeks.        
	The government has released four million tonnes of wheat and rice to state governments and bulk consumers and imported sugar to ease pressure on prices.        
	The Prime Minister rejected the Opposition charge of a sugar scam, saying exports were negligible and were carried out to meet international obligations.        
	 He was optimistic about growth, expecting it to top the official estimate of 7.2 per cent and reach 8 per cent or more in the coming financial year with a return to 9 per cent the year after.         
	The government is working towards double-digit growth, Singh said, adding, this is the vision that our government is working to realise.        
	If we manage Indias social and economic infrastructure (well) and reduce the scope of corruption, there is a great opportunity... perhaps we can be the fastest-growing economy of the world.

          G.C. SHEKHAR                      Prabhakaran                          
	Chennai, April 17: Slain LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakarans mother was refused entry by immigration authorities at Chennai airport last night after she arrived here from Malaysia for treatment.         
	Parvathi, 72, arrived by a Malaysian Airlines flight from Kuala Lampur at 10.30pm.         
	Prabhakarans mother suffers from partial paralysis and was here for further treatment at a Chennai hospital.        
	Arrangements for her treatment had been made by MDMK leader Vaiko, who was waiting at the arrival terminal to receive her.         
	But before she could get down from the aircraft, immigration authorities entered the plane and told Parvathi that she and a woman accompanying her would not be allowed to enter the country and was advised to fly back to Kuala Lumpur by the same plane.         
	The elderly woman was forced to return to Malaysia though the Indian High Commission there had given her a six-month visa.         
	On coming to know about the development, Vaiko protested and attempted to enter the restricted area but was stopped by security officers.         
	How inhuman can the Indian government get? What threat does an old and ailing widow pose? Vaiko asked. He said Parvathi could not be refused entry when she had a valid visa.         
	Parvathi was allowed to leave Sri Lanka after the death of her husband Tiruvekkadam Velupillai in January. Efforts are on to send her to France where one of her cousins stays. Parvathy and her husband had lived in a Sri Lankan army camp after Prabhakarans death.        
	A senior immigration official said a valid visa was no guarantee for entering the country since the immigration officer had the discretion to refuse entry. We merely carried out orders relayed from Delhi, he said.         
	The deportation is apparently part of the Centres policy to keep a check on any activities related to the LTTE.         
	Last month the Tamil Nadu government had refused early release of Rajiv Gandhis assassin Nalini on the plea that she had completed 19 years in jail.

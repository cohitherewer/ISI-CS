          OUR BUREAU                      Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj with Pranab Mukherjee in 
  Parliament on Tuesday. (PTI)                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Pranab Mukherjee failed to break the stalemate in Parliament today, with most Opposition parties, led by the BJP and the Samajwadi Party, insisting on a joint parliamentary committee probe into the three scams of the moment: the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh society and the 2G spectrum.        
	Mukherjee, who is the leader of the Lok Sabha, had met Opposition leaders at lunch for an all-party meet. There was no meeting ground, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said.        
	Mukherjee, who iterated that the government was prepared for a discussion on all three issues, said: No solution has been found because they want a JPC.         
	He told the Opposition leaders he would convey the sense of the meeting to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow and get back to them.         
	Parliament is closed tomorrow for Id.        
	Before the lunch, Mukherjee separately met BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley for 20 minutes. We made it clear we had no intention of breaking Opposition unity, a BJP source said. The Left and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) sounded a bit more open to an alternative probe mechanism.        
	We told the government that if it didnt want a JPC, what is the alternative? said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, adding that the Left was not in favour of continuous disruption of Parliament. But, in the same breath, he added that since axed telecom minister A. Raja had claimed he had done everything with the Prime Ministers knowledge, a JPC inquiry alone would clear Manmohan Singhs role.        
	After the Supreme Court today questioned the Prime Ministers silence and inaction on a request for sanction to prosecute Raja, the CPM decided to go all out. Now it has become imperative on the part of the Prime Ministers Office to declare who is guilty and who is not, Yechury said.        
	The BJD has asked for a judicial probe. The government argued that according to convention, a JPC could look into one issue at a time. If the Opposition wanted a probe into three scams, three committees would have to be set up.        
	During todays meeting, Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Deve Gowda asked for an inquiry into illegal mining in Karnataka.        
	Somebody from another state might raise a similar issue. Are they suggesting the JPC should go into hundreds of irregularities? a government source asked. The government also argued that while the JPC was functioning, the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate that are investigating the three scams might feel hampered.        
	The third point the government made was that Parliaments Public Accounts Committee, headed by the BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi, would right away vet the CAG report on the 2G spectrum scam that was tabled in Parliament.         
	Congress sources asked if the BJPs insistence on a JPC amounted to a no-confidence vote in Joshi. The JPC questions policy decisions. It goes into many non-accounting issues involved in a scam, into the communiqus and advisories issued by the ministries, what the Prime Ministers Office said and so on, Swaraj retorted.

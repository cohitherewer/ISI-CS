	Dubai, March 29 (PTI): Seventeen Indians have been sentenced to death by a Sharjah court for killing a Pakistani man and injuring three others in an attack last year.        
	Judge Yousuf Al Hamadi sentenced the 17 men to death after all evidence, including DNA tests, showed they had stabbed the Pakistani to death.        
	The victim had been stabbed repeatedly on various parts of his body and he had also suffered brain damage.        
	The attack in January last year followed a fight over the control of an illegal liquor business in Sharjahs Al Sajaa area, the paper said.        
	The police claimed that the suspects had also tried to kill three Pakistani accomplices of the victim, but they escaped.         
	The convicted men are all aged between 17 and 30 years.

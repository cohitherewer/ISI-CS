          SUBHASHISH MOHANTY                               
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 28: Maoists last night blew up an ambulance in Orissa killing five people, among them a pregnant woman and a three-year-old girl, apparently mistaking the vehicle for the white jeep of a police officer.        
	Kandhamal deputy superintendent of police Ramesh Maharana, who seems to have been the target of the attack, escaped because he changed his travel plan at the last minute fearing a rebel strike, sources said.         
	He was camping at Brahmanigaon, also in Kandhamal district, probing an alleged Maoist murder of a contractor on November 25. He was supposed to return to Phulbani, the district headquarters of Kandhamal, last night.         
	The five people in the ambulance, called Janani Express, became the landmines target at 11.30 last night. Siman Mallick, the 28-year-old driver of the ambulance, died. So did Guna Digal, 27, Inshi Digal, a 22-year-old pregnant woman, and three-year-old Subhashree, all from the same family in Brahmanigaon where the vehicle was headed. With them was Susahanti Pradhan, an accredited social health activist. She was killed too.        
	When the ambulance left Brahmanigaon for Berhampur town, 120km away, earlier in the day, another pregnant woman was in it. Banita, Inshis friend, had a narrow escape because the MKCG College and Hospital doctors in Berhampur told her to get admitted as she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy.         
	They (the Maoists) blew up the ambulance going from Berhampur to Brahmanigaon. We have found all the bodies and sent them for post-mortem. A massive combing operation has been launched in the area, said Kandhamal superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.         
	The district police chief refused to comment on whether the real target of the rebels was a police officer. We are inquiring into the incident. Everything will come out during the inquiry, he said.         
	Sources said the Maoists may have had the information about deputy superintendent Maharanas plan to return to Phulbani. The officer was supposed to travel in a white jeep.         
	As the ambulance crossed a culvert near Berhampur town, the rebels, sitting atop a hill 300 metres away, triggered the blast, the sources said.         
	Eyewitnesses said the explosion was so powerful that the Janani Express was tossed 15 metres into the air and landed 100 metres away from the culvert.         
	Maharana said he was lucky to have escaped. One has to be extremely careful in the Maoist-infested belt, he said.        
	Two years ago, a Maoist blast in Belpahari in Bengals rebel-infested West Midnapore killed a doctor and a nurse who were travelling in a red-cross bearing vehicle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modern or museum piece row 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modern or museum piece row 
          CITHARA PAUL                      Members of the Jarawa tribe                          
	New Delhi, July 1: The Andamans lone MP has stirred controversy by demanding that Jarawa children be brought to mainstream schools and introduced to TV and cars instead of being treated as museum pieces.        
	Bishnu Pada Ray has written to the Union tribal ministry to drop its isolationist policy and wean Jarawa children away from the tribe to drastically mainstream them. Else, the tribe, whose population is now around 300, will become extinct, he says.        
	What right do we have to say the Jarawas should be kept as museum pieces? Who are we to say they should not be educated because they will lose their indigenous character? Like each one of us, they too have the right to the fruits of modernity, Ray told The Telegraph.        
	Ray wants Jarawa children aged 6-12 to be kept in a normal school atmosphere, where they will be trained in personal hygiene, use of clothes and basic reading and writing skills and exposed to mainstream eating habits.        
	He has cited the examples of the Birhore and Sabar tribals of Jharkhand, whose children have been modernised.        
	Over time, the trainers were able to infiltrate into the main pockets of tribes and inculcate skills of personal hygiene, wearing of clothes partaking of cooked food and basic agricultural and horticultural activities. The final result was training the entire population into a village identical with any other village of Scheduled Tribe population, his letter says.        
	It adds that the Jarawas numbers have been dwindling every year because they use polluted water and follow unhygienic practices.        
	Rays demand has invited criticism from tribal activists, who say similar schemes in the US, Canada and Australia have proved disastrous. Thousands of indigenous people across the globe had been left traumatised by this modernisation process. Who are we to decide what modernity is? This proposal will spell doom for the Jarawas, said activist Gourav Adivesh.        
	International tribal activists too have hit out at Rays suggestions. If the government takes their children away and puts them in a school, they will lose their culture. If they are made to live in a town, it would be a crime, said a Yanomami leader from Brazil, Davi Kopenawa Yanomami.        
	These scandalous proposals are contemptuous both of indigenous peoples rights and the UNs standards for their protection. Attempts to force the Jarawas to abandon their way of life will simply destroy them, said Survival Internationals director, Stephen Corry.

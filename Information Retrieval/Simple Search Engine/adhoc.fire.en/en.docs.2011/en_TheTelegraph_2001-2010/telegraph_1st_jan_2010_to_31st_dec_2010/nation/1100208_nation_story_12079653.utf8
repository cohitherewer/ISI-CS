          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Centre plans to institute scholarships and higher education courses for children of leprosy victims for the first time, stung by criticism from a Parliament panel that slammed the government for ignoring their plight.        
	The human resource development ministry will write to the UGC to start the scholarships, government officials told The Telegraph.        
	The ministry will also write to state governments to institute the scholarships and request them to encourage their institutions to start specialised courses for the children, sources said.        
	The Parliament committee, studying a petition by activists working with leprosy victims, had said in its report that it was disappointed to note that higher education facilities for children of leprosy-affected persons were almost non-existent.        
	The House panel asked the HRD ministry to focus on settlements of lepers. The planned courses and scholarships will focus on children in these ghettos, government sources said.        
	The panel argued that these children needed special assistance because their parents, often shunned by society, could not provide educational opportunities.        
	 We are asking the UGC and state governments to adhere to the Parliament panels recommendations of scholarships and specialised courses, and at the earliest, a ministry source said.        
	The courses will also include vocational training aimed at assisting the students in finding jobs.        
	India has reduced the incidence of leprosy to a quarter of its prevalence in 1983-84  from 67 to 17 in every 10,000 citizens.        
	In absolute numbers too, India has seen a reduction in leprosy victims. The country had 4,82,000 cases of leprosy in 1983-84. The last survey, in 2007-08, recorded 1,37,685 detected cases.        
	But victims of the disease largely face stigma and discrimination and India continues to have over 700 leper colonies.         
	UGC sources said they would need to work out details of the scholarship programme on the distribution of the leper colonies.

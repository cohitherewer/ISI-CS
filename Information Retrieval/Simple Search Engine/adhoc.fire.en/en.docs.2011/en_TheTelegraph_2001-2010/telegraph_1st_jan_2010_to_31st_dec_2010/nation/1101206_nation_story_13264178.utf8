          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Dec. 5: Ashok Chavan, who had to quit as Maharashtra chief minister because of the Adarsh housing scam, today said some leaders in his own party implicated him in the scandal in a bid to end his political career.         
	Speaking for the first time after stepping down, Chavan, who attended the winter session of the state legislature in Nagpur last week, told supporters in his hometown, Nanded: I am innocent. I have not done anything wrong in the Adarsh case. Some of my party leaders hatched a conspiracy using the Adarsh society issue and tried to finish my political career. But people will not spare those who hatched the sinister conspiracy.         
	He said that he had submitted his resignation before US President Barack Obamas visit on November 6. He was summoned to Delhi ahead of Obamas visit by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi but his resignation was accepted on November 9 after Obama left.         
	Chavans in-laws have been allotted flats in the Adarsh building in Colaba, which was built flouting coastal norms. Also, the building was meant to house Kargil war widows.

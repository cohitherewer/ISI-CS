	Bhubaneswar, March 4: Paying commercial tax in Orissa is now just a click away. The commercial taxes department today joined hands with the State Bank of India to launch e-payment services of commercial taxes.         
	The facility will enable traders to pay their sales tax, VAT, CST, professional tax, entry tax and entertainment tax online. The tax would be deposited in the state exchequer on the next working day.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik launched the facility here today. This is a precursor to a host of e-services to be launched shortly, said the chief minister.        
	The customer will not have to fill paper challans nor will he require cheques or drafts for payments. The facility will enable all traders across the state to pay taxes either through their own accounts or at any branch in the state and get an e-receipt instantly.         
	Customers with access to the State Bank of India connect facility can pay taxes by logging on and paying through their accounts. Those who do not have the facility or are non-customers will have to visit the nearest branch, where they will be connected to the e-tax facility.         
	The e-payment is set to be a big hit just like the e-tenders we had introduced earlier. Apprehensions that contractors of the state might not migrate to the new procedures proved wrong. It has become a huge success and our contractors are tech savvy now, said state finance minister Praffula Ghadei. The facility will be available 24x7, said officials.

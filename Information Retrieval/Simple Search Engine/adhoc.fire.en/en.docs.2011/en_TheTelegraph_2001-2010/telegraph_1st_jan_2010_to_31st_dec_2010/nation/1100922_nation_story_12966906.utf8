	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Jamia Millia Islamia executive council had rooted for minority status for the university as far back as 1997, the apex minority education arbitrator was informed today.        
	Jamia registrar S.M. Sajid filed an affidavit before the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) saying the executive council had passed such a resolution saying it would help keep the institutions historical character intact.        
	If Jamia is granted minority status, it will help reserve up to 50 per cent seats for Muslims students. At present, the university has a 22.5 per cent quota for SC/ST students and 25 per cent quota for students passing out from its own intermediate schools. The NCMEI had on May 4 asked us to place on record relevant documents on the issue of minority status to Jamia. The registrar has filed the relevant documents in an affidavit, M. Atyab Siddiqui, the lawyer representing Jamia, said.         
	The resolution, passed by the universitys highest decision-making body, said Jamia embodies the liberal and secular spirit of the Constitution. At the same time, this institution reflects the educational and intellectual aspirations of Indian Muslims.        
	For this reason, it is important that the Jamia Millia Islamia be declared as a minority institution so that its historical character is intact.        
	The resolution further said the university would promote and provide for religious and secular education of Indians, particularly Muslims, in consonance with the needs of national life.        
	The matter of minority status has been pending since the Jamia Teachers Association (JTA) and Old Boys Association moved the NCMEI, a quasi-judicial body, in 2006. Tarique Siddiqui, the JTA lawyer, said the resolution was a piece of evidence in favour of minority status.        
	In a related development, educationist Feroz Bakht, an intervener opposing minority status for Jamia, today withdrew from the case without citing any reason.        
	We have asked the Jamia authorities to file a comprehensive affidavit giving details on the origin and establishment of the university, Siddiqui said.        
	Jamia was founded in 1920 in response to Mahatma Gandhis call for boycott of British-sponsored educational institutions. It became a central university through the Jamia Millia Islamia Act, 1988.        
	The minority status issue has created divisions within the UPA government. Minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed and human resource minister Kapil Sibal have been locked in a stand-off over it.

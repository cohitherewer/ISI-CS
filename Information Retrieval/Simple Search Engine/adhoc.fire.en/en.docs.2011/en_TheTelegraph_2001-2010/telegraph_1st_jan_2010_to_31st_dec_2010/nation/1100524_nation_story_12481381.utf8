The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt rule that kept US pilots at bay 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt rule that kept US pilots at bay 
          K.P. NAYAR                           Commander of the plane Captain Z Glusica, who died in the crash. (PTI)                                  
	Washington, May 23: Lobbied heavily by airlines in the US to stem the flow of their pilots to India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ruled in 2007 that Americans holding pilots licences cannot be employed by airlines in India beyond the age of 60.        
	The discriminatory decision to help an American industry with huge lobbying power worldwide was made even as DGCA rules allowed pilots of every other nationality, including Indians, to fly until they were 65 years old.        
	The decision prompted nearly 50 American pilots, whose applications to fly with Indian carriers were pending with Indian authorities, to change their plans for a career shift to India, according to a source in the DGCA who is familiar with the way the national regulator caved into US corporate interests.        
	While the questionable decision, which had been influenced by civil aviation minister Praful Patel, may have had no bearing on the weekends crash of an Air India Express flight, it forced airlines in India, both private and state-owned, to turn in a big way to pilots from non-English-speaking countries to overcome a shortage.        
	Difficulties in following instructions in English from air controllers and an inability to cope with heavy air traffic during landings and takeoffs by such pilots have been among the staple of complaints about the safety of aviation in India, following a recent boom in this industry.        
	The irony of Indias decision to ban American pilots who are over 60 was that it was made one month after the US Congress actually raised their retirement age to 65 to cope with a shortage of pilots in airlines in America.         
	The change merely required flight captains in the US who are over 40 to pass stipulated medical check ups, including cardiac examinations every six months instead of annually for younger pilots.        
	In addition to the 50-odd American pilots who withdrew their applications with the Indian regulator to fly with airlines in the country in 2007, several others left Indian carriers as a dead end after the DGCA changed its rules precipitously, according to sources in the airline industry.        
	For American pilots, India is a new pasture offering lucrative opportunities for deserting their ailing domestic airline industry.        
	In addition to uncertainties facing the industry, airline managements here have crushed trade unions in recent years with their lobbying power and financial muscle, driving down the salaries of pilots to a point where they sometimes have to take up second jobs to keep the fire in their kitchens burning.        
	Typically, a pilot in a regional airline in the US could be earning an unbelievably low remuneration of only $1,500 a month. Even in a major carrier, a pilot in his first year of work could be earning only around $1,800 per month, according to a recent study of salaries by an organisation of pilots here.        
	A captain at the top of the ladder flying international routes could earn about $15,000 a month, but that is a world away from the dream incomes of $300,000 a year which senior pilots used to earn from TWA and PanAm in the heyday of American aviation.        
	In their greed to maximise profits and boost share values, airline companies here have increasingly set up regional outfits to which they contract their domestic flights so that pilots have to be paid only abysmally low scales in force in regional airlines.        
	For many American pilots, therefore, a contract in Indias expanding aviation sector is like a dream job. Which is why US airlines made sure that it forced the civil aviation ministry and the DGCA to give in to their interests over those of Indian carriers with a ban.        
	Last week, a forum here organised by the National Transportation Safety Board was told that college students are no longer attracted to careers in flying because of the dim economic prospects these offered.        
	A lobbyist here who claimed to have worked on the effort in New Delhi to secure the ban said anonymously that it was successful because it made US pilots weary of moving to India even in the light of subsequent changes.         
	Pilots are a tight-knit community and reluctant to leave unless they have to. He said the DGCA decision had the effect of sending a message that Indian aviation is unreliable as an employer because of the power of the state. He also claimed that similar efforts to stem the flow of American pilots to Dubai and Singapore were unsuccessful where India eagerly caved in.

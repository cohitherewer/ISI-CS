The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kashmir tense but rulers relax by lake
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kashmir tense but rulers relax by lake

	Srinagar, June 21: Kashmir is burning, but its rulers are on song.        
	On the banks of the Dal Lake, if you want to know the exact location.        
	A fresh wave of protests has rocked Kashmir for the past 10 days, leaving three youths dead and dozens injured in firing by security forces, but the states legislators have been busy entertaining fellow lawmakers from other parts of the country at musical evenings.        
	There were two cultural shows on Saturday and Sunday evening. One more show is being organised this evening. Artistes from Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are entertaining the guests with folk songs and dance items on the bank of the Dal Lake, an official said.        
	The guests are hundreds of parliamentarians and other lawmakers who have come to take part in the 75th All India Presiding Officers Conference headed by Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar.        
	They are really enjoying it, the official added.        
	If the sarcasm finds its mark through the sound of music, Kashmirs rulers can point to Tony Hayward.        
	The embattled BP chief executive, whose company is in the dock for the worst offshore oil spill in US history, spent Saturday off the coast of England watching his yacht compete in one of the worlds largest races.        
	The nature and scale of the two situations  the violence in Kashmir and the oil spill off the Gulf of Mexico  are different, but the musical evenings and Haywards presence at the race have both portrayed people in powerful positions as insensitive.        
	Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, though, hasnt joined the lakeside entertainment. He returned from a weeklong holiday in Ladakh last Tuesday, left for Gulmarg on Saturday, came back to Srinagar yesterday, met legislators for a couple of hours, flew back to Gulmarg by evening and returned today.        
	After coming back from Ladakh, his next stop was Delhi where he went to meet Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. On Saturday, he left for Gulmarg to spend the weekend with his family, said an official.        
	Yesterday, however, Omar did express his sorrow over the violence raging in Kashmir since a teenager, Tufail Ahmad Matoo, died in police firing on June 11. It was the first time he had voiced his regret over the violent protests that have shut down the city.        
	Sources said the authorities decided to go ahead with the musical evenings because the shows were already scheduled and the government did not find it prudent to call them off. There are dignitaries from every state of the country, including Speakers, deputy speakers, chairpersons and deputy chairpersons from state legislatures who are taking part in the conference, the official said.        
	Another official said ministers and legislators from different parties were attending these evening shows. The guests at yesterdays show included agriculture minister Ghulam Hassan Mir, (National Conference legislator and Omar Abdullahs uncle) Mustafa Kamal and (Peoples Democratic Party legislator) Sartaj Madni and Speaker Akbar Lone.        
	Srinagar, however, was virtually under siege today, with thousands of security personnel manning the streets during an undeclared curfew.        
	The only place bubbling with life is the area around the Dal Lake.

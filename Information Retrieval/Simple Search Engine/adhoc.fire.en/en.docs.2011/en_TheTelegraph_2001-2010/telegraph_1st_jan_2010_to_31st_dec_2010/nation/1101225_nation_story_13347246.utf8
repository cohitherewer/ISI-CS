          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: Seminars in Delhi, little to show at home.        
	The ruling comrades in Bengal are trying to win back Muslim support by organising seminars in the capital, but the CPM-led regime hasnt shown the same enthusiasm in implementing welfare schemes for minorities in the state.         
	Bengal has been listed as one of the worst performers in executing poverty alleviation schemes for the minorities under the Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgaar Yojana. According to data being collated by the central ministry for housing and urban poverty alleviation, the state has failed to deliver both in skill training and developing entrepreneurship among Muslim youths.         
	The figures have emerged barely months before next years Assembly polls and at a time the states Left government has been trying desperately to win back Muslim support after a series of electoral reverses.        
	The recent seminars in Delhi  one for the intelligentsia and the other for migrant workers  were part of these efforts and were aimed at spreading the message that no one has cared for the minorities like the Left.        
	According to the data collected, Bengal, whose 27 per cent minority population is one of the highest in the country, has given assistance to only 11 persons from the minority community to set up micro enterprises against a target of 153.        
	The state has the lowest ranking in this category, while Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Orissa have exceeded the targets they had been set. The best performer has been Gujarat.        
	In skill training, Bengal has been able to help only 40 persons against a target of 1,224, while neighbour Bihar has far exceeded its target.         
	The performance of Bengal has been consistently bad ever since the Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgaar Yojana was conceived. The states performance is bad not just in the case of implementing minority schemes but in all aspects of the job scheme, said an official with the central ministry.         
	The job scheme, launched in 2009, includes the Urban Self Employment Programme, Urban Women Self-help Programme, Skill Training for Employment Promotion amongst Urban Poor, Urban Wage Employment Programme and the Urban Community Development Network.         
	Since last year, the central government has been earmarking a special fund for minority-dominated areas.         
	The fund varies from state to state depending on minority concentration. Both the skill-training and entrepreneurship targets depend on this component.

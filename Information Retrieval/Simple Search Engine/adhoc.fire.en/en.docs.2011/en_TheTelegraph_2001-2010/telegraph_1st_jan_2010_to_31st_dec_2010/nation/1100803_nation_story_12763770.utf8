          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 2: The CBI today sought the custody of Amit Shah for 10 days in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case. The court will decide on the appeal on Wednesday.        
	Shah, sent to judicial custody till August 7 after his arrest on July 25, will remain behind bars at least till August 11 because the hearing on his bail petition has been adjourned till then.        
	The former Gujarat minister of state for home, a confidant of chief minister Narendra Modi, is charged with ordering Sohrabuddin Sheikhs murder by police and is lodged in Sabarmati jail along with five IPS officers and 15 other accused in the case.        
	Seeking Shahs custody, CBI counsel K.T.S. Tulsi argued that the former minister had not co-operated during his interrogation. Shahs counsel Ram Jethmalani opposed the plea arguing the CBI had not utilised the time allowed by the court to interrogate him in judicial custody. It had not sought his custody immediately after arrest because it did not have proof against him, Jethmalani said.        
	But Tulsi pointed out that the law allowed the CBI to seek custody within 15 days of arrest.         
	Since Shah is one of the main accused and the charges against him  murder, abduction, extortion and conspiracy  are serious, the agency requires his custody, he said.         
	Special CBI court judge A.Y. Dave reserved his order, saying he would announce on August 4 whether to hand him over to the CBI for further interrogation.        
	Tulsi made it clear that the CBI had not sought a transfer of the case out of Gujarat in its status report to the Supreme Court. If the trial could be held in a conducive atmosphere, the CBI had no problem with it being conducted in the state, he said.        
	Modi had lashed out at the CBI, accusing it of being biased and of insulting Gujarat, on the basis of media reports that said the agency wanted the case tried outside the state.        
	Tulsi, who had earlier appeared in the apex court on behalf of Gujarat in the same case, said the CBI suspected that Shah possessed documents that could provide vital evidence and needed to be recovered.        
	The CBI has found out that there was a syndicate of politicians, criminals and policemen for running an extortion racket, Tulsi said, adding there were four witnesses on the basis of which we are making these statements. He mentioned tapes of conversations recorded between Shah and N.K. Amin, a police officer who is in custody and wants to turn approver.         
	Sohrabuddin, a small-time criminal who was allegedly extorting money from marble traders in Rajasthan, was gunned down by Gujarat policemen in November 2005. The police claimed he was a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant on a mission to assassinate Modi.        
	Two years later, in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the Gujarat government admitted that Sohrabuddin was killed in a fake encounter, carried out by the Anti-Terrorism Squad for name and promotion.

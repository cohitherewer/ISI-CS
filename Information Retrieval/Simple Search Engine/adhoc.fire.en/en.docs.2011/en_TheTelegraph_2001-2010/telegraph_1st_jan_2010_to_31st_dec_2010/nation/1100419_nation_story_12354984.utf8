The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Efforts to resolve Kochi quarrel
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Efforts to resolve Kochi quarrel
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                          Lalit Modi                                  
	April 18: The new chairman of the Kochi franchise held talks with IPL and Indian cricket board officials, reports from Dubai said today, as efforts to resolve the row over the teams ownership intensified.        
	The reports said the emirate-based Harshad Mehta met IPL commissioner Lalit Modi and also had a courtesy meeting with senior BCCI official I.S. Bindra in Dubai today.        
	Bindra, however, told The Telegraph: There was no courtesy meeting. I was in the hotel lobby going to the elevator from the gym when a gentleman walked up to me and introduced himself as Harshad Mehta from the Kochi consortium. We said hello to each other and that was it.        
	No cricket official or anyone from Rendezvous, the company that bid for the Kochi franchise as part of a consortium, was willing to comment on the reported meetings that came amid a power struggle between the Gujarat lobby, which holds majority stake, and the rest.        
	The Kochi issue has been simmering since Modi, now in Dubai to attend an International Cricket Council meeting, revealed the franchises ownership structure.        
	Asked to comment on reports that BCCI president Shashank Manohar was unhappy with him, Modi told PTI: I have no difference with Shashank Manohar and I have been asked to attend the ICC meeting (on his behalf).        
	ICC vice-president Sharad Pawar and principal adviser Bindra will also attend the meeting.        
	BCCI tax summons        
	The income-tax department has issued summons to the BCCI seeking details of the eight original IPL franchises.        
	Day before yesterday they had asked for details only about the two new franchises  their shareholding patterns, addresses, player auction and bidding process, etc. Now they want us to furnish all the details about the eight other franchises too, BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said.        
	Shetty said Modi or CEO Sundar Raman would represent the board during the summons on April 23.        
	Apparently income-tax authorities want to investigate the IPL structure since the leagues inception in 2008. IT exemptions are given to promotion of cricket activities only but expenses incurred in engaging cheerleaders and hosting after-match parties may not come under this ambit, sources said.        
	Officials said the Enforcement Directorate planned to seek documents collected by tax sleuths from Modis office and other IPL premises. They said the ED was likely to probe deals involving foreign investors based in tax havens.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Electoral college crater haunts BJP
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Electoral college crater haunts BJP
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Gadkari                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: When Nitin Gadkari is formally elected BJP president next month, the electoral college that will cast its votes will be bereft of representatives of the countrys major states that include those where his party has big political stakes.         
	BJP insiders admitted that the rite of passage that would place Gadkari, 52, in his seat for three years had been reduced to a farce. They wondered what the ongoing organisational elections were about: whether they were meant to strengthen Gadkaris hands or impair his working.         
	Normally, such elections are supposed to be a kind of spring-cleaning to remove the dirt and moths that have warped the system and then burnish the apparatus. It looks like those in charge have covered their faces with masks so that they cant see the rot that has settled in, a BJP official said.         
	The organisational polls are held every three years and culminate in the election of a president by an electoral college that includes members of the national council and the state councils.         
	The election is preceded by another procedure that requires any 20 members of the electoral college of a state to jointly propose the name of a person who has been an active member (of the council) for four terms and a member for 15 years. But the joint proposal should come from not less than five states where elections to the national council have been completed.         
	On paper, as many as 12 states have already held the elections and so this provision will be easily implemented. They include Uttarakhand, Orissa, Nagaland, Jammu and Kashmir, Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Manipur, Dadra-Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Sikkim. But though the BJP has a base in states and Union territories like Uttarakhand, Goa, Dadra-Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Orissa they are not necessarily significant on the national political map.         
	States like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat, where organisational elections have not taken place, are electorally weighty in themselves, particularly for the BJP.         
	So Gadkari, who is from Maharashtra, will not have a single representative endorsing his candidacy from his home state. Though this is not a procedural impediment, it means he will inherit a faction-ridden organisation to which he contributed considerably.         
	While alibis were invoked to explain why no elections were held, a source conceded that infighting and coterie politics were the main culprits.         
	The elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh were ostensibly deferred because of the Assembly and the civic polls. Rajasthan, where Vasundhra Raje is permanently rebelling, is a Pandoras box the BJP will rather not open at this moment when it wants to fight the Congress in the panchayat elections.         
	In Gujarat, where Narendra Modi is a law unto himself, it seems nobody dared ask him for a schedule. In Uttar Pradesh, the cracks between the various groups headed by Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Mishra, Lalji Tandon and others were visible even before the exercise was flagged. Let sleeping dogs lie, our leaders feel, a source said.         
	Organisational elections in Bihar too is likely to be put off because of the state polls in October and the fear that tinkering with the organisation may imperil the BJPs prospects.         
	Maintaining the present order will ensure the new president is completely dependent on the entrenched interests for everything, he will be unable to form an independent assessment, a party official said.

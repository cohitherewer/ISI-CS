The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Honour killing notice to Bengal 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Honour killing notice to Bengal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 21: The Supreme Court today asked the Centre and seven states, including Bengal, to explain what steps they had taken to check honour killings.        
	The notices came on a day two young couples in Delhi and Haryana were found dead, allegedly killed by their disapproving families.        
	NGO Shakti Vahini had told the apex court that there was a spurt in honour killings in several states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal. Its petition alleged that neither the Centre nor the state governments were doing anything to check the practice because of vote- bank politics.        
	Bengal director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, however, told The Telegraph: Honour killings have never really been a problem in Bengal. There may have been an instance or two in the past, but nothing in the recent past. Offhand, I cannot recollect any major instance of honour killing in this state.        
	The apex court has not set a deadline for the governments to reply. Shakti Vahini has requested the court to order the Centre and the states to form a special cell in each district that young couples can approach if they are threatened.        
	Delhi police today reported a suspected honour killing after a 26-year-old man, Kuldeep, was found dead in his car and his wife Monica inside their flat. Kuldeeps uncle has alleged that Monicas family was opposed to the marriage because of caste differences, officers said.        
	In Haryana, a couple in their 20s were found dead in the womans home in Bhiwani district. The bodies bore injury marks, indicating the victims were beaten mercilessly.        
	The police have arrested six members of the womans family, including her parents, on the charge of murder. The family apparently disapprov- ed of the relationship because the man was from a different caste.        
	(Honour killings) include torture, mutilation, rape, forced marriage, imprisonment within the home and even murder. These crimes are intended to protect the family honour by preventing and punishing women for allegedly violating community norms of behaviour, particularly sexual behaviour, the NGOs petition says.        
	Four days ago, a 19-year-old girl and her boyfriend were tortured for hours before being killed by electrocution in Delhi. The girls father and uncle have been arrested and have allegedly confessed they killed the couple because the boy, a taxi driver, was not a suitable match for the girl.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP senses manipulating hand
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP senses manipulating hand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ravi Shankar Prasad                          
	New Delhi, July 24: Hours after Gujarat junior home minister Amit Shah put in his papers, his boss Narendra Modi and the BJP threw their weight behind him and signalled they would take on the Congress for manipulating the CBI to fix rivals.        
	Modi indicated the battle theme would be fought along a line he had patented in the 2007 Gujarat elections: the Delhi Sultanates selective targeting of Gujarat.         
	The Gujarat chief minister also slammed the Congress for glorifying a criminal called Sohrabuddin. The comment was a leaf out of his Assembly poll campaign where he had interpreted Sonia Gandhis famous maut ka saudagar (merchant of death) phrase as a condemnation of his commitment to rid Gujarat of anti-national and anti-social elements like Sohrabuddin.        
	That Sohrabuddin was a Muslim was grist for the BJPs us-versus-them campaign.        
	The party stressed that as a citizen, Shah had the right to seek legal recourse and the BJP would ensure he got the best legal advice, spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.        
	Modi spoke of Congress-non-Congress acrimony at the National Development Council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today, though he did not name any individual or institution.        
	A media release by the Gujarat government condemned the systematic misuse of power by the UPA to weaken non-Congress states and warned that the attitude would put the Centre-state relationship on a warpath.         
	Modi accused the Centre of pursuing a pick-and-choose policy while using the CBI. Our friends in the Congress keep on citing the Supreme Court. It is the same court that ordered the killing of Afzal Guru. But besides all this, the case is still pending. Today, the CBI has thousands of pending cases. But why is Gujarat given priority? There is politics behind it.         
	Too little, too late        
	The Congress continued its criticism of the BJP on Saturday despite Amit Shahs resignation. Its good that better sense has prevailed but its too little too late, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said. To resign after resisting for all these weeks is not graceful, it is not voluntary.

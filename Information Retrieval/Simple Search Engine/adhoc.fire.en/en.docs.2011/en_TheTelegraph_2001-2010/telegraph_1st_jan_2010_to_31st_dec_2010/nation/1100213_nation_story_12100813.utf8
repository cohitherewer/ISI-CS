          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Feb. 12: Thousands of Kashmiri civilians stranded across the Line of Control can now look forward to a homecoming, nearly two decades after they had crossed to the other side.         
	The Jammu and Kashmir government today said its amnesty and rehabilitation policy for militants stranded across the LoC would be available to thousands of civilians too, most of whom had gone to the other side at the peak of militancy during the early 90s.         
	There are certain border areas where people in large numbers have migrated after militancy began here. Two-thirds of the population of Kerans had migrated to the other side of the LoC. We want to rehabilitate them akin to the migrant Kashmiri Pandits, said Nasir Aslam Wani, minister of state for housing and urban development in the Omar Abdullah government.         
	Most of these people belong to the states border districts who crossed the LoC at the peak of militancy to avoid alleged harassment by security forces. The administration of occupied Kashmir has set up several colonies for them.         
	Now the Jammu and Kashmir government says these civilians too need to be brought back and rehabilitated, the way they are rehabilitating the Kashmiri Pandits.

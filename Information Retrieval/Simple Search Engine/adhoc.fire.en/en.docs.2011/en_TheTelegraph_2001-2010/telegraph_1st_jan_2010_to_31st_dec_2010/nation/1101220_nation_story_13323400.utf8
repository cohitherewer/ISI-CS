                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Liz and Arun kin move to smother divorce buzz
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Liz Hurley                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: The latest from Elizabeth Hurley and people close to Arun Nayar is that the couple are not splitting yet.        
	The Nayar clan is unwilling to go on record but a close relative said Arun had told siblings Nikhil and Samantha that Liz and he would take a mature call on divorce after giving the pros and cons of a break-up due thought.        
	For starters, instead of heading Down Under with Shane Warne, Liz will head to the Caribbean with son Damian. Liz has told Arun she will spend some me time with Damian this Christmas to clear her head before she decides on the marriage, the relative said.        
	Hurley had sent out an enigmatic tweet yesterday: Er... please take any mentions of me in the latest thrilling instalment of the Jerry Springer-esque saga with a LARGE pinch of salt.        
	The Jerry Springer Show is an American TV programme where dysfunctional families talk about their extramarital affairs, incest, sexual fetishes and the like.        
	The Nayar family source said that a few months into the marriage, cracks had begun appearing over the issue of Liz bearing a child. Arun is 46. He loves (stepson) Damian but wants one of his own too. Liz is not ready.        
	Liz too seems keen to soften her public blow to Aruns ego. She had earlier tweeted her marriage had been over quite sometime before her fling with Warne. On Friday, though, she tweeted that divorce would not be immediate and that Australia was not the way she wanted to go.        
	The tweet, a Mumbai high-society source close to Nayar said, came after Liz learnt from Australian media reports how Warne was sending dirty text messages to a married woman in Melbourne while he was seeing Liz.        
	The scandal involves Adele Angeleri, who runs a designer leather shop opposite the office of Warnes charity. Angeleri had told her lawyer husband Denis about it and he spoke to the media.        
	Nayars friend said: Liz trusts ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant a lot, and he warned her against Warne. Arun is a wonderful dad to Damian and she knows it. Through the difficult times in their marriage, Arun has never been mean. (Warne) is an incorrigible playboy. She certainly needs to think through whether she has a future with Warne.

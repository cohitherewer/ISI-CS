          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Patna, July 22: The Nitish Kumar government today argued in Patna High Court against a CBI probe into the Rs 11,412.54-crore treasury scam while the Opposition tried to step up heat with a resignation drama and a visit to the Raj Bhavan.        
	The government demanded the high court stay its order handing the case over to the CBI since the Assemblys public accounts committee was already investigating the matter.        
	All the 12 MLAs of the Opposition Lok Janshakti Party, headed by Ram Vilas Paswan, resigned to press their demand that chief minister Nitish and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi step down from office. They, however, handed their letters of resignation to their state party chief, Pashupatinath Paras, not Speaker Udainarayan Choudhary.        
	A Lok Janshakti-Rashtriya Janata Dal team met governor Devanand Kunwar to apprise him of the Speakers brazen act of suspending 67 Opposition MLAs yesterday for protesting against the scam in the House.        
	An unidentified Opposition member had flung a slipper at the Chair during a free-for-all in the Assembly, and another was filmed smashing flower pots.        
	On the streets today, over 500 RJD cadres protested against the suspension of the MLAs and were caned by police when they attacked government vehicles and threw stones at the force.        
	In the high court, arguing before the two-judge bench that had ordered the CBI probe, government counsel Nageshwar Rao said: The issue involves the jurisdiction of the judiciary and the legislature.        
	He added: The public accounts committee (PAC) is a legislature body empowered under the Constitution to examine the Comptroller and Auditor Generals report. And thats what the PAC is already doing. Ordering a CBI probe in such a situation amounts to interference in the business of the legislature.        
	Rao said Bihar was not the only state to have witnessed irregularities over detailed contingency (DC) bills and advance contingency (AC) bills, which relate to drawals from treasuries and subsequent explanations of the details of expenditure.        
	He told the court the state government had already procured DC bills relating to the expenditure of Rs 4,000 crore and was working round the clock to prepare the DC bills for the rest of the amount. Hearing resumes tomorrow.        
	Nitish today criticised Opposition members for transgressing the limit while disrupting proceedings in the two Houses of the state legislature on Tuesday and Wednesday. Transgression of constitutional limits by anybody during a protest is highly condemnable, he said.

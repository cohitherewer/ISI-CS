                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak says yes to talks offer
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Islamabad, Feb. 12: The foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan will hold talks in New Delhi on February 25 for the first time since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.        
	Pakistan foreign secretary Salman Bashir called his Indian counterpart Nirupama Rao this afternoon to say he had accepted the offer of an open dialogue made by her last month.        
	Salman Bashir telephoned foreign secretary Nirupama Rao today to convey acceptance of Indias invitation to hold foreign secretary-level talks in Delhi on February 25, a spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs said in Delhi this evening.        
	Pakistans high commissioner to India Shahid Malik is now in Islamabad and is expected to convey his governments views on the possible agenda for the talks to Indian officials when he returns to Delhi on Monday.        
	The announcement in Delhi followed a meeting in Islamabad earlier in the day where Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani directed Bashir to hold result-oriented and meaningful talks, a statement issued by Gilanis office said.         
	The statement quoted Gilani as saying that the Pakistani side should raise all the core issues and impress upon India the need for expeditious resolution through resumption of composite dialogue.        
	Pakistans nod came on a day the US military commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, arrived in Islamabad for a meeting with army chief General Ashfaq Kayani.         
	India had proposed resuming the talks late last month, suggesting February 18 and 25 as possible dates, but Pakistan was reluctant initially because it believed the negotiations would be confined to one subject  terrorism  and would, therefore, be a non-starter. New Delhi denied having attached any conditions.        
	Indias talks offer had come days after Shiv Shankar Menon, the architect of last Julys Sharm el-Sheikh declaration between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Gilani, took over as national security adviser. Sources said the push for talks had come from Singh and was backed by allies of the ruling UPA.        
	Some analysts in Pakistan believe American pressure had led India to propose resumption of the talks. Pakistan, too, has been under US pressure to engage with India.        
	An official told The Telegraph today Islamabad did not want to be blamed for sabotaging the talks. But one thing is clear  India will not be in a position to stop Pakistan from raising other issues when the talks begin, the official said.

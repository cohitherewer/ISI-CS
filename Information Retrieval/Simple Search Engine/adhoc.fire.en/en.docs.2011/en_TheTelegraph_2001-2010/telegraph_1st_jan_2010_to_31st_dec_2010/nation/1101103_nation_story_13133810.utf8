The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Communal threat in Sonia focus
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Communal threat in Sonia focus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Congress today said communalism was one of the biggest challenges before the nation, apart from Naxalism and terrorism.        
	Addressing the AICC meeting, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said the broader message for all of us is that our fight against communalism of all kinds, against fanaticism of all types, has to continue unabated.        
	But the main attack came from Pranab Mukherjee, who said recent revelations linking communal forces to terrorist activities had exposed how hollow the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs claims of nationalism and patriotism were.        
	Mukherjee said communalism was continuing to erode Indias composite culture and there was need to expose the RSS. He said the Manmohan Singh government had created a development strategy in which welfare schemes came with a legal guarantee. He mentioned the rural job scheme and the right to education and food security bills to vindicate his claim.        
	The Prime Minister said the Congress was fortunate to have Sonia as its leader. He stressed the need for inclusive growth so that the common man could get a share of the fruits of development.        
	Speaking on the Naxalite problem, Sonia said: We have always maintained that while firm police action is necessary, greater emphasis is essential on socio-economic issues. There must be greater sensitivity to the daily concerns of the tribals and other communities. Of course, these areas need to be developed but it is the nature of that development that is in question.        
	She added: People must have a say and they must have a stake. Destroying forests and their habitat through the indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources does not necessarily bring them out of the abject poverty in which they are languishing.

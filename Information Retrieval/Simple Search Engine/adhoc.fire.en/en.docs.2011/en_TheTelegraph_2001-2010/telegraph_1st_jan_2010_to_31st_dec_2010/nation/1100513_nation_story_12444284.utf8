          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, May 12: A 19-year-old who had recently married a man from a different caste against her parents wishes was shot dead in a Punjab village by her father and other relatives who also killed her mother-in-law.        
	The incident of honour killing  the latest in a series of such cases in the prosperous state  left Gurveen Kaurs husband Amanpreet Singh critically injured. He has been admitted to an Amritsar hospital.        
	Gurveen had married Amanpreet about two months ago. Threatened by her relatives, the couple had filed a plea for protection in Punjab and Haryana High Court, which was yet to take a decision on the request.        
	According to police in Tarn Taran, where the couple lived, eight relatives of Gurveen, including her father, barged into their house around Tuesday-Wednesday midnight armed with guns and sharp-edged weapons.        
	The first to be killed was Gurveens mother-in-law Kuljeet Kaur. Gurveen was next. Amanpreet ran out of the house but was chased and shot from behind. The attackers left thinking he had died, a police officer said.        
	Police teams have been sent to arrest Gurveens relatives at their home in Kotshera, a village in the same district.         
	In March, another couple, Prabhjot Kaur and Pardeep Singh, were shot dead in front of a government school in Patti town by Parabhjots relatives after they got married against their wishes. Prabhjot had gone to appear for an exam at the school.        
	The police have put down such violence to the low tolerance levels. The main reason for the growth in honour killings in the state is the low tolerance level. Mere suspicion is leading to extreme violence against women in the state. It casts a medieval shadow over the prosperous state, a senior police officer said.        
	Naveen explanation         
	The Congress leadership has sought an explanation from its Haryana MP Naveen Jindal for his remarks favouring the khap panchayats and supporting its cause. The party said Jindal should understand an MP cannot support extra-constitutional activities, reports our special correspondent in New Delhi.        
	I have sought an explanation from Jindal, Congresss Haryana in-charge Prithviraj Chavan said today. Party sources said Jindal has given an explanation, saying that he did not support khap panchayats.

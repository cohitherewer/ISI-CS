The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tussle over US study plan 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tussle over US study plan 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Who will control the initiative?                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: An ambitious Indo-American education initiative named after President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is caught in a tug-of-war and is yet to take off six months after Obama announced it from the White House.        
	The Singh-Obama 21st Century Knowledge Initiative, announced during Singhs visit to America in November 2009, is stuck because the two countries are yet to decide how to implement the project.        
	Differences have emerged between the American and Indian higher education regulators over who should be put in charge of implementing the initiative, top government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	The initiative is aimed at strengthening ties between institutions in India and the US, and at encouraging interaction between students and teachers of the two countries.        
	The US has told India that it wants the United States-India Education Foundation  earlier referred to as the USEFI but now called the USIEF  as the nodal agency to implement the initiative, the sources said.        
	But the University Grants Commission, Indias apex higher education regulator and funding agency, has told the human resource development ministry that it should be placed in charge, the sources said.        
	Talks over the status of the initiative are a component of the strategic dialogue between the two nations scheduled in Washington between June 1 and 4.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, who is touring the US, will accompany foreign minister S.M. Krishna; the junior minister in the Prime Ministers Office, Prithviraj Chavan; and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia to the talks.        
	It is a tricky situation to be in because President Obama was very keen on the initiative and suggested naming it after the heads of governments of the two countries, a source said.        
	Obama had announced the initiative at the White House news conference that followed his meeting with Singh on November 24.        
	We are increasing ties and exchanges between our universities and community colleges as part of a new Obama-Singh  or Singh-Obama  21st Century Knowledge Initiative. We think its appropriately named, Obama had announced, smiling in response to laughter at his quandary over the order in which the leaders names ought to be mentioned. Like many bilateral programmes, each country refers to the initiative in official documents with its leaders name first.         
	But while India is keen to take forward the initiative, sources said the government was unlikely to accept the US proposal to allow the USIEF alone to implement the project. The project involves funding by both India and the US.        
	 They (the USIEF) will implement the initiative the way they want to. How can we allow that, considering that this is a joint project? the source said.        
	The USIEF manages the prestigious Nehru-Fulbright fellowships that provide financial support to eligible Indian students who wish to pursue postgraduate education in the US. Obama and Singh had also announced plans to expand the number of these fellowships in their November joint statement.        
	The University Grants Commission, on the other hand, today carries far less credibility than it used to, and the government itself plans to wind up the organisation and create a new, overarching higher education regulator.         
	It is unlikely that the University Grants Commission will get complete implementation powers either, a source said, adding that the governments of India and the US would probably need to arrive at a joint mechanism for implementation.

	Patna/Bhagalpur, Sept. 4: Bihar police today claimed a breakthrough towards ending the hostage standoff by nabbing a top area commander of the CPI (Maoist) with an associate even as a rebel spokesman said the three captive policemen would be released tomorrow.        
	The arrest of commander Pintoo and his aide Bahadur Yadav comes a day after the recovery of the body of Bihar Military Police jawan Lucas Tete from the jungles of southeastern Bihar. The duo were nabbed in the Gurmaha forest in Jamui district, police said.         
	Late tonight, Avinash, the self-proclaimed Maoist spokesman, told some news channels that the three hostages would be freed on Sunday unconditionally on humanitarian considerations.         
	The police, however, refused to take his statement at face value. His words have no meaning now. He has been saying all sorts of things, a senior officer said in Patna.        
	Director-general of police Neel Mani said that Pintoo, a resident of Laxmipur village in Jamui, was arrested from a forest hideout.        
	Pintoo, who assumed command of the rebels Jamui-Lakhisarai-Munger border area committee after the arrest of Ajay alias Jai Paswan, is said to have confessed to his involvement in Sundays Kajra encounter, in which eight policemen died and four were taken hostage.        
	Inspector-general (operations) K.S. Dwivedi said that besides the two Maoists arrested in Jamui, 12 other people have been detained for interrogation. He said the police had carried out intensive search operations in pockets of Maoist influence in Jamui, Munger and Lakhisarai districts.        
	While eight people were taken into custody from Kharagpur area in Munger, two each were picked up from Kajra and Jhajha areas in Jamui, he added.        
	Sources said Pintoo had spilled the beans about Sundays operation in the Kajra forest. They claimed he had told interrogators that the plan to attack security personnel had been chalked out a month before the operation.        
	We were asked to reach the destination a day before the operation, he is believed to have said, adding that he was leading a group of 15 armed squad members.        
	When I reached the place, I found 50-60 non-Hindi-speaking people there. Members of the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, besides different parts of Bihar, had assembled there, the self-proclaimed area commander said.        
	He said the squad members had taken up position, for the strike on security personnel, at different locations since Sunday morning on the directive of top leaders.        
	Pintoo said that assistant sub-inspector Tete was killed in his presence. We dispersed after the death sentence awarded to the BMP jawan at a kangaroo court, he said.        
	He, however, said he did not know the whereabouts of the three other policemen taken hostage after the encounter.        
	Tetes body was found a day after the Maoists had claimed to have killed a different hostage, assistant sub-inspector Abhay Kumar Yadav.

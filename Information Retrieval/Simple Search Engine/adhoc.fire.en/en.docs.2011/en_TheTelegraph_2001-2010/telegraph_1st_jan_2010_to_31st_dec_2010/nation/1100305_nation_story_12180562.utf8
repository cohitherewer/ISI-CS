	New Delhi, March 4 (PTI): Air India pilots have threatened not to operate to Kabul if the national carrier does not give clear-cut guidelines on flying to the trouble-torn country.        
	Air India has, however, said it was not flying to any unsafe zone.        
	The situation in Kabul has deteriorated putting the life of the crew and passengers in jeopardy, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association has said.         
	If the pilots do not get a suitable reply, they would be forced to ask our members not to operate flights in these unsafe conditions.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said he was not aware of the issue.

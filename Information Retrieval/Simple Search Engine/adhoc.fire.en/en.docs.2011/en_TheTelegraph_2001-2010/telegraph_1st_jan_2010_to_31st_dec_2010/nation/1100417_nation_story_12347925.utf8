          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 16: A couple from Howrah, shattered by the death of their elder daughter from cancer, drank poison along with their nine-year-old younger daughter in a suicide pact last night.        
	Dwijendra Ganguly, 38, a retired ornament-maker in Mumbai, and his wife Madhuri are dead while young Shweta is battling for her life in hospital.        
	Last night, a day after Suparna lost her four-year battle with cancer, Ganguly discussed the suicide pact with his family after conducting the last rites of his daughter.        
	Ganguly had sold his flat in Bhayander four years ago to raise money for Suparnas treatment, and had moved into a rented apartment in Navghar Road.        
	He also took voluntary retirement from his job with a jewellery-manufacturing unit in Andheri so he could look after Suparna, whose condition turned critical in January this year.        
	She was admitted to Nanawati Hospital in Vile Parle where she died on Wednesday.        
	Last night, the family skipped dinner and went to bed after drinking poison. But sometime after midnight, Shweta told her maternal uncle Harendranath Roy, who was staying at their home, about the suicide pact, police officers said.         
	By the time the three were taken to hospital, Ganguly was frothing at the mouth. He and Madhuri were declared dead on arrival.

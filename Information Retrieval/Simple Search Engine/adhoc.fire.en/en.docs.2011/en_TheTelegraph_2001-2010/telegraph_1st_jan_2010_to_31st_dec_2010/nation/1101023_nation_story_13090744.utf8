          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: The Centre today asked IIT Kharagpur to give a factual account of a professors alleged role in running an unapproved institute and duping students into believing it was a branch of the tech school.        
	Amit Kumar Ghosh, the head of the department of aeronautical engineering, has been accused of having a hand in the running of the Institution of Electrical Engineering (IEE) in Kharagpur and offering diploma courses without the approval of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).        
	IIT Kharagpur director Damodar Acharya met human resource development minister Kapil Sibal today and is understood to have explained the matter.         
	The ministry is livid that a senior faculty member could be involved in fraudulent activities. The IIT Kharagpur authorities have been asked to furnish a factual account on the issue, a ministry official said.         
	A senior IIT official said Ghosh had been removed as aeronautical engineering department head following the allegations. An inquiry has been ordered.        
	The IEE has been operating from a temporary campus and offering courses such as a diploma in electrical engineering. Ghosh has allegedly been serving as the institute president. J.K. Tiwary has apparently been managing the institute for the last two years and luring students by claiming that the IEE is a branch of IIT-Kharagpur.        
	Trouble started this year after students found out that the IEE had no connection with IIT Kharagpur. It did not even have AICTE approval, mandatory for an institute teaching any technical course.        
	Furious, the students registered a complaint with the IIT Kharagpur director. They have spoiled our career. We want justice, M. Ramu, a student of IEE, said.         
	The institute has been closed for the last two months.

	Srinagar, Oct. 12: Four months of bloody street protests may have paralysed Kashmir, but security forces didnt allow militants to exploit the lawlessness.        
	Police sources said despite the relentless violence, the number of militants in the Valley had come down to 250, down from slightly more, though they didnt mention the exact figure.         
	Security forces said they had killed 42 militants last month.        
	Jammu and Kashmir police chief Kuldeep Khoda said some 250 militants were active in the Valley, 45 per cent of them foreigners. If we look at the figure of militants operating in the whole of Jammu and Kashmir, they are not more than 500, he said.         
	Counter-insurgency operations were a casualty during the 2008 Amarnath land agitation, which had forced security forces to focus entirely on stone-throwing mobs.        
	Khoda said militancy was down but had not been completely eradicated. Infiltration is less but has not stopped. We have to remain vigilant, he said.         
	A few days ago we killed a top Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, Abu Kital, a Pakistani citizen, in Sopore, he added.         
	The police chiefs statement contradicted army chief General V.K. Singhs assertion that infiltration bids from across the Line of Control had increased over the last two months.         
	The government had to impose a curfew today to foil a separatist march to Hurriyat hawk S.A.S. Geelanis residence.

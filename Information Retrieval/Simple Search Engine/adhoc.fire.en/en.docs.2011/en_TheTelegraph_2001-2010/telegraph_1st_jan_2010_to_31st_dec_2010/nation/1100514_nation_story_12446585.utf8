          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Orissa High Court      
	Cuttack, May 13: State information commissioner Pramod Kumar Mohantys appointment has been challenged in Orissa High Court on the ground that it is illegal.         
	Mohanty, who was special secretary to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, was sworn in as the state information commissioner by Governor M.C. Bhandare last week.         
	However, a petition filed by Pradip Pradhan, a resident of Bolangir, a few days ago said that Mohantys appointment was in violation of Section 15 (5) of the RTI Act , which says that the information commissioner shall be a person of eminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass media or administration and governance.        
	Pradhan claimed that Mohanty was named the information commissioner a month before he was due to retire. Hence, the appointment was made under political considerations for post-retirement rehabilitation, he argued.         
	Sources said the petitioner has made the chief secretary, secretary of the department of law, and secretary of the department of information and public relation defendants in the case. The high court, however, is yet to list the matter for hearing.         
	Sources said this was the first time that appointment of a commissioner had been challenged in a court. They did not rule out the role of people with vested interests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist refuge in urban pockets
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist refuge in urban pockets
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Union home ministry has received substantive inputs that many Maoist leaders, including military commander Ganapathi, have slipped out of their jungle hideouts and entered urban pockets.        
	They have reportedly sought shelter in traditionally non-Naxalite states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and in pockets of western and coastal Maharashtra.        
	This, sources claimed, was happening essentially on account of the build-up of security heat on Naxalite concentrations in south Bastar and the fear of joint operations across most-affected states.        
	The information on Naxalite bosses scattering away is based mainly on recent telephone intercepts which reveal that most of them are frequently changing locations, sometimes twice or three times during the course of a day.        
	Asked why the security forces hadnt apprehended any senior Naxalite leader since Kobad Ghandy if precise information on their movement existed, a source said: There is mostly a time lag in the receipt and analysis of such intercepts. Most often by the time you have pinned down a location, the person has moved. Not only to another place but also to a new mobile phone.        
	Joint operations against the Maoists -- the effort has got off the ground only in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra  came up for review at a meeting of police chiefs of all states concerned and senior Intelligence officials with the Union home secretary today.        
	The general sense was that some progress has been made in the offensive that has been slow to start.         
	Equally, mention was made of the need to kickstart anti-Naxalite operations in laggard states like Orissa, Jharkhand and even Bengal.        
	Orissa has consistently complained of lacking enough experienced boots on the ground to launch an ambitious offensive. Jharkhand was embroiled in elections. Bengal and the Centre have been having a standing row on strategies to beat away the Maoists.        
	But the emphasis of todays meeting, the sources said, was on development efforts in Maoist strongholds.Officials from the Planning Commision and ministries like transport and telecommunications were also present.

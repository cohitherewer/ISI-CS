The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Push for law study in college
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Push for law study in college
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                         Kapil Sibal    
	New Delhi, April 27: Humanities students in undergraduate colleges across India may soon have courses in law as a part of their curriculum under a new plan which the University Grants Commission (UGC) is finalising.         
	UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat has committed to HRD minister Kapil Sibal that the commission will introduce law courses across undergraduate humanities programmes, top government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	Under the plan, students of undergraduate programmes in the languages, history, political science, sociology, economics and other humanities subjects will be given the opportunity to also study basic courses in law.         
	The plan, if implemented, will represent the first attempt to make basic legal education a part of mainstream higher education and is part of the HRD ministers vision to popularise the study of law.         
	The law courses may either be mandatory or could be added to the bouquet of optional subjects that students of traditional humanities courses at present choose from, the sources said.        
	Most undergraduate programmes in the humanities and the pure sciences across the country at present do not offer courses in professional streams like law, architecture, engineering or medicine to students.        
	This structure of college education has frequently been criticised for denying students skill sets they require for professional programmes they wish to subsequently pursue.         
	The proposal to introduce law courses in traditional undergraduate humanities programmes was made by a panel of legal education experts appointed by Sibal to suggest reforms.         
	The panel, dubbed a roundtable by the HRD ministry, has also proposed establishing a unique institution exclusively for legal research, through a public-private partnership.         
	It has also recommended condensing the current two-year postgraduate masters in law (LLM) programme into a one-year course to make it more attractive to students after they complete their graduation.         
	Students complete at least five years of higher education before they become eligible for an LLM in India.        
	Students who join the BA, LLB programmes offered by the National Law Schools complete their undergraduation in law after five years. Those who go for the subject after their first graduation take longer before they complete their graduation in law.         
	The proposed reforms come at a time law is increasingly emerging as a popular academic and career choice among students, with companies offering fat salaries to lawyers for assisting in formulating deals, mergers and acquisitions.         
	India has also witnessed an unprecedented expansion in opportunities for top quality legal education over the past few years, in recognition of both the demand and the growing popularity of law among students.        
	From just the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) in Bangalore till 1997, India today has 13 National Law Universities (NLU).

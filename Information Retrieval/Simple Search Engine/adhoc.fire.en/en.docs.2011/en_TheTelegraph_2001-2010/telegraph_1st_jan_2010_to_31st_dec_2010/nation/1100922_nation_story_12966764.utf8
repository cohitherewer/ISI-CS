The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deng touch, Kautilya counter
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deng touch, Kautilya counter
          K.P.NAYAR                                       
	New York, Sept. 21: Precisely three weeks before India is elected as a member of the UN Security Council after a gap of nearly two decades, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao yesterday presented a comprehensive outline of the countrys external affairs at the worlds most high profile high table, which New Delhi will occupy for two years from January 1, 2011.         
	A China expert, a former ambassador in Beijing and the countrys foremost authority on Sino-Indian boundary, Raos presentation at Harvards South Asia Initiative was reminiscent of Deng Xiaopings famous description of Beijings policies in his time as socialism with Chinese characteristics. For analysts looking for straws in the wind about trends in New Delhis policies almost on the eve of the UN General Assemblys general debate attended by heads of state and government, Rao also injected a sense of realism to the popular lore about Indias rise as a global power.         
	Today, it is almost de rigeur to speak of the dynamic Indian growth story despite the ravages of the global economic crisis. But, to put our arms around the Indian experience, you have to go beyond just the factor of fast economic growth, she told the Harvard audience, delivering the Harish C. Mahindra Memorial Lecture.         
	To join the ranks of the developed countries, she said, India would have to maintain an average growth of a minimum of 7.5 per cent GDP per year (and) achieve a 10-fold increase in per capita income in the next 30 years... At this rate of growth, by 2020, we should be able to be categorised as a middle income developing country.         
	Seeking to anchor Indias foreign policy on these growth objectives, Rao said this approach has shaped and defined Indias role on the global stage today, as the policies we seek to articulate and endorse internationally are based on our own domestic experience.         
	Explaining the transformation perceived by her audience to global policies with Indian characteristics, Deng-style, Rao recalled that the well-springs of Indias foreign policy as we began life as an independent nation were issues such as decolonisation, the creation of an Afro-Asian community of like-minded countries, the emphasis on the principles of peaceful co-existence based on mutual respect between nations, among others.         
	Not that such issues are no more relevant. But today, driving our foreign policy priorities and our desire for strategic autonomy are factors of external security, internal security, the need for sustained economic growth, our energy security, maritime security and access to technology and innovation.         
	Adding growth as a rarely articulated dimension to foreign policy, Rao said: Where our global role and our foreign policy comes into this growth story is to ensure that we create an environment, an external environment that is conducive to an increased flow of capital into the country.         
	At the same time, the foreign secretary poured cold water on the idea touted by some in India and hoped for by many more in the US that New Delhis foreign and security policies could be anchored to those of Washington as Indo-US relations continue to blossom.         
	India is too large a country to be dovetailed into alliance type of relationships. In order to modernise our country we need to, and we have succeeded in, forging well-rounded strategic partnerships with all major powers.         
	Perhaps for the first time since a setback in Sharm el-Sheikh in July last year when the UPA government was heavily criticised at home for perceived concessions to Islamabad, the foreign secretary explained the rationale behind Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs determination to seek a rapprochement with Pakistan despite heavy odds.         
	Quoting Kautilya, the philosopher-statesman associated with the rise of the Maurya empire, Rao said we understand well the Kautilyan advice that a great power loses stature if it remains bogged down in neighbourhood entanglements. We are determined to persevere in our dialogue with Pakistan in order to resolve outstanding issues.         
	Like the adage that charity begins at home, she emphasised that any visualisation of Indias global role must begin in our immediate neighbourhood because situational factors in that environment affect our internal security and therefore merit our greatest attention. Besides, the Indian economy with its rapid growth and the impact this exerts beyond our borders, is fast becoming an anchoring element in the region. Therefore, a peaceful neighbourhood is mandatory for the realisation of our own vision of economic growth.         
	With barely seven weeks left for US president Barack Obamas visit to India, when Afghanistan will be a critical subject of discussion, the foreign secretary did some plain speaking on Pakistans criticism of New Delhis role in Kabul, which has gained some traction in America, in sections of the Obama administration, within the strategic community and in the media. We have a direct interest in Afghanistan, not because we see it as a theatre of rivalry with Pakistan but because of the growing fusion of terrorist groups that operate from Afghanistan and Pakistan and their activities in India... We stand by (our) commitment (of development assistance) despite the grave threat under which our personnel and people are working in Afghanistan to transform the lives of ordinary Afghan people.         
	Two decades ago, an Indian foreign secretarys speech would have been replete with praise for non-alignment and similar ideas. Yesterday, Rao pointed out that last year in September, at its Pittsburgh Summit, the G-20 was designated as the premier forum for international economic cooperation. We see the G-20 process as a move towards a more representative mechanism to manage global economic and financial issues.

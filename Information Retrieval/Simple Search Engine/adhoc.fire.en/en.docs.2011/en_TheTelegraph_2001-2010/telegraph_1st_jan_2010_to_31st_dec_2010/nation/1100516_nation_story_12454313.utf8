          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sahay will inaugurate the premier league                                  
	Ranchi, May 15: Former Test and Ranji cricketers of Jharkhand and Bihar today announced that Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay will inaugurate the first edition of Jharkhand Premier Cricket league for under-19, 2010, on May 25 at Keenan stadium, Jamshedpur.        
	Under-19 teams from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Punjab, Orissa and Jharkhand will participate in the tournament. The six teams will be divided into two groups and the matches will be played on league basis. The top two teams from each group will qualify for the semi-finals, said Aditya Verma, convener of JPL.        
	The event was conceived at the behest of Sahay.        
	The minister will also launch a talent hunt scheme in his constituency by organising cricket tourneys at the panchayat level, at the block level and finally shortlist 25 talented players.                          
	To kickstart the effort, some former players got together and came up with the idea of organising the Jharkhand Premier Cricket League, in the T20 format for under-19 players.         
	The winners will get Rs 50,000 with a trophy, the runners up Rs 25,000 and a trophy, and the third best team will bag Rs 15,000 with mementos, Verma informed.         
	 This is an effort to give the talented youngsters a platform as well as an opportunity to sharpen their skills, said former Ranji fast bowler Kuldip Singh, also the treasurer of the organising committee.        
	The organising committee, headed by Sahay, comprises former Test players Ramesh Saxena and Randhir Singh as vice presidents, former East Zone fast bowler Sekhar Sinha, Sanjay Kumar (IPS), Ajay Kumar Singh (IPS), Aajay Kumar (IRS) and Deval Sahay, among others. Former Ranj batsman Ujjwal Das is the coordinator.

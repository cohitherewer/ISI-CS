          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                               
	New Delhi, April 22: The Congress has meted out the carrot-and-stick treatment to Sharad Pawar in the latest IPL saga with good reason.        
	It had been dying to give the Maharashtra strongman his comeuppance for the alleged mess in the food and civil supplies sector, his undisguised contempt for the UPAs pro-masses agenda and refusal to rein in his colleague in charge of civil aviation and his obsession with cricket politics.        
	But if the Congress decided to give Pawar a break, midway through the latest edition of the raid raj, it was also because of the fear that his reprisal might be stronger than its action.        
	Pawars importance transcends his flock of nine MPs who might shore up the UPA government for now. If they were to pull out, the Congress can recompense the loss by winning over friends from neutral blocks or Independents.        
	But Pawar is a leader the Congress will not trifle with in a hurry because of his potential to inflict damage through the motley political friends he has nurtured over the years: from the Shiv Sena and the BJP to the socialists and Dravida formations from Tamil Nadu.        
	Pawars political DNA is different from that of the quintessential Congress neta. He may sound ambivalent on ethics and ideology, but he is clear how realpolitik should be played  from a level-playing field where a Mulayam Singh Yadav and a Lalu Prasad can be as useful as a Bal Thackeray or a Gopinath Munde.        
	As the spectre of Opposition-driven cut motions on the finance bill looms, the NCPs movements are being watched closely. Those who have monitored Pawars three rebellions against the Congress  in 1978, 1988 and 1999  know they concluded with his return to the parent party or by forging an alliance with it.        
	For Pawar, politics is more important than arithmetic in government formation and that is why he also knows that while his dalliances with the Sena might be fleetingly overlooked by his party workers, they will not brook a long-term partnership between Pawar and the Thackerays.        
	So while BJP deputy Opposition leader Munde was silent on whether Pawar and Praful Patel ought to resign for their reported patronage of the IPL for personal gains, no BJP leader believes the NCP would let the government down when the cut motions are voted on. Which doesnt mean Pawar will not abandon his game of keeping us on tenterhooks, said a Congress minister.        
	Cast in the same mould, Pawars daughter and political heir Supriya Sule has friends across the political establishment. Like her father, she has also nursed the family constituency, Baramati.        
	Taluka, zilla, villages, I recognise each NCP worker by name and face. In a sense, I am one up on my father because he feels a disconnect with the young workers. But I am easy with young and old alike, she once told this correspondent.

	Patna/Korasi Feb. 19: By killing 11 extremely poor villagers in Korasi, Maoists have virtually defied their philosophy of armed struggle for the cause of have-nots.        
	All the victims, including three women, of Wednesdays midnight raid belonged to extremely poor families and were below poverty line (BPL) cardholders.        
	Phuleshwar Koda and his family survived on manual labour and selling firewood. But the Maoists selectively shot his wife, brother, daughter and a five-year-old child to death. Phuleshwar somehow escaped and has gone into hiding.        
	We are unable to understand why the Maoists have targeted our village. We are poor people with no weapons other than traditional bows and arrows. How can we fight the armed guerrillas who keep on patrolling in the area? asked Narayan Koda (70), adding: Their (Maoists) suspicion is baseless.        
	The Maoists claimed they killed 11 people of the remote village surrounded by a range of seven hills connected to Jharkhands Giridih district to avenge the lynching of eight of their cadres by the villagers.        
	Korasi is one of the many villages in rebel-infested Jamui district. But its residents have steadfastly refused to fall in line with the Maoists despite extreme poverty and hardship.         
	In fact, one Lakhan Koda, whom the Naxalites accused of having a hand in the lynching, had opposed the red operation to baptise villagers in their philosophy of mass annihilation of class enemies in 2003, inviting the wrath of the guerrillas.         
	Lakhan, a local Robin Hood-like tribal figure, persuaded the villagers to get job cards under the MGNREGA and co-operate with the local administration and police. Lakhan always discourages us from joining hands with the Maoists, said Chinta Devi (50), adding: He (Lakhan) is a farm-worker.        
	But the Maoists, according to the villagers, saw Lakhans conduct as an act of defiance and suspected him to be the police informer who masterminded the lynching of eight of their cadres.         
	The villagers, however, denied any incident of lynching there. Deputy inspector-general of police (Munger range) Amit Kumar also confirmed this: We have no records about the lynching of eight Maoist cadres.        
	Today, almost all the survivors have deserted Korasi, comprising 200 families. Only about 50 elderly people who were not on the marauders target are staying back in the village with cattle and charred huts.         
	The Maoists have morphed themselves into armed gangsters spreading terror in villages through their armed might. They are now only interested in extorting levy from traders, looting arms from the forces to increase their firepower rather than carry out any movement for the cause of have-nots, said Asian Development Research Institute, Patna, director Saibal Gupta.        
	It is probably for the first time in Bihar that the Maoists targeted the extremely poor, including women and children.         
	The villagers thoroughly rejected the chief ministers claim that the implementation of development schemes and democracy at the grassroots level were the only solution to the red menace.        
	We have approached the Sikandara police station quite a few times informing officers about our fear of a Maoist attack. But the police simply ignored us, a villager said        
	Senari in Jehanabad district had witnessed a similar carnage in March 1999. But the Maoists, who had claimed responsibility for the incident, had described it as revenge for the killing of over 20 poor people belonging to poor scheduled castes in Shankarbigha and Narayanpur in 1998.         
	Moreover, all the 34 people slaughtered by the Maoists at Senari were men between the age group of 20 to 35 years. They were upper caste Bhumihars who had founded the landlords army, Ranvir Sena.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left nurses cut after BJP vote 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Left nurses cut after BJP vote 
          J.P. YADAV                               Gadkari (top) and Karat				                                 
	New Delhi, April 28: The CPM-led blocs assiduously maintained secular credentials suffered a dent after it was seen voting along with the BJP on the cut motions in the Lok Sabha yesterday, particularly since the BSP, Samajwadi Party and the RJD refused to vote with the Left on the pretext of keeping a safe distance from the communal forces.        
	The Congress today was quick to seize the opportunity to poke at the Left discomfiture for joining hands with the BJP. It was a wonderful sight to see the BJP and the Left marching to the same tune, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said today.         
	Significantly, even sections within the CPM are unhappy at getting a BJP-friendly tag at a time the Bengal unit is taking measures to regain the Muslim vote. The erosion of Muslim support is regarded as a key reason for the Lefts rout in the state in the Lok Sabha elections last year.         
	Bengal CPM chief Biman Bose was evidently embarrassed over allegations of affinity towards the BJP. There were several cut motions, including those submitted by Gurudas Dasgupta and Basudev Acharya. Vote was taken on Dasguptas motion. What can we do if the BJP votes supporting our motion? Bose asked in Calcutta.        
	There is no question of reviewing our position on the BJP. The BJP cannot come out of its communal agenda, he added.        
	The political faux pas of voting with the BJP is likely to be debated in the CPM central committee meeting next week.        
	Yesterday, though the Left did not vote for the cut motion moved by Sushma Swaraj (which got only 162 votes to the UPAs 246), the BJP did not return the favour  it backed a Left-moved motion, resulting in 201 votes to 289.         
	The overall impression, therefore, was that the BJP and the Left had voted together. This impression was reinforced by the public stand adopted by Mayavati, Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav. While Mayavati chose to support the government on the ground that she did not want to give a handle to communal forces, the Yadav duo jeered at the Left and accused it of colluding with the communal BJP.         
	Can you assure us that the BJP will not vote along with you on the cut motion? If you can, we are willing to vote along with you, Lalu Prasad had said before he walked out of the House.        
	The Left leaders reasoned that the desertions had to do with CBI cases, but the regional satraps shrewdly jacketed it with ideology.        
	The BJP is like haija (cholera). How could I be seen with the party that led to the defeat of my daughter-in-law? a source quoted Mulayam Singh as having told the Left leaders, referring to the defeat of Dimple Yadav by the Congresss Raj Babbar in Firozabad.        
	On more than one occasion in the recent past, the Left has been seen on the same page with the BJP inside Parliament. The party has marched in tune with the BJP over price rise and on dealing with Maoists.         
	CPM leader Hannan Mollah, however, said the perception was mischievous. Those who feel that the Left can go with the BJP are living in a fools paradise. The impression is deliberately created to malign the Left parties who are genuinely fighting the price rise, Mollah said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | After Mamata damper, eyes on Sonia   BJP seeks relook at women ticket quota
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      After Mamata damper, eyes on Sonia     -  BJP seeks relook at women ticket quota
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Railway minister Mamata Banerjee with RJD chief and her predecessor, Lalu Prasad, after the all-party meeting on the womens reservation bill on Monday. Both have sought sub-quotas for Muslims. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, April 5: Mamata Banerjee disagreed and Sushma Swaraj dithered. Now the key question about the womens reservation bill is: will Sonia Gandhi jump to its rescue?        
	Without a push from the UPA chairperson, the bill seems unlikely to be introduced in the Lok Sabha in the budget session after Mamata expressed her reservations today.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, a key UPA ally, demanded a sub-quota for backward Muslims at an all-party meeting of MPs called by leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Mamata has apparently received feedback that Muslims feel their meagre share of the legislative space may now be cut further to make room for women candidates. Besides, she wants to counter the Bengal governments move for a backward Muslim job quota ahead of the May 2011 state elections.                        Pranab Mukherjee      
	It (taking the bill up) appears difficult, a cabinet minister admitted.        
	Sonia, of course, could power the process with the devil-may-care resolve she had shown in the Rajya Sabha, but even this script could run into trouble with the BJP saying it would no longer mutely watch marshals evict dissenters.        
	Sushma, a staunch bill backer so far, has apparently taken a more nuanced stand after some of the BJPs more vocal MPs threatened to vote against the party whip even on pain of being disqualified.        
	She suggested a second look at an Election Commission proposal that envisages political parties earmarking 33 per cent tickets for women if a consensus on House seat reservation stays elusive. The proposals critics say this would allow parties to dump women in un-winnable seats.        
	Mukherjee is expected to hold another round of discussions after briefing the Prime Minister about todays talks.        
	Not cordial        
	Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, who wants the bill redrafted to include OBC and Muslim sub-quotas, today forced the government to redraft even its statement on the all-party meeting, a PTI report said.        
	The government had planned to say the talks were held in a cordial atmosphere, that Parliament would maintain decency and decorum over the bill, and that efforts would be made to find an amicable solution, sources said. Also, the government apparently didnt plan to mention further discussions, the agency report said.        
	After Lalu Prasads objections, the statement merely gave the date and time of todays meeting, avoided any mention of cordiality and said further discussions will continue.        
	Mamata had earlier told the meeting the bill should be in tune with the Ranganath Misra commissions recommendation for 10 per cent reservation in government jobs for backward Muslims, sources said.        
	She said she supported the bill but there was no harm in discussing all the issues arising from it.        
	The Congress heard her out intently because it too has received feedback that the gender bill has evoked mixed reactions on the ground.        
	More important, Manmohan Singh and Mukherjee do not want to endanger the finance bill, expected to be passed on April 22 or 23, given their dependence on womens quota opponents like the Samajwadi Party and the RJD to provide the numbers.        
	Like Sushma, the Samajwadis today favoured the Election Commission proposal for a ticket quota. So did the Shiv Sena, a BJP ally.        
	The Left dropped its objections to sub-quotas for backward and minority women, saying that if the Constitution was amended to allow this, it would not have a problem.

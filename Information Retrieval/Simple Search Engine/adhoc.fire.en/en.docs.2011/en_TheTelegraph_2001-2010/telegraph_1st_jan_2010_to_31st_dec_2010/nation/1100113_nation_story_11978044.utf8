          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                      
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: Making itself accountable will not erode the higher judiciarys independence but may actually help protect it, Delhi High Court today told the Supreme Court.        
	The high court had just rejected a Supreme Court plea, made partly on the ground of judicial independence, against opening the Chief Justice of Indias office to public scrutiny under the Right to Information Act.        
	Well-defined and publicly known standards and procedures complement, rather than diminish, the notion of judicial independence. Democracy expects openness and openness is concomitant of free society, the three-judge high court bench said.        
	The high court said that unless judges took on the mantle of maintaining the highest moral standards, the government might step in, undermining the judiciarys independence.        
	If the judiciary fails or neglects to assume responsibility for ensuring that members maintain high standards of judicial conduct expected of them, public opinion and political expediency may lead the other two branches of government to intervene. When that happens, the principle of judicial independence upon which the judiciary is founded, and by which it is sustained, is likely to be undermined to some degree, perhaps seriously.        
	The high court shot down almost all the apex courts arguments in the case, which was kicked off by an RTI applicant asking whether Supreme Court judges declared their assets to the CJI.        
	The Supreme Court had claimed the CJIs office was not a public office but the high court held it was one, at least for the RTIs purposes, since it was an authority created by or under the Constitution.        
	The Supreme Court had claimed that the CJI held the information about other judges assets not under any law (that is, such revelation was not legally mandatory) but only under non-binding court resolutions. It argued that for the RTI to apply, the revelations would have to have legal sanction.        
	The apex court claimed the CJI held the information only in a fiduciary capacity, that is, in a relationship of trust. The high court rejected this argument too.        
	The declarations are not furnished to the CJI in a private relationship or as a trust but in discharge of the constitutional obligation to maintain higher standards and probity of judicial life, and are in the larger public interest. It cannot be held that the asset information shared with the CJI by the judges of the Supreme Court are held by him in the capacity of fiduciary, which if revealed, would result in breach of such duty, the bench said.        
	It held that the phrases held by or under the control of under Section 2(j) of the RTI Act would include not only information obtained compulsorily under the law by a public authority but also all information received or used or consciously retained by the public authority in the course of its functions and in its official capacity. Any other interpretation would render the right to information ineffective, it said.        
	Accountability of the judiciary cannot be seen in isolation. It must be viewed in the context of a general trend to render governors answerable to the people in ways that are transparent, accessible and effective, the high court said.        
	Behind this notion is a concept that the wielders of power  legislative, executive and judicial  are entrusted to perform their functions on condition that they account for their stewardship to the people who authorise them to exercise such power.

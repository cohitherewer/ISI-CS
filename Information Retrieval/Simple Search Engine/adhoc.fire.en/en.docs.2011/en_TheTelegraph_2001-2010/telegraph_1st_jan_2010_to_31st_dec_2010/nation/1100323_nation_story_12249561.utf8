          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Salboni, March 22: Suspected Maoists triggered a blast damaging a railway line in West Midnapore a little after Sunday midnight, prompting suspension of service on the Adra-Midnapore section for about 10 hours.         
	Officials said trains, halted at various stations for three to nine hours, started running again at 10.35am.        
	A little after yesterday midnight, the driver of a goods train heading towards Adra in Purulia heard a blast saw a banner and red flags on the tracks. He stopped somewhere between Godapiasal  about 30km from Lalgarh  and Midnapore stations and called the railway authorities in Kharagpur.        
	Immediately, all trains were stopped, a railway official said.         
	The official added that the damage caused was minor. Only a few clips that fix the tracks to the sleepers were dislodged. But it took so long for the service to resume as several kilometres of tracks had to be scanned for possible explosives.        
	The strike took place on the first day of a 48-hour bandh called by Maoists in Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh demanding an end to the crackdown on the guerrillas.         
	The Bhubaneswar-bound Rajdhani was among the trains delayed today. It was stuck in Bankura for 45 minutes because of the damaged tracks. The same train, while it was heading to Delhi on October 27 last year, had been detained for around seven and half hours at Banstala in West Midnapore by Maoists demanding the release of some of their leaders.        
	 Some of the other trains stalled were the Purulia-Howrah Express, Asansol-Haldia Express, Shalimar-Adra-Santaldih Aranyak Express and the Rupasi Bangla Express.

  - Passenger misreads am as pm on ticket, misses flight          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                    
	Mumbai, May 22: Airlines ask you to read your ticket carefully. A little carelessness probably saved Thresiamma Philips life today.        
	The 50-year-old UAE-based Malayali misread the 1.15am departure time on her ticket as 1.15pm, which is why she did not board the early morning flight from Dubai that crashed in Mangalore.        
	I have never misread the flight timing or missed a flight before in my life. God has done this to save me, the devout Catholic said over the phone from her home in Fujairah, a 90-minute drive from Dubai.        
	There are two flights to Mangalore, and I thought I was to fly on the 1.15pm flight. It was only after the news channels began flashing my name as a victim that I realised my mistake.        
	Philip, who works for the UAE health ministry in Sharjah, has been living in the Emirates for 29 years and flies to India two or three times a year. Her husband has an electronics business in Dubai.        
	Philip, whose youngest daughter lives with her, was to visit her other children in India. Her eldest son lives in Bangalore while a younger son and her daughter stay in Mangalore where they study.        
	My children called me around 6.30-7am to tell me a Mangalore-bound plane had crashed and the airport was closed. All of us believed I was booked on the afternoon flight. I had finished packing but was worried whether my flight would get delayed, Philip said.        
	Around 10.30am (local time) she had switched on the TV. When I saw my name on the news ticker I checked the passenger list on the Air India website, and then my ticket. It was then that I realised that God had given me a second life.        
	Eight others too missed the ill-starred flight. Air India gave their names as Merwyn DSouza, Vasantha Shetty, Mohamed Ashfaq, Husna Farheen, Sanjeeva Babanna Hegde, Louiscarlo Vincent Geraro, Steven Rego and Kunhikannan Chandu.        
	Dubai-based Shetty said his heavy workload had prevented him catching the flight. Its all Gods grace, he said.                    WITH INPUTS FROM PTI

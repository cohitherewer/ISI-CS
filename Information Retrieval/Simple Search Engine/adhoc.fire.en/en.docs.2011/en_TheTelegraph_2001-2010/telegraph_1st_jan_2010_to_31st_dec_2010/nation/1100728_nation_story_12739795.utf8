          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 27: India and Myanmar, battling insurgency on their 1,640km border, today agreed to have closer co-operation between their security forces to tackle the pernicious problem of terrorism.         
	Myanmar also hoped for greater economic co-operation with India in its efforts to have a countervailing force to China which has made huge investments in that country in recent years.         
	Myanmars head of government, General Than Shwe, held talks with Manmohan Singh. They agreed that security co-operation should be given immediate attention since terrorists, insurgents and criminals respect no boundaries and undermine the social and political fabric of a nation, a joint statement said.         
	Myanmar has recently reached ceasefire agreements with 17 of the 18 ethnic tribes that inhabit its border regions with India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul to Shah Rukh, Senas hands full   MP opts to brave black flags
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul to Shah Rukh, Senas hands full     MP opts to brave black flags
          OUR BUREAU                          Rahul Gandhi                                        
	Feb. 4: Rahul Gandhi will visit Mumbai tomorrow, ignoring protests lined up by cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackerays parties against his remark that the city is for all.        
	Rahul had a legitimate excuse to avoid the trip amid the tension. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) is meeting tomorrow to discuss price rise, and he could have cited it as a reason not to venture out of Delhi. However, the Gandhi scion decided to go, not wanting to send out the message that he had buckled under pressure.        
	Uddhavs Shiv Sena, which had earlier threatened to block Rahuls entry, has now scaled down its protest to a show of black flags. But police have tightened security and tonight arrested 51 Sena activists as a preventive measure.        
	 The Italian prince is on a visit to Mumbai tomorrow. Welcome him with black flags, Sena patriarch and Uddhavs father Bal Thackeray ordered his party workers in a statement this evening. Yesterday, the 84-year-old had taken a swipe at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna. The target was Rahul for his remarks, made in Bihar earlier this week, about Mumbai. Mumbai could belong to all Indians, but how could it belong to an Italian mummy? Thackeray wrote, alluding to Sonias Italian origins.        
	The Congress brushed aside the threats, arguing that little better could be expected from narrow-minded parties with no constructive agenda. Party spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said in Delhi: Rahulji is being lapped up by people wherever he goes because his politics is to serve, not threaten them. The Thackerays, rejected by people, are threatening everybody, be it Sachin Tendulkar, Shah Rukh Khan or Rahul Gandhi.         
	Ahmed refused to respond to the barbs flung at Rahul  Romeputra (uttered by Raj last evening) and frustrated because he hasnt married (Thackeray in an editorial)  saying the Congress couldnt stoop to such levels.        
	In Mumbai, chief minister Ashok Chavan echoed Ahmed. It only shows the new low politics has touched.         
	Asked whether the government was contemplating action against the Sena leadership for the provocative writings in Saamna, Chavan said We are watching what is being said. State home minister R.R. Patil appeared to suggest that proceedings could be initiated, saying legal opinion had been sought from the advocate-general on the writings and assured that appropriate action would be taken based on the advice.        
	Mumbai Congress chief Kripa Shankar Singh said Rahul  touring the country as part of a drive to mobilise youths for the Congress  was scheduled to address a group of college students in suburban Vile Parle at 11am and spend time with youths in a Ghatkopar slum before leaving for Pondicherry at 2.30pm.

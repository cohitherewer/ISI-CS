          SANJAY K. JHA                          Mukul Wasnik                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Bihar election campaign appears to have divided the Congress leadership, with the state unit rejecting the main slogan cleared by the publicity committee and a section of central leaders questioning the choice of advertising agency.        
	The slogan that the Bihar unit has rejected as dull, cumbersome and lacking punch goes like this: Hamari larai unse hai jo sirf baat banate hain/ ab jaroorat hai kam ki, Bihar ke oonche naam ki. (Our fight is against those who only indulge in lofty talk/the need of the hour is to work and enhance Bihars prestige).        
	Unimpressed Patna leaders have complained strongly to Mukul Wasnik, the general secretary in charge of Bihar, who has promised a relook at the theme song.        
	Wasnik is also the convener of the AICC publicity committee, headed by the powerful general secretary Digvijay Singh, which is believed to have cleared the campaign material. The committee has as its members Rahul Gandhi, Union ministers Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh, MP Nirmal Khatri, former MP Jagdish Tytler and Mohan Kumar. Law minister Veerappa Moily, Anil Shastri and Vishvjit Prithvi Singh are ex-officio members.        
	Rahuls presence on the committee and that of other powerful leaders has forced the Bihar unit to speak in a muted voice even though there is unanimity that the campaign is a disaster. However, Rahul rarely attends meetings of the committee.        
	The feedback we received is very disappointing. People fail to understand the message. Lalu-land is accustomed to high-voltage political rhetoric and our mild, apolitical slogan signifies nothing but the partys marginal status in the state, a leader from Bihar said.        
	Some central leaders agree with the assessment and say the campaign does not reflect the issues identified by the party to be taken up in the state election.        
	They question the very decision to award the campaign contract to an advertising agency with which the party did not have a pleasant experience in the last Lok Sabha election. Sources in the AICC reveal that there were serious problems about the bill it submitted for the general election campaign and treasurer Motilal Vora had withheld payment for a long time.        
	Vora had asked the firm to get certificates from candidates of the constituencies where its hoardings were put up. Apart from the number of hoardings it claimed, there were questions about how the agency managed the certificates. A huge amount was finally deducted from the payment.        
	Some leaders are also uncomfortable about the companys BJP connection. It has devised the BJPs campaign in the past.        
	The Bihar issue has triggered a fresh debate about the ad agencys credentials and questions are being raised about the quality of the campaign. The party should decide the political content and direction of the campaign. We are not sure if the slogan being used in Bihar would have impressed the publicity committee members. I am sure the party will come up with better stuff in the second round, a leader said.        
	There is also a difference of opinion on the prime target in Bihar. While some leaders want a frontal attack on Nitish Kumar, others want the focus to be on his association with the BJP and on criticism of the RJD. The Congress slogan which primarily targets leaders who talk loudly may be seen as an attack on Lalu Prasad, not Nitish. Many leaders doubt this will work.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Holbrooke regrets Kabul comment
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Holbrooke regrets Kabul comment
                            
	New Delhi, March 5 (PTI): The US special envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, today regretted any misunderstanding caused by his statement two days ago that Indians were not the target of last weeks terror strike in Kabul.        
	I did not say Indians were not the target, but that initially it looked like the target was not an official Indian facility. Early reports on events like this are often unreliable, and I try not to jump to conclusions, he said in a statement circulated by the US embassy.        
	I regret any misunderstanding caused by my comments on the recent terrorist attack in Kabul, he added.        
	Six Indians, including three army majors, were killed and nine, including four army officers, were injured in the strike, which Afghan President Hamid Karzai termed an attack on Indians.        
	Indian officials had said the special envoys statements were surprising considering the fact that the Afghan government had clearly stated that the attack was against Indians and had been carried out by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba.         
	Today, Holbrooke appeared to accept Indians were being picked out. We all know Indian citizens have (been), and continue to be, targeted by terrorists, including inside Afghanistan. My heart goes out to the families of all of the victims, he said.        
	Menon meets Karzai         
	National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon today discussed with Karzai the security of the 4,000-odd Indians working on projects in Afghanistan and the progress in the probe into last weeks attack. Menon later met Indian ambassador Jayant Prasad and other senior officials of the Indian embassy for their assessment of the situation.

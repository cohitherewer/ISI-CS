          ARCHIS MOHAN                           Relatives of blast victims break down at a hospital in Varanasi. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: After a quiet 2009, the Indian Mujahideen seems to be back. But the good news for the home ministry is that intelligence agencies believe it is still trying to regroup.         
	Sources say the terror group is yet to fully recover from the spate of arrests and encounter killings of its activists by police in Mumbai, Delhi and elsewhere in the country in 2008.         
	As proof, the sources in intelligence agencies cite the two most recent terrorist strikes the Indian Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for  the September 19 attack on foreign tourists outside New Delhis Jama Masjid and todays blast in Varanasi.         
	Its hand is also suspected in the German Bakery blast in Pune earlier this year that killed 17 but the terror group did not claim responsibility for that.         
	In the Jama Masjid attack, barely two weeks before the Commonwealth Games opened, two motorcyclists attacked a group of Taiwanese nationals. Two tourists were injured. An email signed by Al Arbi followed, claiming responsibility and threatening attacks  a Great Surprise!  during the Games.         
	Like the September attack, todays blast in Varanasi does not match up to the series of explosions the terror group executed from 2005 to 2008 in terms of the number of casualties.         
	The site was suitable thronged by thousands of devotees and dozens of foreigners. So was the time around evening aarti on a Tuesday, when the place is the most crowded. An email signed by Al Arbi and apparently sent from Malad in Mumbai followed, claiming responsibility and stating that the attack was in retaliation to the Babri Masjid title suit judgment.         
	Security officials say all this suggests good planning but poor execution. Their think tank has regrouped. But they are yet to get an efficient rank and file  people who will execute these attacks with precision, a source said.         
	The Centre banned the Indian Mujahideen in June this year. The group was behind 10 serial blasts from 2005 to 2008, including the ones in Jaipur, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. Around 500 people were killed, home ministry officials said.         
	Counter-terrorism strikes, which included the arrest of several activists and culminated in New Delhis Batla House encounter a week after the serial blasts in the capital in September 2008, broke the back of the groups network in north India, sources said         
	In its heyday, the Indian Mujahideen would release an email after each of its strikes. They had released five emails in 2007-08  one each after the Uttar Pradesh court attack and the Jaipur, Delhi and Ahmedabad blasts and another after the police claimed the Ahmedabad blasts case was solved.         
	The outfit fell silent for nearly two years  till September 19 this year, when they sent an email after the Jama Masjid attack claiming it was meant to avenge the agony of the Kashmiri people. It also remembered the two men killed in the Batla House encounter.         
	Security officials maintain that the Indian Mujahideen is a shadow outfit of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India or Simi and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba, and is directly controlled by Pakistans ISI. It was formed after Lashkar started finding it difficult to send people from across the border to carry out terrorist attacks in India, they say.         
	The group grabbed attention with the February 23, 2005, blasts in Varanasi that injured eight.

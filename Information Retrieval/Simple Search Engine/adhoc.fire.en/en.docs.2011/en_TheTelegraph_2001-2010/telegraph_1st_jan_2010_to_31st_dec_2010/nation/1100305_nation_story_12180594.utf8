          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 4: CPM leader Basudeb Acharya today accused Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee of having links with Maoists, taking to Parliament the Bengal rivals propaganda war ahead of next years Assembly election.        
	Not many Trinamul members were present at the time Acharya spoke, but Congress MPs sprung to the defence of their ally. Minister of state for parliamentary affairs G. Narayanswamy raised a point from the rulebook, saying no allegation of a defamatory nature could be made against a member without prior notice.        
	The Congresss Francisco Sardinha, in the Speakers chair, expunged the remark and directed the CPM leader to exercise caution. But Acharya continued and quoted Mamata as having said: I shall try my best to prevail upon the Union government to meet all your demands (Maoists demands), including withdrawal of forces from Lalgarh.         
	He then went on to accuse the Trinamul leader of opposing action against the rebels. Can she deny it (the report). These are the words of a cabinet minister and hence the Government of India. The government must explain how a minister openly defies the collective will of the cabinet. Time and again, she made such statements opposing the Centres decision to carry out operation against the Maoists, Acharya said.        
	He was speaking on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address, but chose to focus on Mamata instead, only fleetingly mentioning economic policies, agriculture and high prices, the main themes of the address.        
	The Trinamul Congress, the biggest ally of this government, is hand-in-glove with Maoists. Kishenji, a top Maoist leader, wants to see Mamata as chief minister.                     
	Chhatradhar Mahto, the leader of the PCPA (the rebels-backed tribal outfit in Lalgarh), belonged to Trinamul. The government owes an explanation to the House.        
	By this time, more Trinamul MPs had trooped in. They tried to shout him down, but Acharya went on. The Prime Minister has several times spoken against Left-wing extremism but this minister (Mamata) is supporting Maoists. The Trinamul is pursuing a diabolical electoral agenda at the cost of human lives and wants to spread anarchy.        
	The Congress and Trinamul members urged Sardinha to expunge the whole speech. Sardinha repeatedly asked Acharya to wind up, but the CPM MP threatened to walk out if he wasnt given more time.         
	Later CPI member Prabodh Panda continued the volley, but without naming Mamata. Is the central government united in its fight against Maoists? Are they speaking in one voice? Public statements by some of the constituents of the UPAshow they are supporting Maoists. But unlike Acharya, Panda didnt harp on the subject, spending most of his time on food security, inflation, land reforms and employment.

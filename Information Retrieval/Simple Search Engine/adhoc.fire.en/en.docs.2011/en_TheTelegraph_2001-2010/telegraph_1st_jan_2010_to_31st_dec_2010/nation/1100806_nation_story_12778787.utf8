The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata sprints for Urdu
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata sprints for Urdu
  - Minister rushes into House after Mulayam speaks for Muslims         J.P. YADAV                      TV footage of railway minister Mamata Banerjee in the Lok Sabha on Thursday. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Mamata Banerjee today virtually ran from Parliaments Central Hall to the Lok Sabha and drenched the House in a shower of shayari, all because Mulayam Singh Yadav appeared to be angling for minority votes.        
	Mamata was seen bustling into the House and egging on party MPs to join issue with the Samajwadi Party leader who had just alleged government apathy towards Urdu newspapers.        
	That was enough to kick off a scramble, with the Left and even the BJP competing to register their claims over the Muslim vote bank. An issue that was to be disposed of through a special mention turned into a full-fledged debate, compelling leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee to declare the government would take all necessary steps to promote and protect Urdu.        
	I love shayari; its so powerful, Mamata said, underlining her commitment and love for the Urdu language. She went on to recite one Urdu poem after another, reading out from her notes, presumably written in the Bengali script.        
	It all began when Mulayam received the Chairs permission to make a special mention of how the government had allegedly stopped publishing advertisements in Urdu newspapers. Mulayam said the government was trying to finish off the language.        
	Even before Mulayam had finished, Mamata, who had left the House, was seen rushing back. She sat down behind Sudip Bandopadhyay and whispered something to him. Sudip immediately raised his hand for a chance to speak.        
	Speaker Meira Kumar appeared reluctant, mentioning how members were waiting to raise zero-hour issues. Sudip eventually prevailed and rose to declare that Urdu was a very sweet language and his party would fight to protect it.        
	But the race was wide open by then. The BJPs deputy leader, Gopinath Munde, sprang a surprise and sympathised with Mulayams concern even as ally Shiv Senas MPs were seen fretting and fuming. Senior BJP leaders such as L.K. Advani were not in the House.        
	Urdu bhasha desh ki bhasha hai, kisi dharm ki bhasha nahi (Urdu is a language of the country and not of any religion), Munde said. He demanded that Urdu newspapers be protected, setting off a round of desk-thumping.        
	With a BJP leader backing Urdu, the Left couldnt afford to be left behind. The CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta raised his hands, followed by the CPMs Basudeb Acharya.        
	But they had to wait: the Chair had given right of way to Jammu and Kashmir MP Mirza Mehboob Beg, who thanked the members for their concern for Urdu.        
	Now the ball seemed ensconced in Kashmirs court, with renewable energy minister Farooq Abdullah taking charge. Pointing towards Shatrughan Sinha, he said Urdu was surviving because of Bollywood.        
	Health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, another former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, then took over. Eventually, Shatrughan had his say on the language before the comrades got their opportunity.        
	All this made Mamata restless. She got up and walked towards Azad and sat down beside him in the front row. The health minister was seen telling her something, which she scribbled on a piece of paper.        
	Apparently, it was shayari.        
	Armed with the poem  or poems  Mamata was seen appealing to the Chair with folded hands. She received permission to speak.        
	Looking pleased, the Trinamul Congress chief got up and let loose four Urdu poems, ignoring BJP members taunts that it was all a ploy to woo the Muslim voter.        
	The railway minister, who had peppered her rail budget speech with Urdu couplets, demanded a comprehensive plan for the development of the language and increased reservation for Muslims.        
	Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har tadbir se pehle/ Khuda bande se khud puchhe ke bata teri raza kya hai (make yourself so strong that before you plead for anything, God Himself asks you, tell me whats your wish), she recited.        
	She ended with the opening lines of Ram Prasad Bismils patriotic song: Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil me hai/ Dekhna hai zor kitna bazuye kaatil me hai (the desire for sacrifice is now in our hearts; lets see how much strength lies in the enemys arms).        
	This appeared directed at the CPM. On being asked, politburo member Sitaram Yechury scoffed: She read out Urdu shayari from the Bengali script. The political meaning is quite clear.

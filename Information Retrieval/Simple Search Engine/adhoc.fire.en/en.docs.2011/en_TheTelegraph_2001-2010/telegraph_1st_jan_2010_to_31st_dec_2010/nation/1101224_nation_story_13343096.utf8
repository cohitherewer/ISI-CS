  - Exam pattern changes, focus on analysis        BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                          EXAM TIME                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Students looking to study at any of the countrys 11 law universities may find it tougher to clear the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) next year, because the pattern of the questions will be changed.        
	The candidates will have to answer questions on legal reasoning and current affairs. The law universities have decided to drop questions on static general knowledge relating to history, geography and political science.        
	The candidates have already been tested on static general knowledge in their school board examinations. In CLAT, they will answer questions only on current affairs, said Prof M.P. Singh, vice-chancellor of the National University of Juridical Sciences, Calcutta, which will conduct CLAT next year.        
	He said students analytical abilities on legal matters would be tested. They may be given portions of certain court judgments and asked to analyse them and answer questions about them. There will hardly be any questions on law per se, though.        
	Students have to clear the test to gain admission for the LLB course to law universities in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Calcutta, Jodhpur, Raipur, Gandhinagar, Lucknow, Patiala, Patna and Kochi.        
	There are about 1,200 seats in these universities. Nearly 18,000 students had appeared in CLAT last year. The law universities have been holding a combined entrance test for the last four years.        
	The law universities have tied up with Indias post office network for better distribution of application forms from next year. Earlier, the forms were available at certain banks in the metro cities. Now students can get the forms at the nearest head post offices.        
	CLAT will be held on May 15, 2011, and the results will be announced within 15 days.

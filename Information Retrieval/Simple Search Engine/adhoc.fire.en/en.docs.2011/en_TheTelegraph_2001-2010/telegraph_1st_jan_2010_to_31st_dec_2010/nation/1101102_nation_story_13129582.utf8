          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Ashok Chavan    
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Congress sources believe Ashok Chavan picked the wrong line of defence in the housing scandal, and may be removed within days after veterans Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony work out a succession plan.        
	They say the high command may have temporarily kept Maharashtra out of the frame to focus on tomorrows All India Congress Committee meeting, but that does not mean the chief minister can expect a reprieve.        
	Chavan, who flew to Mumbai this morning only to return to Delhi late in the night, appears to have harmed his case by dragging the entire Congress leadership in Maharashtra into the scandal.        
	Sources say Chavans decision to throw mud at other senior leaders instead of concentrating on his own defence was a huge tactical error.        
	Nobody will appreciate it if a leader tries to tarnish the image of the party. What is the message in the stories about the involvement of the whole crop of Maharashtra Congress leaders? It creates an image crisis for the party, one leader said.        
	Chavan apparently did not want to go down without a fight, but he trampled on too many toes in his desperation and created a much bigger headache for the party.        
	Sources revealed the Congress had asked all its leaders in Maharashtra to keep quiet and not turn the controversy into a media circus.         
	The regular media appearances by Vilasrao Deshmukh and Narayan Rane have not gone down well with the central leadership.        
	Party leaders say the turn of events has deeply disturbed Mukherjee and Antony, the latter in particular because several of the issues relating to the scandal pertain to his own ministry: defence.        
	Mukherjee has said he needs more time to study the details but the feeling in the party is that an important state like Maharashtra cannot be left hanging for long.         
	While some expect a decision by November 3 or 4, others say any development must wait till President Barack Obama has finished his India trip.

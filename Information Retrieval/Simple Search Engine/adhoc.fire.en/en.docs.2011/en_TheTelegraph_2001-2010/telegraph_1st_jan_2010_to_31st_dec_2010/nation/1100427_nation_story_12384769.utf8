The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IPL czar who gave lakhs, but also slaps
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IPL czar who gave lakhs, but also slaps
  - Modis style: 18 hours of work in Jaipur, then daily flight to Mumbai at night         RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Lalit Modi with actress Sushmita Sen at the closing ceremony of the IPL in Navi Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                                        
	Jaipur, April 26: He would hand a subordinate a cheque for lakhs as a wedding gift  or slap the man if he made him angry.        
	He would work 18 hours a day in Jaipur, fly to Mumbai to sleep, and return next morning to his Rajasthan Cricket Association office.        
	In his home state where he was the cricket boss and super chief minister, Lalit Modi evokes hatred, fear, jealousy and blind loyalty.        
	His slapping sprees  he once whacked a constable for entering the VIP box at Jaipurs Sawai Man Singh Stadium  led most officials to detest him. They could do little, though, because Modi virtually ruled Rajasthan from 2005 to 2008 thanks to his childhood ties with then BJP chief minister, Vasundhara Raje.        
	The top bureaucrats escaped being slapped themselves, but only just.        
	Mahendra Surana, then secretary of the employees welfare department, had asked Modi for passes to a match at the SMS Stadium in 2007 but was refused. Somehow, he managed to get a pass from Rajes aide and minister Rajendra Singh Rathore.        
	Modi saw Surana standing at the stadium gates and tore off his pass, thinking the official had secured it from the camp of his rival Kishore Rungta, whom Modi had ousted as Rajasthan cricket chief in 2005.        
	His brashness extended even to central ministers. Sources said that when C.P. Joshi asked Modi for support in the bitter state cricket elections of December 2009, he told the Congress leader: Joshiji, politics is your field; I would not interfere in it. But let cricket remain with me. It is my passion; please do not interfere in it.        
	Sources said Modis workaholic nature, too, put off many of the ageing state cricket officials. He would work the whole day in Jaipur, fly back around 2-3am to Mumbai, and be back next day by 8am, fresh and raring to go, a source said.        
	With such high energy levels, he would never take no for an answer and that made his supporters put in their best but also evoked heartburn and fear among his rivals.        
	Among many of Rajasthans cricketers, Modis go-getter traits evoke admiration and loyalty.        
	When it came to cricket infrastructure, if you asked for Rs 2 lakh, he would give Rs 5 lakh so that people put in that extra effort. There was no room for complaints or complacency, said former cricketer Bimal Soni.        
	Modi spent about Rs 20 crore to turn the SMS Stadium into one of the countrys best.        
	Before Modi became Rajasthan cricket chief in 2005, we had just one net for practice. He brought in Greg Chappell to coach Rajasthans budding cricketers. He did not take the associations money to pay Chappell but managed through sponsors, said former Ranji Trophy player Shamsher Singh.        
	Rungta, however, said Modi developed the infrastructure not for the benefit of grassroots talent but to bring in big money and glamour.        
	All district and village tourneys winded up as soon as he took over. He is only interested in big matches and big money. No Rajasthan player has been given a chance in the Rajasthan Royals, Rungta said.        
	Many state cricket officials now criticising Modi for bringing glitz, cash and wild partying into cricket, however, once queued up for passes to IPL Nights.        
	Modi, though, has always been his own man. The 1963-born son of business baron K.K. Modi had upset his family by marrying his mothers close friend, Minal. She was 37, ten years his senior, divorced and with a daughter.        
	The family threatened to disinherit Modi but eventually relented, making him executive director in Godfrey Philips to give him a foothold in the corporate world.        
	Today, Modi owns yachts and jets and a Maltese terrier, Andy, whom he loves deeply. His son is a student of American School of Bombay and his daughter studies in Switzerland, while stepdaughter Karima is married to Dabur scion Gaurav Burman.        
	Modi has enjoyed clout outside Rajasthan too. During IPL III, he and his family were provided police security by the Maharashtra government, whose home department is in the hands of NCP leader R.R. Patil.        
	At least four policemen and 12 other security personnel (bouncers) were seen in the convoy of Modis son Ruchir, tailing the Mercedes in which the boy was travelling.         
	Police sources said some eight personnel had been deployed for the familys security. In addition, Modi employs a band of private security guards from actor Ronit Roys agency.

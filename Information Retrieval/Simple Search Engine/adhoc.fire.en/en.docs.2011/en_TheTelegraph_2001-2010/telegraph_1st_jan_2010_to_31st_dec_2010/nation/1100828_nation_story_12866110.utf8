          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The Congress leadership has disapproved of home minister P. Chidambarams use of the phrase saffron terror to describe terrorist activities of some Sangh parivar activists.         
	Branding terror in this manner is completely uncalled for, the party feels.         
	Congress general secretary and media department head Janardan Dwivedi today said terrorism has no colour; if any, it is black.         
	Saffron has its own traditional and historical importance and is not the monopoly of any party, he said. In a clear rebuff to Chidambaram, the partys chief spokesperson added: In politics, people should be careful about the use of expressions.        
	The Congress leadership is upset because such a potent political issue like the involvement of Sangh parivar members in terror activities has been diluted with the BJP grabbing the saffron word to divert attention from the real issue.        
	Dwivedi conceded this, saying: The real issue is communalism and terrorism. The word saffron created a needless controversy.         
	Congress leaders had been discussing this issue before the media in the past month but seldom described it as saffron terror.         
	Some did speak of Hindu terror initially but were cautioned as the Congress never uses the expression Muslim terror for the subversive acts of Pakistan-based outfits.         
	Senior leaders think linking religion with terrorism is wrong and helps only the communal forces.        
	Even the BJP had corrected its position before the last Lok Sabha polls and started avoiding the oft-repeated expression Islamic terror in public.        
	The Congress also understands Hindus sentimental attachment to the colour saffron. BJP leaders artfully diverted attention from the subversive activities of RSS and VHP leaders by focusing on saffrons importance.         
	Murli Manohar Joshi pointed out in the Lok Sabha that saffron was part of the national flag and was the colour sages wore, and warned of national repercussions if it was linked with terrorism.        
	He cleverly omitted any mention of the activities of those who are facing investigation.         
	With the entire debate getting derailed, the Congress wanted to nip the controversy in the bud.         
	The party has promptly distanced itself from the home ministers remark as it wants to use the issue of RSS involvement in terrorist activities as a major political weapon.

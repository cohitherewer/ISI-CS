          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, June 25: The BJP is out to score brownie points over the Congress on the dismantling of the administered price mechanism (APM) and other issues impinging on the petroleum price hike.        
	The BJP insists that although it pioneered the move to deregulate the oil sector, it had kept popular sensitivities in mind and did not implement the changes in one fell stroke, like the Congress-led UPA has done.         
	Ram Naik, the petroleum minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, explained the point. The UPA government should have come up with a pricing policy that ensures the consumer is not subject to harsh increases.         
	In 2002, when a barrel of crude oil cost $23 and the NDA government started oil sector reforms, Naik recalled that he monitored domestic prices every fortnight to ensure they were on a par with the world rates and consumers were not overburdened.         
	The fact, however, was that as crude prices shot up, the 15-day calibration was stopped and the APM dismantling was put on hold for political expediency.         
	There were voices within the BJP and the RSS that felt a populist touch was needed. Also the Congresss aam aadmi slogan began capturing peoples imagination.        
	Today, the BJP did a Congress on the Congress by batting for the common man. Spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said: We demand that consumers should not be asked to pay more either for subsiding the inefficiencies of oil PSUs or for jacking up profits of the private oil companies.

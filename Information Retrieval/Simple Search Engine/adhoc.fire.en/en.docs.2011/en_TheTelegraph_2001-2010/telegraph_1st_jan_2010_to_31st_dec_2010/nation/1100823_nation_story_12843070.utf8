	Patna, Aug. 22: A Bihar Maoist arrested in Calcutta has claimed that the rebels have launched a recruitment drive.        
	Self-proclaimed zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist), Musafir Sahni alias Alok alias Nishant, made the revelation during an hour-long interrogation in Motihari today, sources said.         
	The Maoist was brought from Calcutta to the district headquarters of East Champaran on a transit remand.        
	The sources quoted Sahni as saying the recruitment season had begun for the Maoists operating in Bihar and Jharkhand. The group is trying to spread its base in north Bihar and strengthen its base in the districts bordering Nepal.         
	An officer present during the interrogation of Sahni said the new recruits were being paid between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 a month as stipend. Besides, they get insurance cover depending on the task assigned to them, he said.        
	When the members of the Peoples Guerrilla Liberation Army (PGLA), the military wing of the banned outfit, are engaged in operations against security personnel in other states, the leaders are recruiting members in Bihar and Jharkhand, a source said.

	Bhubaneswar, May 12: A villager from Chandia died in a clash with the police in Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex in Jajpur district today.        
	Chandia is considered to be a stronghold of Visthapan Virodhi Janamanch, which is spearheading an agitation against acquisition of land for a Tata Steel plant.        
	The incident took place this morning after the displaced villagers, currently lodged at a rehabilitation centre, arrived in Chandia and forced their way into the houses despite opposition by the police deployed at the site, about 120km from here.        
	The police had to resort to lathicharge and firing rubber pellets, said Jajpur SP D.S. Kuttey said. As the mob ran scurrying for cover, Laxman Jamunda (55), who was part of the group, fell and sustained injuries after his head hit a roadside boulder. Twelve other people sustained injuries.        
	Jamunda succumbed to police bullets, insisted an activist. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, however, denied the allegation.

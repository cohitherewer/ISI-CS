          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: When in doubt, let the government handle it.        
	The Congress has adopted a cautious stand on engagement with Pakistan although it realises that talks are essential for improving ties with the neighbour.        
	Sources said the party had chosen not to persuade the government to call off next weeks proposed secretary-level talks. Instead, to play safe, it has decided not to back the decision enthusiastically.        
	Party spokespersons merely said the Centre had taken a decision in its wisdom and the Congress wouldnt oppose it.        
	We dont want to send out a message that we will continue to talk despite anti-India activities from across the border. But we realise the futility of a breakdown in communication, a party leader said.        
	Even now, we havent indicated resumption of the (stalled) composite dialogue. We only want to convince the Pakistani authorities that more was required to be done on the terror front to create a conducive atmosphere for a meaningful peace initiative.        
	Sources said while the party was being careful mainly because of the overwhelming sentiment in the country that Islamabad hadnt done enough since 26/11 to merit friendly relations, the Pune blast had made it jittery too.        
	Senior leaders admitted the Congress wanted to keep space for a reversal in its stand in case another untoward incident turned the public mood more hostile.         
	In off-the-record briefings, Congress leaders took pains to underline that not all terror outfits were in control of the Pakistani government, a clear shift from the ruling partys post-26/11 rhetoric when the claim of non-state actors had been dismissed contemptuously.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, who was the foreign minister then, went to the extent of saying in Parliament that non-state actors didnt fall from heaven.        
	Now Congress leaders say the government shouldnt fall into a trap laid by vested interests in Pakistan who dont want the peace initiatives to succeed.        
	We understand that Pakistan is reaping what it sowed. But it is also a fact that Pakistans internal dynamics has changed drastically and the terrorist groups operating from its territory have been engaged in fighting the state powers, a Congress leader said.        
	We cannot overlook the fact that Benazir Bhutto was killed by those forces and Pakistan has witnessed countless terrorist strikes in the recent past. If we dont engage with the saner elements in Pakistan and support them, the situation will get worse.

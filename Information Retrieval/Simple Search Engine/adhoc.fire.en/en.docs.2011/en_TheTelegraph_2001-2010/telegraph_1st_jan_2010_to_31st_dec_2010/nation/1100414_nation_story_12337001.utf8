The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Water protest stops Duronto
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Water protest stops Duronto
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 13: Passengers on the Calcutta-bound Duronto Express from Bangalore had to go without water for almost seven hours on Monday.        
	The train, supposed to ply non-stop, had to halt at Bhubaneswar for almost half an hour in the morning as irate passengers pulled the chain twice demanding water.        
	Once the train left Bhubaneswar, bottled water was kept outside the washrooms for the passengers.         
	Between 5am and noon, there was not a drop of water on the train. The cisterns and the wash basins were dry and there was no drinking water, said Sushmita Kar, a homemaker travelling in coach B1 with her seven-year-old son. People could not even brush their teeth in the morning, said Sabita Chatterjee, another traveller.        
	The passengers first approached the travelling ticket examiners and RPF personnel on the train requesting them to arrange for water.        
	But they pleaded helplessness saying water was not reaching the cisterns and wash basins as the system had developed some compression problems, said Chatterjee.         
	Passengers forced the train to stop at Bhubaneswar by pulling the chain and told railway officials that they would not allow the journey to resume unless water was arranged.        
	The officials threatened action against us but we did not budge. They tried to start the train but passengers brought it to a halt by pulling the chain again. The authorities were then forced to fetch water, recalled Kar.         
	The train left Bangalore at 11.15am on Sunday morning and reached Calcutta at 4pm on Monday.        
	Asked about the passengers allegation, an official of South Eastern Railway said the protest was reported from Bhubaneswar, which was under East Coast Railway.

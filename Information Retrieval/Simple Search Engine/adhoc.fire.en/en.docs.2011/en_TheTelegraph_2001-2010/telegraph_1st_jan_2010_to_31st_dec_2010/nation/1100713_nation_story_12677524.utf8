The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rail to pay for wrong penalty
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rail to pay for wrong penalty
                            
	New Delhi, July 12 (PTI): The Delhi state consumer commission has directed Northern Railway to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to a passenger, who was travelling with a wait-list ticket, for wrongfully penalising him.        
	The commission also imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 on the railway for filing a frivolous appeal against a lower forums decision.         
	The train superintendent (TSI), who initially permitted the passenger to board the train as four vacant seats were available, did not confirm the wait-list ticket and instead penalised him.        
	The passenger was forced to pay the penalty at Allahabad under threat of detention by the railway police force on the instruction of the train superintendent.         
	The commission said non-allotment of seat to the passenger, though he was the only wait-list passenger, clearly showed that the railway was guilty of misconduct.        
	The Northern Railway is vicariously liable for misconduct of TSI Ramesh Kumar and hence we find no fault with the impugned order whereby they have been directed to refund the penalty imposed upon the passenger and also to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 for the harassment and mental agony caused to him, a commission bench headed by justice B.A. Zaidi said.         
	The order came on an appeal by the railway challenging a district forums directive to pay the compensation besides refunding the imposed penalty. The railway had cited policy instructions regarding Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains to justify the penalty.         
	The commission said the passenger had taken permission from the appropriate authority to board the train.

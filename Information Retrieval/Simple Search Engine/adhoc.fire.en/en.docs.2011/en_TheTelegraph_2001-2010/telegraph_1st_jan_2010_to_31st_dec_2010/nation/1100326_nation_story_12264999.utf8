The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Written apology order to Delhi top cop
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Written apology order to Delhi top cop
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, March 25: The Delhi police chief has been asked to personally tender a written apology to a mason booked on trumped-up charges, including some under Tada, and harassed over 16 years by cops in a bribe-for-vendetta hunt.        
	Prempal Singh will also receive more than Rs 5.62 lakh in damages, Delhi High Court said today, passing a judgment being seen by legal experts as one of the most scathing indictments of the police in a harassment case. It is a case that shocks the judicial conscience, Justice S. Muralidhar said in his order.        
	The court directs the commissioner of police to send, within a period of two weeks from today, a written apology to Prempal and each of his family members for the suffering they have had to undergo at the hands of the police, Muralidhar said.         
	The order applies to the police chiefs post, though it is the incumbent, Y.S. Dadwal, who will have to give the apology.        
	Between 1991 and 2007, Prempal, a father of two and now 49, was booked in 18 cases, of which he was acquitted in 13. His wife and son were also charged in petty cases spread over a decade, spending several spells in lockups.        
	Prempal is entitled to be compensated by Delhi police for the suffering he has had to undergo on account of the illegal actions of the police in implicating him falsely and getting him wrongly arrested and incarcerated unjustifiably. There is no doubt there has been a clear-cut violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to Prempal, the judge said.        
	Prempals harassment began in 1991, when he was charged under the now-repealed Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act after he intervened in a neighbourhood brawl. Prempal had tried to stop four men from beating up a woman, informed the police and got them arrested. Two of them threatened to get even with him. Prempal was arrested under Tada days after the men were released and allegedly bribed the cops.        
	In 2002, despite acquittals in other cases, Prempal was arrested on charges in which he couldnt even hope for bail  rape of a minor. It was his acquittal in this case two years later that spurred him to fight for compensation.        
	Police slapped Prempal with false charges for an offence (rape of minor) in which it would have been next to impossible for him to obtain bail and even more difficult to avoid trial. It was fortunate that Prempal was able to establish his innocence in this case and justice prevailed. However, by this time Prempal was a man broken in spirit and in health. The illegal actions of the police have not only taken away precious years of Prempals life, which can never be retrieved, but caused irreparable damage to his reputation, the court said.         
	The compensation the police have been ordered to cough up, within four weeks, includes around Rs 5.32 lakh in damages along with a simple interest at 6 per cent per annum from May 23, 2002  the day Prempal was arrested in the rape case  till the date of payment. Another Rs 30,000 must be paid as litigation costs.        
	I was forced to spend 2,349 days (all cases) in jail (6 years, 5 month and 9 days) on various occasions and was beaten and tortured. This resulted in wasting almost 20 years of my life contesting cases at various courts, all because (a) few persons of Delhi police with Sangam Vihar Police Station, New Delhi, were inimical to me, Prempal said in his petition.        
	Describing his trauma further, he said he become like a corpse. I was physically, mentally and financially living (like a) corpse with no hopes and resources and was finding it difficult to have even a meal a day, Prempal said in his petition.

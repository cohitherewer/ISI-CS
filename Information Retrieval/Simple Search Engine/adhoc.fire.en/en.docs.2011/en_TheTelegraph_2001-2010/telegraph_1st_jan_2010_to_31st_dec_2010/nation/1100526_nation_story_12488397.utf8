          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, May 25: Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir are fighting a dozen-odd Hindu militants, according to a document prepared by police.        
	The document says four Hindu militants were among those killed in encounters with the security forces over the years, while one had surrendered and another was arrested.        
	The number may not be big but is significant given chief minister Omar Abdullahs recent statement in which he put the total number of active militants in the state between 550 and 575.        
	Some of the (Hindu) militants are listed in the A (the most dreaded) category and all are from various districts of the Jammu region. The first time any Hindu was known to have joined a militant group was in the early 1990s, a police officer said.        
	The dozen-odd surviving Hindu militants are with the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, Al Badr, Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Harkat-ul-Ansar, the officer said, adding they are active in the Jammu districts of Rajouri, Kishtwar, Doda and Reasi. The families of the Hindu militants had been ostracised by the community, the officer added.        
	However, the officer said he could not recount a single case of a Kashmiri Pandit joining the ranks of militants. Most of them (the Pandits) left the Valley in 1990. But Hindus in the Muslim-majority districts of Jammu continued to live there, came in contact with the militants and some were lured by them, he added.        
	Fame, money or power could have been the reasons. But none of these appear to have influenced Kishtwars Subhash Kumar alias Wasif. He (Wasif) is an A grade militant, the deputy district commander of HM (Hizb-ul Mujahideen). He has been active for the past five to six years, Kishtwar police chief Haseeb Mughal said.         
	Another officer, however, said Wasif had been in love with a Muslim girl and apparently wanted to impress her by picking up the gun. What we know from locals is that his relationship with the girl couldnt go forward. His love story is old now but what is obvious is that he didnt leave militancy, the officer said.        
	The police document claims that the Hindu militants operate with code names. Sham Lal, for instance, became Shamsuddin and he is with Al Badr. Krishan Lal is with the Lashkar. Kripal Singh is also with Al Badr.        
	The police said one of the longest-serving militants was a Hindu, Bipin Kumar of the Harkat-ul Ansar. Bipin, killed by the forces in 2008, had been active since 1996. Kuldeep Kumar alias Qamrain of Hizbul died at Kulhind in Doda two years ago after being active for seven years. Uttam Kumar alias Saif-ullah of the Hizbul died in an encounter in August 2005. Bittu Kumar, who was also with Hizbul, is also suspected to have been killed.         
	The only Hindu militant to surrender is Sunil Kumar. He has been absorbed into the paramilitary forces.

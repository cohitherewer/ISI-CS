The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | End of Rajneeti: Prakash 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      End of Rajneeti: Prakash 
  - Film-maker says he will not contest polls again        RASHEED KIDWAI                           (From left) Prakash Jha, Amitabh Bachchan and Nana Patekar                                        
	Bhopal, July 27: The maker of Rajneeti has had enough of politics.        
	Director Prakash Jha would love to play the piano and paint, maybe even learn to fly a plane, but insists he is off elections  for good.        
	Reservation yes, but electoral rajneeti never again. The last election was my last, he says.        
	While Rajneeti, a film that dealt with the seamy underbelly of politics, was a box-office hit, Jhas latest venture also deals with another political hot potato  Aarakshan, or reservation.        
	The director didnt reveal much about the film, which would feature Amitabh Bachchan, but said it would deal with the complications surrounding the quota-system in jobs and education.        
	Aarakshan intends to accomplish two tasks  to explore the question whether reservation has generated opportunities for the lower castes, and to shed light on all the misunderstanding that has shrouded peoples opinion, he says.         
	The shooting starts in December. Apart from Bachchan, the cast would include Ajay Devgn and Manoj Bajpai but not Nana Patekar, with whom there were rumours of a showdown during the making of Rajneeti.        
	Apparently, Jha wanted to shoot a scene in a particular way but Patekar threw a tantrum. When the director tried to reason with him, the veteran actor reportedly lost his cool. Things got worse when Patekar abruptly left for Mumbai and Jha went public, saying he would never, never work with Patekar again. It was left to the films lead actor, Ranbir Kapoor, to play peacemaker.        
	Jha, who unsuccessfully contested the 2004 and 2009 general elections, says he has had enough of electoral politics. I was never in politics per se. In 2004, I felt that Bihar needed a change. In my assessment, (current chief minister) Nitish Kumar needed the support of all right-thinking individuals.        
	The film-maker was in Bhopal to thank the dozens of artistes, production assistants, local bureaucrats and politicians for making Rajneeti a success. The blockbuster was shot mostly in the Madhya Pradesh capital.        
	Jha dedicated the film to Bhopal, its people and Madhya Pradesh as a whole.         
	The director says he prefers not to talk about his 2009 experience that saw him in the fray as Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party candidate from West Champaran.         
	He lost again, though his vote share rose from a paltry 26,000 in 2004 to 1,50,000 in 2009.        
	For me politics is about development. I wanted to assert and re-assert the point that the one who feels he can lead and make a difference, should not sit on the fence, Jha says.        
	Now, at 60, he wants to play the piano, paint and, perhaps, learn to fly a plane.        
	Before joining politics, Jha had taken a four-year sabbatical from films. He stayed in Bihar for four years, forming two organisations, Anubhooti, which trained young people from the region in filmmaking, and Samvedan, to promote small and micro industries.

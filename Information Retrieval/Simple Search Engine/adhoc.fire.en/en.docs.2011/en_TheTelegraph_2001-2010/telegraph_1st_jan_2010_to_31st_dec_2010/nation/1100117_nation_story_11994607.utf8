The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Feathers fly in KCR versus PC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Feathers fly in KCR versus PC
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Anti-Telangana activists during a protest in Delhi                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 16: KCR is locked in a do-or-die battle with Chidambaram and only one can survive.        
	If the statehood saga hasnt quite come to that, the battlelines are drawn for the famed cockfights that are a part of the Sankranti festivities in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions.        
	After a month of intense protests over the plans to carve up the state, activists of the movement for an integrated Andhra have taken a Sankranti break.         
	The festivities are marked by cockfights, gambling and merry-making in the non-Telangana regions.         
	Even MLAs, MPs and the ministers who sent in their resignations over the issue have decided to give their minds a rest and focus on the festivities.         
	Most of them are keen participants in the traditional fights of rams, bulls and cocks organised in the rural areas. And as a reminder of the battle that lies before them, some of the cocks have been named KCR, after the Telangana spearhead K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Some are even named after Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who set the cat among the pigeons last month by announcing that the process for statehood would be initiated.        
	Police warnings and threats of criminal action, since these fights fall within the ambit of cruelty towards animals, have not deterred them.         
	How can we deny such small pleasures to our voters, said Bangaru Usha Rani, Congress MLA from Palacole, who defeated film star Chiranjeevi (he won from another constituency).         
	Congress sources said Usha Ranis encouragement had brought in funds of over Rs 5 lakh this year for revelries in her constituency.         
	Police said these sports were being held in at least 35 towns of coastal Andhra, with women and children also taking part. They come in tractors and bullock carts and keep playing till late when their husbands are busy drinking and gambling, said Bapiraju, a businessman of Kakinada.        
	Cockfights are banned but villagers find them popular during Sankranti, admitted A.K. Khan, additional director-general of police.         
	In 2009, nearly 256 cocks were seized along with Rs 70 lakh in cash from their owners, who were detained. The betting on cockfights went as high as Rs 110 crore last year. The men were bailed out, but not the birds.        
	The cocks were held for almost a month in several police stations as they were prime evidence, before the courts closed the case and fined the culprits minor amounts.        
	In spite of the recession and police action, local residents say the betting would be as high as Rs 200 crore this year. Police in West and East Godavari districts have already seized nearly 1,700 cocks and arrested 500 people during the season.        
	After last years experience, we are just video-recording the cockfights and releasing the birds and also the men, said Gopalakrishna, a police inspector from Kamavarapukota in West Godavari.        
	As many as 13 varieties of cocks are bred and trained for months together to participate in the fights. They are also fed cashewnuts, worms, mushrooms, honey and wine during the training period. It costs almost Rs 80 per day to feed a fighting cock, said Subba Raju, a trainer of cocks of Bhimavaram.        
	Villages on the sea cost or forest tracts are hired for merrymaking. The cockfights of Bhimaravam also attract businessmen and politicians from neighbouring states like Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. A Karnataka minister had flown in a helicopter to one such cockfight in 2009.

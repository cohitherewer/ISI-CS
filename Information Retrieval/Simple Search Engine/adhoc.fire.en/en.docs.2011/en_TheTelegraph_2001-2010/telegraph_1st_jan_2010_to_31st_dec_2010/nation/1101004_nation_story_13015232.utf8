          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: A security official of one of the 71 teams participating in the Commonwealth Games was stopped by policemen today while he was entering a five-star hotel with a firearm on him.         
	Several Games officials are staying in the hotel.        
	The small firearm was detected in his bag during the security check and our officials immediately detained him. A preliminary probe revealed that he had come to the hotel to meet some members of the team from his country, said a Delhi police official but refused to divulge the name and the nationality of the security official.         
	The foreign security official was questioned for nearly 15 minutes and told to surrender the firearm before entering the hotel.         
	He had all the valid documents and his passport. He was let off after the questioning. He tendered an apology for carrying the firearm, saying he was not aware of such rules, said a home ministry source.         
	The source said security officials of several countries, among them New Zealand and Britain, had accompanied their teams to assess security arrangements. They are liaising with Delhi police and intelligence officials, the home official added.         
	Delhi police have issued guidelines asking people not to carry firearms, toy guns, knives, daggers, swords, scissors and items with sharp or pointed edges.         
	The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the venue of the opening ceremony, became a fortress ringed by nearly 8,000 police personnel, among them commandos. Around 30,000 policemen have been deployed to man roads leading to Games venues.         
	Snipers posted atop a nearby residential building kept an eye on the movement of people around the stadium, where over 60,000 spectators and VIPs such as Prince Charles, President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and foreign diplomats were present for the opening ceremony. The army has been kept on standby.        
	Although there is no specific threat, we are well prepared to avert any incident. We have been asked not to take any chance, said a home ministry official.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram visited the stadium for a recce. Asked if he was satisfied with the security arrangements, Chidambaram told PTI: Ask me on October 14 and I will tell you.

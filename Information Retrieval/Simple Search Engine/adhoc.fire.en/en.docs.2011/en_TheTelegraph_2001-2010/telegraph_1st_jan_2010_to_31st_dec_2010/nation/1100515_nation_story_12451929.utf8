	Siliguri, May 14: Over 2,000 tourists and local people were stranded in New Jalpaiguri station and Bagdogra airport on the first day of a rash of bandhs in the hills and plains of north Bengal today.         
	Many tourists, mainly foreigners, were caught unawares. We did not have any clue about todays strike. It seems we have to wait at least till the evening to get out of here. We are desperate to reach Sikkim by tonight because if we travel tomorrow morning, we may be stopped by the agitators, said Glen McCarthy, an Australian, who had flown in from Calcutta.         
	With hardly any vehicles plying and taxi drivers sitting around at New Jalpaiguri station or at the airport throughout the day, passengers were forced to wait for hours. After 4.30pm, some drivers agreed to bring out their vehicles.        
	Todays strike, called by the Bangla Bangla Bhasha Banchao Committee, will be followed by a two-day shutdown in the hills from tomorrow by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad has threatened to call a bandh for three more days from May 17. The Morcha has announced a 10-day strike from June 12.         
	A few visitors managed to make it to Darjeeling early in the morning. But those coming down from the hills had to face problems as their vehicles dropped them off either at Sukna on NH55 or at Salugara on NH31. They had to walk at least 5km to reach Siliguri town.

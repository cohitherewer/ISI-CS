The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UN glare on scribe killing 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UN glare on scribe killing 
                            
	United Nations, July 16 (PTI): A top UN official has said journalist Hem Chandra Pandeys death along with Maoist leader Azad in an encounter with Andhra Pradesh police early this month needs to be looked into.        
	I am concerned about the circumstances in which Hem Chandra Pandey was killed and I urge the authorities to shed full light on the conditions under which it occurred, said Irina Bokova, director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco).         
	Unesco is the only UN agency with a mandate to defend freedom of expression and press freedom.        
	Pandey, 30, who freelanced for several Hindi-language newspapers, was killed on July 2. His widow Babita has alleged a fake encounter and demanded a probe by the Centre saying she does not trust the state authorities. Human rights groups in India and civil liberty activists have also called for a central investigation.         
	The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has expressed shock and sought an inquiry. Hem Chandra Pandey, like any journalist, was well within his rights in seeking to interview an insurgent leader, IFJ Asia-Pacific director Jacqueline Park said last week.         
	The IFJ extends its solidarity to Babita Pandey and the family of the killed journalist, and welcomes the Andhra Pradesh home ministers announcement of a full inquiry, Park added.         
	The IFJ noted that Pandey was a contributor to Hindi dailies such as Nai Duniya, Rashtriya Sahara and Dainik Jagaran. A portfolio of his recent writings shows a well-informed engagement with issues of wide social concern, such as inflation, food security and climate change. Nowhere does it reveal an advocacy of violence, the IFJ said.

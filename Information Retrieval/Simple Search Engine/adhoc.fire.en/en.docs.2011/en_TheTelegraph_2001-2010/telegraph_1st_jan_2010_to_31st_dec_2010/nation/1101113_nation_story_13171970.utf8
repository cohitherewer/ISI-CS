The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya whets smaller parties appetite
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jaya whets smaller parties appetite
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                              Jaylatithaa and Ajit Singh      
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Jayalalithaas offer to the UPA has left many smaller parties eyeing their chance.        
	Among them are the unattached Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is neither with the NDA nor with the UPA, and the partially attached Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal (Secular), which support the ruling alliance from outside.        
	They are all waiting for the DMKs next move, wondering if it might withdraw its ministers and offer outside support or pull out altogether if the Prime Minister sacks telecom minister A. Raja.        
	Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Dal (Secular) have privately indicated willingness to be part of a non-NDA, non-UPA bloc being envisaged by Jayalalithaa, who hopes the Congress would forget its past disillusionment and accept her as an ally in place of M. Karunanidhi.        
	RLD sources said Ajit had signalled his intent to be part of a broader secular alliance when he broke away from his 2009 Lok Sabha ally, the BJP. They said he met Jayalalithaa every six months and spoke quite often to her but wouldnt confirm if they had exchanged notes on the current happenings.        
	Our leader believes that Tamil Nadu will determine how things pan out, but he also knows two things, an RLD source said.        
	One, we have done business with the Congress in the past and the memories are not particularly bitter. Two, the BJP is not in a position to offer an alternative if this government, by any chance, falls short of a majority. The Congress remains in a commanding position at the Centre and will be the natural gravitational force for prospective allies, us included.        
	The Dal (Secular) has similar views. A party source said the priority of H.D. Deve Gowda and his son H.D. Kumaraswamy was to dislodge the BJP government in Karnataka. A stronger presence in the Centre can facilitate the process.        
	The AIADMK, RLD and the Dal (Secular) together have 17 Lok Sabha members, one short of the DMKs 18. But that gap can be filled by the lone member from Jayalalithaa ally MDMK.        
	Political observers, however, say that aligning with this group of disparate region-specific parties, each pursuing interests tied up with state politics, could be a recipe for disaster.        
	Ajit, they argue, may unveil an elaborate wish list ranging from plum ministerial berths in Delhi to sops for his Jat constituency in western Uttar Pradesh.        
	Congress sources too say that Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh would not have forgotten the ignominy Atal Bihari Vajpayee had suffered in 1999 when a pullout by Jayalalithaa cost him his government.        
	AIADMK sources, however, sought to allay fears about their leader, saying that her long stint out of power had taught her the virtues of reasonableness and accommodation.        
	If she indeed became an ally in Delhi, they claimed, she would be focused entirely on the Tamil Nadu elections and be less preoccupied with wangling benefits in Delhi.        
	The Samajwadis appear to feel this is their best chance to fill the gap, should one be created. We have done business with the Congress and we have the best of equations with the Prime Minister. He is still beholden to us for bailing his government out after the Left withdrew support over the nuclear deal, a Samajwadi source said.        
	Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav told The Telegraph he did not want to bargain under any condition, but sources said his MPs believed it made more sense to join a government and gain something than back it from outside and get nothing.        
	At least, it will stem our decline in Uttar Pradesh, a source close to Mulayam said.        
	Between the Samajwadi Partys cup and lip stands Rahul Gandhi and his vision for the Congress in Indias premier political state.        
	If the Samajwadis are to become a UPA constituent, our plans to go it alone in Uttar Pradesh will go for a toss. Our workers will again get mixed signals, an MP from the state said.

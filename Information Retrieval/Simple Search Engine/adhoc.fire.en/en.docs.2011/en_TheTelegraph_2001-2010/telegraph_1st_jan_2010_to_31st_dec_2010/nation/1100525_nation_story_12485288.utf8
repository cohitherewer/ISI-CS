The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Swastik, as old as the storm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Swastik, as old as the storm
                                          
	Manipur (North 24-Parganas), May 24: Aila will turn one tomorrow, so will Swastik Munda (in picture with mother Manashi).         
	The family decided not to name the baby  born the day Aila struck the Sunderbans  after the cyclone, despite suggestions such as Pralay (deluge) or Toofan (storm).         
	They chose Swastik. I want a happy life for my son, said Sriram with Swastik sitting on his lap at Manipur Colony Para in Sandeshkhali II, about 90km from Calcutta.         
	Pagol Munda, one of Srirams neighbours, said: Our lives changed after Aila. Our families were forced to live under extreme conditions but this little boy was always happy and playful. He enlivened our spirits whenever we looked at him and that gave us the strength to survive.        
	On the night of May 24 last year, Manashi started suffering labour pain. Sriram set off with her for Paschim Manipur Upaswasthya Kendra, about 15km from their home. We had to trek 15 feet down from the high ground and walk 500 metres across a barren field before another steep trek to the road, said Manashi. The journey took three hours. It was drizzling when we had left home but then it turned into a downpour. By the time we reached the health centre, she (Manashi) was almost unconscious. It was 6am then. I will never forget that night, Sriram said.         
	On May 25, doctors told Sriram his wife was fine. He rushed back to Manipur to save his daughter, his aged parents and the familys livestock.         
	Around 9.45am, when the embankment on the Raimangal gave way and water rushed into Manipur and several other villages, Swastik was born at the health centre.

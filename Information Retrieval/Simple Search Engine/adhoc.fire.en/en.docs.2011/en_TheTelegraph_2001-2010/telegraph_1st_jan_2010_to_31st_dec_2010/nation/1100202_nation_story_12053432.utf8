          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A damaged house in Kandhamal                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 1: Claiming that the 2008 communal riot victims were still living in fear and without proper livelihood, a delegation from Kandhamal today met Governor M.C. Bhandare and sought early restoration of peace and speedy justice.        
	Even today after 17 months of the communal riots, the victims are still living in an atmosphere of insecurity and terror without any adequate livelihood support system, said Keshamati Pradhan, who led the delegation.        
	Though the government has closed all relief camps claiming that the situation in Kandhamal is peaceful and normal, the victims are still not in a position to return to their villages, construct damaged houses and avail due compensation, said Pradhan.        
	The victims are leading a miserable life with fear of death without social security and government relief. They are forced to stay in their self-managed temporary tents and shelters. The victims have been compelled to suspend 40 per cent of their agricultural activities due to constant social unrest and disturbances, she added.        
	Alleging that a large number of complaints was yet to be converted into formal FIRs and even in the justice delivery system, criminals were getting acquitted due to weakness in investigation and prosecution, the delegation stressed on the need of protection for the complainants and witnesses.        
	The real criminals, who masterminded the violence, had not been arrested and were moving scot-free, said the delegation members.        
	The delegation, while seeking the governors intervention, urged for conduct of inquiry through a special agency and speeding up of justice delivery system through a special court as applicable for disturbed area and publication of a white paper on Kandhamal violence.

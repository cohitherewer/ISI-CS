	Bhubaneswar, April 27: Red and green flags dotted the city instead of people and cars today during the dawn-to-dusk bandh called by non-Congress and non-BJP parties in protest against price rise.        
	Normal life was hit across the state with bandh supporters reaching out to all and sundry to ensure its success.        
	Morning protests began with activists burning tyres to block national and state highways at several places. Buses, trucks, taxis and autorickshaws which attempted to run were intercepted and returned. Passengers trying to ply two-wheelers to offices were also asked to go back.        
	Slogan-shouting activists also pulled down shutters of a few outlets that tried to open for sometime. Shops, business establishments, banks and commercial outfits remained closed during the bandh. Protesters held banners and picketed before central government offices, post offices, banks and PSUs, including Nalco, preventing staff from entering the offices.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said: The bandh, supported by the people, has been successful and peaceful.         
	Senior BJD leader Pyari Mohan Mohapatra claimed that the bandh was a complete success. People have expressed spontaneous support to the bandh call given by the non-Congress and non-BJP parties in protest against price rise, he said.        
	On the other hand, former Union minister and state Congress working president Chandrasekahr Sahu described the bandh call as cheap political gimmick rejected by the people.        
	In Orissa, seven non-Congress and non BJP parties, including the BJD, Left, RJD and JMM, had supported the bandh.        
	Several trains, including the Bhubaneswar-Secunderabad Visakha Express, Howrah-Koraput Sambaleswari Express, Howrah-Ahmedabad Express, Hyderabad-Howrah Faluknama Express and Bhubaneswer-New Delhi Rajdhani Express were stranded for some time at the Bhubaneswar station, as the bandh supporters squatted on the tracks.        
	The bandh hit bus services, too, with vehicles being parked at Baramunda till late evening. The shutdown compounded the woes of people in southern Orissa where the economic blockade called by the Maoists entered the fourth day today. Impact of bandh was felt in Cuttack, Rourkela, Sambalpur, Puri, Bolangir, Berhampur, Balasore, Baripada and Khurda, too. At Jeypore, 40 activists were arrested while trying to enter the All India Radio office.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren nod to BJP govt, for now
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Soren nod to BJP govt, for now
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, May 8: The Jharkhand impasse appeared to end this morning with the JMM and Ajsu accepting a BJP-led government, but Shibu Soren later floated the balloon of rotational chief ministership, prompting a BJP rebuttal.        
	Soren, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha boss and outgoing chief minister, claimed before journalists that his party and the BJP would run the government by rotation. The BJP, which had earlier rejected the proposal, reaffirmed it would not accept Sorens formula.        
	Earlier, at a morning meeting, BJP president Nitin Gadkari had told Sorens son Hemant and All Jharkhand Students Union boss Subodh Mahato that if they persisted with their demands, the BJP would sacrifice power and settle for Presidents rule.         
	Sources said Hemant and Mahato accepted the BJPs terms because Presidents rule would have given the Congress a free run in the state.         
	However, Soren later told reporters the BJP would form a government for the time being after he stepped down in a day or two. He said the chief ministers chair would be shared by the JMM and the BJP for the rest of the term.        
	The BJP parliamentary board will decide in Delhi on Monday who will be the new chief minister. In due course, we will finalise our formula for sharing of berths in the state cabinet, Soren said.        
	BJP sources said the chief ministers post would most probably go to an MLA and not an MP. This would mean that Lok Sabha members Yashwant Sinha and Arjun Munda, whose names had been doing the rounds, are out of contention.        
	The names of current deputy chief minister Raghubar Das and state health minister Neelkanth Munda, both from the BJP, were circulating today.         
	The BJP is also said to be eyeing the post of Speaker and two more ministry berths.         
	In Ranchi, state welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari, however, said the JMM would get the Speakers post, which is now held by the BJPs C.P. Singh.

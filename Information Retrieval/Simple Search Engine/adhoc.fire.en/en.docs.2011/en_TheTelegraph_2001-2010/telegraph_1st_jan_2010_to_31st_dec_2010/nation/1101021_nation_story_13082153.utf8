          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Several Calcutta properties seized by the government after the 1962 war could be returned to the legal heirs of their Chinese-origin owners if a bill cleared by the Union cabinet today becomes law and certain conditions are met.         
	The Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Second Bill, 2010, which proposes to amend the Enemy Property Act 1968, will be introduced in Parliaments winter session that begins on November 9.         
	It will cover 80 properties seized under the Defence of India Rules of 1962 after their Chinese-origin owners migrated or were deported, and 2,168 highly prized properties declared enemy property through the 1968 law after their owners migrated to Pakistan following the 1965 war.         
	Of the 80 properties, 15 owned by people of Chinese origin are in Calcutta, most of them in Tangra.         
	Under the 1968 law, the Centre is the keeper of all enemy properties which it manages through the Custodian of Enemy Properties. On July 2, 2010, it brought an ordinance to scuttle attempts by legal heirs of the owners to reclaim the properties through court cases. However, several Muslim MPs opposed this and pleaded that legal heirs be allowed to hold the properties.         
	The amendment bill seeks to return the properties of those persons that were taken away through the July 2 ordinance but also blocks any future claims in courts. It bars courts from passing orders to divest enemy property. The Centre alone can divest the property, it says.         
	The central government is authorised to direct the custodian to sell or dispose of enemy properties in such manner as may be prescribed, a press release issued by the home ministry said. It also said that the enemy property could be divested only to the owner or his lawful heir.         
	The amendment says transactions made before July 2, 2010, that conform to the Enemy Property Acts Section 18 will have legal sanction. If any property had been returned to the owner or his lawful heir by a court order and if the lawful heir is a citizen of India by birth, the property will stay with that person.         
	Any other transaction before July 2 which has not followed these procedures will stand cancelled.         
	While the Centre will honour court orders passed till July 2, henceforth courts will not have jurisdiction over adjudging cases on divesting of enemy property, the bill says. The court, however, can rule on whether a property is enemy property or not.         
	Any transfer or claim of transfer of enemy property made through oral will or oral gift or without permission of the competent authority will not be recognised, the bill says.         
	Once passed, the law will come into force with retrospective effect.         
	The biggest beneficiary could be the Raja of Mahmoodabad M.A. Mohammad Khan, who is expected to get control of his fathers properties in Uttar Pradesh thought to be worth around Rs 20,000 crore. The Supreme Court had in 2005 ruled in Khans favour.         
	The 2,168 properties of migrants who left for Pakistan are spread across Uttar Pradesh, which has the largest chunk, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar.         
	Most of the 80 properties of Chinese-origin owners, taken over through 58 notifications issued in 1963, are in Calcutta, Darjeeling and Shillong. Some are also in Makum, Silchar and Tinsukia in Assam, two in Siliguri and one in New Delhi.         
	In Shillong, these include several restaurants like Globe, New World, Shin Sheng and Chang Hwa. In Darjeeling district, the properties are spread across Kalimpong and Darjeeling towns located on Laden La Road, N.B. Singh Road and Hill Cart Road. Many are listed as shoe and bag shops.         
	In Assam, the list includes Lu Hing Yuan Saw Mills Company in Tinsukia. Assam had a small population of Chinese-origin people who had come to work in the tea gardens in the mid 19th century.         
	Makam, a book in Bengali by Rita Chaudhary published earlier this year, talks about how many of these Chinese families from Makum, a small town in Upper Assams tea cultivation area, were first taken to Deoli in Rajasthan and later deported to China during the 1962 war and their properties seized. The government had feared that the Chinese-origin people might spy against India.         
	The government had tried to bring these amendments in the last session, but faced opposition from the BJP. There is no change in the content of the bill, home minister P. Chidambaram said after the cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, approved the bill today.         
	The BJP is likely to oppose the amendments in Parliament again as it believes properties of people who had migrated to Pakistan should not be handed to any heirs.

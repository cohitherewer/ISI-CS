	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Everybody wants to see Carla Bruni, but one group of people whom Bruni wants to see in Delhi are less excited than puzzled.        
	Anjali Gopalan of the Naz Foundation is wondering why Bruni wants to visit her centre on December 6, when exactly she would be coming (the French embassy hasnt clarified that) and how Bruni heard of the NGO, which works in the field of HIV/AIDS.        
	She wouldnt be requesting Bruni for any aid: These people usually dont give anything.        
	Bruni, though, is known for her hands-on involvement with groups working with HIV patients. Her brother, photographer Virginio Bruni-Tedeschi, died of AIDS-related illness in 2006, at age 46.         
	Gopalan said she would introduce Bruni to the 29 HIV-positive children living at the centre but no photo session with them would be allowed. It may jeopardise their further education.

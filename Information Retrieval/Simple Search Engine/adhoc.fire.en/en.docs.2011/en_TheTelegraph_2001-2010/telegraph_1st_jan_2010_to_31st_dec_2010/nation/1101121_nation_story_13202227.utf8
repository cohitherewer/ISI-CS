          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 20: An Andhra police recruitment test has been postponed after threats of unrest by pro-Telangana campaigners, two months after the K. Rosaiah government watched the activists disrupt a similar exam.        
	The decision to put off the December 18-19 test for sub-inspectors comes a day after violence by Telangana supporters at Osmania University here, but it also triggered counter-demonstrations on campuses opposed to the statehood demand.        
	The Telangana protests have increased ahead of the Srikrishna committee report expected next month. The panel is examining the statehood demand.        
	State home minister P. Sabita Indra Reddy announced the postponement and gave the impression that it could be indefinite when she said the written exams would be held only after peace is restored in the state.         
	Two months ago, the Telangana campaigners had stormed some venues where an Andhra Pradesh Service Commission exam was being held.        
	The postponement of the exam prompted statehood spearhead Telangana Rashtra Samiti to withdraw its call for a Telangana shutdown today.         
	At Andhra University in Visakhapatnam, the joint action committee , the umbrella group of campaigners against statehood, dubbed the exam deferment as an instance of the government buckling under political blackmail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court rejects Shah claim, extends probe
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court rejects Shah claim, extends probe
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Supreme Court today granted the CBI three more months to complete its probe into the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case.         
	It also rejected former Gujarat junior home minister Amit Shahs claim that false cases were being foisted on him as part of a conspiracy hatched at the highest political level to demolish the Gujarat government and the chief minister.         
	The apex court also shrugged off an attempt by Shahs counsel Ram Jethmalani to question its July 12 order to the CBI to probe the case by pointing fingers at one of the judges on the bench  Justice Tarun Chatterjee.         
	Justice Chatterjee was under a CBI probe himself when he referred this case to the CBI, Jethmalani said.         
	But Justice Aftab Alam, who was part of that bench, and heard the matter today alongside Justice R.M. Lodha, dismissed it saying he was hurt by the allegation.         
	 The anticipatory bail plea of Shah, chargesheeted by the CBI in the case, had been rejected and he had been remanded in judicial custody.         
	The agency had also submitted a status report on the progress of the investigation to the court and sought an extension to complete the probe. Although the CBI sought six months to finish the task, it got only three months.         
	However, the agency virtually got a go-ahead to probe another encounter death, that of Tulsiram Prajapati, who was witness to the abduction of Sohrabuddin and his wife Kausar Bi. The court said if Prajapatis case formed an integral part of the larger conspiracy in the Sohrabuddin case, the agency could probe it.        
	Jethmalani said: I have evidence to show that a conspiracy was hatched at the highest level of politics that the Gujarat government must be demolished and by involving Modi (chief minister Narendra Modi) and the home minister (of state) in false cases.        
	Adopting the BJPs political line, Jethmalani argued that his client was not opposed to further interrogation but not by the CBI, which had completely misbehaved throughout. He claimed that the agency never sought to interrogate Shah from January to July before filing the chargesheet, but questioned him only after filing it.         
	He then raised a technical plea that once a chargesheet was filed, the Supreme Court could no longer monitor the case. Then the trial court takes over, he argued. Even that was shot down. The court said: We are trying to get to the bottom of a fake encounter.

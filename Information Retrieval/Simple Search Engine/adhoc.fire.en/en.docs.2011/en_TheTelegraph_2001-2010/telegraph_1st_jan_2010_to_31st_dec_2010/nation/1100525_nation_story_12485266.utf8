The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP pulls out of Soren govt
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP pulls out of Soren govt
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                           Shibu Soren                                  
	Ranchi, May 24: A frustrated BJP today withdrew support to the Shibu Soren-led Jharkhand government, reducing it to a minority.         
	Around noon, a 45-member delegation led by BJP state president Raghubar Das and national general secretary Arjun Munda submitted a letter to governor M..H. Farook formally withdrawing support. Farook told them to get the letter signed by all the 18 party legislators.         
	The governor then summoned Soren at 5.30pm to Raj Bhavan and asked him to prove his majority in the House within a week.         
	Soren, who went to meet Farook accompanied by son Hemant and nine JMM MLAs, refused to speak to waiting journalists.        
	Sorens deadline to quit was May 25 and he had said that a decision on government formation would be taken on May 23. But yesterday, the BJP sought an appointment with the governor to withdraw support.         
	The BJP and the JMM have 18 MLAs each in the 82-member Assembly. The Sudesh Mahto-led All Jharkhand Students Union (Ajsu) has five members and the Janata Dal (United) two. The two parties were also the JMMs allies. The Dal (United), too, has asked its MLAs, one of them a minister, to withdraw support.         
	Although no party has spoken of supporting Soren, back-channel discussions are on between the JMM and the Congress, sources said.        
	Babulal Marandi, whose Jharkhand Vikas Morcha is a Congress ally, had yesterday said he was not interested in forming a government as it would inevitably involve horse-trading. But speaking to The Telegraph today, Marandi said: We are strongly opposed to Presidents rule and fresh elections at this juncture. However, we are willing to take the initiative (to form a government) only if its led by our party. Horse-trading and black-mailing by ministers and ruling allies will not be tolerated.        
	Ajsu chief Mahto held his cards close to his chest. We will clear our stand after a meeting of our MLAs, he said.         
	The BJP blamed the Congress, not Soren, for plunging the state into political instability. The Congress has been tirelessly trying to destabilise the government, luring several JMM MLAs to Delhi and Calcutta, alleged Das, and said the BJP would continue to work among the people for the development of the state. The Congress had destabilised the BJP-led government in 2006 and installed a government led by Independent MLA Madhu Koda, who is now cooling his heels in jail, he said.         
	Asked why he had spared Soren, whose refusal to quit as chief minister had led to the crisis, Das claimed the Congress move to woo JMM MLAs prompted Soren to issue absurd statements.         
	Asked if there was a possibility of the BJP and the JMM coming together again, Das said: All possibilities remain open in politics.

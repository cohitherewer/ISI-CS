The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Suspended IAS in harassment plea
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Suspended IAS in harassment plea
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, July 27: An IAS officer who once took on the Jayalalithaa regime for graft has complained to a central panel that he was being harassed by the chief ministers family and the Maran brothers for opposing their allegedly corrupt moves.         
	C. Umashankar, a Dalit official credited with making Karunanidhis home district Thiruvarur the first e-district in the country, has written to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes citing instances that led to his transfers and his suspension recently. He has also sought security for his family.        
	Umashankar, 46, became a favourite with Karunanidhi after exposing the Jayalalithaa governments scams.         
	In 2006, when the DMK came to power, he was made the managing director of state-run Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (ELCOT) that is responsible for procurement of television and wireless sets for a state free scheme. Karunanidhis third wife, Rajathi, then allegedly told him to sanction a contract for 45,000 wireless sets in the name of a person she recommended.         
	Umashankar turned down the request and told her all purchases had to be made through e-tenders.         
	The IAS officer said he also started probing the disappearance of certain assets of ELCOT and zeroed in on purportedly fraudulent activities of Thiagaraja Chettiar, the chairman of another state-run company.         
	As a result, he was transferred to Arasu Cable TV Corporation in 2009, he claimed. Umashankar wrote: The order of transfer was passed adverse to public interest and to help Thiagaraja Chettiar. It is perceived that M.K. Alagiri, Union minister (and Karunanidhis elder son), was responsible for my abrupt transfer from ELCOT.         
	While working in Arasu Cable, a state-owned multiple system operator, Umashankar suggested that the government should seek penal action against Dayanidhi and Kalanidhi Maran as officials from their cable channel, Sumangali Cable Vision, were apparently destroying optical fibres laid by Arasu Cable. The Maran brothers are grandnephews of Karunanidhi.        
	He was shunted out, this time to the department of small savings  an ex-cadre post. An ex-cadre post is one that lapses if not regularised within five years.         
	On July 21 this year, the government suspended Umashankar saying he had wrongfully declared he was an SC during his recruitment when he was actually a Christian. Umashankar said he became a Christian only in July 2008, hence his recruitment could not be questioned. He claimed he was suspended because he challenged in Madras High Court a vigilance inquiry against him.        
	I live only on the salary I receive from the government, but I live honestly and peacefully, Umashankar said.        
	Dayanidhi Maran could not be reached for comment.

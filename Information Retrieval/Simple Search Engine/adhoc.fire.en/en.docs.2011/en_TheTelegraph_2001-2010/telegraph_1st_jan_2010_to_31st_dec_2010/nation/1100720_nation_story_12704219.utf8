                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Unbearable politics of relief

	Suri, July 19: Accident victim Enamul Haq was almost thrown off his hospital bed by crowds jostling to glimpse a visiting VIP.        
	The Big Three political parties opened assistance booths and bullied passengers relatives, many of whom knew no Bengali, to accept help from them rather than their rivals.        
	Doctors cited a British-era rule to stop post-mortems after sundown even as scores of traumatised relatives of the dead waited for the bodies to be handed over.        
	The tragedy-struck passengers and their bewildered families, mostly from Bihar and Jharkhand, took a backseat today at Suri Sadar Hospital, where most of the dead and injured had been brought from Sainthia.        
	This is the worst day of my life. I have lost my brother in the accident but the nightmare at this hospital has made it much worse. Most of us went through hell here, said Gulab Nabi, 40, a bidi worker from Suti, Murshidabad, whose brother Mantaz Ali had boarded the Vananchal Express from Pakur in Bihar.                  
	Amid the filthy surroundings and media glare, hundreds of curious onlookers crowded the hospital grounds as the convoys of Mamata Banerjee, Asim Dasgupta and MP Shatabdi Roy whizzed in and out of the three gates.        
	Im in great pain; I need rest. When people were scuffling to glimpse one of the VIPs, some of them almost pushed me off my bed, said Haq, 34, a mason from Pakur who has multiple fractures and a head injury.        
	Khwaja Ghulam Rasool Khan, 22, from Pakur was left shaken by the noisy assistance booths opened inside the hospital complex by CPM student arm SFI, Trinamul Congress and the Congress.        
	So much pushing and shoving was going on. Everyone was speaking in Bengali, which I dont follow. I was confused and helpless, said Khan, whose father Ataur Rehman, 48, a bidi worker, died in the accident.        
	The police stood and watched. There was no effort to stop outsiders from entering; no checks on the random parking on the premises that made it difficult for the ambulances to move, Khan said.         
	When Mamata arrived, a scuffle broke out between her security and Trinamul workers. The railway minister left the hospital after the crowd almost knocked 12-year-old Ashraful Haq, admitted with a head injury, out of his bed.        
	Outsiders must not be allowed to enter and disturb the patients and their families. There is so much confusion here, Mamata said on her way out.        
	Bengal finance minister Dasgupta, who arrived heading a team of Left Front ministers, told The Telegraph: Given the situation, I am satisfied with the facilities the hospital is providing. There will be crowds in such situations. I have instructed the superintendent of police (Birbhum) to politely cordon off the hospital.        
	Local MP Shatabdi Roy of Trinamul dropped by and left soon after, covering her face with a handkerchief because of the stench from the morgue.        
	The evening witnessed a virtual agitation outside the morgue with doctors refusing to continue with autopsies. The rules say there cant be post-mortem after dark but an exception has to be made in such cases. I have told the doctors to carry on under lights, said disaster management minister Srikumar Mukherjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Triveni in air, Green Hunt on ground
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Triveni in air, Green Hunt on ground
          SUJAN DUTTA                                  1949-2010: six festering decades, no arbiters             
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Operation Triveni is the code name for the Indian Air Forces aerial support to the disputed counter-Maoist Green Hunt offensive on the ground.        
	Triveni is another name for the Sangam near Allahabad where the sacred Ganga, Yamuna and the mythological Saraswati meet.         
	The rationale for christening the counter-Maoist aerial support operation Triveni has not been explained. But it is probably inspired by the location of the Central Air Command that is in Allahabad.         
	The air command and the Central Army Command keep tabs on the counter-Maoist offensive.        
	Four helicopters from the Western Air Command, which is the most active of the IAFs commands  its area of responsibility covers almost the entire border with Pakistan and part of the China border  have been redeployed to the Central Air Command for Triveni. The Western Air Command is headquartered in New Delhi.        
	Operation Triveni also makes the Central Air Command an active theatre like the western command and Eastern Air Command that is headquartered in Shillong.        
	The codification of the IAFs counter-Maoist operation means that the force has created a separate budget for sorties that it flies to support central and state forces in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bengal.        
	The air forces operations have run into controversies already. The IAF complains that the paramilitary forces on the ground have not secured helipads fully for its Mi-17 helicopters. The CRPF has on one occasion alleged that IAF pilots refused to fly after Maoists killed their men at Narainpur in Chhattisgarh in July.        
	Under the rules of engagement for Operation Triveni, the IAFs helicopters are equipped with side-mounted medium machineguns and are escorted by Garud commandos whose main task is to protect the IAF assets. The IAF has permission to fire in self-defence if fired at. But it is not authorised to use rockets and ground-attack weapons as yet.        
	In Operation Triveni, the IAF is tasked mostly for troops movement and casualty evacuation.        
	The IAF has also recalled its helicopters from Africa where they were deployed for a UN mission in Congo.         
	The IAFs helicopter resources are stretched, senior commanders admit.        
	Under Operation Triveni, co-ordinated by a group captain, IAF helicopters have so far flown 955 sorties, moved 6,282 troops and 95 tonnes of equipment.

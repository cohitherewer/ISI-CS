The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amid applause, a voice of caution   Verdict on CBI probe incorrect: Counsel

   Verdict on CBI probe incorrect: Counsel 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Jurists and lawyers shrugged off concerns that todays ruling by the Supreme Court would undermine the role of states in ensuring law and order, a state subject.        
	Only one, senior counsel Rajeev Dhavan, termed the verdict entirely incorrect.        
	Policing is a state subject, he said. It is unimaginable that now the high courts and the Supreme Court will violate the countrys federal structure and the statute.        
	But former law minister Shanti Bhushan said courts always had the power to probe anybody. Even an ordinary magistrate can order a probe by a non-officer if he feels that police, probably on account of state influence, are not doing a good job. Why should states think that the CBI will do its job dishonestly?        
	Ultimately, if its done dishonestly, they can go to the court. After all, trial will be by a judge, the evidence weighed by a court.        
	Senior lawyer C.S. Vaidyanathan said the judgment was in tune with the times. Criminals, he added, did not respect state boundaries.        
	In cases where there were allegations of favouring those in power, there was a need to instil confidence in the probe process, he said. If the local police machinery were not insulated from political influence, it would strike at the root of democratic governance.        
	As a solution to this eternal problem, he added, the government should separate the law and order, policing and prosecution wings.        
	Law and order puts police in touch with politicians, he pointed out. In such circumstances, they could hardly be expected to probe the role of an accused politician in an impartial way.         
	Constitutional expert Anil B. Divan said the ruling was in consonance with the courts inherent powers to do justice. In a case such as the fodder scam in Bihar, in which the chief minister is the main accused, how do you expect the police to do an impartial investigation?        
	If courts were not free to direct a CBI or an independent probe into such cases, there would be no rule of law in any state, only rule of the political executive and vendetta, he added.        
	Congress spokesperson and lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the judgment delicately and comprehensively balanced public interest.        
	But Dhavan struck a discordant note, saying the Supreme Court itself had held in many cases that even while doing complete justice, it cannot violate the law.         
	The Delhi Police Special Establishment Act, 1946, he said, made it clear that state consent was required before a CBI probe could be ordered in a case of an offence committed within that states territory.         
	Referring to the disproportionate assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav  assigned by the apex court to the CBI for a probe  he said: The CBI in this case tailored its report depending on whether Mulayam was in the good books of the party at the Centre or not. To that extent theres an element of unreliability in the CBI.        
	Dhavan said it would be better if high courts monitored cases where there was pressure on the police. If the Supreme Court can monitor investigations into the hawala scam, theres no reason why high courts cannot monitor an SIT (special investigation team).         
	Vaidyanathan said the ruling would unravel fine if the CBI did not report back to the government except when it required sanction to prosecute anyone.  
	Over the head

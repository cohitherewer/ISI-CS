  - ...and the sting          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Union health ministry today pledged to start a co-ordinated city-wide war on mosquitoes after Delhi reported over 1,000 cases of dengue just a month before the scheduled opening for the Commonwealth Games.         
	Health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who had called a meeting of city agencies in the morning,said a massive clean-up exercise would begin on Monday, but added that the subtype of dengue circulating this year caused only mild illness.         
	Public health experts have linked the dengue epidemic in the capital to the bountiful rain, coupled with construction activity ahead of the Commonwealth Games that has created puddles of freshwater  the ideal breeding grounds for the Aedes egypti mosquitoes that spread dengue virus through their bite.         
	Azad said municipal authorities had been asked to fill up all freshwater accumulation zones and distribute larvicidal tablets to resident welfare associations for use in homes and open water tanks.         
	Health authorities in Delhi had till September 1 registered 1,014 cases of dengue, although private hospitals say the actual number is much higher because many patients do not get tested.         
	Azad said studies on the virus had shown that it is subtype 1 that causes only mild illness.         
	We are not seeing dengue haemmorhagic fever, a senior health official added.         
	Public health specialists have said that city health authorities should have anticipated the epidemic several weeks ago, given the level of construction activities and forecasts of heavy rainfall.         
	Azad said city residents also had a role in preventing mosquito breeding. I have a tumbler of water at home where our dogs drink, Azad said. This tumbler is usually filled with water. Each night, after reaching home, I tip it over to empty the water, he said.

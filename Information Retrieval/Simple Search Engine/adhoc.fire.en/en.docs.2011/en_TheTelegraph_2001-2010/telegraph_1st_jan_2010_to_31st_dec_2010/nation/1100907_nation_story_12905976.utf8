	Patna, Sept. 6: Maoists today freed three Bihar policemen near a holy place atop a hill but not far from the spot where one of their colleagues body was dumped by the guerrillas on Friday.        
	Among the three whose eight-day ordeal ended this morning was Abhay Kumar Yadav, who virtually returned from the dead after his picture appeared in newspapers and on television screens across the country last week when the Maoists claimed that he had been executed.         
	The three policemen, taken hostage on August 29 during an encounter, were released just before dawn at Sringirishi, a holy place in Lakhisarai district.         
	Abhay, Rupesh Kumar and Md Ahsan Khan, all from the 10th battalion of Bihar Military Police, were released unconditionally and were in good health.         
	The trio, who were dragged from one hamlet to another across the inaccessible Kajra hills that has been surrounded by security forcers, were freed near Simra Rari, 165km from Patna, around 4am.         
	The place of their release was less than four kilometres from the spot where the body of their colleague Lucas Tete was found last week.        
	The release brought relief to chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was under intense pressure to secure the freedom of the hostages. Finally, it is over now and we are happy for that, Nitish said.        
	He, however, had a word of caution. But nobody can say that this is the last time. Such things can happen again, especially with the elections round the corner, the chief minister said.        
	Nitish stressed that no deal was struck to secure the release of the policemen. The Maoists had demanded the release of eight jailed colleagues in exchange for the freedom of the policemen.        
	The police claimed the Maoists were forced to release their captives as they had been surrounded.         
	The rebels, however, said they released the policemen on humanitarian grounds, a claim Opposition leader Lalu Prasad agreed with.         
	The police said they had learnt of the hostages release after intercepting Maoist messages.         
	Lakhisarai superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar Mishra said seven persons had been picked up since late last night. Unconfirmed reports said one of those arrested was K. Koda, a rebel commander.        
	The hostages said they had not been informed of their impending freedom. We were asked by the armed men to follow them from late night. Around 4am, they left us on top of the hills where Sringirishi dham is located. We had to walk not less than 7km. Our hands and mouths were tied but after they left, we managed to free ourselves and started climbing down, said sub-inspector Abhay Yadav.         
	All the three men were tight-lipped but after repeated requests, Abhay said though they had a terrible experience, the Maoists did not torture them. They used to give us food three times but we were not allowed to talk to each other. They frequently changed our locations from one village to another located in highly inaccessible regions, Abhay recalled.         
	The three released policemen did not know about Tetes execution until after their release. A few days ago, we saw the Maoists taking away Lucas. They told us that because of some security reason, they were shifting Lucas to some other place, said Rupesh.        
	Police sources said the three policemen had more or less identified Pintu Yadav, the Maoist commander arrested on Saturday, as one of the men who had led away Tete.

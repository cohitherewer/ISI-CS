The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren resigns late at night
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Soren resigns late at night
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, May 30: Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren resigned tonight, unable to garner support for his minority government after the May 24 pullout by the BJP.        
	The resignation capped 33 days of political uncertainty in the state and kicked off efforts for a realignment of political forces to avoid Presidents rule.        
	After Soren handed in his papers at the Raj Bhavan, governor M..H. Farook asked him to act as caretaker chief minister till an alternative arrangement had been worked out.        
	Farook can either invite the largest single party or the largest alliance to stake claim to form a new government. Sudhir Tripathi, principal secretary to the governor, said a decision was possible tomorrow.        
	Sorens human resource minister, Hemlal Murmu, indicated that the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha was ready to join hands with any side if it meant being a part of the next government. We are not in a hurry and will decide whether we want to be part of the next government, he said.        
	The drama began at 8.45pm when Tripathi received a call from the chief ministers office seeking an appointment for Soren at 10pm. The chief minister and his entourage arrived sharp at 10.        
	Wearing kurta-pyjamas and black leather shoes, Soren put in his papers in the presence of an army of reporters, his principal secretary Sukhdev Singh, a host of MLAs from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and ally All Jharkhand Students Union (Ajsu), and Independents Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh.        
	We had appealed to all (that is, the BJP and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Congress combine) to come forward and form a government with our help. But we did not receive any positive response from anyone, said Sorens deputy chief minister, Sudesh Mahto.        
	Soren was escorted back to his sport utility vehicle by his party workers and MLAs, and left the Raj Bhavan without making a statement. It was left to his ministers Mahto and Murmu to face the journalists.        
	Murmu said the party had decided to call it quits because there was no way out. But we are against Presidents rule and a mid-term election, he said.        
	The Soren government had been formed on December 30 with the support of the BJP-Janata Dal (United) and Ajsu.        
	The political crisis in the state began after Soren, MP from Dumka, voted against the cut motion moved by the BJP in the Lok Sabha on April 27. The BJPs parliamentary board decided to withdraw support to the Soren government the next day, but the move was withheld amid speculation that the BJP could led the next government with support from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha -Ajsu alliance.        
	However, the BJP failed to decide on a chief minister acceptable to all in the tribal-dominated state. All this while, Soren and his son Hemant kept issuing confusing signals about Sorens readiness to step aside for the BJP. Eventually, the BJP withdrew support.

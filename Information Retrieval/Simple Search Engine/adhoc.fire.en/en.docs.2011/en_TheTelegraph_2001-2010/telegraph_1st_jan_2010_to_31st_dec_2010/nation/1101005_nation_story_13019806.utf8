The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dumped your partner? Pay palimony
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dumped your partner? Pay palimony
  - Court for contract to protect deserted live-in pal          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: If you have deserted your pal (partner), pay palimony, the Supreme Court said today, strongly advocating the need to develop such a concept in India.        
	Hearing a case involving a couple from Tamil Nadu, a bench of Justices Markandey Katju and T.S. Thakur asked: Why should we not develop such a concept in our country?        
	A California court had developed the concept in the Marvin versus Marvin case, involving American actor Lee Marvin and his partner. His partner of several years took him to court seeking rehabilitation payments after the relationship was over.        
	Although she sought half of the property earned during the relationship, she was awarded only a fixed amount that was later set aside by an appellate court.        
	In the 1976 case, the California court ruled that a woman in a non-marital relationship was not entitled to any benefits under family law but she was entitled to palimony.        
	While provisions of the Family Law Act do not govern distribution of property acquired during a non-marital relationship, the courts should enforce express contracts between cohabitants except when it was explicitly founded on the consideration of meretricious sexual services, the California court said.        
	In the absence of an express contract, the court should inquire into the conduct of parties to determine whether that demonstrates an implied contract, agreement of partnership or joint venture, or some other tacit understanding between parties, it said.         
	In the Tamil Nadu case, one D. Patchaiammal claimed that D. Velusamy had married her on September 19, 1986, and dumped her soon after. She then approached the family court, seeking maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC.        
	The family court awarded her Rs 500 per month. But the man challenged the order in the high court and then in the Supreme Court. He claimed he had a legally wedded first wife who was still living. He had married in 1981 and had a daughter from the marriage, his counsel said.        
	Therefore, he could not have validly married another woman in 1986. Since the second marriage was invalid, she had no maintenance rights, he argued.        
	But the court said: You have taken her youth and then deserted her. Why shouldnt you pay palimony?        
	Why shouldnt we presume an oral contract? Justice Katju wondered. In such cases, the woman need not have statutory rights under the law, but she could have contractual rights, he emphasised.        
	A contract could be presumed from either an oral agreement or by conduct of parties (prolonged cohabitation), he said.         
	Since the lady was not represented in court, the bench directed senior counsel Jayant Bhushan to represent her interests and explore whether she could be granted palimony. Such a right under American law is called a Marvin right.        
	In another recent case, another bench of the court had suggested that every deserted woman  whether wife or another dependent woman  should have the right to maintenance lest she be reduced to vagrancy.

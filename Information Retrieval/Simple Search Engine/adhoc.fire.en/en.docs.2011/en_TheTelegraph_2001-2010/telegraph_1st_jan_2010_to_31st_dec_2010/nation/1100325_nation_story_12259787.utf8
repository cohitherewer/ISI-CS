                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi warms up for date with riot probe team
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Ahmedabad/Mumbai, March 24: Narendra Modi is set to make an appearance before the Supreme Court-monitored special investigation team on the Gujarat riots on March 27 or any other mutually acceptable date.         
	Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, among the battery of legal eagles advising Modi, today confirmed that the Gujarat chief minister was willing to appear before the SIT on March 27 or any other day, but prior to that he would like a clarification with regard to a related case pending in the Supreme Court.         
	The SIT has asked Modi to appear before it in connection with the Gulbarg Housing Society carnage of February 28, 2002, in which Congress leader Ahsan Jafri was killed along with 68 others, many of whose bodies were never recovered as they had been burnt beyond recognition.         
	The SIT was asked by the Supreme Court to look into a complaint filed by Zakia Jafri, widow of the leader, in which she named Modi as the first accused in her husbands murder.        
	The SIT has to report to the Supreme Court by April 30 on Zakias complaint. Of the 63 people named, most have already been questioned by the SIT.         
	On March 11, the SIT, headed by former CBI chief R.K. Raghavan, said it had asked the chief minister to appear before it for questioning on March 21, a date which Modi disputed, saying it was a lie planted by vested interests.        
	The Telegraph has learnt that the SIT had asked Modi to appear before it in the week beginning March 21.        
	Advocate Jethmalani today said Modi had written a letter to Raghavan, pointing out that the Supreme Court was scheduled to hear a petition seeking to recall its earlier order referring Zakias complaint to the SIT. The plea is scheduled to be heard in the week beginning April 5.         
	The petition was filed by Kalubhai Maliwad, a former legislator of the BJP who was named with Modi and 61 others in Zakias complaint.        
	Moreover, Teesta Setalvad and other NGOs have also challenged the composition of the SIT. Modi has said that propriety demands that unless these pending matters are resolved, it may not be appropriate to call him. He (Modi) said if the SIT still wants to go ahead, he is willing to appear before it on March 27 or any other day it wishes to, Jethmalani said.         
	Asked if the SIT had responded to the letter, Jethmalani said: No, it hasnt. The letter was sent either on Monday or Tuesday.        
	Raghavan could not be reached for comment. He, however, told PTI that it (the missive) is a privilege communication between the SIT and the witness (Modi) and he could not comment on it.         
	The Gujarat government continued to be cautious. Home minister Amit Shah said the date and time of Modis appearance had not been fixed as yet.         
	Asked whether the chief minister would appear before March 27, a staff member at the chief ministers office said: As of now, we have not decided.        
	Legal experts said Modi, who is also being advised by BJP leader and legal luminary Arun Jaitley, cannot avoid appearing before the SIT since it has all the powers of an investigative agency under the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973.        
	The chief minister, sources said, is likely to comply with the summons since he would prefer to be seen as a responsible, law-abiding citizen who welcomes the investigation instead of running shy of it.

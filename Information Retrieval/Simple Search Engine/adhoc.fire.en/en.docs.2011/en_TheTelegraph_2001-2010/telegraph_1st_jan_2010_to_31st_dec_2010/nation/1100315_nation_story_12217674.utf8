          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, March 14: The simmering rivalry between Kashmirs hardline and moderate separatists today spilled over to the streets.        
	A convoy of the pro-independence Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) was attacked by alleged activists of Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani with stones and daggers in north Kashmirs Sopore.         
	The incident sparked fears that group clashes involving militants, common in the Valley at the start of the insurgency in the early 1990s, may have returned.        
	Several JKLF activists were injured, but group chairman Yasin Malik escaped unhurt. They were returning from Sopores Chinkipora after handing over Rs 9.4 lakh in relief money to the families whose houses were damaged in a fierce encounter between security forces and militants recently when they were waylaid.        
	In the evening, a JKLF spokesperson blamed goons owing allegiance to Geelanis organisation for the attack.         
	The spokesman said six JKLF activists were injured, one of them critically. Mohammad Dilawar suffered several stab wounds on his neck. Five other people also sustained injuries in the incident, he said.        
	Malik escaped as he was in one of the vehicles at the front of the convoy and had driven off when the attack began, the spokesperson said, adding the hooligans were shouting pro-Geelani slogans.         
	Peer Saifullah, a leader of the Geelani faction, denied its activists were involved in the attack.        
	Grenade hit        
	One CRPF jawan died and four were injured today after militants lobbed grenades at their vehicle parked outside a police station in Srinagar. This was the third attack on security forces in the city in a week.

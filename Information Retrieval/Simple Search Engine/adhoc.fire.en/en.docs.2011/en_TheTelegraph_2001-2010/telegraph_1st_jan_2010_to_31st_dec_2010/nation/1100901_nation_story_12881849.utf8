The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Made for each other, at KV
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Made for each other, at KV
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: Walk down the classroom, then walk down the aisle.        
	The Kendriya Vidayalyas (KV), having made a mark with quality schooling, have now started match-making for their teaching and non-teaching staff by introducing a matrimonial link on their website.        
	The results have been instant. Satish Kumar Yadav, a teacher in one KV in Haryana who was among the first lot of candidates to post their bio-data, said he had already received a response.         
	The KVS had sent a circular last month asking for personal details from staff who are looking for spouses. I had given my information and I have got a response. She is a teacher under the KVs and negotiations are under way, Yadav said.        
	The countrys largest chain of Centre-run schools has nearly 1,000 institutions, with around 50,000 teachers. There is no precise data on the unmarried among them, but the move is being held up as a welfare initiative.        
	We started the matrimonial link on our website just a fortnight back. The purpose is to help unmarried staff looking for partners. But our role is limited to putting out the details. The candidates will take the process forward, Shachi Kant, deputy commissioner (training) at the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan headquarters here, told The Telegraph.        
	The website at present lists nine candidates with their contact details and other personal information.         
	Some of the candidates are yet to get a response but they are hopeful their effort will not go in vain.        
	For Sanjay Kumar, the website seems to be the best bet. For me, this is an ideal forum to look for a life partner. As such, finding a match is difficult for me since I am over 30 years of age and have been staying away from home. I am hopeful that I will get my partner here, said the librarian at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Kerala.        
	If Kumar does succeed in his partner hunt and glides into wedded bliss, he will have a lot to thank another chain of Centre-run schools for. The Navodaya Vidayalya Samiti, which runs nearly 550 schools, started such a facility four years ago.         
	At the moment, the Navodaya matrimonial site has bio-datas of nearly 200 staff members.

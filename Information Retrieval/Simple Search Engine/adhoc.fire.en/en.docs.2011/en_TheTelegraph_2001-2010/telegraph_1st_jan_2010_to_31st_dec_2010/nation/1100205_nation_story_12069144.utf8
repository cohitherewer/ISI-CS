The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minority groups end silence on Simi ban
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minority groups end silence on Simi ban
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: Several Muslim groups have come together to question for the first time the ban on Simi, the student group blamed by the government for involvement in anti-national activities in the country.        
	The initiative has come three days before the ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India expires on February 7.        
	It is for the first time that the community has shown the courage to come out in the open to protest against the ban on Simi. Though this should have been done much earlier, we are happy that we could gather the courage at least now, said Zafarul Islam Khan of Milli Council, one of the groups involved in the campaign along with organisations like the Jamiat Ulema and the Jamaat Islami-e-Hind.        
	So far, no Muslim organisation except the Jamaat Islami-e-Hind had publicly sympathised with Simi since it was first banned in 2001.        
	 The ban, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, had come in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the US. The government said Simi was involved in anti-national and terrorist acts. The outfit was outlawed again in 2003 and 2006.        
	The last time Simi  formed in April 1977 as the youth wing of the Jamaat Islami-e-Hind  had been banned was on February 8, 2008. A tribunal headed by Delhi High Court had stayed the order on August 6, but the next day the Centre had moved the Supreme Court, which stayed the tribunals order.        
	The Muslim organisations have already held a conference in Delhi and have decided to hold more across the country to put pressure on the government, fearing it might extend the ban.        
	Minority leaders say Simi is the only banned outfit that has moved court against the decision to outlaw it. None of the other banned organisations like the Maoists have gone to court. Simi did it because it believes in the Indian constitution, said Maulana Arshad Farooqi, who heads the Markazi Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.        
	We admit that Simi had an element of fanaticism in it, said Milli Councils Zafarul Khan. But that does not make it a terrorist group. If fanaticism is a criterion, then organisations like the RSS and the Bajrang Dal, should have been banned.         
	The minority groups have submitted memorandums to the Prime Minister and the home minister, urging them to lift the ban. They also plan to meet Sonia Gandhi, hoping that the Congresss new-found love for minorities will encourage her to take a favourable stand.

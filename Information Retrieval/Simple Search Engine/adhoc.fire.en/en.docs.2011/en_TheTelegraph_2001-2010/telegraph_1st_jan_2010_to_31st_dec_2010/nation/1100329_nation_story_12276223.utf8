          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 28: The militarys Strategic Forces Command began exercising its missile regiments, test- firing the 700km-range Agni I today within a day of testing the 250km-range Prithvi II and the ship-launched Dhanush.        
	The Strategic Forces Command functions under the Nuclear Command Authority that is headed by the Prime Minister.        
	The tests are examining the mutual coordination among the missile regiments under the Strategic Forces Command, a defence ministry source said today, explaining the simultaneous tests.        
	The Agni I tested today was launched from the Integrated Test Range at Wheeler Island, about 100km off the Orissa coast, shortly after 1pm by a missile regiment of the army. Senior officials of the defence ministry and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were present.         
	The short-range ballistic missile met all parameters, a DRDO officer said.         
	The Strategic Forces Command was validating a specialised navigation system of the Agni I that ensures that it strikes within metres of the target, the official said.        
	The army fired the single-stage missile from a launcher that moves on railway tracks (rail-mobile). The Agni I is capable of carrying a payload (warhead) of 1,000kg. DRDO officials said it was capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, just as the Prithvi II and the Dhanush. For todays test, the Agni I had a dummy warhead.        
	This month has seen the missile regiments being reinforced. Last week, the army signed a contract totalling over Rs 8,000 crore to raise two regiments of the Brahmos Mark II supersonic cruise missile.

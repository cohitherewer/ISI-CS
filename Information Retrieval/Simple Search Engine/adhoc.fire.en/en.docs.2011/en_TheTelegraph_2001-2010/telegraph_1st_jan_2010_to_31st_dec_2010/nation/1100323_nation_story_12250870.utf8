	 New Delhi, March 22: India will send a team of legal experts and National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigators to the US by mid-April to interrogate David Coleman Headley.           
	Government sources today claimed to have received a communication from the US justice department, asking the home ministry to be ready to send a team to the US to interrogate Headley, an accused in the 26/11 Mumbai attack case. The sources said the home ministry was in the process of forming a team of four to 10 members with the help of the law ministry.                  
	 Melbourne (PTI): An Indian-born American doctor, who had allegedly botched up operations causing the death of three patients and was extradited to Australia, today pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges at a Brisbane court. More than 160 witnesses are expected to testify in the 10-week hearing. Patel has faced complaints about his competence since the early 80s. In 1984, he was placed on probation for three years by New York health officials for failing to examine patients before operations. He was also banned from conducting liver and pancreatic surgery at a hospital.                  
	 Chennai (PTI): A satellite phone, switched on during the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to Chennai, caused a scare for security agencies, police said. However, it was later traced to three Israeli girl tourists.                  
	 New York (PTI): Sothebys will auction this week a portrait of Guru Nanak and a selection of 19th century miniatures collected by Indias first governor general Warren Hastings besides paintings by M.F. Husain, S.H. Raza and Manjit Bawa.

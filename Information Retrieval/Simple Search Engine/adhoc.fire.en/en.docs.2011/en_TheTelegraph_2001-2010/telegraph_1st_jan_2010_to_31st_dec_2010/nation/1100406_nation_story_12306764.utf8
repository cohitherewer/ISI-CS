          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The site where a minibus carrying SOG jawans was blown up in Orissas Koraput on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 5: The state government today began a probe to determine whether there was any security lapse that led to the death of 11 policemen in a landmine blast triggered by rebels in Maoist-hit Koraput district yesterday.        
	We have asked the Koraput SP to probe whether there was any violation of standard operating procedures by the elite special operation group personnel, state home secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said here today.        
	The home secretary said yesterdays incident was suspected to be the handiwork of CPI(Maoist) opposing Operation Greenhunt.        
	Today, bodies of two missing Special Operations Group (SOG) jawans  Chandrakant Pradhan and Bibhisan Sahu  were recovered from the blast site.        
	Five battalions of Border Security Force have already arrived in Koraput district, a hotbed of Left-wing extremists, for carrying out the special anti-Maoist operation. Earlier, four CRPF battalions had been deployed in the region to counter the rebels.         
	Meanwhile, there have been allegations that standard operating procedures were ignored during the movement of a contingent of the elite anti-Naxalite force, SOG.         
	Standard operating procedures dictate that forces should not move in large numbers in vehicles through Maoist-affected areas. In yesterdays case, this rule was clearly violated, leading to such a large number of casualties, alleged Padmanava Behera, the president of Orissa Police Constable and Havildar Association. No precaution was taken by senior policemen although such incidents have been taking place repeatedly, he lamented.        
	The standard operating procedures were apparently not followed in this case. We are probing to know what prompted them to travel in one vehicle, said Prakash Mishra, the director of intelligence, Orissa police.        
	Former DGP S.N. Tiwari said movement of forces in buses should have been avoided. Around 72 SOG personnel were travelling in three minibuses to Baipariguda to clear felled trees when the landmine blast took place yesterday.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 14: The Rengali Jala Andolan (RJA) has pointed out that acquisition of agricultural lands in the command area of the Rengali right canal for power projects will defeat the purpose of the project to irrigate 1.22 lakh hectares in Cuttack, Dhenkanal and Angul districts.        
	This observation comes after reports suggested that the government had cleared four independent power projects in the command area and acquisition of private land for them was underway. We find no rationale for acquiring rural land for power projects in the command area of Rengali Irrigation Project as the state has already taken loans from the World Bank to complete 79km of the right canal and is negotiating with Japan International Co-operation Agency for additional loan, said RJA action committee convener Ram Narayan Mohanty.        
	The RJA, which is spearheading a movement for completion of the right bank canal that has been languishing even after more than three decades, had organised a protest march from Sunshine Ground to the collectorate in Cuttack on March 10.         
	Nearly 500 farmers from Athagarh, Badamba and Narsinghpur areas in the region and adjoining Dhenkanal and Angul districts took part in the rally on March 10 and submitted a memorandum for completion of the Rengali right canal and water through it to their farm lands, said RJA action committee co-convener Damodar Rout.        
	Rengali dam was constructed across Brahmani River 70km from Angul in 1985.         
	A barrage having free catchment area of 4,780sqkm to store the flood releases from the dam was constructed 35km downstream under the Rengali Irrigation Project that started in 1980-81.         
	Construction of the Rengali left bank canal with irrigation potential of 1.14 lakh hectares in Keonjhar, Jajpur, Dhenkanal and Angul districts is more than half way through. But work on the right bank canal had not taken off over these years.         
	Official sources said as part of acquisition of land in the command areas of Rengali right bank, substantial patches of private land had been handed over for a 1,000-MW power plant at Kamalanga in Dhenkanal.         
	While notification had been issued for acquisition of 1,014 acres for a power plant at Badabandha, 1,002 acres and 882 acres for another two at Khadaprasad and Neulapali in the same district.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Over a decade after the Supreme Court laid down guidelines to protect women from sexual harassment in the workplace, the Union cabinet today cleared a bill much wider in ambit, covering students, consumers and patients.         
	The Protection of Women against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Bill, 2010, could be introduced in Parliament as early as the winter session that begins on November 9.         
	Under the bill, employers with more than 10 workers could lose their licence to operate or have to pay Rs 50,000 in fine if they dont have a complaints committee to deal with sexual harassment. The bill will include all enterprises  private or public, organised or unorganised.         
	The proposed law will apply even to establishments with less than 10 employees, but their complaints will be directed to a local complaints committee at the district level.         
	The bill sticks with the court-mandated definition of sexual harassment, which includes any physical contact, advances, demand or request for sexual favour, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography and any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal contact of sexual nature.         
	One improvement is the bill recognises the promise or threat to a womans employment prospects or creation of hostile work environment as sexual harassment and expressly seeks to prohibit such acts.         
	In a first, students will be covered by the proposed law that will protect not only women who are employed but also women who enter a workplace as client, customer, apprentice, day labourer or in ad hoc capacity. So, students and research scholars in colleges and patients in hospitals will be covered.         
	Statutory bodies such as the Medical Council of India and the Bar Council of India come under the bills ambit.         
	A complainant can seek transfer, go on leave or seek the transfer of her harasser while the inquiry is on. She will not be named or her name publicised.         
	The internal complaints committee will be headed by a woman employed at a senior level and include at least two employees and one representative of an NGO or an association committed to the cause of women. At least half the total members will be women.         
	The inquiry has to be completed within 90 days. The aggrieved party can then appeal to the appropriate authority or move court. A woman can also sue for damages or file a criminal case if she is dissatisfied with the action taken.         
	If the bill becomes law, the harasser can get any punishment the committee thinks fit but a second-time offender will get double the punishment initially awarded. It could range from fine, demotion, suspension, transfer or termination to a criminal case.         
	The woman can also demand an apology or compensation. The proposed law will include some form of deterrence against false complaints.         
	The proposed bill, if enacted, will ensure that women are protected against sexual harassment at all workplaces, be it public or private. This will contribute to realisation of their right to gender equality, life and liberty and equality in working conditions everywhere. The sense of security at the workplace will improve womens participation in work, resulting in their economic empowerment and inclusive growth, a government release said.         
	The Supreme Court had on August 13, 1997, laid down guidelines, widely known as the Vishakha guidelines, which stand in for law in the absence of a law on the subject.

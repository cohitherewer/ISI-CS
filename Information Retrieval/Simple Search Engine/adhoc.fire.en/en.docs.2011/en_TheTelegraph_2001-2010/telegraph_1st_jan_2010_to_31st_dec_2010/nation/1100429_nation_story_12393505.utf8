The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Speed or make-up, she was at home
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Speed or make-up, she was at home
                                          
	Islamabad, April 28: She dressed with care, but drove with abandon.        
	When Madhuri Gupta stepped on the accelerator while driving to India, she didnt think about speed.        
	I did the Lahore motorway in three-and-a-half hours, she would tell friends.        
	The motorway is over 360km long, which means she drove at over 100kmph. And she drove alone.        
	Most Indian diplomats travel in groups or with their families on such drives to the Indian border.        
	But for someone addicted to speed, Gupta was careful when it came to make-up and what she wore.        
	I bought this in Lajpat Nagar on my last trip to India, the 53-year-old, arrested in Delhi on Sunday on charges of allegedly spying for Pakistan, said when friends recently praised her stylish new coat.        
	She was ambitious, too, and was hoping for a plum diplomatic posting in either London or Washington.        
	I should get London or Washington, a confident Gupta had told PTI a few months back.        
	Gupta had earlier served in the Indian mission in Baghdad and said she was looking forward to another good posting sometime later this year.        
	She made friends easily and was comfortable with small talk. She could talk about clothes, hairstyles or Pakistans Urdu press  where the real news was  with equal ease.        
	English newspapers are boring. They always pick up news a day late. If you want to read real news, real gossip, read Urdu newspapers, she told a PTI correspondent once.        
	Gupta learnt Urdu in Delhi shortly before she was posted to Pakistan in late 2007. She had then hired a Muslim woman as a private tutor.        
	She taught me from scratch, said Gupta, who had earlier learnt another foreign language at Jawaharlal Nehru Universitys school of languages.        
	Gupta spoke perfect Urdu and could have easily passed off as a Pakistani because of her accent.         
	If Guptas tales about her galloping speedometer sometimes came across as brash, the small Indian community of diplomats and staff at the high commission in Islamabad also banked on her for getting them firecrackers or Holi colours from her trips across the border.        
	I will get natural colours, they wont harm your skin, she once told a reluctant few who didnt want to play with colours before a planned Holi celebration.        
	On a picnic to the picturesque Pir Sohawa viewpoint overlooking Islamabad, she decided to be spokeswoman for a group of Indian ladies when a Pakistani woman entered their bus to ask if they had a cassette of bhajans.        
	While most of the Indian women were wondering how the Pakistani had figured out they were Indians, Gupta dealt with her politely but firmly, ensuring that she got off the vehicle.        
	You give us your address and we will send you a cassette, Gupta told the woman, taking her address.        
	When she returned from her last trip to India, she told friends: I am so tired. There is so much to do when you are in India. There is no time to relax. I feel I am back home now.        
	She was quick to note the expression on her friends faces following her remark. Home is where you live, she laughed. Good or bad, this is home.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

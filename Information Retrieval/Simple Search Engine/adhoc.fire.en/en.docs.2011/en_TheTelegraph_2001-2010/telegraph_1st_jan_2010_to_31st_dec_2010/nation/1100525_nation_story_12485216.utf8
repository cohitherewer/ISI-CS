                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP-Left chorus on Singh evasions 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 24: The BJP and the Left today came out with similar reactions to the Prime Ministers news conference, accusing him of evading and deflecting questions more than addressing key issues.        
	The Prime Minister decided not to answer questions but to deflect and evade them. He decided to talk but not to speak, said the BJPs Arun Jaitley.        
	CPI boss A.B. Bardhan said: The Prime Minister disappointed us. He evaded and covered up more than he answered (questions) on core issues. The media too failed to ask probing questions.        
	Both the BJP and the Left charged Manmohan Singh with failing to contain inflation and alleged he was giving false assurances to the country. This nation cannot live on false hope, Jaitley said referring to Singhs hope that inflation would come down to 5-6 per cent by December.        
	How will general inflation come down to 5-6 per cent when food inflation is at 20 per cent? The government can do it only by statistical jugglery, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.        
	The BJP and the Left also alleged that Singh had avoided a clear reply on the Maoist problem. The Prime Minister cannot afford to look the other way when he feels that Maoists are a danger to Indias sovereignty, Jaitley said.        
	Yechury referred to Mamata Banerjee and spoke of differences within the government on the Maoists. The Prime Minister is not taking any concrete step to save his government, he said.        
	Both the Left and the BJP accused the Prime Minister of shielding corrupt cabinet colleagues. Yechury referred to the spectrum scandals shadow over telecom minister A. Raja.        
	The CPIs Bardhan compared UPA II unfavourably with UPA I, to which the Left had provided outside support for four years. UPA I had a direction but UPA II is completely directionless. Cabinet ministers are pursuing their individual agendas and the government is working for the big business houses, he said.

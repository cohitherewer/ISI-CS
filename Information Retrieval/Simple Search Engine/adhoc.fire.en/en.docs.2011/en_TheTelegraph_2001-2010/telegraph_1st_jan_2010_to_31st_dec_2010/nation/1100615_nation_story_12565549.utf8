The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ban on lewd child shows
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ban on lewd child shows
  - Rights panel upset over scantily clad kids         G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                    
	Hyderabad, June 14: The Andhra Pradesh rights panel today banned six reality shows that featured scantily clad young girls in dance or vamp queen contests, saying they violated the childrens rights even if their parents consent was taken.         
	The children dont know what they are doing and how they are being used. Parents have no right to compel their children as child rights are part of human rights, the human rights commission said.        
	Police have asked the Telugu channels that featured these shows to take them off the air till the commission holds a public debate on the issue on July 3.        
	On that day, the rights panel will hear out the channels and the child contestants parents  who support these shows  and the NGOs that had moved the commission in April against these vulgar and obscene programmes.        
	The NGOs say some 120 children aged between 8 and 14  mostly girls  have been pushed by their parents into performing in these shows.        
	They say that one of these shows, which aims to select a vamp queen from among young girls, drew 340 initial entries after offering Rs 1 lakh for the winner and a chance to dance with item girls of Telugu cinema.        
	The physical and psychological growth of children continue till 18 years of age and such reality shows are having a bad effect on their growth, commission chairman Justice Subhashan Reddy said.        
	A team of six parents opposed the ban, arguing before the commission that the reality shows were harmless talent hunts that could open up a bright future in show business for their children.        
	Their affidavit alleged that some rival TV channels and NGOs were defaming us and spoiling the chances of a bright future for our kids.        
	Dont you feel uncomfortable with the way your children have been dressed up for the shows? Reddy countered.        
	He asked the police to prohibit the telecast of these shows  or any similar programmes on any channel under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995 and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986.        
	Reddy also suggested the government should frame guidelines for TV reality shows.        
	A spokesperson for the TV channels said the campaign against these shows was just a ploy by rival channels to defame the programmes.        
	Since the past two years, these shows have been on display not only in Telugu but all Indian languages, including Hindi, and there has not been a single complaint of vulgarity or obscenity, he said. He claimed that all the participating children were above 12.        
	There is no culture or even talent involved in these reality shows where such young girls have to dance to hot numbers from Telugu films, said Ramesh Kumar of Jana Vijnana Vedika, one of the NGOs that had moved the commission. Its painful to see the parents clapping when their kids make lewd dance moves on highly elevated and brightly lit platforms, another activist said.

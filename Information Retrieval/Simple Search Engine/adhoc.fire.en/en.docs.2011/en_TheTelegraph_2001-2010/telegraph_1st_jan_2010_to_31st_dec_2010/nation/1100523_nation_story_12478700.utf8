          SANJAY MANDAL                                          
	Calcutta, May 22: An 8,300-foot-long stretch without a runway-end safety area (Resa) offers little room for error. Mangalore airport did not have the Resa.        
	The Resa is a paved extension of the runway not meant for regular runs. But in case a plane overshoots, the safety area can provide a cushion.         
	The Resa is around 1,000 feet from the end of the runway.        
	But there is no such buffer space at Mangalore airport, which is surrounded by deep gorges, said a senior Air India pilot who has made more than 50 landings at the airport. While landing here, the pilot must be on full alert, he said.        
	Be alert, be precise and be accurate: these are the mantras pilots chant before making landings at tabletop strips such as the one at Mangalore airport, well aware that even a small slip could turn fatal.        
	One must have a good judgement to make a landing approach at Mangalore airport, especially during the visual segment (the time during landing when the pilot can no longer depend on instrument landing system aids and sees the runway touchdown point) of the landing process. Precision and caution are the key things for a safe landing at an airport where the margin of error is very less, said Captain Sarvesh Gupta, a senior instructor pilot with Jet Airways. Gupta, who is based in Calcutta, has made several landings at Mangalore airport, which sits on a plateau.        
	The entire stretch of the runway should be visible before landing there, a pilot said.        
	In longer runways like those in Calcutta, even if one misses the touchdown point, there is enough length inside the runway to stop. But this is not so at Mangalore. Here, if there is an iota of doubt, the pilot should discontinue landing and go around for a fresh approach, Gupta said. For any type of aircraft, the touchdown point is around 1,000 to 1,300 feet from the threshold, the point from where the runway starts.        
	Matters turn more precarious during bad weather with strong tailwind, poor visibility and wet runway conditions. A combination of all these factors can cause an overshoot like todays disaster, said another pilot based in Calcutta.         
	Only experienced pilots, with special training, are allowed to operate flights at airports like Mangalore, Lengpui in Mizoram, or Paro in Bhutan.         
	Lengpui is also a tabletop runway. Adding to the difficulty is the airport being surrounded by hilly terrain. The alignment of the runway is towards the hill, making it more difficult to land, said a pilot.         
	A pilot said that at airports like that in Calcutta, an aircraft can overshoot the touchdown point by 3,000 feet and still be able to stop within the runway edge, although ideally one should land at the touchdown point. However, in airports where there is no buffer space, overshooting by even 500 feet can be critical, said a pilot.        
	The pilots said landing at Mangalore airport was more difficult four years ago. An older runway was only 5,500 feet. But in 2006, another runway was built with a length of 8,000 feet. The disaster took place on the new runway.

	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Bengals unified command overseeing anti-Maoist operations will continue without a retired major general despite the Centres recommendations that such an ex-army officer be part of the cell.        
	We are not in a military rule. It (the presence of such an officer) is not of urgent need, chief secretary Samar Ghosh, who heads the unified command, said today when asked whether the appointment would be made anytime soon.        
	The Centre decided to set up such commands in the Maoist-infested Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh at a meeting of chief ministers with the Prime Minister on July 14.         
	Following the meeting, the Union home ministry had laid down that the commands will be headed by chief secretaries, with the retired major general helping in strategising.         
	The Centre had proposed retired major generals P.C. Panjikar and E.K. Kachchekan for Bengal, after which the state government sought former army chief Shankar Roy Chowdhurys opinion.         
	Ray Chowdhury pointed out that neither of the two had sufficient experience in counter-insurgency. Hence, they could not be appointed as a member of the command, Ghosh said.        
	Ray Chowdhury recommended P. Sanyal, saying he had extensive experience in counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast and Punjab. But Sanyal could not be included as he had retired below the rank of major general.         
	If there is need for consultation, we will seek the help of Ray Chowdhury and Sanyal, said Ghosh.

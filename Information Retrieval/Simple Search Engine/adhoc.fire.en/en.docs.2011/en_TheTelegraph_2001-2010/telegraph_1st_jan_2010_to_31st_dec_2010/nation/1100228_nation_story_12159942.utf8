          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 27: Orissa High Court has quashed the disciplinary proceedings and punishments imposed thereof against Ananga Kumar Mohapatra, one of the three teachers accused in the sensational Richa Mishra suicide case.        
	Richa, a 19-year-old undergraduate commerce student of BJB (autonomous) College in Bhubaneswar, committed suicide on November 18, 2005, leaving behind a note. It had alleged that she had deliberately been awarded less marks because she had refused to join private tuition of faculty members  Mohapatra, Sahadev Swain and Durga Prasad Patnaik. In it, she also requested her father to take action against them.        
	The ruling comes after the court directed the government to initiate action against the three accused teachers. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated by the commissioner of departmental inquiries.        
	As part of the proceedings, the commissioner imposed punishments in the form of censure, withdrawal of increment and period of suspension as leave.         
	Mohapatra had challenged it in the high court after losing his case before the State Administrative Tribunal.         
	Giving its verdict yesterday, the division bench of Justice B.P. Das and Justice B.K. Nayak quashed the disciplinary proceedings and action initiated thereof, his counsel Akshaya Kumar Rath said.         
	Initially, the state government had asked the commissioner to probe it.         
	The three accused teachers were arrested following their depositions before the commissioner. Subsequently, they had been reinstated after being released on bail.

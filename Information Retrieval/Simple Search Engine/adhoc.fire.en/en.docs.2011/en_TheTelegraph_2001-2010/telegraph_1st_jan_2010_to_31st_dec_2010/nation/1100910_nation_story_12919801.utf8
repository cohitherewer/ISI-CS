          J. P. YADAV                                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Mamata Banerjee wants the amended land acquisition bill, which the Congress is adamant to table in the winter session, to be sent to cold storage till the Bengal elections next year.         
	The Trinamul Congress leader is learnt to have no problem with the bill being brought in Parliament but wants it to be subsequently referred to a standing committee, so that it can be kept in abeyance till the Assembly polls.         
	The bill can come during the winter session but we are sure that it will be referred to a standing committee. By the time the committee gives its report, elections in Bengal would be over, a senior party leader said.         
	Trinamul leaders said that given the sensitivity attached with land acquisition in Bengal, they could not afford to take any risk till the elections. The party owes its political resurgence to its protest against land acquisition in Nandigram and Singur.         
	We have communicated our views over the bill to the government, Mamata said yesterday, when asked to respond to the governments plans to introduce it in the winter session.         
	Mamatas key concern is that she does not want the government to play any role in acquiring land for private developers.         
	The government should not figure anywhere in land acquisition for private developers. We cannot compromise on this aspect, a party leader said.         
	But the government, which is working on the bill that Rahul Gandhi is very keen on, is finding it difficult to accept this demand.         
	Suppose a private developer has acquired 90-95 per cent of the land they need and the project is held up because the owners of the remaining 5-10 per cent refuse to sell their land. That small portion of land could well be very critical to the project, like providing road connectivity. Would it be prudent for the government not to step in and allow the proposed industry to be shelved? an official in the rural development ministry asked.         
	The land acquisition bill prepared by the previous UPA government, which lapsed because it could not be tabled in the Rajya Sabha, had proposed that the government would acquire 30 per cent of the land after the private developer purchased 70 per cent.         
	This was totally unacceptable to Mamata, who had opposed it in the cabinet last year.

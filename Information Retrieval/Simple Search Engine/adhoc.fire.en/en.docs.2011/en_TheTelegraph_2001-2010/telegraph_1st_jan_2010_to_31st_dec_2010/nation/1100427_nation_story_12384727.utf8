The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Priyanka my model: Katrina
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Priyanka my model: Katrina
                            
	Mumbai, April 26 (PTI): Priyanka Gandhi was whom she watched to get her look and body language right in Rajneeti, Katrina Kaif has revealed, not Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.        
	Priyanka is a young, strong, independent and modern leader with the right blend of values. My character is not based on her. I just watched her campaign videos to observe her body language and how she campaigns and interacts with crowds, Katrina said.        
	The actress said that she had not played Sonia Gandhi in Prakash Jhas yet-to-be-released political thriller. Prakashji himself chose the saris I wore as the politician (in the film). Everybody knows I spent my early years in England and my mother is English and even Sonia Gandhi has a foreign connection. So the comparison was logical.        
	Katrina said she had her initial apprehensions before accepting the film as there was no song, dance or romance. When I first heard the script during the making of New York, I made up my mind to refuse the film, she said. When I heard the narration from him during our meeting, I realised this film has as much excitement as any other film I am doing, Katrina said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, July 21: One of the most wanted Kashmir militants and the man behind the Valleys only fidayeen attack in the past two years was killed in a Sopore encounter last night, police said.        
	Pakistani national Nouman alias Mooch Wala was the Jammu and Kashmir chief of the Harkat-ul Mujahideen and was active in the Valley for the past six years. On the most wanted list, he was second only to Lashkar-e-Toiba Kashmir chief Abdullah Unny. This is certainly a big achievement for us, a police officer said.        
	The fidayeen attack Nouman allegedly masterminded took place on January 7 this year in Srinagars Lal Chowk. A policeman and a local militant, Manzoor, were killed.        
	A soldier and another militant were also killed in last nights encounter in Sopore, the north Kashmir town that has emerged as the born-again capital of militancy in the Valley.         
	A series of attacks on security forces have occurred in the area this year. Most of them have been blamed on Nouman and Unny.

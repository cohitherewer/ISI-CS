	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Two months of violent strife finally found an empathetic echo in the national capital today, but the initial response of the angered Kashmiri street may suggest it is not strong enough to inspire peace in the Valley.        
	In a fervent address telecast live this evening, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reached out directly to Kashmiris to assuage their pain and anger and dropped the first hint the Centre was ready to lift the locally despised Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).        
	I am deeply saddened by the recent violence and I realise the pain of those who have lost near ones, I can also understand the pain and anger of the youth who have only seen chaos and instability over the last 20 years, Singh said. I understand sentiments against the AFSPA. It is only right that the Jammu and Kashmir police take more and more responsibility for ensuring the security of the people; in the days to come it will be our endeavour to strengthen the Jammu and Kashmir police to enable them to perform that role.         
	While he offered poultice to scarred Kashmiris, the Prime Minister also patted security forces who have been hard put to keep order in the Valley. They are working in tough conditions, they have taken a beating, we should not allow their morale to be lowered, he said.        
	For the record, the Prime Minister was speaking to an all-party delegation from Jammu and Kashmir but it was clear he was trying to establish touch with a much larger audience than gathered around the conference hall of his 7 Race Course Road residence.        
	In an innovative and meditated twist to the routine protocol of such meetings, the Prime Ministers opening set-piece was hooked to live television. It became a two-birds-with-one-stone trick that silenced critics who have been accusing the Prime Minister of not making any direct connect with the tumult in the Valley.         
	With todays call, he has not merely established deep cognisance of Kashmiri sentiment at the highest quarters in New Delhi but also signalled a qualitative change in approach. Singhs tone was inclusive and compassionate rather than accusatory and hectoring. He chose not to fault Kashmiri youth for taking to violence, rather he spoke of understanding their anger and grouse. Repeatedly referring to Kashmirs young generation  the spearhead of the current turmoil  he called upon them to return to schools and colleges because without education there can be no progress.        
	To political leaders from the state he had this to say: It should be all our effort to reach out to the youth of Kashmir and activate them in democratic ways. They have seen nothing but violence which has affected their psyche. They want to conduct their lives peacefully and bereft of fear. We must do, and will do, our utmost to ensure that.         
	But even as the Prime Minister spoke, fresh protests erupted in Valley towns; the most strident was near Baramulla where the body of a missing 18-year-old boy was fished out from a stream.         
	Mehbooba Muftis Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which boycotted the Prime Ministers meeting, appreciated Singhs tone and tenor but said he lacked substance and will have no positive impact on the current crisis because it says nothing about a political solution.

	Separatists Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Aasiya Andrabi were even harsher. While Geelani refused to see anything other than continued Indian hegemony in the Prime Ministers speech, Andrabi reacted from her underground hideout saying: Kashmiris are not a crowd of beggars, India must set us free and we are capable of managing our affairs.         
	Among those who attended todays meeting were chief minister Omar Abdullah, senior National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Saifuddin Soz, former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, state BJP leader Chaman Lal Gupta and the CPM veteran from the Valley, Yusuf Tarigami.        
	Singh seemed to suggest the Centre was ready to go the extra mile to meet Kashmiri demands but to start with, he appealed, violence must be halted if a new beginning was to be made towards fulfilling Kashmiri aspirations, both political and economic.         
	We have done more than any previous government to bring peace and development to Kashmir and we are willing to do much more. But people should give us a chance, all parties should come forward for talks on a political solution to remove the sense of alienation and anger. No more lives should be lost, we all must ensure that, Singh said.        
	To this end, he advised early holding of local body elections  scheduled for October but threatened by the violent upsurge  and said all political parties and forces should work for strengthening democratic institutions from the grassroots level in the Valley.        
	The Prime Minister was not overly optimistic on quick-fix solutions  I cannot say this complex problem will be easily solved  but held out several promises on the economy and development front in addition to iterating his resolve for a political solution. The main among them were speeding up the implementation of the economic package and setting up a new working group, led by head of his economic advisory council C. Rangarajan, to present a report on tackling widespread unemployment in the Valley. Infosys mentor N.R. Narayanamurthy and CII mentor Tarun Das are also to be part of the group.        
	The Prime Minister recalled several steps taken by his government to normalise the situation in Kashmir, including the opening of the Line of Control to trade and civilian traffic and the granting of unprecedented development funds for Kashmir.

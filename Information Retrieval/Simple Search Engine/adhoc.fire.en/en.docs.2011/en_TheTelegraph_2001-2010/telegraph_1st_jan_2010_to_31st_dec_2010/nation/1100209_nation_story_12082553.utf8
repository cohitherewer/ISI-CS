The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong fumes at Pawar in private
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong fumes at Pawar in private
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Congress leaders slammed Sharad Pawar off the record for running to Bal Thackeray yesterday with a plea to let Australian players take part in IPL III, but the party refused to criticise the ally in public.        
	In private conversation, Congress leaders said Pawar always visited Thackeray in Mumbai whenever the Congress turned up the heat on him in Delhi, as it had now done on the price rise. We show him the mirror, he shows us the tiger (the Shiv Sena symbol), a leader said.        
	Congress sources also argued that Pawar was jittery at the way Rahul Gandhi won accolades for cocking a snook at Shiv Sena threats and touring Mumbai in local trains.        
	The protest by the Sena against Rahul Gandhi fell flat. Barely a few dozen Sainiks came out on the streets. The Sena was unnerved but Pawar went to meet Thackeray to re-establish the perception that the Sena was the supreme force in Mumbai and even cricket matches could not be played there without Thackerays blessings, a senior Congress leader said.        
	Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan, too, reminded coalition partner NCP that there was no parallel power centre in Mumbai, but neither he nor the Congress spokespersons would criticise the agriculture minister directly. We have a political understanding with Pawar; we have nothing to say if he meets anyone regarding cricket matches, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said.        
	Asked if a cabinet minister visiting the home of a person whose politics the Congress had described as divisive sent out a good signal, Tiwari said: What the Congress thinks of these divisive forces has been made clear by Rahul Gandhi. It is for Pawar to clarify what message he wanted to send.        
	Chavan said: Dont ask me. It will be better if you ask Pawar about his motive.        
	NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi said the Pawar-Thackeray meeting had to do with cricket and had no political significance.

	Bareilly, Sept. 7 (PTI): A local Uttar Pradesh court has directed the head of an Islamic outfit to appear in court in person on September 24 for allegedly announcing a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh to anyone who kills controversial Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, prosecution sources said here.              
	Chief judicial magistrate Yogendra Ram Gupta issued the summons to Eith-e-haad Millat Council president Maulana Taukeer Raza yesterday directing him to appear before the court in person on September 24, the prosecution said.        
	Khan had during a convention organised at Islamia Inter college on March 16 allegedly announced the cash reward to anybody who beheads Nasreen whose writings have angered radical Islamic groups.        
	Later, the police lodged an FIR against Khan on the charge of triggering communal passion and providing instigation to murder and filed a chargesheet in the court.        
	Earlier in a similar instance, the Maulana had announced a cash reward of Rs 1 crore for the murder of former US President George W. Bush.

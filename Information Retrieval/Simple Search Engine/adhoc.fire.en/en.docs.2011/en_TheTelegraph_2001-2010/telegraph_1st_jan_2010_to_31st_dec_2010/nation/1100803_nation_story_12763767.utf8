The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mutiny cry from mosque
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mutiny cry from mosque
  - Shrine loudspeakers blare pro-freedom chants in Valley; eight-year-old among eight dead        MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 2: Mosque loudspeakers crackled across Kashmir today, blaring not a call to prayer but a call for rebellion.        
	The shrines turned protest pulpits overnight in a throwback to the early 1990s when the governor of the day, Jagmohan, had dubbed them centre of revolution (sic).        
	The trigger for the return to a tactic used 20 years ago was the death of eight civilians in clashes with security forces yesterday, the bloodiest day of the seven-week unrest that started in the second week of June.        
	Todays death count was also eight, but a boy injured yesterday was among those who died. Sameer Ahmad, an eight-year-old from Srinagar who is the youngest victim of the current spell of violence, died of injuries suffered during a clash. The police blamed his wounds on a stampede. The seven other victims included at least two school-going teenagers, one of whom died in hospital after a tear-gas shell hit him on Saturday.        
	The death toll has risen to 39 since the violence began on June 11. Twenty-two of the deaths have occurred in the past four days.        
	Todays flash point was Budgam, where a mob of hundreds torched two state government offices and a portion of the railway station, the police said.         
	At Rajpura, also in Pulwama, protesters set fire to all the four buildings in a police station, injuring 20 people. The incident mirrored yesterdays raid on the Khrew police station, 20km from Srinagar, by a mob that unknowingly torched an explosives-packed storeroom, triggering a blast that killed five people.        
	At Kralpora in north Kashmirs Kupwara, a mob looted arms from a police post, triggering retaliation that killed one person. The agitators fled with four rifles.         
	One person was killed in police firing after agitators attacked a police post and attempted to set fire to it in Kulgam. At neighbouring Sangam in Anantnag, CRPF personnel fired on a stone-throwing mob. The stampede that followed claimed a life.        
	The continued violence came on a day chief minister Omar Abdullah discussed the situation with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi.        
	If the streets were on fire, mosques appeared to rekindle a familiar spark.        
	A police officer who had been on duty in Srinagar in 1990 highlighted the parallels between the events then and now. People know the power of mosques. They had used it with perfection during Jagmohans stint as governor and they tried to repeat it today.         
	Mosques, the officer said, serve two purposes for protesters. It amplifies their call. The slogans coming from mosques make one feel as if the entire population has joined the protests. It frustrates the government. Plus, they (the people) feel safe, thinking they are protesting peacefully inside and will not be harmed by the police.        
	Jagmohan mentioned several incidents in his book, My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir. The subversives used mosques extensively for rearing, nursing and fanning their activities. In fact, one of the instructions was to make mosques centre of revolution (sic).        
	History was repeating itself today as scores of mosques reverberated with azaadi songs, and pro-freedom and anti-India slogans. Thousands, including the elderly and children, flocked to such mosques. Some went even at night.        
	At many places, the crowd spilled onto the streets. But at the forefront were mostly teenagers or youths in their early twenties  described as the children of conflict because they were born during the past 20 years of strife. Many were painting roads and walls with the slogan: Go India go.        
	Its a do-or-die situation for us. Either well get it (azaadi) now or never, said a 17-year-old in Srinagars Hazratbal as he joined a dozen-odd youngsters in pulling down concertina wires strung together by the police to block traffic in the curfew-bound city.        
	The groups next step was to put up hurdles to deny the policemen access to their locality and use the obstacles as shields to launch a form of attack that has become common for months now: stone-throwing.        
	Our parents picked up the gun to fight for azaadi but we want to achieve it through peaceful means. If that is not allowed, we will pick up stones, the 17-year-old said.        
	The authorities arent unaware of the trouble that can be fomented from mosques, and Jagmohans centre of revolution phrase is on their mind. That could explain why they have not permitted prayer gatherings in some mosques. That includes the Jamia Masjid, Kashmirs main mosque, where Friday prayers have not been allowed for five weeks now.        
	Residents in Srinagars old city said they had heard gunshots throughout last night, apparently fired by security forces to keep the people indoors. But in several other places,cops watched helplessly as protesters marched.         
	Officials said reinforcements were rushed to such spots before dawn to enforce the curfew, but many mosques, mostly on the city outskirts, continued to draw protesters.

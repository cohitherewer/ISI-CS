The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM plot quota query for HC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CM plot quota query for HC
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Supreme Court today asked a Bengal advocate to find out if Calcutta High Court had ever looked into land allotments under the chief ministers discretionary quota since 1977 before it took up his petition for a thorough scrutiny.        
	If it has, you should come to us in appeal, a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia told Calcutta-based advocate Joydeep Mukherjee, asking him to get back with the information.        
	We want to know whether the policy of allotment of land under the chief ministers discretionary quota has been examined on its merits or not by the high court. The query came during a hearing on a public interest petition that alleged that since 1977, when the Left Front seized power in Bengal, some 2,000 such plots had been allotted in Salt Lake, most of them in violation of rules.        
	The matter has come under scrutiny at a time allotment of Rajarhat plots by Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb through his special quota has triggered controversy.        
	Mukherjees petition, which sought independent scrutiny of all land allotments made in the state since 1977, named, among others, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his cabinet colleagues Asim Dasgupta and Asok Bhattacharya as respondents. The PIL also named the late CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu.         
	Basus name was, however, deleted when the counsel for the Bengal government said the petition had levelled grave allegations against him.         
	Mukherjees counsel said the high court and later the Supreme Court had looked into only an individual case, the discretionary allotment to Justice B.P. Banerjee, but had not dealt with the issue of whether such a policy was constitutionally valid. The apex court later cancelled the allotment.

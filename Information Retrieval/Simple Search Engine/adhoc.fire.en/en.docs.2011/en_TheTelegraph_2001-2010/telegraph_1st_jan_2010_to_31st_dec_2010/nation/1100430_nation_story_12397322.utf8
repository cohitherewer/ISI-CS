          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ravenshaw University                                  
	Cuttack, April 29: The police commissionerate is yet to crack the theft of rare and precious books, magazines, journals and music, along with computer peripherals, from the digital wing of Kanika Library at Ravenshaw University.         
	The library officials had sought help from the police in locating 60,000 text and reference books, journals and magazines and 80,000 songs stored in portable document format (pdf) that were stolen from the digital library on Monday. An FIR was registered at the Malgodown police station.         
	What has rattled the commissionerate police is that the burglary went unnoticed even though 27 computers were dismantled and key components  processors, RAM, hard discs and other hardware were removed  in the theft.        
	The burglars had apparently sneaked into the library by breaking the window railings, assistant commissioner of police Pravat Kumar Pradhan said today, adding that some people, including the library staff, had been subjected to interrogation. No arrests have been made yet, he said.        
	The digital library was set up in February this year as part of grand plans to digitise old books and rare manuscripts to save them from perishing. As the whole campus is connected through wi-fi, students could easily access rare books and browse the Internet anywhere on campus, a library official said.        
	Opened in 1922, Kanika Library boasts of more than 2 lakh books and journals and is the biggest and oldest library in Orissa and the central library of Ravenshaw University. A project was also underway to incorporate a digital music library with an extensive collection of contemporary music by popular artists. A collection of 2,000 greatest hit albums of all time since the 1950s was also part of the plan envisaging a music library, the official said.

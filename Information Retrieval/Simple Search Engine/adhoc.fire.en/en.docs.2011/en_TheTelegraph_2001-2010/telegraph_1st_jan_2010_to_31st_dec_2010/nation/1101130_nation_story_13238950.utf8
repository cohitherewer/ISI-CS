	New Delhi, Nov. 29 (PTI): Abhishek Singhvi has been reinstated as a Congress spokesperson more than a month after the party took him off as its public face following a controversy over his appearance in a lottery case in Kerala High Court.         
	AICC general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said: He (Singhvi) has told the party leadership that it was an error of judgement on his part. He has now been called back as party spokesperson. He will hold a press conference tomorrow.         
	Singhvi had been barred from holding media briefings in the first week of October.        
	The appearance of Singhvi, a lawyer, in the high court in the lottery case had raised a storm in the Kerala unit of the Congress, which had launched a campaign against promoters of lotteries from outside the state.

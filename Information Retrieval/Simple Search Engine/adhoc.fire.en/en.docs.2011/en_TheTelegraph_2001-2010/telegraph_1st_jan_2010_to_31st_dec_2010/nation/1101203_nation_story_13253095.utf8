          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           PJ Thomas                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Central vigilance commissioner P.J. Thomas could quit ahead of the Supreme Court hearing on Monday when a PIL against his appointment is likely to come up, highly placed government sources said.         
	The commissioner, however, insisted today he was innocent and would continue in office. I am morally clear. My conscience is very clear. I am continuing as CVC, he said. Asked about his possible resignation, Thomas said: That is a speculative question. I do not have to answer it.         
	An unsigned letter surfaced in his support, which sources said was from IAS colleagues in Kerala. The two-page letter defends his role in the palmolein case and says he was only following instructions of the then chief minister, K. Karunakaran, as the states food and civil supplies secretary in 1991.         
	Thomass name figures in a chargesheet on an alleged palmolein import scam and the Supreme Court had questioned how he would function as the central vigilance commissioner in view of the criminal case pending against him.         
	The commissioner said today the case was about the council of ministers in Kerala taking a decision to import palmolein that he, as food secretary, had implemented. On that basis, to level a criminal conspiracy charge against me is funny, he said.         
	What is the criminal conspiracy.... meeting at the council of ministers headed by the chief minister? Thomas asked. The state investigative agency... said this cabinet meeting was a criminal conspiracy as food secretary I am also in attendance.... Thereafter, the cabinet meeting gives a decision and as food secretary you issue the order and they say this conspiracy of the meeting of council of ministers, you have contributed to that, he said.         
	The Centre is, however, coming round to the view that Thomass continuation as vigilance commissioner is becoming politically and legally untenable.         
	The episode has exposed poor decision-making. The issue of sanction to prosecute Thomas has been pending with the department of personnel and training for 10 years and the department could have dismissed the request.         
	The letter in his support, purportedly from the Kerala IAS Association, said the Left government which came to power in 2006 had revived a dead case in which Thomass role was at best tangential. In 1991, the food secretary had signed a government order to import 15,000 metric tonnes of palmolein on the basis of a cabinet decision. Karunakaran and other officials are also accused in the case.         
	The letter claims that the only irregularity the vigilance inquiry found was that the import of palmolein was sought in connection with Makar Sankranti, which is not a major festival in Kerala. Four other states had obtained the Centres approval under the scheme to import without tender.         
	Two of these, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, actually purchased palmolein without tender under the same scheme, from the same vendor, after signing exactly similar contracts, with the price being fixed in the same manner as was done in Kerala, the letter said, adding there are no such palmolein cases in these states.         
	Thomas, who has also served as telecom secretary at the Centre, today distanced himself from the 2G spectrum allocation. Initially, he said the matter was sub judice and it would not be appropriate for him to speak on it. But questioned further, he said: It happened between 2007 and 2008 when I was not the telecom secretary.         
	I am very impartial and take judicious decisions as per the law on every matter that comes to me, Thomas added.

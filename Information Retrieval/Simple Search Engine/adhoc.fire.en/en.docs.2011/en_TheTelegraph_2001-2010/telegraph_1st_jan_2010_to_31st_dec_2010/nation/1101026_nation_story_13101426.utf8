The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India skirts Tokyos China trap
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      India skirts Tokyos China trap
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                               
	Tokyo, Oct. 25: India conveyed to Japan today that it was unwilling to take sides in its ongoing tension with China and emphasised that it was essential to engage China in close, open and productive dialogue.         
	The threat Japans facing from China over the past few months reportedly figured high in a bilateral meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had with the Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan this evening.         
	They also discussed the pending civil nuclear cooperation deal and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) that awaits inking after the conclusion of negotiations.         
	The word from the Japanese side was that Kan  facing domestic flak for reportedly letting China have an upper hand  was anxious when Singh came calling.         
	So anxious he was that he departed from protocol and stood near the elevator to receive the Indian PM. In normal circumstances, he would have remained in his official chamber, a source said.         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, who was asked in a media briefing about the discussion the two had on China, said: They did refer to the relations each country has with China and how important these relations are from the strategic point of view. The Japanese PM was interested in knowing from our PM on the development of our relationship with China and how the relations have grown. She did not say what Singh said, the sense that came through in her answer was that both sides had outstanding issues awaiting resolution with China.        
	But the answer lay in drawing the country in a peaceful and engaging way. India has boundary issues to resolve with China, Japan has maritime issues. We have a well-functioning system to discuss these issues in a peaceful and engaging way, said Rao.         
	Asked whether India would allow itself to be used as a counter-power against China, given how Beijing was creating problems for other countries in the region, Rao said: You have to look at India, Japan and China as the largest economies of Asia. India and Japan are democracies. India and Japan have China as their neighbour. It is a reality, a fact of life. Both countries have to develop an in-depth relationship with China as times go by.        
	She emphasised that India wished to see the peaceful rise of China. To attain that vision, drawing China into more productive dialogues is the only way forward, Rao added.         
	Rao quashed speculation that Singh and Kans decision to explore the possibility of bilateral cooperation in the development, re-cycling and re-use of rare earths and metals in research and development of their substitutes was a direct challenge to China since it also figures high on its geo-political agenda. The decision was part of their joint statement.         
	Replying to a related question, she said, This is an Indian-Japanese centric process. Since 1952, India and Japan are working on rare earth and looking at long-term cooperation on the issue. If you are looking for drama, theatre, no, this is a very need-based, functional thing. There is a very high degree of trust between our two democracies and this is the ambience in which such cooperation is being done.

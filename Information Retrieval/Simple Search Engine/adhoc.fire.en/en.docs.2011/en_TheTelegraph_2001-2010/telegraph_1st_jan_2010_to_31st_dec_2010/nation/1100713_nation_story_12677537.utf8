The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fraud summons for BJP manager
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fraud summons for BJP manager
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 12: A Delhi court today issued summons to BJP central headquarters in-charge Shyam Sunder Jaju for an alleged financial fraud.         
	The court ordered police to impound his passport, six days after Jaju reportedly tried to flee the country with jewellery and items worth several crores of rupees, according to the income-tax department.        
	The Patiala House Court acted on evidence gathered by the tax department that suggested Jaju, regarded as the RSSs eyes and ears, was allegedly involved in financial irregularities.        
	Among the findings mentioned in the summons were Jaju had filed returns of only Rs 2-3 lakh whereas he had signed a memorandum of understanding with an IT company, S.K. Infotech, for investing several crores.         
	Jaju is alleged to have opened a bank account in Dubai where he is said to have stashed away a huge amount. He reportedly has multiple PAN cards.         
	Jaju has been asked to appear before the court on July 24. He is also likely to be charged with another offence  levelling false charges with the intent to injure.        
	Jajus name first cropped up for the wrong reasons when Rs 2.6 crore mysteriously vanished from the BJPs central office in December 2008. The incident was hushed up.        
	But the theft ghost came to haunt the party last January after Chandan Kumar Jha, a student of a media institute in Delhi owned by a BJP investors cell member, was thrashed at the party office for trying to snoop on Jajus account.         
	Jha walked into an Andhra Bank branch allegedly pretending to be Jaju and asked for an account statement for 2008-09. The bank manager got suspicious, called Jaju to cross-check and then detained the impostor.         
	Some BJP workers arrived, got hold of Jha and took him to the party office where he was beaten up before being handed over to the police. The episode turned the spotlight on Jaju because insiders confirmed that Jha was living with him in a house adjacent to the BJP headquarters.        
	Questions were asked on how Jha could have accessed Jajus PAN card and on whether he was put up to the job by persons who were keen to get to the bottom of the theft. The court in its summons said Jaju had falsely implicated Jha. We will see the court order, said BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar.        
	Jaju is said to be close to the Sangh brass because he reportedly fills them in on the goings on at the BJPs 11 Ashoka Road headquarters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Training hub for rebel-hit Bengal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Training hub for rebel-hit Bengal
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Bengal will get one of the temporary anti-insurgency training schools proposed at a meeting of the Prime Minister last month with the seven worst Maoist-hit states, after being left out of the initial list.        
	The counter-insurgency and anti-terrorism school will come up in rebel-infested West Midnapore, sources said, adding that Nagaland and Manipur will also get such institutes. Like Bengal, the two states were not on the initial list.        
	After last months meeting, it was decided to set up 20 such training schools  four each in Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa.         
	Under the reworked register, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, which have borne the brunt of Maoist attacks, will get four such schools each, the sources said. Assam, Bihar and Orissa have been given three each.        
	Nagaland and Manipur have been fighting insurgency and demanded the setting up of such schools. Nagaland last year bagged a Sainik School  the countrywide chain of army-run schools. It will be set up in Peren district.        
	The sources said the counter-insurgency schools would be temporary  they would be in place until the insurgents in their areas are active and would function from the facilities of the respective state police.        
	The money will be released soon and training will start with temporary shelters and facilities. The facility will not be like the one in Kanker but will be temporary in nature, the source said. Kanker, in Chhattisgarh, has a full-fledged centre headed by a former army officer who had earlier run the counter insurgency and jungle warfare school at Vairangte in Mizoram.        
	The plan to set up the counter-insurgency schools underscores the high priority the government attaches to training in its fight against the Naxalites.        
	The importance of the issue has come into sharper focus in view of Union home minister P. Chidambarams call to state police forces to recruit rapidly. He wants them to hire up to a lakh personnel by March 2011. The huge numbers will require training facilities much bigger than what are available at present.        
	The defence ministry has agreed to provide army officers for training to state police and central paramilitary forces.         
	The central forces are expanding, too, in a way that their existing training facilities can hardly support.        
	More than 75 battalions (around 75,000 personnel) will be raised between the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). All three forces are engaged in anti-Maoist operations.        
	But it is the CRPF, expected to the bulk of the personnel to be hired in the near future, that is in dire need of facilities. The force has a training institute in Assams Silchar but requires many more such schools.         
	The ITBP and the BSF have their own schools, too, but these are unable to cope with the forces swelling ranks.

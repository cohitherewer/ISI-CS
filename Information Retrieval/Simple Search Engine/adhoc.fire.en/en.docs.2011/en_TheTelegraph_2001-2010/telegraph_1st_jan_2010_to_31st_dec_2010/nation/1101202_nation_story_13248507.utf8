          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     Asif Ali Zardari (top), Pervez Musharraf      
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government has expressed reservations about granting Pervez Musharraf a visa to visit the country after realising that several of his supporters have also applied for visas to visit India around the same time.         
	Musharraf, a former President and military chief of Pakistan, stays in London but has been trying to make a comeback in Pakistani politics.         
	He applied for a visa last month because he has been invited by the India chapter of the Young Presidents Organisation  a global network of young business leaders  to be a guest speaker at their conference in Delhi on Saturday. Musharraf had requested for permission to visit Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta.         
	A senior home ministry official, asked about Musharrafs visa application, said: The MHA (ministry of home affairs) has expressed reservations. The ministry directly looks into all visa applications from Pakistan.        
	Sources said initially the government was willing to grant Musharrafs visa request presuming that his visit would involve closed-door meetings with young businessmen from India and Pakistan.         
	But the home and foreign ministries found out that several of Musharrafs supporters from Pakistan had also applied for visas at the Indian mission in Islamabad to visit India during the same time. New Delhi does not want to offer Musharraf a platform to launch an attack on the Asif Ali Zardari government from Indian soil.         
	Indias reservations also stem from Musharraf recently accusing Indian intelligence agencies of creating trouble in Balochistan. In a recent interview, he also admitted that Pakistan had trained militants to fight in Kashmir.         
	In a lighter vein, the home ministry official said Delhi might rethink if Musharraf brings with him the 26/11 conspirators.        
	Musharraf visited New Delhi a couple of years back to deliver a lecture. He was not the Pakistan President then.

	Hyderabad, Dec. 28: A commerce graduate who couldnt find a bride because of his drinking habit axed his aged mother to death after she refused to sign a document transferring the family property to his name.        
	The Sunday-night murder came to light days after four sons of another 70-year-old refused to take her body from a hospital morgue unless their father registered the 12-acre family land in their names.        
	Police sources in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, said Srikant Reddy killed his mother Yellamma, 70, with an axe as she slept at their family home in Bethamcherla town in the district, 225km from Hyderabad.        
	The 29-year-old was still a bachelor as community elders had refused to find him a bride because of his drinking habit. Srikant wanted to be the sole owner of the 20-acre family property, hoping that would help him get a wife, but his mother had refused because she had three other children, including a daughter.        
	On Sunday night, Srikant axed his mother to death after a heated argument and fled. Bethamcherla inspector Maheswar Reddy said an investigation was on.        
	In Dasaripalem, a village in Guntur district, 340km from Hyderabad, four sons kept their dead mothers body in an icebox for three days and refused to cremate her. They wanted their father to gift them the family land.        
	This was three years after they had driven their mother Mangamma, 70, and father Venkateswarlu, 74, from their home.        
	After Mangamma died, the brothers refused to cremate her, forcing the police to intervene. They drove us away, now they want to kill me for the property, Venkateswarlu said.

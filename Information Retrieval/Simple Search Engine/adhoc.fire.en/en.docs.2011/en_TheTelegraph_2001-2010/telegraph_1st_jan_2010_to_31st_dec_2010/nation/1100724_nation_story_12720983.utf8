                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stay on Bihar CBI probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Nitish Kumar                          
	Patna, July 23: Patna High Court today stayed its order for a CBI probe into allegations that the Bihar government had misappropriated over Rs 11,412 crore from the exchequer, offering a big reprieve to the Nitish Kumar regime.        
	After hearing the states interlocutory petition seeking revision of its July 15 order, a bench of Chief Justice R.M. Doshit and Justice S.K. Katariyar also put on hold till further orders its directive to the CBI director and CBI joint director, Bihar, to be present in court on July 26.        
	The paragraphs 18 and 19 of the order (dated July 15) is being kept in abeyance till further order, the bench said in its brief interim order.        
	Clauses 18 and 19 of the July 15 order, passed after a PIL was filed in connection with the CAG report, had dwelt on whether the case was fit to be given to the CBI and had asked the bureau officials to personally appear in court on July 26.        
	Advocate-general P.K. Shahi said after the order: The courts order implies there will be no CBI inquiry in the alleged scandal. The high court has kept the operative part of its previous orders in abeyance.        
	Earlier, arguing on the interlocutory petition, Shahi said the government had already submitted detailed contingency (DC) bills worth Rs 5,516 crore to the office of the accountant general.        
	It (submitting DC bills to AG) is an ongoing process. The officials have been working round the clock to submit the DC bills against the rest of Rs 11,412 crore as soon as possible, Shahi said, asking the court to revise its order on the CAG report which the PIL had quoted to accuse the government of misappropriating the amount.        
	Sources said another reason the court revised its order may have been the argument of the CAG office counsel, P.K. Rajgarhiya, that the CAG had referred to Rs 11,412 crore drawn from the treasuries as unadjusted amount and not as defalcated/ misappropriated as alleged in the PIL.        
	Rajgarhiya said the CAG was a watchdog of the state exchequer and that there was no embezzlement of funds highlighted in the report.        
	The courts July 15 order had triggered protests in election-bound Bihar, with Opposition parties demanding the dismissal of the Nitish Kumar government and imposition of Presidents rule in the state.        
	The Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party did not allow legislature to function for two consecutive days. Their leaders met governor Devanand Kunwar demanding imposition of central rule ahead of the polls. There were street protests also, with Opposition members locking horns with security forces.        
	With todays court order virtually dis-arming the Opposition, the protests are likely to lessen. NDA leaders claimed the Congress and the RJD-LJP were trying to malign the Nitish Kumar government as part of their sinister campaign to destabilise the regime ahead of the polls and reap political gains.        
	The NDA has decided to burn the effigies of Congress and RJD leaders across the state on July 24 and July 25 to expose their real intent.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 18: Jammu and Kashmirs Omar Abdullah government will hold panchayat elections in October after almost a decade, in a logistical and security challenge that dwarfs even those posed by Assembly and parliamentary polls.        
	This is a massive exercise that needs tens of thousands of candidates. It is impossible to ensure the safety of these persons, the reason the government has been delaying the exercise, an officer in the states rural development and panchayat ministry said.        
	Such elections were last held in early 2001 and governments have been delaying the process for years because of threats from militants. But the nine-year wait would seem less to many  the 2001 polls were held after a gap of 23 years.        
	The delay wasnt the only problem. The polls were criticised as a paper exercise as more than half of the seats remained vacant in the Valley and hundreds of candidates got elected unopposed. The separatists had called for a boycott.        
	The apparent lack of credibility had prompted the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government to dissolve the new panchayats after he came to power in 2002. He promised fresh elections but neither he nor the successive governments, held them.        
	The states minister for rural development and panchayats said this years elections would be held in six phases across the state. This (holding the panchayat polls) will help us delegate powers to the grass-root level. The tentative draft publication of the electoral rolls will be made on July 20 and the final publication on August 20. The notification for the elections will be issued thereafter, Ali Muhammad Sagar said.        
	Funds to hold the polls will come from a Rs 1,000-crore grant received from the Centre under the 13th Finance Commission for the development of rural areas. We would also utilise other (central) grants, Sagar said.        
	The government admits that the challenge is enormous. We have 4,139 panchayats with over 20,695 seats. Some 50 lakh people will participate in the elections. It is a huge task, Yadullah, the states rural development and panchayat secretary, said. He downplayed the security threat, though. This is an election that has nothing to do with politics. It is for effective administration, he said.              
	 We will still be in touch with the home department to decide what kind of security needs to be provided to individual candidates, he said.        
	But official sources said they would need thousands of security personnel. Militancy is still a major challenge for us. The separatists are also likely to call for a boycott and it will require greater efforts to convince candidates to stand in these elections. We hope it will not be a repeat of the 2001 polls, another officer said.

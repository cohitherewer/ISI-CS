The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Posco ball rolls to tribal wing
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Posco ball rolls to tribal wing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct 26: The uncertainty over Poscos proposal for a $12-billion integrated steel plant in Orissa continues with an advisory panel on forests recommending that the ministry of tribal affairs examine the projects process of approvals.         
	The forest advisory committee of the Union environment ministry has suggested that the tribal affairs ministry should determine whether the approval process was in complete compliance with the Forest Rights Act, a source said.         
	The project, which will produce 12 million tonnes of steel, with an associated power plant and a port proposed by South Koreas Posco, is Indias biggest foreign direct investment deal so far.         
	The environment ministry had earlier specified that the project can proceed only after all conditions relating to the forest act, including the consent of tribal people and other traditional forest-dwellers, are met. A four-member committee set up by the environment ministry had last week cited serious lapses in complying with the forest act. The Orissa government has denied any wrongdoing.         
	If the advisory committee recommendation is accepted, the tribal affairs ministry will be the latest among a number of panels tasked with scrutinising the approvals for Posco.         
	The committees role was to examine only forest-related issues, a source, who attended the committees meeting, said. Environmental and coastal laws issues related to this project are being examined independently by other experts.         
	Each of these panels will submit their observations to the environment ministry which is expected to take the final decision on Poscos steel plant which will require about 1,620 hectares of which 1,253 hectares is forest land with eight villages.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs expected visit to South Korea next month for the G20 summit has given rise to speculation that a decision on Posco will emerge soon. But environment minister Jairam Ramesh has said he is under no externally imposed deadline to decide on Posco.

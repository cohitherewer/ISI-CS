	Lucknow, Dec. 7: Mohammad Waliullah, 35, the suspected architect of the serial blasts in Varanasi four years ago, was only found guilty of carrying arms and absolved of all other terror charges for want of evidence.         
	Waliullah was arrested with an AK-47 rifle and half a kg of RDX from Lucknow in April 2006, a month after the March 7 blasts at Sankatmochan temple and the railway station that killed at least 20 people and injured around 100.         
	On August 26, 2008, a district court in Lucknow cleared the former Simi activist and imam of a mosque at Phulpur in Allahabad of the charges of engineering the blasts and conspiring to wage war against India. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail  till 2018  and fined Rs 100,000 by a sessions court in Varanasi after being held guilty of illegal possession of arms.         
	Two others, arrested soon after Waliullah, were handed the same punishment.         
	The special task force, which filed a chargesheet in July 2006 quoting 45 witnesses, alleged that Waliullah had briefly forged a tie-up with the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad but snapped ties with it and cosied up to the Harkat-ul Jehad Islami.         
	Waliullah was first arrested on terror-related charges in 2001, just after he had graduated from an Islamic seminary. Picked up from Allahabad, he was released soon after.         
	He was picked up for the second time in 2004, again from Allahabad and carrying arms, and was freed on bail. In June that year, HuJI leader Bashiruddin got in touch with Waliullah. He was taken to Bangladesh for a meeting with a mid-level HuJI commander Maulana Mohammad Assadullah, the STF said.         
	After the meeting, Waliullah was appointed HuJI commander for eastern Uttar Pradesh and he organised the Varanasi blasts with the help of Zubair, Mustakeen, Bashir, Zakir and Asif Mohammad, the chargesheet said. The first three were killed in encounters and the remaining two are in jail.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Oct. 24: Rajasthan polices anti-terrorism squad is likely to question Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar, who has been mentioned in the 2007 Ajmer blast case chargesheet, sources said today.        
	The deputy inspector-general of the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), Anand Srivastav, declined to reveal anything but the sources said the squad was gathering evidence with a view to Indreshs possible interrogation.        
	The ATS is said to have seized several documents and the register at the Gujarati community guesthouse in Jaipurs M.I. Road, where Indresh allegedly attended a secret meeting that plotted the blasts at Ajmer, Hyderabads Mecca Masjid and Malegaon. The chargesheet, however, does not name Indresh as an accused.        
	Its not clear when Indresh, who is in his 50s, may be questioned. He is expected in Ajmer on November 20 to address a meeting, Ajmer sanghachalak Sunil Kumar Jain said.        
	According to the chargesheet, filed by the ATS in an Ajmer court on Friday, Indresh met seven Hindu radicals at the October 31, 2005, meeting. He allegedly urged them to carry out their individual tasks while remaining affiliated with religious organisations to stay off the police radar.        
	Doubts have been raised, however, whether the ATS will be able to nail Indresh. Sangh officials here said the chargesheet contained nothing to corroborate the charges against Indresh.        
	Former Sangh boss K.S. Sudershan today told PTI in Jaipur: It is absolutely wrong to say that (Indresh) Kumar was present at a secret meeting held in a guesthouse here in 2005 as mentioned in the chargesheet.

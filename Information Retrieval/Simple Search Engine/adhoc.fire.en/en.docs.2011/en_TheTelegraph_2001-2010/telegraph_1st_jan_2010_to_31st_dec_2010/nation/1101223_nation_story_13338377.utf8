 - Import duty lifted          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The government today allowed duty-free import of onion and said its state trading agencies were planning to buy it from China, the worlds largest producer.        
	The focus on imports came a day after food minister Sharad Pawar said such an option was not being considered.         
	Pawar had also said prices would not improve before two-to-three weeks  which was revised a few notches by his own department secretary to 7 to 10 days today. The tune seems to have changed after the Prime Ministers Office wrote to the secretaries of Pawars department to take immediate steps.        
	The Centre also asked state governments to crack down on hoarders and extended the ban on exports till further notice. Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar has asked the commerce department to speed up imports.        
	The steps the government has taken have helped in drastic reduction in prices. New stocks will come, prices will come down in the next 7 to 10 days, agriculture secretary P.K. Basu said.        
	Consumer affairs secretary Rajiv Aggarwal said 40 per cent of the normal crop damaged in Maharashtra was because of rains. Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh reported a 15-20 per cent dip in supply because of rotting and reduced size.        
	Commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said: I met the chiefs of three public sector companies MMTC, STC and PEC and asked them to look around for import contracts.         
	Sources indicated that the state-owned agencies were looking at China as a potential source to import onions to fire-fight the crisis. If the Beijing bulb does roll across the border, it will be the second not-too-friendly neighbour after Pakistan to do its bit to wipe the tears of India.         
	The impact of the decisions was felt in the wholesale market with prices dipping. We are hopeful that in a couple of days the declining trend will be reflected in retail price also, Aggarwal said.        
	The railways, led by Mamata Banerjee who will protest the price rise in Calcutta tomorrow, have also chipped in. Vivek Sahai, the chairperson of the Railway Board, said: We are geared to provide more rakes for expeditious movement of onions from producing regions to different parts of the country.

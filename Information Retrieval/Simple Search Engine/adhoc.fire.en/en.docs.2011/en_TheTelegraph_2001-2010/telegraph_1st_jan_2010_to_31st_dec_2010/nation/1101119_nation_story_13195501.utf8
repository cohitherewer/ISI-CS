          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Samajwadi Party today said the Prime Minister was answerable to the Lok Sabha and not the Supreme Court on the spectrum row, the apparent defence coming more than two years after it had rescued the Manmohan Singh government over the nuclear deal.        
	The Prime Minister is answerable to the Lok Sabha and not the judiciary. It is beyond the Supreme Courts right to rap the Prime Minister. The court should rap the cabinet secretary, Samajwadi spokesperson and MP Mohan Singh said.        
	The party, however, rushed to dispel the impression that it was being soft on the Congress, asserting that its stand should be understood from the perspective of constitutional propriety.        
	In fact, the Congress is a bigger culprit on the spectrum issue than the Prime Minister. A. Raja was inducted into the cabinet at the behest of the Congress and not Manmohan Singh, Mohan Singh said and echoed the Opposition demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the spectrum allocations.        
	The Samajwadi leader justified his defence of the Prime Minister by pitching it as a judiciary-versus-legislature battle, saying if the judiciary was allowed to take on the legislature, it could prove dangerous for democracy. This practice of judiciary rapping the Prime Minister should not be encouraged, Mohan Singh said.        
	The Samajwadi stand contrasted with that of its arch-rival, the Mayavati-led Bahujan Samaj Party, which appeared to go against the chorus of demands for a JPC investigation. Mayavatiji has asked us not to join the demand for JPC. She feels that a JPC probe is useless, a BSP MP said.         
	In the Lok Sabha, party MPs did not join Opposition members in trooping to the well of the House demanding a JPC investigation.        
	The Left, which had withdrawn support over the nuclear deal and set the stage for the Samajwadis to rescue UPA I in 2008, insisted on a JPC probe into the telecom controversy and wanted it to cover even the BJP-led NDAs term.         
	The telecom policy regarding granting licences was changed during the NDA period in 1998-99. Therefore, the probe should cover it, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said.        
	He asked Manmohan Singh to allow a JPC probe. The only and the best course available now is the JPC and the PM should allow it.

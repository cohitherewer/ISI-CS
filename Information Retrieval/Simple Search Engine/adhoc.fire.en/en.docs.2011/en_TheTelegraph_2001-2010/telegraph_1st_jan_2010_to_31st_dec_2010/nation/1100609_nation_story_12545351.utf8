	New Delhi, June 8: The vanquisher of the LTTE, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, arrived here today to start a four-day state visit during which he is expected to impart lessons to his Indian friends on dealing with the Maoists.        
	LTTE training documents have been recovered from Maoists, who are believed to have modelled their guerrilla warfare techniques on those practised by the Tamil Tigers.        
	Of the five agreements likely to be signed between the two countries, one relates to co-operation in fighting terrorism.        
	Rajapaksa will spend a day and a half in salubrious Shimla. Foreign ministry sources would only say that the Lankan President had asked to spend a day in an Indian city other than Delhi and, considering the heat wave in the plains, the hill town was chosen.        
	Shimla, where Rajapaksa would be the guest of the Himachal Pradesh governor, happens to be the home of the elite Army Training Command. The sources would not say if the Lankan President might visit the Command, whose doctrines of war and training modules are now being followed also by the paramilitary.        
	Thursdays meeting of the cabinet committee on security is expected to decide whether to send the army to fight the Maoists.        
	Rajapaksas first India visit since winning a second term in January coincides with Colombo marking the first anniversary of its victory over the LTTE.        
	Last month, the Indian home ministry had renewed its ban on the LTTE as a terrorist outfit. The gazette notification mentioned intelligence inputs that the decimated LTTE might regroup and launch attacks on India.        
	Security agencies and Delhi police have beefed up security outside the hotel where Rajapaksa would stay and also at the Sri Lankan high commission, fearing protests by Lankan Tamil refugees and those sympathetic to their cause.        
	A team of DMK and Congress MPs from Tamil Nadu, led by T.R. Baalu, will meet Rajapaksa tomorrow to press him for early resettlement of the over 80,000 Tamils displaced by the Lankan civil war and for a political resolution of the ethnic conflict.

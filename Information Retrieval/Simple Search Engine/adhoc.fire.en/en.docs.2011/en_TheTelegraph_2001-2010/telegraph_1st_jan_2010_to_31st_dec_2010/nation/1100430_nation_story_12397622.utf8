          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, April 29: IPS officer Abhay Chudasama, arrested yesterday in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, had used the victim for extortion from traders before having him bumped off, the CBI told a court today.        
	Chudasama ran an extortion racket and had extracted around Rs 40 lakh from 2001 to 2003 using Sohrabuddin before the 2005 encounter in which he and his wife Kausarbi died, the agency told the special CBI court.        
	Chudasama  who was remanded in CBI custody till May 5 today  had planted a gun to prove that Sohrabuddin was a terrorist out on a mission to kill Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.         
	The CBI also claimed that Chudasama had sent an emissary offering Rubabuddin, Sohrabuddins younger brother, Rs 50 lakh to withdraw the case. Rubabuddin, who lives near Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, confirmed that Chudasama had sent a person to meet him three months ago. Rubabuddin said the emissary had told him that Chudasama would take care of his needs and protect him if he withdrew the case. He declined.        
	Rubabuddin suspected Chudasama had been tapping his phone. Im sure he was tapping my phone. How else could he know that I was going to file a case in the Supreme Court.        
	Throwing light on the events leading up to the encounter, the CBI said Chudasama had called Sohrabuddin and found out his location, Sangli in Maharashtra. Chudasama then tipped off his IPS colleague D.G. Vanzara  among the other three arrested officers  who brought Sohrabuddin to Ahmedabad four days before the encounter.        
	Chudasamas lawyer termed his clients arrest illegal and said the CBI officers had exceeded their brief.

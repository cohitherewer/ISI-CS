The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Veil off ISI Valley cell, dossier ready 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Veil off ISI Valley cell, dossier ready 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                          
	New Delhi/ Jammu, Nov. 7: India has uncovered the operations of a Kashmir cell of Pakistans ISI, co-ordinated by a self-styled news analyst who goes by the name Raeis Mir, and is likely to share the dossier with President Barack Obama, intelligence sources said.        
	The Telegraph has accessed evidence of regular communication that Hurriyat leaders and human rights activists in Kashmir have had with the Islamabad-based Mir, who liaisoned with senior ISI officers.        
	An email sent by Mir to moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq asks: The acts by India to disrupt the status of population are on, what are your counter-steps?         
	The Telegraph has seen the nine-point questionnaire emailed directly to the Mirwaiz, which is part of the evidence intelligence agencies have gathered after four months of work.        
	In April this year, the ISI got scanned copies of census forms so that it could use fake census forms to influence population figures in Kashmir, the sources said.        
	Another question goes like this: Is it true that there is a big ratio of the Scheduled Castes of Jammu in government services and it is a part of some big conspiracy? If yes, please give details.         
	The National Technical Research Organisation, the military intelligence and the Intelligence Bureau have used intercepts and human and cyber intelligence to uncover a complex web of information exchange between ISI officers on the one hand and Hurriyat leaders, NGOs working in Kashmir, ISI operatives in Kashmir and Pakistan and allegedly also the Pakistan High Commission on the other, the sources said.        
	The PMO and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar were last month briefed about Mir and his associates and how Pakistan is influencing developments in Kashmir.        
	Headed by a brigadier of the Pakistan army, the ISIs Kashmir cell includes at least half-a-dozen army officers, of whom two are majors. Civilians with expertise in different fields are also part of the cell, which co-ordinates with a camp office in Muzaffarabad headed by an officer holding the rank of colonel.        
	Mir, said to be in his early forties, has excellent access to the Mirwaiz, Muslim Khawateen Markaz chief Yasmeen Raja as well as ISI operatives in Pakistan. He has played a substantial role in the street protests that have rocked the Valley since June, the sleuths have found.        
	Giving Obama the dossier would serve the purpose of showing the US how Pakistan, while claiming to fight terrorism, has a hand in the troubles in Kashmir.        
	Mir and his team have expertise in what is described as steganography  the art of embedding vital information about the enemy in a sea of trivia  the intelligence sources said. For instance, sensitive information collected by ISI agents is embedded in routine news reports about the Valley.        
	Last week, a code was cracked to reveal that the Mirwaiz was asked to address a rally in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir via the Internet.

  - Sustainable living in slums impresses Charles         GORDON RAYNER                          Prince Charles (left), the Dharavi slum                                        
	London, Oct. 9: The Prince of Wales has cited one of the worlds worst slums as a model for how British cities  and banks  could be improved.         
	He says we could all learn lessons from the way people live their lives in Dharavi in Mumbai, the setting for the film Slumdog Millionaire.         
	The Prince claims that Asias largest slum is better organised than many Western towns and cities, and that the residents instinctively practise sustainable living, which the heir to the throne is keen to promote.         
	Dharavi, which at 430 acres is less than half the size of the Princes Highgrove Estate, is home to between 6,00,000 and 1 million people.         
	It has only one lavatory for every 1,440 residents, leading to widespread health problems, and an average annual wage of around 420 (Rs 29,580).         
	But in his latest book, Harmony, to be published next week, the Prince risks accusations that he is out of touch by praising the way the slum has become a functioning community.         
	He writes: When you enter what looks from the outside like an immense mound of plastic and rubbish, you immediately come upon an intricate network of streets with miniature shops, houses and workshops, each one made out of any material that comes to hand.         
	The Prince contrasts the fragmented, deconstructed housing estates built in the West with the order and harmony of the slum, saying: We have a great deal to learn about how complex systems can self-organise to create a harmonious whole.         
	The Princes views on sustainable living led to the inception of the Start project, his latest initiative to promote recycling, organic farming and a low-waste economy. Harmony is a 330-page manifesto of the Princes ideas on preserving the planet for future generations.         
	He adds: The people of Dharavi manage to separate all their waste at home and it gets recycled without any official collection facilities at all.         
	It is not done in safe conditions and few people would want to do this work  but that is not my point. The real lesson I took from Dharavi was about the vast asset we can call community capital.         
	The slum has built up its own financial sector, with community banking enterprises using the savings of residents to extend loans to borrowers.         
	This works on the basis of personal relationships and the power of the community to ensure the creditworthiness of those who borrow (sometimes in contrast to the recently imploded financial sector in the West).        
	Describing his book as a call to revolution, he alludes to the controversy he expects to follow its publication, saying: It is probably inevitable that if you challenge the bastions of conventional thinking you will find yourself accused of naivety.         
	But he says defiantly that the thought of what would be left of the planet for his children and grandchildren was the main driving force for this book, regardless of how it might be greeted.         
	Not for the first time, he also complains that he has been misunderstood in the past.         
	Perhaps I should not have been surprised that so many people failed to fathom what I was doing, he says. So many appeared to think  or were told  that I was merely leaping from one subject to another  from architecture one minute to agriculture the next  as if I spent a morning saving the rainforests, then in the afternoon jumping to help young people start a new business.         
	What I have actually been trying to demonstrate is that all of these subjects are completely inter-related and that we have to look at the whole picture to understand the problems we face.

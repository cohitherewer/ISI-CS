The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Big names rule on awards list
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Big names rule on awards list
          BEN SISARIO                                    Beyonce becomes the most decorated female on a Grammy night. Collects six trophies, including song of the year for her anthem Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)      
	Los Angeles, Feb. 1: Affirming her role as one of the reigning queens of pop music, Beyonc was the top winner at the 52nd annual Grammy Awards, taking six prizes, including song of the year for her inescapable hit Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).        
	But she shared the spotlight with Taylor Swift, the 20-year-old country-pop singer, who was crowned a new superstar with four wins, including the top prize, album of the year, for Fearless.        
	This is the story were going to be telling over and over again  in 2010, we got to win album of the year at the Grammys, she said while accepting the award.        
	After a punishing decade for the music industry, the voters of the Recording Academy, the organisation that bestows the awards, reversed its recent trend of showering acclaim on modest sellers, sticking instead to the biggest names in entertainment. Right behind Beyonc, with three awards each, were the Black Eyed Peas, a powerhouse of radio-friendly hip-hop, and the alternative rock band the Kings of Leon.                    But another diva, Taylor Swift, nabs the top honor, album of the year, for her best-selling Fearless, becoming the youngest to do so in the category. Swift, who won a total of four awards, jumps around like the 20-year-old kid that she is. Swift breaks an age record held since 1996 by Alanis Morissette, who was 21 when she won for Jagged Little Pill      
	Kings of Leon won record of the year for the boogieing blues-rock song Use Somebody. (The record category is for performers; song of the year recognises songwriters.) Beyoncs Single Ladies also took best R amp;B song and best female R amp;B performance, and her Halo won best female pop vocal performance.        
	The ceremony, packed with splashy performances, celebrated the power of pop celebrity in an age when the foundations of the recording industry are being shaken, and it linked older, established stars with their younger progeny, whose record sales may not be as great but are reaching for the same level of fame.        
	The Grammys are voted on by about 12,000 members of the Recording Academy, who must have credits on at least six commercially released tracks to qualify. To avoid competition with the 2010 Winter Olympics, which begin on February 12 in Vancouver, British Columbia, the awards are being held earlier in the year than they ever have been before, and as a result the window of eligibility for nominations had to be adjusted to 11 months, from October 1, 2008, to August 31, 2009.        
	That change disqualified a number of major albums released in September, including releases by Jay-Z, Barbra Streisand, Miranda Lambert and Mariah Carey.

	For all the power of youth, the Grammys still gave pride of place to older legends. A 3-D tribute to Michael Jackson featured Smokey Robinson, Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson and Carrie Underwood singing along with Jacksons recorded voice in the ecological hymn Earth Song. Jacksons two oldest children, Prince and Paris, accepted their fathers lifetime achievement award. In all his songs, the message was simple: love, Prince said, haltingly. We will continue to spread his message and help the world. Thank you.        
	The memory of Jackson, who died in June, hung over the ceremony as one of its most beloved recipients and as a symbol of a lost megacelebrity.

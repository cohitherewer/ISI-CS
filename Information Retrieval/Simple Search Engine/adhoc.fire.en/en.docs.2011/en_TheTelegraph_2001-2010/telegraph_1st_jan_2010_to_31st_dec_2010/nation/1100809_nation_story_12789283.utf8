The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Church surrogacy battle
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Church surrogacy battle
          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Catholic Church is gearing to fight a proposed law that will allow same-sex couples and single men and women to become parents through surrogacy, on the ground that it will destabilise the family system in the country.        
	The Church will write to all the 14 Christian Lok Sabha MPs asking them to canvass opinion against the bill, to be tabled this monsoon session, regardless of their party line. It also plans to ask priests to discuss the issue during Sunday mass.        
	The Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulation) Bill, 2010, seeks to regulate all forms of assisted reproduction, including test-tube birth and in-vitro fertilisation. The Church opposes all of them.        
	We shall not play God just because technology is available, Syro-Malabar Church spokesman Father Paul Thelakat said.        
	The bill is open to the possibility of gay and lesbian couples becoming parents using assisted reproductive technologies if same-sex relationships are legalised in India.        
	If passed, the bill will make a mockery of the institution of marriage and our value system. We have decided to try out all possible steps to stop the bill and will be writing to all MPs listing the moral and social consequences of the bill. There will be a session with the Christian MPs, Father Thelakat said.        
	Asked whether the MPs would be asked to vote against the bill, the priest said he could not reveal that. But one thing I can tell you, we will be asking the MPs to convey the consequences of the bill to other MPs and also to the higher-ups in their parties, he said.        
	Father Thelakat insisted that this was not just a Christian issue. Ideally, every straight-thinking man should be concerned about the consequences and must raise his voice against the bill, he said.        
	The bill, drafted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, stipulates informed consent from couples, married or unmarried, before they opt for assisted reproductive technology.        
	It defines a couple as two people living together and having a sexual relationship that is legal in India. Under the bill, an unmarried couple means two people of marriageable age living together by mutual consent without getting married in a relationship that is legal in the country or countries of which they are citizens.        
	It adds: The child born to a single woman will be considered her legitimate child and the child born of a single man will be his legitimate child. The birth certificate issued to a baby born through surrogacy will bear the name, or names, of (the) individual or individuals who commissioned the surrogacy, as parents.        
	Couples or individuals using the services of a surrogate mother will be legally bound to accept the custody of the children irrespective of any abnormality the children may have. If a couple, married or unmarried, separate or divorce before the child is born but after they have consented to using assisted reproductive technology, the child will be the couples legitimate offspring.

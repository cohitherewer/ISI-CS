	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Over 80 per cent of crimes in the capital this year were committed by people from Delhi and neighbouring Haryana and only 18 per cent by outsiders, home minister P. Chidambaram might want to know.        
	One rape is reported in Delhi every day, police records also reveal, and three out of four rape accused go scot-free because of slip-ups in the investigation or gaps in the chargesheets.        
	In 2009, Delhi accounted for 14.2 per cent of the total crimes against women in cities across the country  22.4 per cent of rape cases, 30.5 per cent kidnappings and abductions, 15.3 per cent dowry deaths and 15.4 per cent molestation cases.         
	But the conviction rate is less than 5 per cent. Its a matter of great concern, a senior police officer said.         
	Delhi police report to Chidambaram, who this week had blamed crime in the capital on migrants.         
	Most of the rape cases this year  403 complaints have been registered so far, against 414 in 2009  are committed by people from the lower strata and Delhiites were behind most organised crimes, an officer said.         
	A National Crime Records Bureau survey has found that in the past 10 years, crimes against women have increased by over 100 per cent.         
	R.K Kapoor, who practises criminal law at the Supreme Court, said the low conviction rate emboldens criminals.         
	Police do not investigate the cases seriously as they are bogged down with routine law and order duty. In most cases, the accused get enough time to influence investigators. The long trial by overburdened session courts is also a problem, he said.         
	The most important factor in the rise of cases of rape is the growing confidence among culprits that they will get away. This can be ascertained from the pitifully low conviction rate, another lawyer said.         
	In April, an 11-year-old girl was raped and killed by her neighbour in Mehrauli. The police initially refused to file the missing report, delaying the search, a senior officer said. Her decomposed body was found a few days later.         
	A senior officer blamed the delay on forensic laboratories, saying they took too long to send reports.        
	Delhi police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said more cases were being solved but could not give the conviction rate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In health stop India, a New Delhi infection
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In health stop India, a New Delhi infection
          AMIT ROY                      At risk?                          
	London, Aug. 11: Indias ambitions of becoming a major destination for medical tourism suffered a deadly blow today when British health experts warned patients they were at risk of picking up a possibly incurable infection highly resistant to almost all antibiotics.        
	 Perhaps with a unintended sense of irony just before the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, the new gene that apparently enables the rogue bacteria to be almost immune to treatment has been christened New Delhi metallo--lactamase  or NDM, in short.        
	 One of the lead authors of a paper published in the September edition of The Lancet Infectious Diseases was asked today by The Telegraph whether patients from the West were being urged not to seek treatment in Indian hospitals, which had hitherto been promoted as being as good as anything available in the West and sometimes much better and certainly a lot cheaper.        
	 The reply from Timothy R. Walsh, professor of medical microbiology and antimicrobial resistance, School of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology at Cardiff University, was equally blunt.        
	 People should think long and hard before making that decision, he said.        
	 Unless Indias health authorities can allay concerns raised in the paper  and todays report received top billing on the BBC and in the British media in general  the countrys attempt to build itself up into a provider of excellent but relatively cheap medical treatment will be seriously undermined.        
	 Although no hospital has been singled out as having passed infection to patients, the report is bound to be seen as an attack on the lucrative work being done by such institutions as the Apollo group  which enjoys a high reputation in India and abroad.        
	 Despite repeated attempts, the Apollo group has so far declined to comment.        
	 However, its senior directors as well ministers and top bureaucrats in Indias ministry of health will be disturbed to read the advice to the British government as well as patients in the UK.        
	 As a result of the examination of patients who had returned to the UK from India, the report concluded: Several of the UK source patients had undergone elective, including cosmetic, surgery while visiting India or Pakistan. India also provides cosmetic surgery for other Europeans and Americans, and NDM-1 (the infection) will likely spread worldwide. It is disturbing, in context, to read calls in the popular press for UK patients to opt for corrective surgery in India with the aim of saving the NHS money.        
	 As our data show, it added, putting the knife into Indian ambitions, such a proposal might ultimately cost the NHS substantially more than the short-term saving and we would strongly advise against such proposals. The potential for wider international spread of producers and for NDM-1-encoding plasmids to become endemic worldwide, are clear and frightening.        
	 Much of the paper is very technical, intended as it is for doctors and the medical profession but the sense of it is very clear  patients are picking up an infection which doctors in the west are finding hard to cure. Nothing has been said about Indians in India who may also have been infected but are unaware of the fact.        
	 Unless health experts in India can challenge the findings on medical grounds, the suggestion that British doctors are simply resisting the loss of work to India  as happened with outsourcing in the IT world  has to be dismissed. Papers in The Lancet have to be peer reviewed before publication and, in any case, some of the research was done in labs in India before they were further processed and double-checked in the UK.        
	 The pool of patients tested is relatively small  about 50 in the UK  but big enough for British experts to warn that there is a worldwide threat emanating from India.        
	 The rapid emergence of these multi-drug resistant NDM-1 producing bacteria and their potential worldwide spread could herald a period in which antibiotics become redundant and demands very close international monitoring and surveillance, the report said.         
	 In this study, the authors investigated how common the NDM-1 producing antibiotic resistant bacteria are in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan and the importation of these bacteria into the UK via patients returning from these countries, the report explained.        
	 Worryingly, NDM-1-producing bacteria are resistant to many antibiotics including carbapenems, a group of antibiotics generally reserved for use in emergencies and the treatment of infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria, it went on.        
	 The researchers collected bacteria samples from patients from various hospital and community-associated infections in Chennai and Haryana, and from patients referred to the UKs national reference laboratory between 2007 and 2009.        
	 The infection was found in 37 patients from the UK, who travelled to India or Pakistan for medical procedures including cosmetic surgery.        
	 Walsh told The Telegraph that some Pakistani patients had gone to India for surgery.        
	 Study co-author Dr David Livermore, director of antibiotic resistance monitoring at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the UK, said: The findings of this paper show that resistance to one of the major groups of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is widespread in India. This is important because carbapenems were often the last good antibiotics active against bacteria that already were resistant to more standard drugs. We have now also identified bacteria with this type of resistance  NDM  in around 50 patients in the UK. Most, not all, had previously travelled to the Indian subcontinent, and many had received hospital treatment there.        
	 He warned: International travel gives a great potential for spread of resistant bacteria between countries. Few antibiotics remain active against these bacteria. Their spread underscores the need for good infection control in hospitals both in the UK and overseas, and the need for new antibiotic development.        
	 A Department of Health spokesman said: We are working with the HPA on this issue. The HPA alerted the NHS in January and July last year to be vigilant about these bacteria and take appropriate action where necessary. Hospitals need to ensure they continue to provide good infection control to prevent any spread, consider whether patients have recently been treated abroad and send samples to HPA for testing.        
	 The spokesman pointed out: So far there has only been a small number of cases in UK hospital patients. The HPA is continuing to monitor the situation and we are investigating ways of encouraging the development of new antibiotics with our European colleagues.        
	 The Telegraph asked Walsh why India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were all lumped together (since Pakistan and Bangladesh do not attract medical tourists).        
	 He said: I suspect the gene/DNA is present in rivers or maybe wildlife which is why it is (present) in these regions.        
	 It may now be the case that patients in India who are not recovering from illnesses despite prolonged treatment with antibiotics will ask their doctors to review the evidence in the light of the latest findings in London.

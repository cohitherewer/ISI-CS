          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 21: A spy camera was found hidden in a bathroom freshener packet inside a ladies toilet at a call centre in Delhi.        
	An office boy of Home Land Survey Centre, an international call centre selling American products, has been arrested on the charge of planting the camera. The company has around 120 employees, 60 per cent of whom are from the Northeast.         
	Four days ago, some employees noticed a blinking object inside the toilet freshener packet. On closer scrutiny, the object was found to be a camera.         
	When they asked the management to show them the footage recorded on the camera, they were told the company would look into the matter, said Luikang Lamak Maram, the president of the Naga Students Union, which has taken up the employees cause.         
	Maram said the company had told the complainants that they had held an employee guilty of placing the camera inside the toilet. He said he feared the company was involved.         
	The employees have refused to return to work until the issue is resolved.         
	Some of us have seen the footage. The images of women are hazy but I am sure the company is not showing us the entire footage, an employee said.

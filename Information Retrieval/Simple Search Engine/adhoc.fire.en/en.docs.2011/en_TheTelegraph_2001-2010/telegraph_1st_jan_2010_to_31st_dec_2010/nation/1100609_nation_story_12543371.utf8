  - Support from Govindpur        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, June 8: While the Jagatsinghpur district administration is preparing to take up survey in Govindpur village, considered a bastion of anti-Posco plant agitation, around 50 people of the same village today extended their support to the $12 billion project.        
	Some villagers of Govindpur met me, expressed their support to the Posco project and requested me in writing to start survey in the village, Jagatsinghpur district collector Narayan Chandra Jena told The Telegraph.        
	They claimed that most of the residents of the village wanted the project to be set up, but they were scared to express their views because of threat from members of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, said Jena.        
	The villagers, led by Purna Chandra Behera and Babuli Das, invited the administration to start the survey as in other villages.        
	So far, the survey has been completed in five out of seven project-affected villages. Only Govindpur and Dhinkia, considered as the epicentre of the anti-Posco agitation, have not been surveyed.        
	Meanwhile, activists of the samiti have put up barricades and dug up roads, leading to Dhinkia and Govindpur, to prevent entry of survey teams and police.        
	As two rounds of talks between the government and the samiti delegation have failed, the district administration had invited the people of Govindpur for talks to pave way for the survey. People are eager to participate in the talks, but they are terrorised by the samiti members, Jena said.        
	Meanwhile, the police conducted a flag march in Nuagaon bordering Govindpur today to instil confidence in the terrorised people, said a senior police officer.        
	Eight platoons of armed police force have been deployed near Govindpur to prevent any untoward incident, the officer added.        
	On the other hand, the samiti leadership is determined not to allow the survey in strategically located Dhinkia and Govindpur villages. We will not allow the survey and entry of police till our last drop of blood, Sahu said.        
	The samiti is completely opposed to setting up of Posco plant and insisting on relocation of the project.        
	Though Posco had signed an MoU with the state government on June 22, 2005, for setting up of a greenfield steel plant with a capacity of 12MTPA, the project had failed to take off as the anti-plant protesters had put up barricades to prevent entry of government and Posco officials for land acquisition.                    
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had convened a high-level meeting last month following Poscos apparent threat to shift its project and directed the revenue divisional commissioner (central division) to initiate the dialogue process. However, the talks held on May 29 and June 5 failed to break the deadlock.        
	Following failure of talks at the official level, the samiti demanded that the survey work be stopped till the chief minister held direct dialogue with the villagers.

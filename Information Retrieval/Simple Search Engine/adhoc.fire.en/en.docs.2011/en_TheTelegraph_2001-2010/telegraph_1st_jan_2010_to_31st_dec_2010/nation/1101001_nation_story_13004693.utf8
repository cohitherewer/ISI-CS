The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Moderates see opportunity   Muslims to appeal but await Delhi initiative
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Moderates see opportunity     Muslims to appeal but await Delhi initiative
          RASHEED KIDWAI, J.P. YADAV AND G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          A Muslim and a Hindu share a laugh in Ayodhya on the day of the verdict. (PTI)                                        
	Sept. 30: The Ayodhya verdict has stunned the hawks within the Muslim community while it has strengthened the position of moderates who are keen to settle the Mandir-Masjid issue and move ahead.        
	Leading Muslim organisations today came up with a measured reaction to the verdict, adding they would appeal against Allahabad High Courts decision.        
	But All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) insiders told The Telegraph that the possibility of reconciliation based on the high courts order could not be ruled out.        
	However, a lot will depend on the BJPs readiness to permit construction of a mosque in the vicinity of the disputed site and Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs willingness to explore the option of a negotiated settlement.        
	In the next few days, the AIMPLB wants to ascertain if Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi are keen to work out a negotiated settlement or stay aloof. Similarly, the board members also want to gauge the BJPs mood and see if it is willing to tap the Muslim communitys goodwill towards construction of a temple in exchange for permitting a mosque near the disputed site.        
	Earlier, the VHP had been insisting that a mosque cannot be constructed anywhere within five miles of the proposed temple.         
	When the initial points of the courts verdict became public, there was a sense of dismay among the conservative sections of the Muslim community. But by late evening, the drawing rooms and dinning tables in many middle-class Muslim households were abuzz with the possibility of a new mosque next to a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya.        
	There was also a sense of relief that the verdict had more or less dissipated the tension and deep sense of insecurity among Muslims over the past few days.        
	The wakf boards lawyer, Zafaryab Jilani, said that the division of the disputed land among three sides was unacceptable and that his client would approach the Supreme Court. Jilani, however, made it clear that the board was not in a hurry as status quo would be maintained for the next 90 days.        
	Asked if there was a possibility of an amicable solution after the court ruling, Jilani did not rule it out but said that there should first be such a proposal. We are open to an amicable solution, provided there is a proposal for it. But we are not going to accept any proposal for surrender, Jilani added.        
	Jilani said the judgment was partly disappointing but urged Muslims not to breach peace as there was an option for appeal in the Supreme Court. He underscored that the AIMPLB would study the judgment in detail before the appeal.        
	Sources said the AIMPLB was still debating if belligerence would help the Muslim cause in the long run. Already whispers are doing the rounds that Jilani consistently misled the top clergy into believing that the wakf board was on firm footing on its title suit that was thrown out today.        
	Jilani, however, insisted that the court had not rejected the stand that a mosque existed at the spot and underlined that the appeal would be filed as a matter of right. We believe this is a mosque and do not agree that Ram Lalla was born at the spot. We are not surrendering. We will appeal, he said.                    Javed Akhtar    
	AIMPLB spokesperson S.Q.R. Iliyas said the board did not subscribe to the balancing act of the bench, adding that the apex court would be approached. He, however, pointed out that an emergency meeting of the boards working committee had been convened to take the final view.        
	But sources close to AIMPLB chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi and vice-president Maulana Kalbe Sadiq feel that leading Sunni and Shia clerics do not relish the prospects of stretching the Ayodhya dispute too far.        
	In 2003, Nadvi had worked closely with the Kanchi Shankaracharya to thresh out a negotiated settlement. The common ground was based on the principle of mandir banao, masjid banao where the Muslims were supposed to agree to the construction of a temple around the disputed site and a new mosque nearby.        
	The move was scuttled under pressure from Hindutva hardliners but, significantly, Nadvi had then not insisted on the mosque at the exact site when it had fallen on December 6, 1992.        
	Rajya Sabha member and lyricist Javed Akhtar, too, shares Nadvi-Sadiqs keenness for early resolution.        
	Akhtar, who is known for his plain-speaking, said: We need to ponder if it is better to have the verdict 10 years later going in favour of a particular community or use the high courts idea of peaceful coexistence? I feel the high court has given us a wonderful opportunity to resolve the dispute amicably, he said.        
	Syed Shahabuddin, a working committee member of the board and also a member of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, expressed surprise over the judgment and stressed that only the final judicial verdict would be accepted.        
	Within the AIMPLB, Shahabuddin is sidelined and considered a spent force.        
	Assaduddin Owaisi, the Hyderabad MP and the president of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) said the verdict was not anti-Muslim but had hugely disappointed the community.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 18: The CPM has steered clear of both the Chinese and Russian lines at least on one count: the posthumous affairs of its leaders.        
	The CPM feels that Basu would not have approved of emulating the Soviet or the Chinese communist parties which have preserved the bodies of Lenin and Mao Zedong.        
	This is not our partys culture and nor would Jyoti Basu have approved of it. We dont believe in icon-worshipping. Unlike many other parties ruling at the Centre and in the states, we have not named streets or state government projects after our other founding leaders like Muzaffar Ahmed and Promode Dasgupta, said CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim.         
	Basu had said a few years ago that his body should be donated for medical education.         
	Basu perhaps is the only front-ranking communist leader who chose to donate his body to a medical school. Karl Marx, the founder of modern communism, is buried in London.         
	Both Lenin and Mao, the two most influential communists of the last century, lie embalmed in their respective mausoleums, at Red Square in Moscow and Tiananmen Square in Beijing, open to public viewing.        
	Joseph Stalins body was kept next to Lenins for a while after his death in 1953. But the Soviet leader was later removed, in October 1961, as part of de-Stalinisation and Khrushchevs Thaw, and buried outside the walls of the Kremlin.        
	Chinese communist leader Deng Xiaoping, the reformer who led his country towards a market economy, wished his organs to be donated for research. His remains were cremated and ashes scattered over the seas.         
	The first Chinese premier Zhou Enlais body was also cremated and his ashes scattered from air over the hills, according to his wishes.        
	Communist leaders in India such as E.M.S. Namboodiripad and Harkishen Surjeet Singh were cremated.

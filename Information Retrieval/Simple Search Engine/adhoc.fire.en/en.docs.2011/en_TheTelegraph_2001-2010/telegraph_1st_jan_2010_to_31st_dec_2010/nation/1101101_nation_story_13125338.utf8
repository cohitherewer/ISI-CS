                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Left gets a straw in Kerala
                            
	Kozhikode, Oct. 31 (PTI): The CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala today retained the Kozhikode city corporation and two municipalities in the district after losses in the civic polls, ahead of next years Assembly elections.        
	As the poll process concluded, the LDF was back in power in three of the five city corporations, losing two to the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).         
	Results for 13 of the 14 districts were declared last week, giving a thumping win to the UDF in urban as well as rural areas.         
	The counting for Kozhikode district was delayed as polling in the Velam division was held only yesterday because of a court order. The LDF bagged 42 of the 75 seats in Kozhikode.         
	The LDF also held sway in two municipalities in the district  Vatakara and Koilandy with comfortable margins. At Vadakara, of the 47 seats, the LDF got 27 and in Koilandy it won 23, leaving seven berths for the UDF and two for the BJP.         
	Of the 59 municipalities, the UDF has a clear upper hand establishing majority in 34 seats with the LDF managing to win 14. In the other 11 municipalities, the elections threw up hung councils.

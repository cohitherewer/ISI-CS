          GAJINDER SINGH                          Indian Army soldiers near Kargil in May 1999. (AFP)                                  
	Chandigarh, May 27: A Kargiler expose is ticking for the army.        
	Sacked officer Brigadier Surinder Singh will bare all in a book expected to be released shortly.        
	Asked about todays report in The Telegraph about the distortion of the records of the 1999 conflict, Singh said: I cannot add more to what I have had to say in the book and will speak only after it is released.        
	The sacked brigadier, however, said the Armed Forces Tribunal was correct in its assessment of Brigadier Devinder Singh who, like him, had informed superiors about the intrusions in the Kargil sector.        
	But Lt Gen. Kishan Pal, a superior of the now-retired Brigadier Devinder Singh, who commanded the Batalik sector, doctored his battle performance report and the after-action report that went into the writing of the official history of the war. The tribunal has said the Kargil history should be re-written as some generals had distorted facts.        
	That is the way it was, Surinder Singh said. The Kargil conflict had led to the death of over 500 soldiers. Surinder Singh was dismissed for allegedly failing to detect intrusions by Pakistani troops in the Kargil sector in 1999.        
	He had in 2004 termed the Subhramanyam Committee report on the conflict as one-sided and called for a fresh review.        
	According to Surinder Singh, his warnings had centred on infiltration, not conventional engagement. The Subhramanyam panel had not included the fourth hearing where, he claimed, he had detailed the sequence of events till his removal from the sector.        
	The report is one-sided and aims to protect those who allowed the situation to get out of hand. I had apprised everyone, all senior officers, about the enhanced threat perceptions in the Kargil sector, the former officer said.        
	The brigadier, who is hard of hearing in his right ear because of the constant sound of shelling his brigade had to bear during the conflict, said his assessment was not taken seriously and he was termed an alarmist.        
	Despite documented evidence of his briefings to even the then army chief General V.P. Malik, he said he was made a scapegoat and deprived of command.         
	Malik could not be contacted for his comments as he was away from Panchkula, the town near Chandigarh where he resides.        
	Interestingly, Surinder Singhs superiors had rated him an excellent officer until he began to raise questions about their handling of the Kargil crisis.         
	For instance, the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division (the formation to which the 121 brigade under Singh was assigned), Major General V.S. Budhwar, commented in his confidential report of July 8, 1999: He (Brigadier Surinder Singh) has displayed professional resolve in executing op (operational) tasks. He followed professional advice and has instituted measures to minimise damage to own assets in the bde (brigade) sect (sector) due to enemy fire. On discovery of the armed intrusion by Pakistan into unheld areas of the bde sector, he acted swiftly, blunted the designs of the enemy by containing the intrusion and set the stage for further operations.

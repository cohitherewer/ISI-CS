	New Delhi, Jan. 15 (PTI): The Supreme Court today said a daily allowance had been provided in the past for the spouses of the chief justice and other apex court judges on foreign tours, rejecting the governments stand that they were not entitled to it.        
	The court registry came out with the statement  considered unusual because such formal rejoinders are rare  a day after the government said in response to a right to information (RTI) application that there was only a provision for spouses air tickets and no other allowance.        
	(The) government has been providing daily allowance not only to the spouse of the CJI but also to the spouses of other judges of the Supreme Court as and when they go abroad, Sup- reme Court secretary-general M.P. Bhadran said in the statement.        
	He was reacting to reports that the court had sought a revision of a justice department sanction order that had declined any allowance to the chief justices wife when she accompanied him to Dublin and London last October.        
	According to practice, the sanction for daily allowance is given before a trip.         
	Bhadran said since the government had declined the allowance, a request was made to provide it as had been done in the past. The request is only to issue revised sanction order allowing daily allowance to the spouse of the CJI and that is not against the practice so far followed.        
	Since Indian Foreign Service officers enjoy the facility, it had been extended to the judges spouses, he added.         
	However, foreign ministry officials said their spouses did not get any separate allowances.        
	Bhadran had asked the justice department secretary to look into the plea for allowance personally and issue a revised sanction allowing $75 a day to the CJIs wife.

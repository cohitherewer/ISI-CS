          SUBHASHISH MOHANTY                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 27: The state government is planning to showcase the unexplored Buddhist circuit, particularly the diamond circuit of Lalitgiri-Ratnagiri-Udaygiri, to woo tourists from Southeast Asia and other parts of the continent.        
	We have a number of Buddhist sites in the state. To attract tourists from Southeast Asia, Japan and other countries, we have approached Thai Airways to connect Bhubaneswar. They have responded positively, S.K. Rath, additional resident commissioner of the state government in New Delhi, told The Telegraph.        
	At present, Thai Airways has direct link to prominent Buddhist sites like Varanasi and Bodh Gaya.         
	Thai Airways has sought specific information about the tourist inflow to the state, particularly that of Buddhist tourists, sources said. In 2009, 45,684 foreign tourists  mostly from Japan, South Korea and China  visited Orissa.        
	State tourism director T. Ao said a high-level Thai delegation had already visited the state in February and tried to explore the tourism potential here.         
	In order to promote Buddhist tourism, we are planning to organise roadshows in Bangkok and other parts of Southeast Asia and other countries, he said, adding that the department had already organised a roadshow in Shanghai in China.        
	Meanwhile, the state government has requested the Centre to allow it to organise the next Buddhist conclave in February 2011. We have gained mileage after the Dalai Lama inaugurated a monastery at Chandragiri, he said, adding that Orissa would continue to promote Buddhist tourism.

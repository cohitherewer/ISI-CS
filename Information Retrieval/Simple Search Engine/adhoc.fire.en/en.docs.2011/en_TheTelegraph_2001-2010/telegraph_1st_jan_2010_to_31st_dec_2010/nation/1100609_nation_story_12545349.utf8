The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spat over action on army spy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spat over action on army spy
  - Questions raised on   skipping secrets act        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                           
	New Delhi, June 8: The defence and home ministries appear locked in a spat over why a major suspected of having passed on sensitive information to Pakistan wasnt booked under the official secrets act.        
	Major Santanu Dey, who was posted in Port Blair, is suspected to have passed on 2,500 presentations with sensitive information about the army to Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence. The presentations had information about the army on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and in Kashmir and Punjab, home ministry sources said.        
	The National Investigation Agency (NIA) and military intelligence sleuths are questioning Dey. The Intelligence Bureau has also quizzed him, the sources said, adding a case of espionage would be slapped later.        
	Why were provisions of the official secrets act not slapped against him in the first place in Andaman and Nicobar? The information on his computer was way beyond what should have been accessible to him. So the army should have taken action, said a senior home ministry official.        
	The information should have been accessible only to someone above the rank of brigadier, the sources said. The army had smelt a rat when details about a brigadier visiting the US, including his photograph, were found on Deys computer.         
	After that, Dey had been summoned to Delhi but the major apparently deleted the presentations and told his seniors that the files were damaged by a virus.         
	But what has set off the alarm bells now is the revelation that some computer files were deleted from Deys personal laptop after he was taken into the armys custody, fuelling suspicion that others were involved.        
	The Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Hyderabad has given the dates on which the files were deleted. The dates are after the major was taken into custody, said a home ministry source. The source also pointed out that the hard disk did not go back into Deys possession after the computer was taken into the armys custody. That may even put some generals in the army headquarters under the scanner.        
	The army has denied the files were deleted at its headquarters. It had even claimed earlier this month that it was a case of hacking, but did not book the major.         
	So much is the apparent distrust that the NIA has not handed over the CFSL report to the army, the sources said.        
	Home ministry officials further questioned why the army had not been able to prevent officers from using computers on the forces intranet. It is prohibited, said a ministry official.         
	Following the incident, the army last week circulated an internal note asking officers to not use their personal laptops on the intranet.

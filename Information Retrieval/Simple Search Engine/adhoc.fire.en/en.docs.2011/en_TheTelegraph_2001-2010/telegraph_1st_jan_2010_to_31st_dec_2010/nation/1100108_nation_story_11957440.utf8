          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Indias technical education regulator will no longer inspect any existing institutions approved by it unless it receives complaints against them, under a policy shift that seeks to abandon decades of a corruption-tainted inspection regime.         
	New technical institutions seeking approval from the All India Council for Technical Education will be inspected just once, at the time they apply for recognition, under reforms announced today by the government.         
	We want to end the inspector raj that has governed the functioning of the AICTE, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said at a briefing where the policy shifts were announced.         
	The reforms plan to use technology to substitute for regular inspections to ensure quality  minimising human intervention would reduce chances of corruption, Sibal and the AICTE argued.         
	The reforms also include relaxing land requirements and student strength norms for technical institutions, and making the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) independent of the AICTE. The NBA is the countrys sole technical education rating agency and needs complete autonomy for India to be accepted into an elite club of nations that accept each others degrees under a pact called the Washington Accord.         
	Technology will also be used to put in place an internal regulatory mechanism within the AICTE to keep constant checks on file movement within the agency.         
	This, Sibal and the AICTE argued, would help pinpoint officials guilty of not acting on particular files for reasons that may stem from corruption.         
	The AICTE grants time-bound approval to technical education institutions  offering courses in fields like engineering, management, chartered accountancy or architecture  if it is satisfied that they meet required quality norms.         
	At present, technical institutions are physically inspected by a visiting expert panel each time they seek re-approval by the AICTE. Re-approval is granted by the AICTE based on the report of the visiting panel.         
	But this mechanism has repeatedly been criticised, with AICTE officials accused of sending visiting experts suggested by the institute itself  to ensure a favourable report.         
	In several cases, visiting experts are known to have received material gifts from the institute they visited.         
	Conversely, institutes have accused the AICTE of using the inspection mechanism to deliberately ensure an adverse report  if the institute did not participate in corruption.         
	Under a self-disclosure mechanism that will be launched on the AICTE website on January 10, institutes will now have to fill online forms providing details on their infrastructure, ownership, faculty, courses, fee and students.         
	Along with the form, institutes will have to attach a list of essential documents that will be scrutinised by the AICTE.         
	Crucially, the form and the documents will need to be accompanied by an electronically attached affidavit signed by the institute committing to the correctness of the information submitted, AICTE acting chairman S.S. Mantha said.         
	This affidavit, to be signed before a judicial magistrate, will be our quality security because if the institute is found to be lying, it can be hauled up before court, Mantha said after the briefing.         
	Each institute will be assigned a unique identity number when it fills the online form. The information on the form, once submitted, gets locked and cannot be altered either by the institute or by the AICTE, officials said.         
	A grievance system will be a part of the AICTE website. Students can complain about institutions or individual officers or teachers.         
	Unlike at present, the AICTE will no longer inspect an institution at the time of its application for renewal of approval  which will also be done through the self-disclosure mechanism.         
	But the AICTE will reserve the right to inspect institutions if it receives complaints against them.         
	The inspection team will be randomly picked by a computer from a database of experts from the concerned field of study, to avoid allegations that pliant experts were picked, Sibal said.         
	Institutes will have to place  on their websites  details of all their faculty and students.         
	The AICTE will assign a unique ID number to each teacher and each student at every approved institution. These IDs must be displayed by the institute alongside details placed on the website.         
	This will in turn help the AICTE ensure that education conglomerates do not boost the stated faculty strength of their individual institutions by listing the same teachers in multiple institutions.         
	At present, institutions need a minimum land area of 3 acres in cities and 5 acres in metros for AICTE approval. They will now need 2 acres in cities and 4 acres in metros.         
	Engineering institutions cannot have student strength in excess of 240 and management institutions cannot have an intake of more than 60 students at present, in order to obtain AICTE approval.         
	Under the new rules, engineering institutions can have an intake of up to 300 while management institutions can admit up to 120 students.

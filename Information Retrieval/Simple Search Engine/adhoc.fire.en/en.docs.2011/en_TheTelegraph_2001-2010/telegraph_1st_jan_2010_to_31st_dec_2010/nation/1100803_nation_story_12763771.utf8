	Shimla, Aug. 2 (PTI): Central and state government employees will get 10 per cent additional dearness allowance from July 1 this year on the basis of retail price inflation.        
	The annual moving averages of the consumer price index for industrial workers (CPI-IW), which determines the revision of DA in January and July every year, has risen to 167.9 points.        
	Central and state government employees, who are paid DA linked to the CPI-IW, will get 45 per cent of their basic pay as DA from July 1.        
	It had increased by 8 per cent in January 2010 and with the latest increase, the hike in the past 12 months (July 2009 to June 2010) will be 18 per cent, the highest ever after the launch of the new series of CPI-IW in 2000.

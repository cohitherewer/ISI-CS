          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Swaraj Puri. File picture                                  
	Bhopal, June 15: The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has told a former Bhopal police chief to step down from a panel  the first such step against any official whose actions after the gas tragedy have come under a cloud.         
	Swaraj Puri was Bhopals superintendent of police when, on December 7, 1984, he was asked by the then chief secretary to safely escort then Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson to the airport.         
	Just a few hours earlier, Puri had arrested Anderson for the gas leak.        
	Madhya Pradesh was then ruled by the Congress government led by Arjun Singh.        
	Today, Puri received another directive from his political masters, this time from the opposite camp. He was asked to quit as member of the Grievances Redressal Authority (GRA), which looks after ongoing irrigation projects in the Narmada Valley.         
	The states parliamentary affairs minister Narottam Mishra confirmed Puris exit. Chief minister Shivraj Singh (Chauhan) has decided to remove him (Puri) as as member of the GRA in the light of reports that he facilitated the safe exit of Anderson shortly after the Bhopal gas tragedy.         
	There was no reaction from Puri, who lost his brother a few days ago.        
	In several police stations in Bhopal, activists have filed cases against Puri, the then district collector Moti Singh and then chief minister Arjun Singh on the charge of facilitating Andersons safe exit from Bhopal, four days after the gas leak.        
	A private complaint has been filed before chief judicial magistrate R.G. Singh by advocate Furkhan Khan demanding registration of a criminal case against Arjun for allegedly allowing Anderson to leave Bhopal. Another private complaint was filed today by Abdul Jabbar, convener of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan, against Moti Singh and Puri for allegedly facilitating the safe exit of the Union Carbide boss.         
	The Chauhan government has also decided to turn the heat on former Supreme Court Chief Justice A.M. Ahmadi, who heads the board of trustees of the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre.         
	The government has questioned Ahmadis move to sanction free treatment to the hospitals board members and their families.         
	Chief secretary Avni Vaish and health secretary Sudhir Ranjan Mohanty, who are members of the board, have written to Ahmadi, stating that such a move is a violation of the trusts deed. They claimed that Ahmadi got the free treatment provision passed in their absence during a trust meeting in March this year.         
	In October 1991, the Supreme Court had directed Union Carbide to construct a 500-bed hospital equipped with modern facilities to take care of the gas leak survivors.         
	The company had earlier approached a Bhopal trial court for releasing the shares of its Indian subsidiary for building the hospital but its application was rejected with the observation that the funds for the construction should come from Union Carbides own coffers and the shares of the Indian subsidiary would remain attached until the accused appeared in court.         
	In November 1994, ignoring objections from NGOs, a Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ahmadi overruled the Bhopal court order and allowed Union Carbide to sell its shares to raise the money for the hospital.         
	Two years later, Justice Ahmadi diluted the charges against the Indian officials of the company from Section 304 (Part 2) of the IPC, which carries a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment to Section 304A, providing for maximum punishment of two years.         
	A review petition was filed by activist N.D. Jayaprakash, but Ahmadi dismissed it on March 10, 1997, a fortnight before he retired.         
	When it was recently pointed out to him, Ahmadi remarked: One person says he filed a review; thousands of such petitions come before the court. How do you expect me to remember a particular petition?        
	After his retirement in 1997, Ahmadi succeeded Sir Ian Percival as chairman of the Union Carbides Bhopal Hospital Trust.

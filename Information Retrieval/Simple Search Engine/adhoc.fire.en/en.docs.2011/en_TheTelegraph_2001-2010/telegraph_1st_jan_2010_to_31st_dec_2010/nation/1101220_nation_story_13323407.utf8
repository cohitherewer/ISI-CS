	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Manmohan, Sonia, Rahul.... held up by Bobby, Lalu, Bhairon.        
	Just below the huge pictures of the triumvirate, the plenary banners feature small mugshots of local party officials who put them up, complete with their pet names.        
	Its all a bit too much for a 60-something delegate from Gorakhpur. Yeh sab Congressi hain (are these Congress people)? he asks. His own name? Im Dubey, a Brahmin, he preens.        
	His mood turns sour after realising the public bus has dropped him 4.5km from the main entrance. Ive come here just to meet an obligation to the party, he grumbles.        
	Badauns Suresh Goswami stands out in his tattered tricolour kurta and bandanna and array of shells and beads. Ive been coming for 22 years. Everyone knows me. I dress like this for the leaders to recognise me.        
	A group wearing We want Telangana scarves wants to be recognised too  correctly. Were from Telangana, not Andhra, one explains.        
	Its all about identity  the passes the police want to check, Goswamis attire, perhaps Dubeys Brahmin. Can religion be far behind? The Indian flag is my religion, screams a banner showing a smiling Rahul. A lady in white has no passes but wants to meet Sonia because the Lord is coming. Police, whore you to stop me? Will you stop me when Judgement Day comes? she asks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Ramachandra Guha                                   
	New Delhi, May 18: Author Ramachandra Guha and others today condemned the Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh but in a letter of appeal also said any strategy based on violence will prove counter-productive.         
	Guha, along with Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar and retired bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma, appealed to the government to reach out to the tribals by announcing and implementing a policy that recognises their constitutional rights.        
	We feel that any strategy based on violence will prove counter-productive in the long run. We firmly believe that democratic processes alone will yield a positive outcome in these areas where the extent of violence seems to be on the increase, the statement said.        
	As co-petitioners in a PIL before the Supreme Court (WP 250/2007) urging the end of civil strife in Chhattisgarh, we write to express our shock and horror at the detonation of a bus in Dantewada district by Maoists, the statement said.         
	They condemned such senseless and inhuman violence and those responsible for it. Violence has no place in a democracy and those that adopt violent means to express themselves cannot and should not be condoned in any manner whatsoever.

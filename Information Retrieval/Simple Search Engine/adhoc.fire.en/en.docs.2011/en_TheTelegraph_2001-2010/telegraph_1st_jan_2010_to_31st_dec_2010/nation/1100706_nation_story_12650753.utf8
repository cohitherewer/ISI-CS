The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | HC notice to army on lady officers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      HC notice to army on lady officers
                            
	New Delhi, July 5 (PTI): Delhi High Court today issued a contempt notice to the army chief after the force failed to comply with its order of granting permanent commission to serving women officers recruited for short-service commission.         
	Justice G.S. Sistani also sought a response from the secretary, defence ministry, by August 18.        
	General V.K. Singh is the current army chief, but the order was passed on March 12 when his predecessor Deepak Kapoor was in office.        
	Todays contempt notice came on a petition by Lt Colonel Sangita Sardana and other women officers alleging the force had failed to grant them permanent commission. Rekha Palli, the counsel for officers, argued that contempt proceedings should be initiated against the army for wilful disobedience.        
	In May, the court had stayed the armys decision to release from service the next batch of such women officers.        
	The counsel pointed out that the air force had complied with the court directive  which was meant for all defence services  last month. But the army has failed to make its stand clear and, instead, decided to release some officers of the next batch despite the stay order, the counsel claimed.        
	The March 12 order had come on a batch of petitions filed by more than 60 serving and retired lady officers.         
	There were also male officers performing the same task. If the male officers can be granted permanent commission, there is no reason why equally capable women officers cannot be granted permanent commission. It is not a charity sought by the women officers but their own constitutional rights, the court had said.        
	The judges had rejected the governments argument that permanent commission can be allowed only for future recruitment and the benefit cannot be given retrospectively for the lady officers who had filed the petition.         
	These women officers have served the armed forces well in the areas of operation they were recruited for and have worked in this capacity for 14 to 15 years. They deserve better from the respondents (the government), the court had said.

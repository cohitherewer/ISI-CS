          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar being greeted by visitors at his residence in Patna on Friday (picture by Deepak Kumar) and (right) Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan                                  
	Patna, Jan. 1: The aam admi battling price hike is likely to get daal-roti at relatively cheaper rates and may be even a bonanza from the political dispensation in 2010, christened as Election Year in Bihar.         
	With timely winter rain, the production of rabi crops including wheat and pulses is likely to rise by 25 per cent in the state this year, according to experts. That may bring daal and roti to residents at affordable rates this year.        
	But the year will also be a challenging time for the triumvirate of Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan who have been at the centre of Bihars politics for nearly two decades now.        
	While Nitish will fight to retain his position as Bihar chief minister, Lalu and Paswan have already turned aggressive to wrest power from the NDA.        
	The chief minister used New Years-eve to hold a cabinet meeting at Rajgir only to announce that the salaries of over six lakh state employees  they will man poll booths  were being brought at par with the recommendations of the sixth pay commission.        
	Lalu, meanwhile, visited villages on the outskirts of Patna, asking people to uproot the Nitish government for causing the price rise on New Years eve.        
	The wily RJD boss has given a call for a Bihar bandh on January 28, which his ally, the LJP, has effectively supported. The LJP-RJD combination expects the Lefts support on the issue that has troubled private sector employees suffering salary cuts or retrenchments as well as farmers and workers due to protracted recession in the year gone by.        
	In fact, the political developments in the past year have created an interesting platform in 2010 for Nitish, Lalu and Paswan.        
	After losing to Nitish in November 2005, Lalu and Paswan also lost power in the April/May Lok Sabha polls with the RJD boss also losing his railway ministry at the Centre and Paswan losing his Hajipur Lok Sabha seat.        
	But the RJD boss bounced back with the RJD-LJP combination winning nine of the 18 seats against NDAs five in the September by-election that was dubbed a semi-final to the final clash in October-November.        
	The ruling JD(U) in Bihar was reduced from five in the last Assembly polls in neighbouring Jharkhand to two, giving Lalu  who won five seats  a much needed boost to carry on his fight against Nitish.        
	But Nitish, who has earned the tag of a performing chief minister with decent roads coming up all across the state, quick improvements on the law and order front and schools, health centres and tourism facilities gaining strength, will not let it be an easy war. Cash for students up to Class VIII for buying cycles and uniforms has already reached households in the hinterlands. Women, who constitute almost 50 per cent of the states voters, have got 50 per cent reservations in local bodies at the grassroots.        
	The Congress has emerged as a new force giving a tough time to the triumvirate, in its battle for maintaining supremacy in the state.         
	Year 2010 is also set to test if the political power in the state stays confined among the triumvirate.        
	 or the Congress under the stewardship of Rahul Gandhi emerges as the fourth power centre after almost 20 years.

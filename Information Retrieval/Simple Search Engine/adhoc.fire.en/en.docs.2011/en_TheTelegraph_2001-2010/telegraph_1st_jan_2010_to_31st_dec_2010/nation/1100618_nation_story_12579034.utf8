          OUR BUREAU                                            
	June 17: The Sothebys auction on Tuesday has underlined that even Tagore cannot push Bengal art up the sales charts in the international market.        
	A work by the poet fetched Rs 2.13 crore, squeezing past the previous Bengal record of Rs 2.11 crore by Jogen Chowdhury, yet it was nowhere close to the Rs 14.18 crore raked in by S.H. Razas Saurashtra or the prices commanded recently by F.N. Souza or M.F. Husain.        
	So, why does Bengal art lack high-paying buyers?        
	One undeniable reason is the lack of publicity. Artists from Mumbai and Delhi are backed heavily by the galleries there which do all the promotional work for them. This is why artists from the rest of India such as Bengal and the south lag behind, said Vikram Bachhawat, director of Aakriti art gallery and Emami Chisel, which held the first art auctions in Calcutta in 2007 and 2008.        
	Besides, international art fairs keep in touch with artists in Delhi and Mumbai, and the two international auction houses, Christies and Sothebys, have their representatives there, Bachhawat said.        
	 Ten years ago, at international sales, Rabindranath, Jamini Roy and Hemen Majumdar fetched higher prices than Souza and Raza, said Prakash Kejriwal, who runs the oldest art gallery in Calcutta.        
	But now those who are backing the Progressive Artists like Husain, Souza and Raza have raised their prices abroad. It is the promotional game.        
	Helen Collier of Sothebys confirmed Kejriwals view in an email: Husain, Souza and Raza have had an established international profile and following for a longer period of time and this is a consequence of them studying and working abroad during their lifetime.        
	Its not all about promotion, though. The artists from Mumbai and Delhi are more market savvy than their Bengal counterparts and their art often follows international trends. Their work also reflect themes that the buyers, mostly ethnic Indians, can easily relate to, Kejriwal said.        
	Rich Bengalis in IT and finance have mostly ignored art from their region. It is only in the Sothebys auction that Dr Avijit Lahiri picked up a Tagore, Kejriwal added.        
	One reason could be that the Bengali industrialist prefers drawing room art or goes for the old masters such as Gopal Ghosh and Jamini Roy. Perhaps the Bengali professional has limited interests outside his field of work.        
	If the artists from elsewhere know the market, so do the buyers there. Much of the purchase outside Bengal is done by investors rather than collectors. Professional investors are still not very large in eastern India.        
	The Bengali intelligentsia probably lacks the money to buy paintings or is left cold by the visual arts.        
	Paritosh Sens claim about Bengalis disinterest in the visual arts is borne out by the virtual absence of debate on art among Bengals intellectuals, who tend to split hairs and take sides on every issue.         
	There is no Jogen Chowdhury vs Ganesh Pyne debate in a state once divided into Tagore and Saratchandra  or Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak  camps. Nor does art evoke the sort of avid interest that once surrounded the famous debate between Ray and film critic Chidananda Dasgupta, resulting in a spate of letters to a newspaper.        
	Pyne and Bikash Bhattacharjee earned appreciation in Delhi and Mumbai a good decade before Calcutta discovered them. As a noted art connoisseur said: Isnt it surprising that Sailoz Mukherjee, the greatest of all Bengali artists, is virtually unknown?        
	If NRI buyers can relate to the works of Raza or Husain, perhaps Bengali art is too cerebral for the popular taste?        
	How the market perceives a work of art and how the academic world perceives it may not match. Great artists are not always sold at the values they deserve, said Shiva Kumar, Santiniketan-based art historian.         
	Kumar cited the example of Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee, both of whose works were undervalued in the market although their historical and cultural significance is high.        
	Others, however, may accuse the Bengali artist of having got derailed into pursuing nationalist art, aptly called the Bengal revivalist movement, which produced a pale kind of work. The Left-leaning art of the 1960s too left people outside Bengal cold.        
	By the time Pyne, Bikash and Chowdhury began striking out on their own, the market had practically been lost.        
	Arun Vadhera, who represents Christies in India, however, said: Prices depend on the quality of work. Indifferent works fetch indifferent prices. In the past three or four years no great Ganesh Pyne has come up because collectors have not parted with one.        
	Is it possible that Bengal simply never had painters of the class of Husain, Tyeb or Souza? Or that Tagore was not much of an artist qua artist, his paintings selling because of his overall cultural pre-eminence rather than their intrinsic merit? According to Vadhera, the Tagores auctioned at Sothebys were not as good as the ones with the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in Delhi.        
	It isnt just quality  medium and size, too, matter, Bengals artists say.        
	Arpita Singh said from Delhi she mostly did watercolours and small drawings, and one of these recently fetched Rs 90 lakh. She said Razas work that broke the record was good but quite large as well. And if there is a healthy demand for the Progressive Groups paintings, its also true that not all of Husains work sells.        
	Chowdhury wants to remind the nay-sayers that an 11in by 15in work of his sold for Rs 56 lakh. Even Pynes works are quite high-priced considering their size.        
	Husain and the new-generation artists like Jitish Kallat and Atul Dodiya go for size; Chowdhury says he has done few large paintings.        
	Sothebys Collier agrees with Chowdhury: We have, though, seen some fantastic prices for Bengali artists in recent years and their works are continually setting new benchmarks at auctions. Just last year we set a new record for Jogen Chowdhury and, of course, two days ago we established a new record for Somnath Hore (Rs 1.08 crore for the bronze khanjani player) as well.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                            
	Lucknow, Feb. 20: Salman Khans advice didnt have any effect on the young woman. The 21-year-old engineering student hanged herself yesterday because she wasnt doing well in her studies.        
	Pragati Singh wanted to study commerce but her widowed mother wanted her to be an engineer, police said.        
	It was the 32nd suicide by a student in Uttar Pradesh since January 20, and exactly a month after Salman had appealed to youths not to let academic failures get the better of them.        
	Before the next suicide happens, its better that parents sit and talk to children and advise them that they should study. But at the same time they should say that if its not happening, if you dont pass, then its okay, it will happen next time, the actor had said in Mumbai on January 19, prompted by the high suicide rate among students in Maharashtra, where 20 students killed themselves between January 1 and 11.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, a report by the state crime bureau said of the 5,000 suicides last year, 1,920 were by students. Some 1,840 students were among the 4,008 who killed themselves in 2008. It has prompted the Mayavati government to set up a committee headed by the Lucknow University vice-chancellor to look into the reasons.        
	On February 16, the government announced the panel consisting of psychiatrists, social scientists and academics.        
	 Police sources said students in Uttar Pradesh appeared to be caught in a mismatch between talent and their parents ambitions. Greater Noida superintendent of police (city) Awadesh Kumar Vijaita, who is investigating Pragatis suicide, said the Varanasi girl wasnt doing too well in her studies.        
	She had lost her father. Her mother wanted to see her as a successful engineer. But she herself admitted in a letter that she was unfit for the subject. She wanted to study commerce and felt she was losing out on a career, Vijaita said.        
	A day before the student of electronics and communication hanged herself from the ceiling of her hostel on the campus of the Visheshwariya Institute of Technology in Dadri near Greater Noida, another 21-year-old drank poison.        
	Pankaj Pandey left a note saying failure in exams was the prime reason to end my life.

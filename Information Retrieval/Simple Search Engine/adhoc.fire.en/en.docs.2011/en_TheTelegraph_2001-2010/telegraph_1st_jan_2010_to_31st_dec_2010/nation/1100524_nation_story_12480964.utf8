The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IAF finger at crash pilot

          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	Bangalore, May 23: The Indian Air Force has dismissed suggestions that the tabletop airstrip in Mangalore makes for tough landings and take-offs that puts passengers and aircraft at risk.        
	Voices from within the aviation community are also indicating that pilot error may have caused the crash.        
	Everybody (airlines) have been landing there. There have been thousands of landings and take-offs from there, the vice-chief of air staff, Air Marshal P.K. Barbora, said here today. Barbora was the chief guest at an event here to mark the inaugural flight of a helicopter gunship that defence public sector Hindustan Aeronautics claims has been indigenously designed and developed.         
	Defence minister A.K. Antony was expected here but cancelled his visit to mourn the deaths of passengers in the Air India crash in Mangalore yesterday.        
	I think the inquiry report will be able to come out with the findings in detail, Air Marshal Barbora said.        
	The former chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal (retired) Fali Major, also asked for pilots to be more vigilant.        
	This is a crash whose cause could be quite easily found out because there are witnesses, he said. Major also warned that pilots with years of experience could also get complacent.        
	The pilot of the Air India flight that crashed had more than 10,000 hours of flying. The co-pilot had also made 66 landings at Mangalore.        
	No matter how senior pilots are and how familiar they are with airports they are operating in, they must have the highest levels of alertness and concentration during landing and take-off, Major said. I expect everything about this crash to be known quite quickly, he said.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 10: The men and women heading Indias new breed of IITs, IIMs and central universities may soon be taking a crash course as students  to learn leadership tricks to guide their institutions through their infancy.         
	The human resource development ministry is planning a leadership-training programme for all top administrators at central institutions started over the past two years, top government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	Top administrators across the new IITs, IIMs, National Institutes of Technology (NIT) and central universities will be covered, the sources said.         
	The programme is the brainchild of higher education secretary Vibha Puri Das, who has asked her officers to urgently draw up a schedule to implement the plan from the current 2010-11 financial year.         
	The programme will be conducted at select IIMs, which are being identified by the HRD ministry. Each of the IIMs conducts programmes in leadership, usually meant for mid-career corporate executives and occasionally for bureaucrats.         
	Over the past couple of years, the government has also been encouraging school principals to attend leadership programmes at the IIMs.         
	But this will be the first occasion when IIT directors or vice-chancellors of central universities will be asked to train in leadership at the IIMs. The ministry also plans training for IIM administrators  at either their own institute or at another IIM.         
	This programme is important looking ahead to the coming decade. The new IITs, IIMs and central universities represent our hope for the future. And building new institutions is all about leadership, a senior official said.         
	India has started eight new IITs over the past two years and will have started seven new IIMs by next year. The ministry has also started 12 new central universities and taken over three other state universities since 2008. The ministry is also launching 10 new NITs.         
	Under the ministry plan, administrators from the new institutions will be sent for leadership training in batches.         
	The leadership programme will be specially tutored for three separate categories of students. The first category will consist of vice-chancellors, directors and other institution heads.         
	The second category will consist of deans, heads of departments and other academic heads at these institutions. The final category will consist of registrars, finance officers and other senior administrative staff.                     
	Cynics argue that such programmes rarely serve any purpose other than a break from work for those attending the courses.         
	These programmes invariably turn into jaunts where the main motivation for most people attending is the break it provides from routine work, a source said.         
	But others argue that such programmes do prove useful. People who attend get to interact with peers across organisations and invariably pick up things from each other. They certainly help to broaden ones perspective, one bureaucrat said.

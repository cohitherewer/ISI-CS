                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nod for Rajneeti with cuts on EVM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Katrina during a promotional for her   movie Rajneeti                          
	New Delhi, May 26: Rajneeti will release with a U/A certificate, as director Prakash Jha wanted, after the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal clearing the movie with some cuts suggested by the censor board.        
	The tribunals clearance didnt come with a consensus, though: one of its three members who viewed the film filed a note of dissent, saying the censor boards objections were valid and the film required an A certificate.        
	The cuts involved sequences showing intimate scenes, denunciation of electronic voting machines, derogatory remarks against women and communal references. Jha had gone to the tribunal challenging the boards objections.        
	The reservations had been voiced by many members, including some with links to the ruling Congress who have been monitoring the film because of the buzz that the character played by Katrina Kaif resembles Sonia Gandhi. Jha has denied such similarities.        
	The tribunal members saw the film. There are scenes of violence and abusive language in certain parts. There are also references to homosexuality, which we asked the filmmaker to delete, a senior official said.

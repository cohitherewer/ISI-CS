The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Easter sermon against pill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Easter sermon against pill
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, April 2: This years Easter message for Christians: Never use the abortion pill.        
	The Indian Catholic Church plans to make the message a part of the Easter homily, taking the cue from Pope Benedict XVI who has opposed the launch of the abortion pill in Italy. The pill ends an early pregnancy.        
	The Church has always taken a strong position against abortion. This pill is a new phenomenon but we consider (its use) the same as abortion. Our position is the same as that of the Vatican, said Fr Peter Joseph of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India.        
	The Popes remarks against the abortion pill had come during a pre-Easter mass. He had said that having these pills amounts to killing innocent unborn children.        
	Earlier, the Pope had asked Roman Catholic pharmacists to help protect human life from conception till natural death, and avoid collaborating in the supply of products that cause abortion or euthanasia.        
	Fr Joseph said any believer who used the abortion pill would be considered a violator of Catholic laws.        
	Whether it is clinical abortion or pill-induced abortion, all abortion is the same. Our opposition to abortion comes from the recognition of the basic rights of all individuals. These individuals include the unborn, Fr Joseph said.        
	The Church has provisions to expel those who carry out clinical abortions, but they are rarely invoked.        
	The Catholic Church has always opposed abortion on the ground that human life begins when a womans egg is fertilised by a male sperm. One of its earliest statements condemning abortion is recorded in a document called the Didache, written in the second century AD. You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the new-born to perish, it says.        
	The Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992) had re-affirmed that the embryo must be treated from conception as a person. From that moment a unique life begins. Each new life that begins at this point is not a potential human being but a human being with potential. No one can point to the twelfth day or the fourth week or any other time and say, This is when I began being me. The process of life begins at conception while birth is only the end point of the life within the womb of the mother, the Church says.        
	The pills have been available in India since February 2002. They have caused controversy in India with reports saying women were using them just like any other contraceptive. Following this, the Drug Controller General of India pulled the abortion pill ads off the air last year. They have been allowed back on the ground that they should carry a warning.

          H. CHISHI                              
	Viswema, May 12: The first round of an on-the-spot effort by the Centre has failed to break the deadlock over NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivahs proposed visit to Manipur.        
	Muivah, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai, Centres interlocutor R.S. Pandey, Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, a few of his cabinet ministers and representatives from Naga organisations held a meeting for around one-and-a-half hours in this village, located in Nagaland near the Manipur boundary. The Naga leader is staying here now.        
	Muivah and Pillai declined to speak to reporters after the meeting, but Pandey said they would continue to talk to the NSCN (I-M) in a bid to break the stalemate. We have also conveyed our feelings and I am sure everyone, the NSCN, the civil societies, the governments of Nagaland and Manipur and the Centre  all of us will jointly try to solve the problem as soon as possible, he said.         
	Pandey said their visit to Manipur and Nagaland was aimed at building an amicable atmosphere and the government would continue to talk to all concerned. We will go back to Delhi and discuss the situation further, he added.         
	Making a guarded comment on Muivahs proposed visit to his village, Somdal in Manipurs Ukhrul district, Pandey said the situation was not yet conducive for the trip.         
	On the ongoing turmoil in the hill and valley districts of Manipur, Pandey said the Centre was closely monitoring the situation. Manipur police will be withdrawn from the Mao town area and central paramilitary force deployed to build confidence.

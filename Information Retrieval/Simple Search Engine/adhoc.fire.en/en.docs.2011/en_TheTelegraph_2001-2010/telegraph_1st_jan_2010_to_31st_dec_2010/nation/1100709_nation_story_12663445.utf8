  - Govt to assess welfare plans efficacy in Maoist areas         CITHARA PAUL                                     
	New Delhi, July 8: The Prime Ministers Office has asked the tribal affairs ministry to run a reality check on its welfare programmes, the move coming against the backdrop of the increasing presence of Maoists in tribal belts.        
	The ministry has invited bids from independent agencies  those specialising in social sector research. The institution finally chosen will assess the programmes and suggest ways to make the schemes more effective.        
	We have got directions from the higher-ups (the PMO) to carry out an exhaustive study which will bring out the overall impact (of the schemes) on the beneficiaries, both tangible and intangible, along with solutions to the problems in implementation. Such an assessment is justified as the situation in the tribal areas is not quite satisfactory despite the crores spent on their development, said a senior official of the ministry.        
	The trigger for the decision, the official said, is the recent wave of rebel attacks, allegedly being carried out with the support of the tribals.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has expressed dissatisfaction on several occasions at the ineffectiveness of welfare plans. He had raised the matter at a recent conference of chief ministers of Naxalite-affected states, and admitted there was a systemic failure in giving tribals a stake in the modern economic process.        
	The problems faced by our tribal communities are complex and they require sympathetic and systematic understanding. The policy should factor in the different nuances of tribal life as they exist in several parts of our country, Singh had said.        
	According to the ministry notification on the independent assessment, the agency carrying out the study will review allocation and utilisation of funds, evaluate the performance of the schemes on the basis achievements measured against the targets and identify problems in the selection of the intended beneficiaries.        
	The agency will also try to find out whether there is enough awareness among the tribals about the programmes. In order to assess the awareness of the planners, implementers and the general public, in particular the Scheduled Tribes, about the welfare and development schemes, the ministry proposes to conduct an assessment study of the existing awareness programmes.         
	The findings of the study would facilitate planners and implementers in designing appropriate awareness campaigns using different media and forums... to reach those residing in far-flung areas and help them claim the benefits of governments various schemes and programmes, the ministry notification states.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 1: General V.K. Singh, who took over as the army chief on Wednesday, has said he will lead the force expecting it to cleanse itself from within.        
	Internal health is very important. No organisation can perform well without an internal audit, the general, who ordered investigations against senior officers as the Eastern Army Commander, said today.         
	In civil society there are various standards of probity and integrity. Armed forces have their own value systems that have to be different from that of the civil society. It is my job to ensure that the imagined dignity of the soldier gets improved, he said.         
	After General Singh convened the court of inquiry into an alleged attempt to grab land near Sukna in the strategic chickens neck area in north Bengal, his predecessor, General Deepak Kapoors military secretary, retired Lt. General Avadhesh Prakash was indicted. Two other lieutenant generals are also facing proceedings.         
	The image of the army took a beating at a time it has been trying to attract talent to meet shortage of officers.         
	In other cases, seven lieutenant generals have been investigated and orders for their punishment have been given. Although they have challenged these orders in court, the perception that corruption has seeped into the higher commands of the army remains.        
	Now, as chief, General Singh said it mattered personally and professionally to him that the army regained its lost prestige.         
	I want to emphasise that we have strong traditions, core values. These are the things that make a difference to me, he said.         
	Being the army chief, he was not referring to the Sukna case or any of the other issues in particular. But his remarks, on the day he began his regular duties as the chief, signal that he is already profiling his task.         
	The army chief said he was also looking at the hollowness in the army and will upgrade the force levels.

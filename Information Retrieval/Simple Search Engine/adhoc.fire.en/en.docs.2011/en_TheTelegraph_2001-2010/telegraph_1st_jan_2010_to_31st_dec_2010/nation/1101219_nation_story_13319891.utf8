The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Uma cool to BJP return offer
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Uma cool to BJP return offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Uma Bharti (top), LK Advani                          
	Lucknow, Dec. 18: Uma Bharti has said that rather than accept L.K. Advanis recent offer to her to rejoin the BJP, she would for now retain her independence and might later join the National Democratic Alliance as a partner.        
	Mr Advani, whom I respect like a father, wants me to join the BJP. However, retaining my own partys independent entity is a priority now. But later I could become a part of the NDA, she said today.        
	Despite the reference to my own party, Uma has no party now. She had formed the Bharatiya Janshakti Party in 2005 after her expulsion from the BJP, but walked out early this year amid mounting dissidence against her.        
	The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister was in Lucknow amid speculation that she might accept the offer to oversee BJP affairs in Uttar Pradesh. On December 11, Advani had blogged that Uma would soon join the BJP and that she had agreed to hold charge of party affairs in the heartland state, which faces crucial polls in 2012.        
	But Uma said: To imagine myself joining the BJPs Uttar Pradesh unit immediately is too far-fetched.        
	She claimed BJP president Nitin Gadkari too had offered her a plum post in the party.        
	The (BJP) leaders in Uttar Pradesh should not be afraid of me. I am not a candidate for chief minister. I was offered to shift my base to Uttar Pradesh from Madhya Pradesh but I am not ready for that, Uma said.        
	I might just try to field myself as a candidate of my party in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from any seat in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Uma, who headed for Ayodhya today, had initially shown an interest in the BJP offer but changed her mind because the party wouldnt readmit Kalyan Singh as well, a source said. She is close to Kalyan, a fellow Lodh and protagonist of the temple movement, and would feel uneasy in the BJP if he were not in the party.        
	However, the BJP could face a revolt if it took back Kalyan, who had left to join Mulayam Singh Yadav last year.         
	Uma has been in the political wilderness since the Bharatiya Janshakti Party was routed in the 2008 Madhya Pradesh polls, a defeat she had blamed on the BJPs money and muscle power.        
	However, she had softened towards the BJP last year, backed Advani as the candidate for Prime Minister, and campaigned for the BJP during the general election. Her own party had stayed away from contesting.        
	Had Uma agreed to oversee the BJPs Uttar Pradesh affairs, she would have had to contend with former rival Digvijay Singh, whom she had defeated in the 2003 Madhya Pradesh elections.        
	Uma today took pot shots at Digvijay, saying Rahul Gandhi found himself in trouble because he was being briefed by the Congresss Uttar Pradesh minder. He (Rahul) is borrowing phrases from Digvijay Singhs political handbook. Given a chance, I can be a better guru to Rahul, Uma said.        
	She was reacting to Rahuls alleged remarks, revealed by WikiLeaks, about radical Hindu outfits being a greater threat to India than Islamic terrorists.

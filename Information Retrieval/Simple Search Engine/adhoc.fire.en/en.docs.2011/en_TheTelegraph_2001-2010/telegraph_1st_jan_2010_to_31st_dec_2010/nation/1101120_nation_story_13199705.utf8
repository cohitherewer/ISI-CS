The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Blast at NZ mine with ties to India
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Blast at NZ mine with ties to India
          OUR BUREAU AND AP                          Pike River Coals mine in New Zealand. (AFP)                                  
	Nov. 19: At least 27 men were trapped underground today after an explosion rocked New Zealands largest coal mine part-owned by Indians in a mountainous region.        
	Authorities said it was too early to determine the cause of the explosion and that no deaths had been reported from the accident near Atarau on New Zealands South Island.        
	The mine operator, Pike River Coal Ltd, is a New Zealand-registered company but its majority owners are Australians.        
	Two Indian companies are represented on the board of Pike River. Gujarat NRE Coke, Indias largest low-ash metallurgical coke producer, has 7.14 per cent voting rights in Pike River, while Saurashtra Fuels has 5.51 per cent voting rights.        
	The Pike River mine has hard coking coal, a converted form of which is used mostly in steel making. Gujarat NRE had brought in two shipments of coking coal from Pike River to India.        
	I am in India right now but the management has updated us about the situation. The mine is in a remote location. I am worried about the people, Arun Kumar Jagatramka, chairperson of Gujarat NRE, said.        
	Jagatramka is a director on the board of Pike River Coal but day-to-day affairs were left to the management in New Zealand. Dipak Agarwala, managing director of Saurashtra Fuels, is another Pike River director.        
	Indian companies have been on the lookout for coking coal mines in Australia, New Zealand, Mozambique and South Africa to meet rising steel production targets.        
	India has one of the largest deposits of coal in the world but the fuel is high on ash content which suits mostly power generation. Low ash coal, used in blast furnace for making steel, is sparsely available in India.         
	On South Island, rescue crews waited impatiently outside the mine on Friday night for the all-clear to begin a search for the 27 missing men.        
	Five dazed and slightly injured miners stumbled to the surface hours after the blast blew up the 360-foot-long ventilation shaft. Video from the scene showed blackened and singed trees and light smoke billowing from the top of the rugged mountain where the mine is located.        
	John Dow, chairperson of mine operator Pike River, said each miner carried 30 minutes of oxygen  enough to reach oxygen stores in the mine that he said would allow them to survive for several days.        
	While the condition of the missing men was unknown, the prospect that they could be alive but trapped recalled the dramatic saga of 33 Chilean miners who spent 69 days in a collapsed gold and copper mine half-mile deep. Their rescue last month had captivated the world.        
	Fears that pockets of methane gas could ignite held up the rescue attempt, and it could be days before it was safe enough for specialist teams to enter the mine, said Tony Kokshoorn, mayor of nearby Greymouth.        
	Electricity went out shortly before the explosion and that failure may have caused ventilation problems and contributed to a buildup of gas. The power outage complicated efforts to pump fresh air into the mine and make it safe for rescuers to enter.        
	Theyre itching to get in there and start looking for other people and a bit frustrated at having to stand and wait, said police spokesperson Barbara Dunn.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 7: Comrade PC, mind your own business.        
	The Maoist carnage in Dantewada has given Bengals ruling CPM a chance to hit back at the Union home minister for criticising the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments handling of Lalgarh and law and order.        
	State party secretary Biman Bose today asked P. Chidambaram to mind your own business while maintaining that it was the Centres main responsibility to keep the rebels in check.        
	The jab came two days after Bhattacharjee had asked Chidambaram to mind your language following the home ministers repeated reminders in Lalgarh on Sunday that the buck stopped at the chief ministers table.        
	Boses initial reaction on Sunday had been subdued, but the Dantewada killings have given him a handle to hit back.         
	Chidambaram made some off-the-cuff comments in Lalgarh (dum kare kichhu kotha chhure dilen Lalgarhey). He never thought the Dantewada incident would happen so soon. He could not visit Dantewada today and say what he had said in Lalgarh. He took a political stance in Lalgarh that he should not have taken, Bose said.        
	Nijer charkay tel din (mind your own business), the veteran Marxist added. One earns the right to advise others after taking care of ones own responsibilities.        
	The CPM maintains that law and order is a state subject and opposes central intervention. But where the Maoists are concerned, Bose believes the buck stops at Chidambarams table.         
	The Centre must bear the main and greater responsibility. Constitutional provisions have made this imperative for the Centre. We do not deny the states responsibilities and the state government is doing its job, he said.        
	The CPM is also upset with Chidambaram for not asking Congress ally Trinamul to stop helping the Maoists. Instead, he said what he should not have said, Bose said.

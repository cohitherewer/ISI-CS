	New Delhi, Nov. 11: India and Bangladesh today decided to allow 24-hour unfettered access through the Tin Bigha corridor to Bangladeshis, as the two sides thrashed out several long-standing issues at a meeting of their joint boundary working group.        
	The meeting was the groups fourth since it was set up in December 2000.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina had in January agreed to expedite the process to resolve all outstanding issues in the spirit of the 1974 Land Boundary Agreement.         
	Apart from the decision on the Tin Bigha corridor, the two sides agreed to resolve their differences on demarcating the land boundary in all three segments not demarcated  Daikhata 56 (in Bengal), Lathitilla-Dumabari (Assam) and Muhuri (Belonia) river (in Tripura).        
	On enclaves, both sides agreed to jointly take steps necessary to facilitate the process of exchange of these areas to their respective countries, a foreign ministry official said. There are 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitishs promised land eludes tribals
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitishs promised land eludes tribals
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The government of Nitish Kumar has failed to give land to even a single tribal in the state as promised by the Forest Rights Act.         
	According to the latest progress report on the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, no tribal has got any land in the state. Bihar has so far disposed of barely 13 claims ever since the act was implemented but has not distributed any title yet. That means barely 0.59 per cent of the total claims have been settled out of the 2,179 received.         
	Bihar is one of the nine states affected by Left wing extremism which was asked to implement the legislation with utmost priority. The other states in the category are Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.         
	The Bihar government has had a lackadaisical attitude towards the FRA (Forest Rights Act) ever since its introduction. We have been sending reminder after reminder to the Nitish government but so far there has been no improvement, said an official with the FRA desk.         
	He said the number of FRA applications being filed in Bihar is also very low when compared to other states as there is little awareness among tribals regarding the law.         
	Bihar has a little over 6,800sqkm of notified forest area, which is about seven per cent of the total area of the state.         
	Tribals in Bihar make up less than one per cent of the states population. However, the number of forest dwellers, including the non-tribal ones, is above one lakh, which is around one per cent of the population.         
	The traditional forest dwellers are settled in the districts of West Champaran, Kaimur, Rohtas, Banka, Nawada, Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui, Munger and Nalanda.         
	Bihar officials chose to pass the buck. A forest official, who did not wish to be named, said the welfare department is yet to take action.        
	The state needs to constitute three committees, one each at the district, sub-division and panchayat levels, to settle the claims of traditional forest dwellers. Representatives of the forest and welfare departments, local administration as well those of the local bodies have to be members of these committees, said a senior Bihar forest department official, who did not wish to be named.         
	The official said the welfare department, with support from the local administration, has to constitute these committees. The forest department has repeatedly drawn the attention of the welfare department and the district magistrates concerned about the need of setting up these committees. But nothing much has been done so far on this front. This may be a possible reason for the slow pace of settlement of claims made by traditional forest dwellers in Bihar, the official added.         
	Forest and environment minister Ramji Rishidev, a BJP leader, put the ball in the court of the welfare department.         
	We have asked the welfare department to look into the matter. There were around 1,000 petitions pending last year. I do not know the latest statistics for this year. But we have asked the forest department officials to assist the welfare department in 11 forest areas existing in Bihar, he said.         
	Opposition parties, who have brought out their knives for Nitish following the Maoist hostage crisis, were quick to pounce on the issue.        
	The tribals existing in Bihar are turning towards the Maoists because no welfare scheme exists for them at the ground level. Whatever the government may say, rampant corruption has made the tribals have more faith in the Maoists than the government, said Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Ram Kripal Yadav.         
	Bihars record is worse than most of its neighbours such as Jharkhand and Bengal. Jharkhand has settled only 30 per cent of the claims while Bengal is marginally better, having cleared 50 per cent.         
	Union tribal affairs minister Kanti Lal Bhuria has written twice to the chief ministers asking them to take active interest in implementing the FRA. Among the non-Left wing extremism affected states, the bad performers are Assam (26.01 per cent), Goa (nil), Gujarat (18 per cent), Karnataka (4 per cent) and Kerala (30 per cent).                     WITH INPUTS FROM SANJEEV KUMAR VERMA IN PATNA

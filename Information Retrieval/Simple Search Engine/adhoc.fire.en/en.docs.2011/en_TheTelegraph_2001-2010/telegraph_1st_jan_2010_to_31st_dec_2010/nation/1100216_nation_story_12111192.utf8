          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 15: Students of Osmania University spearheading the Telangana movement today got a shot in the arm from Andhra Pradesh High Court, which directed police to remove all outposts on the campus.        
	The students had moved court this morning following clashes with the police yesterday. In their petition, the students accused the police of carrying out atrocities on the campus in tandem with the Osmania authorities.         
	A high court bench directed the university authorities not to force any student to leave the hostel. The students had alleged that the university bosses would order their eviction on the ground that they were outsiders living on campus, a charge often levelled by the police.        
	The court also said the police should enter the campus only under the direct supervision of the city commissioner. The bench ordered the police to remove all barricades on the campus, saying the students had every right to a democratic protest.         
	The court orders came on a day of swift developments over the statehood struggle.        
	Andhra Assembly Speaker Kiran Kumar Reddy accepted the resignations of 12 of the 15 legislators who had sent him quit letters ever since the issue flared up again over the terms of reference of the central committee on Telangana. The panel has been asked to look into the option of a united Andhra as well, which the statehood lobby says is a betrayal by the Centre.         
	Of the legislators whose resignations have been accepted, 10 are from the Telangana Rashtra Samiti and one each from the BJP and the Telugu Desam. The Speaker has not taken any decision on the resignation letters submitted by two Congress MLAs and one of the Praja Rajyam.        
	The Congresss 51 legislators from Telangana appear divided over resigning. All 39 legislators of the Telugu Desam have decided to send their resignations only after Congress MLAs come forward to quit.        
	The Telangana Congress legislators, however, tried to disrupt the governors address to the joint session of the Assembly on the inaugural day of the budget session. At the end of the 40-page address, they walked out and marched to Gandhis statue inside the Assembly premises.         
	The Congress MLAs said this was their way of showing solidarity with the statehood cause. We cannot resign irresponsibly. If we resign, the Telugu Desam would take advantage and pull down the Rosaiah government, said Jana Reddy, a former home minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Illegal tag on air service tax

  - Aviation body hints at divided house           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Tax turbulence                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: The worlds top airline association has dubbed Indias service tax on air travel illegal and criticised its insular policy of forbidding overseas airlines from investing in domestic carriers.        
	International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief Giovanni Bisignani told a conference here today that for the past four years, the finance ministry had been charging a 10.3 per cent service tax on international tickets and, in this years Union budget, the levy was extended to domestic tickets.        
	Such a tax, Bisignani claimed, is illegal under the International Civil Aviation Organisations (ICAOs) rules. While the IATA represents airlines, the ICAO is a UN agency that sets the rules for global aviation.        
	The IATA chief tried to paint the picture of a divided government, claiming that the finance ministry had slapped the service tax despite the Praful Patel-headed civil aviation ministrys reservations about the move.        
	In February, the minister of finance announced the extension of the tax to economy and domestic tickets. The disconnect between the ministry of finance and the ministry of civil aviation has put India in an embarrassing position. It is not following the rules it helped to create, Bisignani told the meeting organised by industry chamber CII.         
	Airlines, both local and foreign, have protested against the tax saying it impedes air travel besides violating ICAO norms.        
	Bisignani also criticised Indias policy of not allowing foreign airlines to buy equity stakes in domestic carriers. Why this unique restriction on airlines? The logic is very difficult to understand and is inconsistent with Indias open approach to other sectors. Does it make sense that a foreign airline could make a 100 per cent investment in a greenfield airport but cant invest even one rupee in an Indian airline?        
	Foreign investment of up to 49 per cent is allowed in domestic airlines but not from foreign airlines or their associates. Bisignani said such an insular approach cuts India off from global expertise and global trends.        
	The Prime Ministers Office and the finance ministry are said to be in favour of foreign airlines buying shares in local carriers and bringing in global technology, but opposition from industry lobbies has stalled any such move.        
	Jet and Air India, two of the biggest local airlines, are believed to be against the proposal as they fear that smaller rivals may join hands with foreign airlines and turn challengers. But Kingfisher promoter Vijay Mallya had a few years ago urged the Centre to allow foreign airlines to buy up to 25 per cent in Indian carriers.        
	Bisignani also questioned Indias reluctance to adhere to global norms on sharing advance passenger information, a move aimed at checking terrorism. India helped formulate the standards for advance information on passengers, yet its Bureau of Immigration developed its own standards and processes, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           PJ Thomas                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Chief vigilance commissioner P.J. Thomas has volunteered to recuse himself from supervising the CBI probe into the 2G spectrum case, the Centre told the Supreme Court today in what is being seen as a step that will culminate in his departure.        
	Thomas, facing charges in a palm oil export case in Kerala, today denied that he had resigned. However, highly placed sources in the government said it was a matter of time before he was asked to step down.        
	Solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court that Thomas had volunteered to recuse himself, a privilege usually enjoyed by judges. Thomass two subordinate vigilance commissioners supervise the probe.        
	Thomas was telecom secretary when the spectrum allotment decision was made. The court had yesterday expressed doubts whether he could objectively monitor the probe, following which Subramanium had dropped hints that Thomas might not be in the picture for long.        
	It is best that he (Thomas) goes, a government source said today, indicating that the government may use the bargaining chip of making Thomas quit to mollify the Opposition.        
	The sources said Thomas would be asked to quit not at the time of his choosing but when the government deems it politically fit.        
	He is not defiant. He has been asked to leave but the government will decide the timing, said a source. The sources said the commissioner might follow the example of former telecom minister A. Raja, who insisted till the last minute he would not quit but quietly submitted his resignation to the Prime Minister.        
	The Manmohan Singh government does not want to repeat what it perceives as a mistake in asking Raja to quit when it did, which gave Opposition parties more ammunition.        
	Thomas today told mediapersons that he had not resigned. The government has appointed me CVC. I am continuing as CVC. If there is anything, I will let you know, he said.        
	The CVC refused to comment on the Supreme Courts observations on him. The matter is sub judice. It is better not to comment. Whatever proceedings are in the court, it is unfair for me to comment, he said. Thomas had met home minister P. Chidambaram on Monday evening.        
	The apex court had questioned Thomass appointment as CVC for his alleged involvement in the palm oil import case. Government sources played down the import controversy but conceded it was untenable for him to supervise the investigations into the 2G controversy.        
	Thomass appointment to the post of CVC was cleared by a three-member panel that included the Prime Minister, Chidambaram and leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj. She had given a dissenting note on his appointment.        
	I was appointed by the government taking into considerations all these (matters). There is no controversy. There is some old case in which the Supreme Court stay is there. These are judicial matters which will be settled. The law will take its own course, Thomas said.

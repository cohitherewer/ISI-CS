	Mumbai, May 10: A karate black belt who specialised in bomb-making was today arrested in connection with a series of Mumbai blasts, most of them low-intensity ones, seen by police as a way to avenge the Gujarat riots.        
	Wazahul Tamal Khan alias Babubhai alias Murtaza Chaudhari, 44, was picked up from Mumbais Dharavi slum area by the Maharashtra anti-terror squad. The father of five had eluded the cops for seven years. ATS sleuths believe the arrest will help them uncover the links among Indian terror groups.        
	Murtaza was wanted for the explosion in a local train at Mulund on March 13, 2003  a day after the 10th anniversary of March 12, 1993, serial blasts. Thirteen people died in the train explosion, the fourth in a series of blasts that rocked the city from December 2002 to August 2003.        
	ATS chief Rakesh Maria said Murtaza was involved in two other blasts. He is a karate black belt. He helped assemble the explosives in all three blasts.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar today formally disallowed the adjournment motions moved by Opposition parties after hearing out arguments from both sides.        
	Although the decision evoked angry protests leading to adjournment of the House for the day, the government expects Parliament to function normally from tomorrow.        
	The Rajya Sabha also could not function today as the Opposition demanded a debate on price rise under Rule 164, which entails voting.        
	 If the Opposition does not persist with its demand after the Speakers ruling, both the Houses may have a short-duration discussion on the price rise without voting. Both the Speaker and the leader of the Lok Sabha, Pranab Mukherjee, indicated readiness to discuss the issue any time the Opposition wanted.        
	Sources said the Opposition parties may find it difficult to sustain their agitation for much longer and may resume normal work after making some symbolic protests in and outside Parliament tomorrow morning.        
	While the Left, Samajwadi Party and the RJD appeared restive in the BJPs company, the government contended that the revision of petroleum prices was done under economic compulsions and there was no need to force a trial of strength on this issue.        
	It appeared at one point this morning that the Opposition had tilted the scale in its favour by citing examples of adjournment motions having been accepted in the past to discuss price rise. CPM leader Basudeb Acharya referred to five instances between 1973 and 2000 when adjournment motions had been accepted to discuss rising prices.        
	Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav and RJDs Lalu Prasad, too, had built a strong case in favour of the adjournment motion.        
	But Mukherjee demolished the Oppositions logic by quoting several former Speakers who felt adjournment motions could not be used as a normal device to discuss an issue.        
	The Opposition had cited a parliamentary rule that said an adjournment motion could be accepted if the issue was recent, of urgent public importance and of definite nature. It said the rise in the prices of LPG and kerosene was a definite issue of urgent public concern as well as recent and had created an extraordinary situation by mounting unbearable pressure on the people.        
	But Mukherjee cited several rulings, which said adjournment motion could be accepted only if the issue reflected the failure of the government in discharging its duties.        
	Quoting former Speakers, he said an issue, no matter how important, could not be allowed to be discussed under an adjournment motion even if the overwhelming majority of the House favoured it, if not permitted by the rules.        
	He said the tough decision to raise prices did not reflect the Centres failure in discharging its duties.         
	The Speaker picked a thread from Mukherjees contention and gave her ruling: Adjournment motion can be attracted only in case of the failure of the government to perform constitutional and legal duties. That is not the case here.         
	She, however, said: I appreciate the concern expressed by the Opposition over price rise. The House certainly has a right to discuss it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt eye falls on dirty ponds

          CITHARA PAUL                                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The filthy, moss-covered ponds that many rural people depend on could turn into limpid pools of fresh water if a central scheme that kicks off in June is a success.        
	The government plans to list every water body in the country, assess the condition of each, and revitalise the most neglected ones through de-silting and prevention of pollution and encroachment.        
	A sum of Rs 4,000 crore has been set aside for the Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) Scheme, a joint Centre-state project that primarily aims to restore or increase the capacities of lakes and ponds and freshen their water. It is expected to reduce water shortage and illness caused by the use of dirty water.        
	The first ever census of the countrys water bodies, believed to number more than 13 lakh, will be complete by the middle of the year and about one lakh chosen for restoration in the first phase, a water resources ministry official said.        
	The census will be significant  now we have no clear data about the various water bodies, the official said.        
	The census will include details of the tanks and lakes conditions, noting whether they are in use, partial use or complete disuse along with the reasons for their deterioration. Although the census will cover every water body, only public ones will be restored.        
	The states have been asked to assign the panchayats and municipalities the task of selecting the water bodies to be part of the project. Every selected water body will be given a unique code number.        
	The census will also give us an idea about the rainfall during the past 10 years, the groundwater level, land-use pattern, soil characteristics, climate conditions and the water quality in the water body and adjoining areas, the official said.        
	The restoration jobs will primarily include de-silting, repair of the conveyance system (through which the water body is replenished), strengthening of banks, prevention of soil erosion and the like.        
	Ninety per cent of the project cost will be provided as central assistance to the northeastern, drought-prone and Maoist-affected states as well as to those with large tribal populations. Other states will receive half the project funds from Delhi.        
	Local communities and local bodies will look after the upkeep of their water bodies and guard against pollution or encroachment.        
	Community water bodies are significant to the preservation of the ecology and a healthy social framework. The basic idea is to make it clear to everyone that community participation is very important for sustainable management of water bodies, the official said.        
	The scheme stresses the need to prevent markets, hotels, shops and apartment buildings from polluting water bodies.        
	There should be a crackdown on polluters, with hefty fines for dumping waste into water bodies as well as rivers and canals. Households too should be dissuaded from discharging sewage into fresh water sources, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US Indian admits to burning sons
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US Indian admits to burning sons
                            
	Chicago, May 19 (PTI): An Indian was today sentenced to life imprisonment in the US after he pleaded guilty to burning his two sons to death in 2007.         
	Kaushik Patel, 37, from Glendale Heights near Chicago, entered the guilty plea in DuPage county circuit court in return for which he will not be sentenced to death but will remain in jail for life, without the possibility of parole.         
	Patel replied in the affirmative when Judge Kathryn Creswell told him: You will die in prison, do you understand that?         
	DuPages attorney Joseph Birkett agreed not to seek the death penalty after talks with defence attorneys. This disposition provides the closure the victims mother was hoping for. I had to take that into consideration, he said.         
	Patel said little during the hearing. He lowered his head and wept softly as prosecutors recounted the murder of his sons.         
	Patel faced first-degree murder charges for burning his sons Vishv, 7, and Om, 4, on November 18, 2007. According to the state attorney, Patel took his sons to the bathroom at their home and set them ablaze after pouring gasoline on them.         
	Patel then drove with the kids five miles to the house of a relative who alerted the authorities. Vishv and Om succumbed to their burn injuries in hospital a couple of months later.         
	Patel, who was himself injured, had claimed earlier that he was attempting suicide when the boys rushed into the room and got burnt accidentally.        
	The defence had said in August 2008 that Patel was willing to accept a life sentence in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. Birkett had at that time rejected the offer as prosecutors were seeking the death penalty for Patel.         
	But last month, the prosecutors told the court that Patel would plead guilty in return for a life sentence.        
	The boys mother, Nisha, had told the court that while battling for life in the hospital, Vishv had told her how Patel had set them on fire.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sept. strike
                            
	Calcutta, May 12: Nine central trade unions have cut across political affiliations to call a nationwide industrial strike in the first week of September.         
	Aituc leader and CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said the date for the strike against issues ranging from price rise to violation of labour laws would be finalised later.         
	The strike is endorsed by all Left unions, along with the Congresss Intuc as well as the BJPs BMS for the first time, he added.        
	He said traditionally, the railways had been kept out of such strikes but public transport would not be exempt. Private vehicles can ply. Factories, industries and the IT sector will be covered by the strike but shops, restaurants and offices are likely to be spared.

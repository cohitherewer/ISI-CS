                          Chetan Bhagat                    
	Look at it this way, the slumdogs have become millionaires. Over the past decade, petty publishing thousands have multiplied into many thousands, and many thousands into many more, and those into millions and the millions into many millions, until Penguin India broke through the crore barrier last year with its advance for Ramachandra Guhas two-volume biography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. But its not been about author advances and returns at the cash-till alone.        
	The story of Indian publishing has become one of wild, often indiscriminate, mushrooming  fattened catalogues and booklists, exploding writer populace, swelling recognition and sales, a never-before gathering prospecting for riches, literary and monetary.        
	Just consider that Picador, Random House, Hachette, Hay House and Harvard Business School Press have all set up shop in India over this period, and Simon amp; Schusters arrival is on the anvil. Consider, too, that the three big pre-existing houses, Penguin, HarperCollins and Rupa, have all got lists that make their 1990s catalogues look like bus-ticket stubs. Was it merely coincidence that Gurcharan Dass best-seller India Unbound, a celebratory discourse on the unshackling of a free-market democracy, was published at the very onset of the last decade?        
	All the parameters of publishing and writing have changed, Krishan Chopra, publisher and chief editor of HarperCollins, says in relished tones. Purely in volumes, we have grown manifold in a way that seemed unimaginable a decade ago. And in literary terms, I would think India and the subcontinent have become the new Latin America; some of the most exciting writing is coming out of here and some of the greatest focus is zooming in.                    Kiran Desai    
	He probably has in mind the likes of Aravind Adiga and Kiran Desai (both Booker winners of the last decade) and Daniyal Mueenuddin, the US-based Pakistani writer who has quickly made a name for himself with his finely crafted caricatures of feudal life back home. Or, should we travel a little farther afield to lay Asiatic claims, Orhan Pamuk, whose celebration and damnation of Turkish life and politics won him a contentious Nobel.        
	But the success tale is not merely, or only, propelled by literary excellence and acclaim. It is made up equally by non-fiction work that is inspired by the intimations of a new India (Nandan Nilekanis Imagining India and A.P.J. Abdul Kalams Ignited Minds brand of rational evangelism) and vibrant fresh faceting by blue-chip authors like Amartya Sen (The Argumentative Indian and The Idea of Justice) and Ramachandra Guha (India After Gandhi).        
	And, in no mean measure, by those that lay no great claim to producing uber literature. Chetan Bhagat chose downmarket engagement to make a chart-buster of his debut novel Five Point Someone and continued to disturb the record books with successive works like One Night the Call Center and 2 States: The Story of My Marriage. He got no notice from the literary Ivy League but became an instant blockbuster with the aam aadmi.        
	Shruti Debi, editor of Picador India, remains sceptical about the quality of the literary output in India, but agrees that it is not the only factor feeding the industrys robust health. There has been an explosion in the publishing industry, all right, Debi says. Unlike the West, India is not a saturated market and it is to be expected that, tied into the larger economic processes, a good amount of resources will flow into India. There is some very good work happening, but not all of it measures up; a lot of it is, in quality terms, not commensurate with the boom we are experiencing.        
	Ravi Vyas, a former publishing editor and keen book watcher, harbours no illusions that publishing is more about hard economics, less about writing quality.        
	You cannot go under the net, he emphasises, this is business, not romance. But his guess is that the Indian industry has entered a happy loop that it is able to feed on.                    Ramachandra Guha    
	There is, doubtless, good new writing emerging from India, but dont forget it has to have a market. That market is coming from a new class of educated and eager Indian at home, and a huge professional diaspora that is buying into what is coming out of India. There are new markets at home and abroad, and they are providing the authors good advances and the publishers good profits.        
	Nandan Nilekanis Imagining India sold in excess of 50,000 hardback copies in its first five months. Amartya Sens The Argumentative Indian has grossed over a lakh volumes, Guhas own India After Gandhi went beyond 50,000 and is still vanishing off the stands in its paperback form.        
	One of the things that has happened lately is that Indian writers and writing are no longer considered an adjunct to the Commonwealth pool; they make an empire of their own.        
	The seeds were probably sown with Penguin opening shop locally in the 1990s; and Vikram Seth, who arrived here with a reputation already made in the West, forced the early pace for writers. Even so, big-ticket writers such as Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri and Sen were still approaching the Indian markets as part of international contract arrangements. But of late, the trend  and it has proved sustainable and profitable  is to look at India as a separate contract territory.                    Orhan Pamuk    
	Embedded in the new publishing bounties is probably a larger plot unravelling  the rediscovery of India by Indians. Propelled probably by the market and whetted by a new interest that has come redirected via the West, where India has enjoyed extended stay as flavour of the season, Indians are investing more and more in Indian.        
	A discernible trend within that trend is a reversal in genre preference  non-fiction work, as Sen, Guha and Nilekani (and the best-selling diet guide by Rujuta Diwekar, fitness consultant to Kareena Kapoor) illustrate  is often getting far better bids, and market reception, than fiction. That may not essentially be a comment on the kind of fiction being written; it may have more to do with the maturing of the narrative non-fiction form in India and the globally connected Indians desire to engage more with Indias dynamic tryst with itself and the world.                    SANKARSHAN THAKUR

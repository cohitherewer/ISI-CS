	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today called his Pakistan counterpart to offer more help in tackling the devastation caused by nearly three weeks of floods even as Washington urged Islamabad to accept the assistance its neighbour has already extended.        
	India had last week offered assistance worth $5 million but agency reports said Islamabad hadnt yet decided whether to accept that offer despite an acute aid crunch to battle the deluge that has claimed up to 1,600 lives.        
	A statement from Indias ministry of external affairs said Singh called Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani today to express his sense of sorrow at the loss of lives. The Prime Minister said that the Government of India had already made an offer of assistance and was ready to do more the statement said.        
	Dr. Singh said that in such times of natural disasters, all of South Asia should rise to the occasion and extend every possible help to the people of Pakistan affected by the tragedy, the statement added.        
	In Islamabad, foreign office spokesperson Abdul Basit said Pakistan appreciated the gesture. Asked about Washingtons stand that Pakistan should accept the offer from India, he said: Pakistan is a sovereign country and we will take a decision according to what we believe is the right thing to do.        
	Agency reports quoted senior US officials urging Islamabad to accept Indias help. At a briefing, US state department spokesperson P.J. Crowley said: In terms of responding to a disaster, politics should play no role. You have a country (India) thats willing to help (Pakistan), and...we expect that Pakistan will accept.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Radioactive leak exposes safety gaps
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Radioactive leak exposes safety gaps
          G.S. MUDUR                           The spot in New Delhi where the radiation leak occurred on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 9: The silver-coloured material spewing gamma radiation that slipped into a scrap dealers shops here, causing at least six persons to fall ill, has exposed gaps in Indias mechanisms to preserve radiological safety.         
	The scrap dealer and five workers have fallen ill with symptoms of radiation exposure after they tried to work with scrap that contained a highly radioactive element called cobalt-60, a department of atomic energy official (DAE) said.         
	Cobalt-60 is used as a source of radiation in cancer radiotherapy and in industrial inspection equipment, but scientists investigating the incident said the origin of the material found in the scrap dealers shops was still unknown.         
	A team of atomic energy scientists and technicians today shielded, packed and removed from two of the scrap dealers shops eight bunches of junk containing cobalt-60 shaped like wires, an official said.         
	The radioactivity varied from bunch to bunch, but even the lowest level was millions of times higher than the background radiation, Swapnesh Kumar Malhotra, a DAE spokesman, told The Telegraph.         
	Scientists familiar with todays operations said the radioactivity levels in the scrap dealers two shops were so high that each person involved in extricating the material was allowed to stay inside the shops for only four seconds.         
	The material has been sent to the Narora Atomic Power Station where it will be analysed. The radiation in the affected area has returned to normal background levels, the DAE said in a statement.         
	The scrap dealer, who has been in the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital here since April 4 with severe bone marrow suppression, has told police the material was embedded in a consignment of imported scrap.         
	He had acquired the scrap about two weeks ago and stored it in a drum. A DAE official said it was unclear how many persons were exposed to the radiation during this period. Weve asked local people to watch their health  and seek medical help if they experience symptoms of radiation poisoning such as nausea or vomiting, Malhotra said.         
	Gamma rays can cause irreversible cellular damage, including severe bone marrow suppression, as well as cause burns to the skin when a radiation source is touched without adequate protection.         
	Indias Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), the countrys watchdog for radiological safety, has a rigorous accounting and inventory system that tracks every source of radiation each month, a former AERB official said.         
	We need to have zero tolerance for such incidents  even one incident is too many, said K.S. Parthasarathy, former secretary of the AERB. He said the AERB had in the past advised port authorities and associations of scrap dealers to arm themselves with radiation counters to ascertain that any imported scrap entering India or recycling units was free of radioactive materials.         
	It is unclear how many of Indias port authorities have installed such counters and how many are using them, a senior DAE official said. A (radiation) counter would cost at most a few thousand rupees, Parthasarathy said.         
	The incident has occurred three days before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is scheduled to attend a global nuclear security conference hosted by US President Barack Obama in Washington DC. The meeting is intended to promote global co-operation to prevent nuclear terrorism.         
	While countries are expected to maintain rigorous accounting of radiation sources, nuclear experts say they have reason to be concerned about unaccounted, lost, or pilfered sources  orphan sources  because of their potential for abuse.         
	Cobalt-60 is among materials that could be used to produce radiological weapons.         
	Parthasarathy said such incidents with orphan sources had occurred in several countries. In the 1970s, he recalled, cobalt-60 recycled from scrap in Mexico was used to fabricate steel that ended up in the legs of restaurant tables in the US.         
	Two years ago, French authorities alerted India that lift buttons in elevators in France had come from a metal processing factory in India which had used recycled metal from imported scrap that contained cobalt-60. Stainless steel and cobalt have similar melting points and, scientists believe, it is possible the materials were mixed during processing.

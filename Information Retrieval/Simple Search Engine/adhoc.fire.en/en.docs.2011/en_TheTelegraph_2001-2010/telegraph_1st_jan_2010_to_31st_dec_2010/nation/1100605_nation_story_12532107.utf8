The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karats comrade hammers Bengal govt 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karats comrade hammers Bengal govt 
          J.P. YADAV                      Karat                          
	New Delhi, June 4: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today termed Bengals civic poll outcome a very big defeat for the Left, the withering criticism virtually setting the tone for the weekend CPM politburo meeting.        
	The CPI leader suggested that the Left Front government may have become swollen-headed.        
	 It has been a very big defeat for the Left, no doubt about it, was Bardhans first reaction to the poll results in an interview with Karan Thapar on the Devils Advocate programme on CNN-IBN. Asked what message the people of Bengal had given to the Left, the CPI leader was caustic.        
	That they (Left Front) have to improve themselves, they have been too long in power. Maybe they got a bit swollen-headed. Because of that, perhaps, they got alienated from the people, because of that, perhaps, some amount of bureaucratism crept in. All these things are very clear, Bardhan said.         
	The remarks by Bardhan  whose party is the second largest partner in the state government  is expected to find an echo during the two-day CPM politburo meeting beginning here tomorrow. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat is believed to hold similar views on the debacle.        
	Bardhans remarks are at odds with claims by some CPM leaders who have refused to accept the results as a defeat. They have argued that the municipal elections covered only 17 per cent of the Bengal electorate.         
	The CPI general secretary, however, appeared to see little justification in that line of argument and admitted the enormity of the defeat. I would say, you see, without mincing words, without minimising the defeat, that it has been a defeat. I would even use the word debacle in some respects, Bardhan said when it was pointed out that the Left had lost more than double civic bodies than it had retained.         
	Although Bardhan also claimed, like some CPM leaders have since the results were declared on June 2, that there was a marginal improvement in the situation since last years Lok Sabha polls, the attempt to project a redeeming element seemed lost in his big defeat assertion.         
	However, according to CPM sources, the most significant aspect of Bardhans remarks was that it reflected the views of their own general secretary, Karat. Bardhan is known to be close to Karat, who is learnt to have laid the blame for the civic poll defeat at the door of the CPMs Bengal unit.                   Bardhan      
	Bardhan, the CPM sources said, had echoed Karats central line and rejected the Bengal CPMs line that driving a wedge between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress would help.         
	The CPI general secretary said in the interview: But you are talking of Trinamul and the Congress coming together the fact is, you see, down below they have been together. Those who wanted to defeat the Left, the voters who were anti-Left, they were together.         
	On the day of the results, Karat had refused to talk to the media and casually wondered why TV crews had swarmed the CPM headquarters in Delhi. Why are you all here? You should be at Alimuddin Street (in Calcutta). All the action is there, he had said. The remarks indicated the CPM bosss nonchalance towards the results and that questions should be directed at the Bengal unit.        
	The tussle between the two lines in the CPM is likely to be debated during the politburo meeting. Bardhans interview, coming a day before, prompted a few in the CPM to wonder if some central leaders were firing from the CPI general secretarys shoulders.         
	Sources said CPM state secretary Biman Bose would submit a report on the polls and based on it, the reasons for the defeat and the corrective measures to be taken would be discussed.         
	One issue likely to be debated intensively is whether the CPM should continue to warm up to the Congress in a bid to widen its fault lines with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul. The Karat-led central line feels that anti-Congressism should be pursued, while the Bengal unit feels a tactical partnership with the Congress will be in the interest of the Left.        
	In the interview, Bardhan also charged the Left government with having turned undemocratic and stressed that the land-acquisition drive was a mistake.         
	Asked whether the Left Front had stopped being democratic in its behaviour, he replied: Without blaming any particular party, one must say that, that has been so. He also underlined that the anti-incumbency could have been avoided.         
	Careful not to sound completely anti-Bhattacharjee, the CPI leader took care to mention that the entire Left Front, including Karat, should take the blame together for the defeat.

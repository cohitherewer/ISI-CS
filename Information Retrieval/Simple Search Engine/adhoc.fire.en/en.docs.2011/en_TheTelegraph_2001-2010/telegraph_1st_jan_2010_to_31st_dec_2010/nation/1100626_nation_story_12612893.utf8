          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Right step?                                  
	New Delhi, June 25: The Union health ministry has initiated a process to determine whether it could regulate commercial gyms and fitness centres that have proliferated across cities in recent years.         
	An internal note circulated by the minister of state for health, Dinesh Trivedi, has expressed concern that in the absence of regulations, many such facilities may be operating without certified trainers or first-aid facilities.         
	Machines are not always maintained at levels desired by manufacturers. These inadequacies may result in turning many such gyms into sources of constant health hazards, Trivedis note read.         
	Medical experts say certified trainers and first-aid kits are crucial in gyms because strenuous exercise may sometimes put some people with underlying chronic conditions in trouble.         
	Diabetics need to exercise but if they exercise more than what they should, blood sugar level may drop. A gym has to have glucometers and sugar powder, said Punit Pruthi, an internal medicine consultant at the Asian Institute of Medical Sciences, Faridabad.         
	Strenuous exercise may cause an attack of asthma for which gyms need to be equipped with emergency medications, he said. Certified trainers also need to ensure that people dont inadvertently hurt muscles during exercise.

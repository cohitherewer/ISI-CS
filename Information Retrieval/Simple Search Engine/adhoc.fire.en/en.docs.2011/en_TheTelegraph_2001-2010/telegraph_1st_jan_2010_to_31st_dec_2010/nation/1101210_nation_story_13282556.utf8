The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quality concern over new IITs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Quality concern over new IITs
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: A parliamentary panel has voiced concern that the quality of education at new IITs could be affected by lack of adequately qualified teachers and absence of permanent campuses.        
	Fulfilment of qualitative parameters of these new IITs does not seem to be feasible in the near future, the parliamentary standing committee on HRD said in its report on The Institute of Technology (Amendment) Bill.        
	The bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 30, seeks to amend the Institute of Technology Act, 1961, to include eight new IITs and declare them as institutions of national importance.        
	The panel said increasing the number of IITs from seven to 15 would enhance the reach of technical education but the new IITs needed to be made fully functional in the real sense. Mere declaration of institutions of national importance indicates only a quantitative achievement.        
	In 2008-09, the Centre started IITs in Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Gandhinagar, Ropar, Patna and Jodhpur. Two more were begun at Mandi and Indore in 2009-10. All these institutes are functioning from temporary campuses.        
	Given that the tentative dates for shifting the IITs to permanent campuses were between December 2011 and 2013, it was clear the first batch of engineering graduates will not have the opportunity to avail the benefits of a well-equipped premier institute, the report said.        
	 The faculty scenario, too, was discouraging, the report said. Each of the new IITs was to recruit 30 teachers a year for the first three years, so those started in 2008-09 should have 90 teachers each by now. But they have between 20 and 46, the report said.        
	The committee can well imagine the plight of students in these new IITs with quite a few of them (teachers) being M.Tech or PhD students being made to pursue professional education in the absence of qualified and experienced faculty, the report said.        
	Former NCERT director J.S. Rajput said: Starting IITs without infrastructure and faculty will dilute quality. Once you have the infrastructure and faculty, you can start giving admission to students.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                         
	New Delhi, March 7: New rulings by Indias apex minority education watchdog that could rob top Christian academic institutions of minority status contradict repeated orders the panel has passed over the past five years.         
	The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) itself awarded minority status  from its inception in 2004 to February 2010  to over a thousand institutions not meeting new conditions that it laid down earlier this week.         
	The commissions new rulings, demanding 30 per cent students from a minority community for an institution to claim minority status, reported by The Telegraph yesterday, have sent ripples through the countrys Christian educational community.         
	Many of the countrys best known schools and colleges  run by the Christian community  could lose minority status because their student body consists of less than 30 per cent Christians.         
	Senior lawyers, who are independent of the institutions denied minority status, have criticised the rulings as arbitrary and these education bodies are bracing themselves to challenge the orders legally.         
	They point to repeated cases in which the NCMEI had in the past granted the status to institutions with a minority student population of less then even 10 per cent.         
	The panels chairman, Justice M.S.A Siddiqui, who passed the controversial new rulings early this March, confirmed that the commission had granted minority status to several institutions with less than 30 per cent students from that community.         
	Yes, we have in the past done that. But just because you make a mistake does not mean that you continue to perpetuate it, Siddiqui said.         
	Guwahati city, for instance, boasts of at least five major cases of schools that received a minority stamp from the NCMEI despite a Christian student population far below 30 per cent. These include Don Bosco, St Frances de Sales, St Clare, St Marys and Montfort School in Guwahati.         
	All earlier rulings where institutions with fewer than 30 per cent minority students were granted minority status may now need to be reviewed, Siddiqui said.         
	But senior lawyers said the earlier rulings were correct and questioned the legitimacy of the new orders.         
	The rulings have also triggered fresh concerns over the absence of a Christian representative on the NCMEI.         
	The commission, set up in 2004 by then human resource development minister Arjun Singh, is required to have members from the Christian and Sikh communities in addition to a Muslim representative.         
	But since December 2009, when the first term of the commission ended, the panel has no members from both the communities.        
	These new rulings are a fraud on the Constitution of India and an absolute absurdity, said Supreme Court lawyer M.P. Raju, widely held as an expert on minority education.         
	Siddiqui had cited the 2005 P.A. Inamdar judgment to defend his rulings.         
	Raju conceded that the Inamdar judgment did suggest that institutions could lose minority status without an adequate number of students from the community, but called Siddiquis rulings a misinterpretation of the Supreme Court order.         
	The Inamdar judgment does not lay down a minimum percentage of minority students required for institution to earn a minority tag.         
	As Christians comprise merely 2 per cent of the countrys population, it is unreasonable to expect them to muster 30 per cent students from the community outside states like Kerala, Raju argued.         
	The apex court has barred minority institutes from importing community students from outside the state boundary, following a case in Karnataka involving the Sikh community.         
	Senior Patna-based lawyer K.M. Joseph said Siddiquis new rulings were untenable.         
	If he thinks Christian educational institutions can work on the madrasa pattern (where a majority of students belong to the Muslim community), he is wrong, Joseph said, concurring with Rajus argument.         
	Christian institutions, while aimed at assisting Christian students, also seek minority status because they want to use education to spread the message of charity prominent in the religion, Joseph said.

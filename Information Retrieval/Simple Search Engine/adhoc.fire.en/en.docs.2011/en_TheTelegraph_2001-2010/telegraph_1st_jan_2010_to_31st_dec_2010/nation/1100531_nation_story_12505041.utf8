          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 30: The battle lines for the legislative council polls are drawn with both the ruling JD(U) and the Opposition RJD announcing their candidates for the Upper Houses elections due on June 11.        
	Both the political formations apparently have selected their nominees for the council polls, keeping their eyes on the crucial Assembly elections due in October/November. Targeting its extremely backward castes (EBC) support base, Nitish Kumars JD(U) has fielded Rudal Rai, Udaikant Choudhary (both EBCs) and Vijay Kumar Verma (OBC). On the other hand, RJD retained Ghulam Ghaus as its nominee, while it has fielded Ramchandra Prasad, a Teli, indicating that Lalu Prasad wants to cement his Yadav-OBC and Muslim combination.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh refused to comment categorically on some of the pressing challenges before him after the overseas trip of Asia and South-East Asia that ended today.        
	Asked if he would accept the Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavans resignation offer after he was allegedly implicated in a Mumbai cooperative housing scam, Singh said: I am not familiar with all the facts of this case. I have seen the newspapers. When I go back, I will look at the facts and make a meaningful comment.        
	Singh would not say much when asked if he would ask the Union communications minister A. Raja of the DMK to step down after the Supreme Court on Friday rapped the government for allowing him to continue in the cabinet despite the irregularities in the allotment of 2G spectrum. I have not seen what the court has said. When I go back, I will have it looked into, he said.        
	On what the Centre thought of Mamata Banerjees oft-raised objections against the deployment of anti-Maoist central forces in Bengal, he said: The home ministry is looking into them.

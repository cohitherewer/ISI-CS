	New Delhi, May 5: The Congress today grabbed controversial remarks by BJP leader Ananth Kumar to smash the tenuous Opposition unity which had already developed cracks during the recent cut motions.        
	Kumar used the words gaddari (treachery) and rashtravirodhi (anti-national) apparently targeted at Lalu Prasad  while speaking on illegal immigration, prompting the Congress to egg on an infuriated RJD leader and his friend Mulayam Singh Yadav to attack the BJP.        
	For the record, the word gaddar was declared unparliamentary on June 5, 1998.        
	The Congress did its best to fuel the fire and the result was instant: while Lalu Prasad repeatedly tried to reach the BJP benches for a physical bout, Mulayam threatened to expose the BJPs real face.         
	Ananth Kumar pointedly looked at Lalu and called him a gaddar and rashtravirodhi. We will rip the BJPs mask as the history of the freedom movement is replete with instances to prove who is a traitor, Mulayam said.        
	The Lok Sabha, which could not function yesterday as Trinamul leader Sudip Bandopadhyay asked CPMs Basudev Acharya to shut up, got repeatedly adjourned today because of Kumars remarks but the deadlock couldnt be resolved.         
	Although the Congress did not compel Bandopadhyay to apologise, its leaders are determined to stretch the latest issue, telling Lalu Prasad not to yield until the BJP leader expresses regret.        
	A furious Lalu Prasad said: We will not spare him. The Lok Sabha is bound to witness turmoil tomorrow again.         
	The trouble started when Kumar continued to speak about infiltration from Bangladesh and Pakistan during a debate on caste-based census, prompting Lalu Prasad to complain that he was pursuing the RSS agenda.        
	The BJP leader said people like him should decide if they were with Pakistan, Bangladesh, infiltrators and terrorists or with India. He said the BJP was with India. This provoked Lalu Prasad to say that he needed no certificate from the BJP.        
	Kumar then said: The House should be united but the House is divided because of people like Lalu. Aap desh ke saath gaddari kar rahe ho, desh ko bechna chahte ho.        
	From the immediate response, it appeared Lalu Prasad had not caught the words. But his colleague Raghuvansh Prasad protested and Trinamuls Bandopadhyay explained to Lalu Prasad what had been said. Soon, Congress and Samajwadi Party members stood up in Lalu Prasads support. Congress MP Raj Babbar added a larger dimension by contending that what the BJP member said was an insult to the entire House, not Lalu Prasad alone. He (Kumar) is asking members to decide if we are with India or terrorists and Pakistan. He is suggesting that some members could be against India. We will not tolerate this, Babbar said.        
	Although the deputy Speaker had already directed officials not to record the unparliamentary expressions, the ruckus continued and led to the adjournment of the House.        
	Even after the resumption, trouble continued as Kumar insisted he had said nothing undignified and gaddari and rashtravirodhi were not unparliamentary.        
	Floor leaders of different parties, including BJP ally JDUs Sharad Yadav, requested Kumar to withdraw his remarks but he refused. Congress leaders kept instigating the RJD and Samajwadi Party members to fight on and the House had to be adjourned till tomorrow.         
	Speculation was intense that both the Congress and the BJP were not keen on a debate on caste-based census which has already divided the cabinet.        
	The Congress and the BJP are not expected to shed tears if the debate does not take place in the Lok Sabha. But the Congress has additional reason to rejoice: new Opposition leader Sushma Swarajs attempt to unite the anti-Congress parties has fallen flat.

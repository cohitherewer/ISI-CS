          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 3: The Trinamul Congress today skipped a meeting organised by the SUCI to condole the death of the partys general secretary Nihar Mukherjee, apparently peeved by the allys criticism of Mamata Banerjees railway budget.         
	Trinamuls Partha Chattarjee, the Opposition leader in the Assembly, said he had not received any invitation to attend the meeting. However, SUCI state secretary Pravash Ghosh claimed he had sent an invitation to Trinamul.         
	Trinamul sources said Chatterjee had on Mamatas instruction visited the hospital and the Peace Haven mortuary after Mukherjees death and had placed wreaths on the SUCI leaders body. But today, Mamata had not asked Chatterjee to attend the condolence meeting, the sources added.        
	Trinamul leaders said Mamata was not pleased with the SUCIs public criticism of her decision to involve private parties in railway projects.         
	The SUCI had accused Mamata of imposing higher fares on passengers by renaming express trains as super-fast ones.        
	Tarun Mondol, the SUCI MP from Jaynagar, said on the sidelines of todays rally that his party would not mind joining the Left and other democratic forces to protest the fuel price hike.        
	The SUCI had earlier attended the Left Fronts rally to condole the death of Jyoti Basu which Trinamul had boycotted.

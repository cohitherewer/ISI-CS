	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Navodaya Vidyalayas, the chain of Centre-run residential schools, will diversify from regular courses and start cultural schools to help students develop and nurture their skills in music, dance and drama.        
	Four such schools focusing on the performing arts will be set up. The training will enhance the aesthetic sensibilities of students and make them self-sufficient. After the courses, they can take up jobs or pursue further studies.        
	The Navodaya Vidyalaya Samitis executive body, headed by Union HRD minister Kapil Sibal, has approved the plan and has asked the organisation to submit a detailed proposal, ministry sources told The Telegraph.        
	Under the proposal drawn up so far, there will be four years of schooling starting from Class IX. Students will study parts of general courses such as math, science and literature in Classes IX and X. But in Classes XI and XII, they will focus on culture.        
	The students will organise exhibitions and programmes. Another key objective behind such schools is that they will help strengthen the cultural roots and preserve national heritage.        
	The schools will encourage children to develop a taste in classical music, dance, folk forms, theatre and art. Students who are good in music will be given admission through a talent search.         
	The diversification does not end with culture. The Navodaya Samiti has also decided to start what are now being described as 10 science magnet schools which will be dedicated to science subjects.        
	These will be located near the scientific institutions and research laboratories.         
	Students passing out from these schools will pursue advanced scientific research. This proposal is set to go to the Union cabinet soon.        
	The 594 Navodaya schools, which mainly target the rural poor, are regarded as islands of excellence. About 97 per cent students of these schools pass the board exam every year. About 74 per cent are from families with an annual income less than Rs 48,000.        
	The Navodaya samiti has argued that about 4 to 5 per cent children in every community are gifted students who need to be identified and provided with quality education.

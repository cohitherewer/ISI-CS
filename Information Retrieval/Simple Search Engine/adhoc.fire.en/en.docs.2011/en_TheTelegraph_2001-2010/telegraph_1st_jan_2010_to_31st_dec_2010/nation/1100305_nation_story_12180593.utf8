                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Barc officer from Calcutta kills herself
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 4: A young scientific officer from Calcutta working with the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre killed herself in her room last night, hours after she had returned from her home city happy and looking forward to marriage.        
	Colleagues of Titas Pal, who celebrated her birthday last week and was also looking ahead to a transfer to Calcutta, broke open the door to find the 27-year-old hanging by the windowsill of her 14th-floor flat in the Barc staff quarters at Anushakti Nagar.        
	Titass death was the second of a Barc employee in 10 days after a 47-year-old mechanical engineer was on February 22 found dead in his flat. Initially believed to be a suicide, police had later registered a murder case.        
	S.K. Malhotra, spokesperson for the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), said Titas was a scientific officer with the Isotope division of the Radio Chemistry department.        
	She had returned from Calcutta on Wednesday morning and was at her office the whole day. Her friends and colleagues in the department said she was a cheerful, bubbly girl who was looking forward to her transfer to Calcutta and wanted to marry and settle down, Malhotra said.        
	A senior police officer in Trombay said the cops recorded the statement of Titass father Subrato Pal after he reached Mumbai. He said his daughter celebrated her birthday on February 28 and had left Calcutta in a happy frame of mind. He told us she was engaged to a doctor living close to their house in Shyambazar, assistant commissioner Jalinder Khandagale said.        
	The police have not found any suicide note in the flat but Khandagale said the post-mortem report had confirmed death by hanging. However, we will investigate why she took this step of killing herself. We will investigate all angles and also check her mobile phone records to see if she spoke to anybody before her death.         
	Colleagues said Titas told them she was feeling tired after the long flight from Calcutta and left office earlier than usual. She was last seen around 4.30pm.         
	Police sources said Titas used to call her family in Calcutta as soon as she returned to her quarters around 5.30-6 in the evening. Mobile phones are not allowed in the high-security Barc core area, so employees take or make calls once out of their workplace.        
	But when no call came from Titas, her father, who works as chief chemist for CESC, tried her number.        
	Her father telephoned one of her friends saying she was not answering her mobile or landline and asked the friend to leave a message to call him back. The friend went to her flat, but finding no sign of Titas, left a hand-written note by the door asking her to call her father. Around dinner time, she went again to the flat and found the note still by the door, DAE spokesperson Malhotra said.        
	Perplexed, she called her friends and neighbours. They broke open the door to find her hanging by the windowsill.        
	She had requested a transfer to the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, a DAE division in Calcutta, and she would have got the transfer soon, Malhotra said.        
	Titas was rushed to the Barc hospital at Anushakti Nagar but doctors declared her dead. Radio Chemistry and Isotope Group director V. Venugopal said Titas was an enthusiastic scientist.        
	On February 22, mechanical engineer Mahadevan Iyer was found dead in his first-floor flat near Breach Candy hospital in south Mumbai. Initially believed to be a suicide, the police registered a murder case when the post-mortem revealed that he had suffered internal bleeding after being hit with a blunt object.         
	Police sources said they suspected a homosexual liaison might have led to the murder.        
	Break-in bid        
	Trombay police have arrested a 40-year-old man for trying to break into the project office of the Board of Radiation and Isotope technology yesterday night. Barc authorities said the building housed marketing and finance departments and the incident posed no threat to the high-security zone where atomic reactors are located.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Heat wave hits Bihar, spells doom for crops
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Scorching days                                  
	Patna, March 25: An unexpected and steep rise in temperatures, creating a heat wave-like situation across Bihar, has left residents gasping for relief.        
	Meteorological office sources said that Patna has been recording maximum temperature of 40.5C against the normal 34C usually recorded in the last week of March in previous years.         
	A heat wave is lashing Gaya, Chapra, Purnea, Bhagalpur and Forbesganj, bordering Nepal.         
	Gaya today recorded the highest temperature of 41C against the normal temperature of 35C and Purnea, Bhagalpur, Chapra and Forbesganj recorded 38C, 37.9C, 38.6C and 37.2C respectively, against the normal temperatures of 33-34C at this time.        
	The director of the meteorological office, Animesh Chanda, told The Telegraph: The dry westerly wind blowing across the cloudless region has brought about the sudden heat wave-like situation. The sun rays have also become intense for they do not have to negotiate through a cloud cover.        
	Chanda, however, said the situation was temporary.         
	The situation should get back to normal after two days as the dry westerly wind is likely to stop in the next couple of days, he said.        
	Agriculture experts say that the sudden heat wave may have an adverse impact on kharia crops, particularly wheat and barley, which yet are to be harvested.         
	The heat wave coupled with dry westerly wind will suck the moisture from the land leading to the premature ripening of the grains. In that situation, the size of the grains would be reduced, experts say.        
	Not everybody is complaining though.         
	Mantu, an electrician on Ashiana Road here, had little to do till three days ago. Now, it is hard to seek his services for his small shop has been filled up with old coolers and fans for repair.

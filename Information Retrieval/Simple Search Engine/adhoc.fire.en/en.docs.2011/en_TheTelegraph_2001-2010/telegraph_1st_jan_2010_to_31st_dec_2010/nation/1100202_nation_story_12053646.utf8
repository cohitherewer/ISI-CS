          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 1: State JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan, alias Lallan Singh, today resigned from his post in protest against chief minister Nitish Kumars dictatorial style of functioning.        
	I have resigned from my post as Bihar JD(U) president. I will not take my resignation back, Lallan said soon after tendering his resignation to party president Sharad Yadav at the latters New Delhi residence.        
	I have not yet accepted the resignation. He continues to be in the party. We will discuss the issues raised by him in the internal party forum, Yadav said, refusing to reveal the content of dialogue with Lallan.        
	Lallans resignation is the culmination of his differences with Nitish for over a month. Observers describe it as unhealthy development in the election year for the JD(U), which suffered loss in the September by-election.        
	Unfazed by Lallans resignation, Nitish appeared in the Janata ke durbar mein mukhyamantri programme as usual today and refused to comment on the developments in his party.         
	Everything is well in Bihar. We are working relentlessly for the betterment of the state and its people. I never discuss party matters through media, Nitish said.        
	The grapevine has it that Lallan, a long-time aide to Nitish, had of late turned bitter to his mentor for the chief minister not listening to him in matter of transfer of senior government officials or allotment of party tickets.        
	Moreover, Lallan, an upper caste Bhumihar, was also opposed to Nitish denying ticket to the wards of the senior MPs and MLAs and the chief ministers promotion of the EBCs and Mahadalits.         
	Lallan, however, said: I am very much in the party. I will not do anything which damages the interest of the party, which I have raised.

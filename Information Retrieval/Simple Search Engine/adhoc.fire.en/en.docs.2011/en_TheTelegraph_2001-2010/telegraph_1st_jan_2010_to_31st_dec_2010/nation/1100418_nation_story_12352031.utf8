          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 17: A Japanese tourist in her mid-twenties was raped last night by an auto driver and four others in a village in Bodh Gaya, the revered destination of Buddhist pilgrims from across the world.        
	According to the victims statement made to a police officer, she had hired the auto around 8.30pm to go to the Gaya railway station from where she was to take a train to Calcutta.        
	Little did she realise that she was being followed by four others in another auto. Near village Amwan on River Side Road, 3km away and under Bodh Gaya police station, the driver asked her to disembark and board the auto that was following them.        
	He joined the four others in that auto. When they took a sudden turn to the left, she realised something was amiss and protested. But the men overpowered her and gagged her.         
	They took her to a secluded spot and took turns in raping her. The assailants then took away her wallet containing her passport and dropped her near the Gaya railway station.        
	The tourist, who arrived in Bodh Gaya a couple of days ago and stayed at a private guest house on River Side Road, first approached the railway police to register her complaint.         
	Three suspects have been detained. Magadh Range DIG Anupama Nilekar has assigned the case to Gaya SP Sushil Khopade and asked him to complete investigations at the earliest so that there could be a speedy trial and the victims statement recorded before April 24 when she is scheduled to leave for Japan.        
	Nilekar said a medical examination was conducted on the victim this morning at Gaya. A medical board was being constituted to conduct a thorough examination, while a special forensic sciences team had been requisitioned to collect evidence.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed concern and promised action. No one involved in the dastardly act will be spared. The law will ensure the culprits are punished, he said.        
	This is the second incident of rape involving a Japanese tourist in Bodh Gaya.         
	In 2007, a Japanese tourist was sexually assaulted after being kept hostage for several days. Three persons were convicted in a speedy trial and was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment.

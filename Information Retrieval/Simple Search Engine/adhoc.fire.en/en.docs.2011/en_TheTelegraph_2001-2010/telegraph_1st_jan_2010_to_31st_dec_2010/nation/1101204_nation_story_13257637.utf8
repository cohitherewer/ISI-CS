The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anti-graft bill in House, party outside
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Anti-graft bill in House, party outside
  - BJP MPs proposal to check corruption falls victim to Oppositions protest         SANJAY K. JHA       
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Had members of Parliament not been busy shouting to shut down the Lok Sabha today, they could have discussed a proposed legislation to root out corruption.         
	The House was supposed to take up private members business and one bill listed was on steps to root out corruption. It was to be moved by senior BJP leader Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav, whose party is leading the campaign to paralyse Parliament.         
	The bill proposed that all cases of misuse of official position should be disposed of within a fixed time frame; appointment of retired government officials to any post, government or private, be banned; declaration of assets by office-bearers of all political parties be made mandatory; and that money illegally deposited in foreign banks be brought back.         
	However, Yadavs bill became a victim of his partys campaign against corruption.         
	Other bills that could not be introduced or taken up as the Parliament logjam continued for the fourth week include the controversial womens reservation bill, which the government is now eyeing as a tool to divide the Opposition.         
	Minister of state for parliamentary affairs V. Narayansamy today said the government is considering bringing the womens bill in the Lok Sabha. The bill has been passed by the Rajya Sabha.         
	But the governments hope of using it to split the Opposition might be misplaced because the BJP, too, is not keen to pass it in a hurry and is unlikely to bite the bait to abandon its protest.         
	There are 23 other bills pending before Parliament for final approval, after being passed by one or the other House in previous sessions.         
	Two Constitution amendment bills on 50 per cent reservation for women in municipalities and panchayats, the Arms Act (Amendment) Bill, the anti-hijacking bill, seeds bill, wakf amendment bill and the educational tribunal bill are among them.         
	Eight new bills are in the pipeline, of which only one the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill  could be introduced in the din.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said more and more bills are coming from the standing committees but have to be put in the cold storage now. He said the government hoped good sense would prevail on the Opposition even now and that Parliament would resume normal business from Monday.         
	Asked if the government would review its decision to reject the Opposition demand for a JPC probe into spectrum allocation, Bansal said: They are not interested in fighting corruption and unearthing the truth in the 2G scam. They only want JPC as a political tool to embarrass the ministers and the Prime Minister and that we are not going to give.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Defence date for flat trigger

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Adarsh housing society in Mumbai. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: The defence ministry has set November 8 as the deadline for a decision it will take on cracking down on officials and politicians suspected to be part of a nexus that built the 31-storey Adarsh high-rise in South Mumbais upscale Colaba.        
	Defence ministry sources said a report from the navy submitted on Tuesday evening had clearly stated that the building is a security threat. The 110-metre structure overlooks the naval air station INS Shikra and also gives a view of the naval dockyard.        
	The defence ministry also said that it had not yet referred the Adarsh case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). But the CBI is understood to have begun a preliminary inquiry based on private complaints. It asked the navy if it had given the building security clearance. The navy said it had refused to.        
	The sources said the reports of the army and the Director General of Defence Estates (DGDE) had also pointed to irregularities. Defence minister A.K. Antony along with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has been entrusted by Sonia Gandhi to recommend a course of action after Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan offered to resign after it was found that his mother-in-law was allotted a flat in the building.        
	Former army chief Generals (retired) Deepak Kapoor and N.C. Vij and former navy chief Admiral (retired) Madhvendhra Singh have also been allotted apartments. The former service chiefs have offered to give up their allotments if the building was in deed meant for widows of soldiers killed in the 1999 Kargil war.        
	Antony had asked for separate reports from the army, the DGDE and the navy. It was the navy that first raised concerns of a security threat when the Western Naval Command chief, Vice-Admiral Sanjeev Bhasin, wrote to the Maharashtra government.        
	A defence ministry source said that in its report submitted on Tuesday evening, the navy said the high-rise was built within the security perimeter of military installations.        
	We are now collating all the information we have got from the three reports. I think by Monday we will take a decision, he said.        
	In its report, the army has also raised security concerns over the building. But it said the matter had never reached Army Headquarters in New Delhi. The no-objection from the army had been given to the state government and the builders at the level of the local command (area command, Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat).        
	The army also suggested to the defence ministry that a more comprehensive investigation needs to be carried out. The army is understood to have recommended that the land records of the site should be analysed to find out how the builder took possession of it.        
	The report of the DGDE said the land on which the Adarsh building was constructed was with the army for 60 years. In 1964, the collector of Mumbai had objected to the transfer of the land.

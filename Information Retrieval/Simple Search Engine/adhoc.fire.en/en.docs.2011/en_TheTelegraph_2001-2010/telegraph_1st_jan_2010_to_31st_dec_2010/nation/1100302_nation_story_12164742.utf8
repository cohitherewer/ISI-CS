The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Women scheme nod with cut

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     Patil and Tirath                                  
	New Delhi, March 1: The UPA government is ready to launch its promised flagship scheme to streamline the delivery of programmes for women on March 8, after months of internal quibbling involving the President and the women and child development ministry.         
	But the government has agreed to the launch only after whittling down the financial allocations for the scheme to less than 1 per cent of the amount sought by women and child development minister Krishna Tirath.        
	The National Mission for the Empowerment of Women will be launched by President Pratibha Patil this International Womens Day, ending months of intra-government debate on its ambit and structure, government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The mission, envisaged by Patil in 2008 during the UPAs first term, aims to integrate the countrys myriad schemes aimed at helping women under a single monitoring structure to ensure better delivery.        
	Under pressure, Tiraths ministry agreed to downsize the mission. Tirath asked for Rs 8,000 crore for the mission, but the Planning Commission and the finance ministry objected. Instead, they have convinced the ministry to accept a mere Rs 60 crore allocation for the mission  an amount so small that the project does not technically even need cabinet approval.         
	In her first address to Parliament after the return of the UPA to power last year, Patil had listed starting the mission among the targets of the government for its first 100 days in office.         
	But the mission, cited by the UPA as an indicator of its concern for womens empowerment, failed to take off till now primarily because other wings of the government opposed changes to the scheme proposed by Tirath.         
	The Planning Commission, the Presidents office and other government arms contended that the mission, while dovetailing multiple women-centric schemes, could not be created as a parallel bureaucracy to run these schemes.         
	Tirath ran into trouble with the Prime Ministers Office also over the mission. She announced in Parliament that the Prime Minister would head the mission  without seeking the approval of Manmohan Singh  and was rapped on the wrists.        
	But the expenditure finance committee that vets all new projects requiring funding finally cleared the mission in the last week of February.         
	A committee of secretaries is now vetting the mission structure but is expected to approve it soon. The mission represents probably the first major government plan inspired by President Patil.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Sept. 14: Azam Khan, a key witness in the Sohrabbuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, was shot at in Udaipur today by two motorcycle-borne assailants who managed to get away.         
	Udaipur SP Sanjay K. Narzari told The Telegraph that Azam had gone to Udai Sagar Lake, about 10km from Udaipur, this evening. The two unidentified assailants shot at him, injuring him in the arm.        
	He has been admitted in an Udaipur hospital and is reportedly out of danger. Police are on the lookout for the attackers.        
	Azam had voiced fears about his life after he became a witness in the case. He was a close confidant of Sohrabuddin.         
	The CBI had recently said in its chargesheet that Sohrabuddin extorted money from marble traders in Udaipur. Azam, after turning a witness, had alleged that the marble traders of Udaipur had met Rajasthan police officers and politicians, including then home minister Gulab Chand Kataria and state BJP president Om Mathur, to get Sohrabuddin eliminated.         
	Azam had spent time in jail with Tulsiram Prajapati, another close aide of Sohrabuddin, who was killed in an encounter in 2006. The CBI had said Prajapati was killed as he knew about the murder and may have confided in Azam.

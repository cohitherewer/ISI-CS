          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Ram temple crusader Vinay Katiyar has renounced politics and taken to spiritualism.        
	The former Bajrang Dal president and now BJP general secretary has shut himself up in his home in Ayodhya and refuses to meet anybody. He is not even taking calls from party leaders in Delhi.         
	However, BJP insiders who have worked with Katiyar said the renunciation was his way of telling the high command he wouldnt take kindly to the induction of another star from Uttar Pradesh in new chief Nitin Gadkaris team of office-bearers likely to be announced next month.        
	The reference was to Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi whom the RSS wants to project as the BJPs new face in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Sangh is keen Varun should figure in Gadkaris pack. Obviously as before the team should have a place for everyone  Hindutvawaadis, liberals, Dalits and so on. But we cannot have two of a kind. If Varuns in, Katiyars redundant because they represent the same brand of politics. The way a liberal like Jaswant Singh complimented a hardliner like Murli Manohar Joshi in the past, said an RSS source.        
	Katiyar is seen as a has-been. He lost the last two elections he fought and his articulation of political Hindutva, focused solely on the Ram temple, is perceived as narrow and dated, sources said.         
	Varun can be packaged as the new voice of Hindutva. He can become a rallying point for youths who are attracted to this kind of politics, an Uttar Pradesh leader said.         
	The Sangh has asked the Uttar Pradesh BJP to test the waters in a series of public meetings Varun will address in the state.

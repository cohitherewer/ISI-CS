The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress pulls it off, Yeddy versus Reddy 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress pulls it off, Yeddy versus Reddy 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              BS Yeddyurappa and G Janardhana Reddy				                                 
	New Delhi, July 29: Shaken by the unexpected public response to the Congresss Bellary Chalo padyatra, Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa was forced to act against the Reddy brothers who control illegal iron ore mining and export it from the state.        
	However, some of the BJPs Karnataka functionaries, who were concerned about the long-term implications of the Yeddyurappa versus Reddys face-off, thought the chief ministers move came too late and was too little.         
	He ought to have shown more moral and political courage rather than enact cosmetic measures because he is losing public sympathy, said a BJP central office-bearer.        
	Today, Yeddyurappa banned iron ore export from the minor ports of Karnataka that come under the states jurisdiction according to the Ports Act of 1908. New Mangalore is the only port from where iron ore can be shipped out because it comes under the Centre. But the chief minister ensured that this facility would also be shut because of objections from the state forest department that were conveyed to the Centre.        
	Yeddyurappa also cancelled permits to allow iron ore transport within Karnataka. The prohibitory injunction that was initially enforced in the districts of South Kanara, Udupi and Hasan was contested in Karnataka High Court by truckers who pleaded for its movement on the national highways. But the court upheld the order.        
	Earlier this month when the activities of the three Reddy brothers  two are ministers in the Karnataka government  came under scrutiny, Yeddyurappa pleaded with the Centre to proscribe iron ore export from India.         
	The Centre made it clear that the demand was not feasible because iron ore fines (as opposed to lumps) constitute about 87 per cent of exports from India but the country does not have the expertise and the technology to use them. As a result, a huge amount of foreign exchange would be lost if the fines are not exported.        
	The BJP leadership didnt help the chief minister. At least three powerful central leaders, including Sushma Swaraj, allegedly patronised the brothers, Janardhana, Karunakara and Somasekhara. Sushma first met them when she contested a Lok Sabha election from Bellary in 1998 against Sonia Gandhi. Although she lost, she maintained contact with the Reddys and unfailingly attends the Varalakshmi puja they perform every August at their ancestral home in Bellary.        
	Next months puja has turned into a political rally that will be addressed by Sushma as a riposte to the Congresss padyatra to arouse public opinion against the BJP government with the Reddys as the centrepiece of the discourse.        
	Sources close to Yeddyurappa, however, stressed his moves had the high commands consent. B.K. Hari Prasad, the Congress general secretary from Karnataka, dismissed them as gimmicks. Instead of stopping the loot of wealth, the CM has merely downed the shutters. He has tricked the people of Karnataka, Prasad said.        
	BJP sources agreed with him: The ban is like throwing the baby with the bath water. The CM should contain illegal mining but he is scared to do it because he may lose his job. Eventually, the BJP will have to pay a price for the Reddys misdeeds, said a source.        
	The decision was also questioned for another reason. Ever since China announced the dates of the Olympics, the Reddys were on a roll. A bulk of the ore required for the infrastructure was exported by Karnataka. They have made their billions, they are unconcerned with the ban, a BJP source maintained.

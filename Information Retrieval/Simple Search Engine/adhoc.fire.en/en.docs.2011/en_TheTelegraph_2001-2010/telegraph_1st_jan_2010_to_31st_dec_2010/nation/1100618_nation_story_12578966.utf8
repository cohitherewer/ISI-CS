The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Partial closure, fine on Himadri
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Partial closure, fine on Himadri
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	Calcutta, June 17: The Bengal pollution control board today asked Himadri Chemicals and Industries to close one of its two units in Hooghly until proper pollution control measures are put in place and fined the company Rs 10 lakh for not adhering to environment norms.        
	The companys factory near Singur had come under the glare a day after the Bhopal gas tragedy verdict when carbon soot-laced smoke allegedly emanating from the unit created panic in the area.        
	There are two units at the plant and we have ordered the closure of one of the units until the adoption of proper pollution control measures, said P.N. Roy, the chairman of the pollution control board (PCB).         
	If proper pollution control measures are still not put in place, we will take stringent steps in future, he added.         
	We have been asked to keep a section of the plant, which is already under maintenance, closed. We will discuss the order with our legal counsel, said Anurag Choudhary, the Himadri CEO.        
	The unit, which employs 100-odd people, can resume production only after a clearance from the board.         
	The decision was taken after a probe team found the pollution control mechanism inadequate at the unit, which produces coal tar pitch, an ingredient used by aluminium plants.         
	A preliminary report by the PCB had found unusual rise in carbon soot emission from the plant. As the villagers had demanded an immediate closure of the unit  tagged a red category industry in the PCB record book  the expert team had carried out a detailed probe.        
	We had kept a bank guarantee of Rs 25 lakh from the company as there were complaints pending against them. We have decided to slap a penalty of Rs 10 lakh, which is part of the pollution cost the company will have to bear, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the PCBs law officer.        
	On an earlier occasion, the company with an annual turnover of Rs 500 crore had to shell out a pollution cost of Rs 5 lakh as the board was not satisfied with the effluent treatment plant.         
	Mukherjee said the fine would be spent on health, sanitation and water supply projects in villages around the plant and the money would be disbursed through the district magistrates office.         
	Officials of the pollution control board today held the final hearing at their Salt Lake office, giving the company a chance to state its position. The PCB officials iterated their recommendation that the pollution control system at the plant be overhauled.         
	The board has also advised the company to install sensors to monitor any leak of particulate matter through the chimneys.         
	 The PCB has been very lenient. We are not happy and we will observe a black day on Sunday, said Bhaskar Dhara, a villager.

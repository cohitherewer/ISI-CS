          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, July 13: Nitish Kumar today made a strong attempt to wean away Jagdanand Singh, the Buxar MP and trusted of Lalu Prasads men from the RJD, days after having successfully inducted into his fold the partys Muslim face, Taslimuddin. Nitish drove to Ramgarh on the invitation of to inaugurate a womans college. He announced a grant of Rs 20 lakh for the college set up by former Bihar minister and Jagdanands brother, late Sachidanand.        
	Jagdanand has always worked for the cause of development despite staying in a party opposed to us. We (Jagda and I) believe in the politics of development despite belonging to two different political streams, Nitish said.        
	The RJD MP also gushed about the Bihar chief minister for carrying out development work in the state, his praise coming at a time when his boss, Lalu Prasad, has been organising bhandaphor rallies across the state with RamVilas Paswan to expose Nitish Kumars failures.        
	Jagdanand has enjoyed a clean image. He was water resources minister throughout 15 years of the Lalu-Rabri regime and was never involved in any controversy as opposed to half a dozen ministerial colleagues who served time in cases of corruption.         
	But, Jagdanand has always stood by Lalu Prasad, even as Nitish Kumar, George Fernandes, Sharad Yadav and several other bigwigs left the RJD.                     
	Nitishs attention on Jagdanand falls in line with his strategy to woo Rajputs ever since Prabhunath Singh deserted him.

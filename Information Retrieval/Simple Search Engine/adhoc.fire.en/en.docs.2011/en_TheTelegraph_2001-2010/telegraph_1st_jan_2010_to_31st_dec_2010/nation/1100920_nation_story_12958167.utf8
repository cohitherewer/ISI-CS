          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Sept. 19: An embattled Jammu and Kashmir government today clamped curfew on a day the Hurriyat chose to relax its shutdown, challenging the separatists who have held command over normal life in the Valley for months.         
	For three months, Syed Ali Shah Geelani and his hard-line Hurriyat wing decided which day should pass as normal in Kashmir and on which the Valley should down shutters. The Hurriyat generally interspersed its shutdowns with an occasional normal day.         
	The government was compelled to announce curfews on the protest days, though that did nothing to prevent the agitators from taking to the streets. Consequently, on the days the Hurriyat decided to give the Valley people a break, the government too had to lift the curfew.         
	A police officer said: If you had one normal day in a week (according to the Hurriyat protest calendar) we were forced to lift the curfew on that day to give people respite. But we were blamed for surrendering to the separatists. That policy has reversed.         
	Police sources said the strategy to enforce the curfew today was formulated to put the separatists on the defensive.         
	Geelani and moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq were placed under house arrest as a precaution.        
	The Hurriyat criticised the clamping of curfew. We had announced relaxation on Sunday but they (the government) imposed the curfew to force people into subjugation, said Ayaz Akbar, a spokesperson for the Geelani faction of the Hurriyat.         
	The curfew did not pass peacefully, though. In Sopore, a woman bystander was killed when security forces opened fire to quell a mob.        
	Three other persons injured during demonstrations earlier died today, taking the Valley death toll to 106 on the 101st day of the agitation.

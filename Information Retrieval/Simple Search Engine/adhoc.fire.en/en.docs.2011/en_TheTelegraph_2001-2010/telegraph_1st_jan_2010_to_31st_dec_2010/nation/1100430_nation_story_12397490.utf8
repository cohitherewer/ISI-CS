                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu sees Muslim vs OBC plot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 29: Lalu Prasad today accused the Centre of trying to drive a wedge between Muslims and the Other Backward Classes by raising the possibility of a share for backward Muslims within the OBC quota.        
	His comments came in the Lok Sabha after minority affairs minister Salman Khursheeds statement that the Centre was considering implementing the Ranganath Mishra committees recommendation for reservations for Muslim OBCs.        
	They are trying to make Muslims and OBCs fight each other, Lalu said.         
	He dared the Congress to amend the Constitution and provide religion-based reservations if it genuinely cared for the minorities.        
	Does the government want to provide job quotas to Muslims through the Constitution? he asked. As Khursheed tried to side-step the query, Lalu Prasad walked out with other RJD MPs and those from the Samajwadi Party.

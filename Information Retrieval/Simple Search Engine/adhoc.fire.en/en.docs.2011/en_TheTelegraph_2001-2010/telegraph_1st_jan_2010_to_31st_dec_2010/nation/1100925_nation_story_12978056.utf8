          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: An apex committee of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders and the Hindu clergy has demanded that the entire 70 acres on the Ayodhya temple-mosque complex, including the disputed 90x130 feet land housing a makeshift temple, be handed over to them.        
	All this land belongs to Ram. It is his birthplace. This was where he was born and raised, this is where he played as a child. So this land cannot be partitioned and given away to another community for building a structure of another religious faith, the committee said in a resolution adopted at a meeting here today.        
	Claiming to speak of behalf of Indias Ram bhakts (the faithful), the resolution claimed that all preparations for putting up a temple in a democratic way were ready. If there is a proposal to raise a mosque on Shri Rams birthplace, Hindus will unitedly foil the conspiracy.        
	While clerics who addressed news conferences maintained they would abide by the court verdict, Nritya Gopal Das, who heads the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, took a different line. There are courts and courts, lower court, high court and Supreme Court. But Lord Ram is above all of them.        
	VHP chief Ashok Singhal, who was present at the meeting, said if the judgment went against the Hindus, we will oppose it but peacefully.        
	Advani in Somnath        
	Security has been stepped up at Somnath temple with BJP leader L.K. Advani and Uma Bharti scheduled to visit the shrine on Saturday to mark the anniversary of his Ram Rath Yatra to Ayodhya.         
	Advani had taken out the Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in 1990.

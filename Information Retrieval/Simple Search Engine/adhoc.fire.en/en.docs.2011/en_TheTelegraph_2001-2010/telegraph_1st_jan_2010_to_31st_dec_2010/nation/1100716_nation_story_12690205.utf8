          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 15: After Narendra Modi, Bihars ruling alliance has to contend with memories of Ayodhya.        
	The RSS has asked the BJP to cooperate with a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) campaign that will indirectly resurrect memories of the Ram-temple era.        
	The diktat has left BJP leaders struggling to find ways to explain to ally Janata Dal (United) that they are being forced to be part of the Sanghs divisive agenda. We are in a dilemma, said a BJP Lok Sabha MP from Bihar.        
	Last Monday, a day after the BJP and Dal (United) leaders declared truce at a Patna breakfast meeting, state BJP and RSS leaders met separately in the presence of central BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Ananth Kumar.        
	The Sangh representatives said it had been decided at a recent meeting in Jodhpur that the entire parivar, including the BJP, would support the VHP in its four-month campaign to educate and enlighten the post-Babri generation of Hindus about the truth of the Ram temple struggle. The events and circumstances that led to the demolition of the Ayodhya mosque on December 6, 1992, will also be explained.        
	The programme has been tactically named Hanuman shakti ka jagran (awakening of Hanumans powers) to avoid a direct allusion to Ram. It will kick off in August.        
	The Bihar BJP leaders were told that the religious campaign would help them ahead of the state polls later this year by stemming the flight of the upper castes towards the Congress as the stress will be on Hindu sentiment.        
	BJP leaders dont appear to agree. They say that the directive from Nagpur, where the RSS is based, could have been followed without any questions if the party were to fight the elections on its own, a BJP source said. But the Sangh diktat has created a fresh problem for the ruling alliance because chief minister and Dal (United) heavyweight Nitish Kumar has been projecting himself as a pro-Muslim leader, the source added.        
	We just managed to put the Nitish-Narendra Modi chapter behind us. We wanted to get on with the business of election management but we will now have to deal with the RSS, the source said.         
	Nitish is believed to have made it known that the riot-tainted Modi should be kept out of the campaign. Publicly, the BJP has not said whether Modi will address meetings in Bihar, but it seems Nitish has been assured he will not come.        
	Bihar BJP cadres, however, want the Gujarat chief minister to campaign. They say there is a lot of interest and enthusiasm for him after Nitish snubbed the BJP leader during the partys national executive in Patna last month.

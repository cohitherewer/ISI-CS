	Srinagar, Dec. 15: Masrat Alam, who spearheaded the pro-azaadi agitation in Kashmir for five months, has been charged under the Public Safety Act, a law that allows police to detain a suspect for two years without trial.        
	Police sources said Alam, arrested in October, was ques- tioned for weeks before authorities slapped the Public Safety Act against him. The police claimed that some of the stone-throwers were funded by separatists and Alam confessed to giving them money.

	An elephant calf that failed to climb out of a canal in West Midnapore died apparently after the tusks of an adult, which was trying to push it up, pierced its stomach.        
	Forest officials said the dead calf (in picture above) was part of a herd that reached Nayagram from Jharkhands Dalma range on Saturday night. The herd had waded into the irrigation canal to drink water. The calf probably failed to climb up, one official said.        
	The official said villagers, alerted by the trumpeting herd, reached the spot to see the calf lying in a pool of blood and four adults, including two tuskers, surrounding it.

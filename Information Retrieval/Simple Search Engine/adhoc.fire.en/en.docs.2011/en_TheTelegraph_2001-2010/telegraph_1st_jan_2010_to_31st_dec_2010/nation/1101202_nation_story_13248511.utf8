The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NDA plans rally, Left gets the jitters 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      NDA plans rally, Left gets the jitters 
          J.P. YADAV                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: A proposed NDA rally to highlight corruption in the ruling UPA has unsettled the Left, which is worried that the BJP will poach on its third front partners and make its protests ineffective.         
	Both, the BJP-led NDA and the Left-backed third front, want a joint parliamentary committee probe into the 2G telecom spectrum scam, a stand on which the ruling UPA has not given in yet.         
	The NDA is learnt to be trying to bring in some third front parties for its proposed rally against corruption.         
	The BJP has already authorised Sharad Yadav, Janata Dal(United) leader and NDA convener, to hold talks with other Opposition parties and get their support. It was learnt that Yadav has held discussions with Jayalalithas AIADMK and Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal. Both parties are part of the third front.         
	We fear that some of our partners might join the NDA rally. We have made it clear to the BJP that we cannot join them and now they are trying to isolate us, said a CPM leader.         
	In order to keep the third front flock together, the Left parties have called a meeting on Thursday. The meeting has been convened to discuss how secular Opposition parties can stay together and take the anti-corruption campaign to the people, CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said.         
	The Left leaders feel that the government has decided to cut short the Parliament session and thereby now they have no option but to hit the streets and reach out to the masses.         
	The CPM wants to use the 2G scam as an issue to boost cadre morale and slam the Congress and its partners ahead of elections in Bengal and Kerala next year.         
	The Left parties have given a call for weeklong protests from December 5-11.         
	To make an all-India impact and also show that it is still a force, the Left would need other regional parties to back the campaign. Our protest week will otherwise remain confined to three states. At the meeting tomorrow we will ask them to join our campaign and shun the BJP, said a CPM leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Intelligence talks with Pak
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Intelligence talks with Pak
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, June 18: Sharing of intelligence and not the raking up of old wounds will be the focus of talks between P. Chidambaram and his Pakistani counterpart Rehman Malik when the home minister visits Islamabad next week.         
	Matching its agenda with the views expressed at the recent strategic dialogue with the US, India has decided to work out mechanisms to share intelligence on terrorism with Pakistan, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Chidambaram, home secretary G.K. Pillai and foreign secretary Nirupama Rao will leave for Islamabad on June 23 to attend the four-day Saarc interior ministers summit. The Indo-Pak discussions are expected to take place on the sidelines of the meet.         
	Sharing of intelligence on terrorism is on our agenda. It will, however, have to be worked out whether we will share intelligence about a third country or our own countries, a top government official said.         
	Over the recent months, relations between officials of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and Indian officials posted in Islamabad have reportedly improved. Doubts, however, remain over Pakistans sincerity in co-operating with India to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks, including Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, to justice.         
	Washington, it is believed, will play a vital role in the intelligence-sharing talks between the two countries.         
	Home ministry sources said Chidambaram would hand over to Islamabad a report on court proceedings leading to the conviction of Ajmal Kasab, the lone-surviving 26/11 gunman.         
	New Delhis change in tack comes on the heels of its strategic dialogue with the US earlier this month when Washington expressed satisfaction over Indias positive response to its Pakistan policy, including aid to Islamabad.         
	Intelligence-sharing talks, sources said, would focus on non-state actors.        
	While Pakistan has accused Indian spy agency RAW of fomenting trouble, India has said it has evidence against the non-state actors operating from Pakistani soil. Pakistan itself has conceded that its non-state actors were involved (in the 26/11 attack), a home ministry official said.         
	Chidambaram and Pillai will also carry a summary of the six dossiers of evidence that India has already furnished to Pakistan.         
	The National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials who had gone to America to interrogate US terror suspect David Coleman Headley met home secretary Pillai this evening.         
	The Indian team was earlier expected to travel to Islamabad armed with the evidence the NIA had collected from Headley, accused of carrying out the 26/11 recce. But now, with the focus shifting to intelligence-sharing, the information from Headley is expected to carry marginal weight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan for joint medical test
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plan for joint medical test
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, June 29: A common entrance test for all 32,000 undergraduate seats in medical colleges across the country from next year has been proposed by the apex regulator of medical education.         
	The new panel of doctors governing the Medical Council of India today announced that it had requested the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to develop a single test to replace more than 15 versions that currently regulate entry of students from the plus-two level into undergraduate medical colleges. The MCI panel said it would also seek a common test for all 13,000 postgraduate medical seats.        
	A Class 12 student aspiring to join the undergraduate MBBS programme currently takes a minimum of five of six entrance tests, a panel member said.        
	The common test will be used to place students in all government, private and minority-run medical colleges, as well as institutions such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences that are top choices of students.         
	The common test will not change the seat matrix in any way  either in private or minority-run institutions, said Devi Prasad Shetty, who is a panel member.         
	Private colleges and minority institutions have a certain quota of seats that may currently be filled by institution managements.        
	Under the new proposal, the quotas may continue, but all students will have to enter through the common test. For instance, if a college has 20 such quota seats and there are 100 applicants, all 20 seats would go to students who have taken the test.        
	Students will be the biggest beneficiaries of this move, said Shiv Kumar Sarin, who leads the six-member MCI panel of doctors pitched into new roles as education regulators.        
	The government had earlier this year appointed the panel to replace the MCI board after the arrest of its former president Ketan Desai on allegations of corruption.         
	A common test will reduce the stress of multiple exams for the same course.        
	A member of the MCI panel said the common test would have to overcome certain administrative or legislative hurdles, but declined to specify details. Separate tests are currently offered by several institutions including AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, and several states.         
	This is an excellent proposal  not only will it ease the burden on students, it is also the only way to stop the practice of capitation fees, said Kunchala Michael Shyamprasad, a former member of a health ministry task force on medical education.        
	Colleges with private quotas can now literally give away seats even to undeserving students who pay capitation fees.        
	A common test will ensure only students with merit get the seats. For precisely this reason, the proposal is likely to encounter intense opposition, Shyamprasad said.        
	Many colleges are exploiting the existing system to earn millions of rupees, he said. Typical capitation fees demanded by private medical colleges in India range Rs 20 lakh upwards.        
	A common test would also introduce uniformity in the test standards across the country, Sarin said. Right now, we have a situation where a test by one medical college is considered very difficult, another is seen as relatively easy.        
	The panel member said they have already discussed the proposal with the CBSE and with sections of private medical colleges. Both the CBSE and the colleges we have talked to agree that this is a good thing, a member said.

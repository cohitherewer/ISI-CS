The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak gets ready for Krishna talks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak gets ready for Krishna talks
          NASIR JAFFRY                            Krishna (top) and Qureshi                                 
	Islamabad, June 4: Pakistan has started the homework for Indian external affairs minister S.M. Krishnas visit to Islamabad next month, with the foreign office getting inputs from ministries on key issues to be raised during the talks, officials said.        
	The foreign office is in touch with interior and defence ministries as well as water (resources department) officials to discuss and finalise the agenda points for the talks, a senior official told The Telegraph here. Krishna will hold talks with his counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who had last month invited him to Islamabad.        
	Indian home minister P. Chidambaram is also scheduled to travel to Pakistan for a Saarc conference of home ministers on June 26, a trip the Pakistani official said would help set in motion the dialogue process suspended since the 26/11 attacks.        
	The two foreign secretaries will meet and finalise the agenda of talks between their foreign ministers when they meet in Islamabad on the sidelines of the Saarc conference of interior (home) ministers. We hope that the two sides will be able to bridge the trust deficit during their upcoming interactions, the official said.        
	Pakistans parliamentary committee on national security has finalised a set of recommendations for the talks. The recommendations will be sent to the foreign office in a few days, the official said.        
	Another official outlined the contours of what could be discussed. We hope the talks will focus on peace and security in the region with special reference to efforts to combat terrorism, water issues, confidence-building measures, progress in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks and the insurgency in Balochistan, he said.        
	The foreign ministers of both countries had agreed to meet in Islamabad during a telephone conversation last month that was a follow-up to the meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani on the margins of the Saarc summit in Bhutan capital Thimphu.        
	India had blamed the Mumbai attacks on Pakistans Laskhar-e-Toiba, asked Islamabad to quickly bring to justice the perpetrators to justice and hand over Hafiz Saeed, who had founded the banned terror outfit in the 1980s.        
	Pakistan refused to hand over Saeed citing insufficient evidence on his involvement in the attacks, but indicted seven suspects, including alleged mastermind, the Lashkars Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi.

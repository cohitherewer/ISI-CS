	Mumbai, Aug. 25: Mumbai police, who yesterday tracked down four Latin American jewel thieves at Dubai airport as they were fleeing with diamonds worth Rs 6.6 crore, are now probing if the group had any link with an uncannily similar heist in Bangalore in March.        
	Then, the Bangalore crime branch had caught four Latin Americans who had robbed jewellery valued at Rs 1.5 crore and fled to Goa.        
	Bangalore joint commissioner Alok Kumar said: The only difference is that the Mumbai group carried out the heist at the jewellery expo, while the Bangalore group had targeted the hotel where the jeweller was staying. This group also consisted of three men and one woman.        
	Kumar said the mastermind, Pedro Alexjandro Maita Rodriguez, 30, is still in jail. His 22-year-old girlfriend, Maira Alexjandra Giraldo, and accomplices Elenilson Amilcar Ruano, 34, and Luis Alberto Giraldo Lopez, 25, jumped bail. While Roriguez is from Ecuador, the rest are from Colombia.        
	Pedro and his group came to Mumbai from Kathmandu in February. They stayed in Mumbai till the 26th or 27th. They visited Calcutta to target a jewellery exhibition around March 2, but the exhibition was cancelled. The group then went to Kathmandu and returned to Bangalore to carry out the Pride Hotel heist. Here, too, they struck on the last day of a jewellery exhibition as they did in Mumbai.        
	The group told interrogators they had hatched a plot to target jewellery exhibitions in south India sitting in Kuala Lumpur.        
	The Mumbai crime branch has found that the three men and one woman caught yesterday had arrived in the city on August 17, two days before the India International Jewellery Show 2010 began. While Gutierez Orlando, who claimed to be Venezualan, stayed at the JW Marriott, the others  Guerrero Lugo Elvia Grissel, Campos Molan Elias and Gonzalez Maldonaldo Mauricio, who said they were Mexican  stayed at The Westin Mumbai Garden City hotel.        
	An hour and a half before the show was to end on Monday, they stole the diamonds and left by the back gate. They returned to their hotels before regrouping at the airport to board the 10pm Emirates Mumbai-Dubai-Hamburg flight.                    
	The police scanned the faces of nearly 1,500 visitors on CCTV and identified the group. The footage was matched with the registration details of the four, whose photographs and passport details were with the organisers. Then the police contacted immigration.        
	But the flight had left, so the crime branch got in touch with the Interpol wing of the CBI and the Union home ministry, which contacted Dubai. The thieves were taken off the plane at Dubai airport early on Tuesday. Mumbai police are likely to send a team with a non-bailable warrant to bring them back.

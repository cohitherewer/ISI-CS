	Srinagar, June 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today warned security forces they would face action if they violated human rights.        
	I am aware of some complaints related to human rights. On this issue, the government policy is to protect the human rights of the people even when dealing with terrorism, he said.         
	The stern message came a day after two army officers were benched for their alleged role in killing three young men, who had been branded militants but later turned out to be innocent civilians.        
	Singh also said meaningful talks with Pakistan were possible only when cross-border attacks stopped, and reached out to separatists, too, but made it clear they had to shun violence first.

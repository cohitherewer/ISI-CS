	New Delhi, May 22: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today suggested that pilot error could be behind the crash of Flight IX 812, saying all parameters were normal.        
	It should have been a normal landing. All parameters were normal. We need to wait for the inquiry report, Patel said.         
	The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has appointed an inspector of inquiries to investigate the reasons behind the crash. The ministry will also put in place a four-to-five member court of inquiry headed by a retired high court judge to carry out a detailed investigation.        
	The investigation will be assisted by officials of US National Transportation Safety Board and a Boeing team which is rushing to India, said an MEA official. The Indian mission in the US is facilitating their visa issuance. Air India has also constituted a team to look into the mishap.         
	The minister, as well as civil aviation secretary M. Madhavan Nambiar, said only a detailed investigation could reveal what caused the crash.         
	Nambiar said machine failure could not be totally ruled out but Patel hinted that it was unlikely. The Boeing 737-800, manufactured in 2008, had clocked only 126 flying hours. The aircraft, leased from Four Lion LLC Delaware by Air India, had its certificate of airworthiness valid till January 2013.         
	The ministry said the Mangalore runway was dry, the weather conditions normal with visibility at a comfortable 6km, a calm wind and no rain at the time of the incident. Also, the pilot was in constant touch with the Air Traffic Control (ATC).        
	Around 10 miles from touchdown, the pilot had reported to ATCthat it was on course to land. The landing clearance was given about 4 miles from touchdown.        
	Patel and his officials dismissed charges on the inadequacy of the runway. The minister claimed that the runway met all DGCA standards. The officials pointed out that the old runway at the airport was barely 6000 feet, which is considered ade- quate for aircraft like Boeing 737-800.        
	The new airstrip, operationalised in May 2006, is 8,000 feet with 90 metres of safety area  sufficient for a plane of the type to land.        
	There have been 32,000 landings at this runway since it was operationalised. We have not received even a single complaint from any pilot, Nambiar claimed.        
	Officials also pointed out that there was no distress call from the pilots, who were experienced.         
	Patel also pointed out that the survival of some passengers suggested that the aircraft did not catch fire immediately after landing.         
	The officials are hoping for more information once the black box is found.        
	Air India will run a larger aircraft on the Delhi-Mangalore sector instead of its regular Canadian regional jet forfamily members of the crash victims to Mangalore.         
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh his countrys deepest condolences and sympathies on the crash. I was deeply shocked to learn of the tragic crash of an Air India Express aircraft this morning, resulting in the loss of many precious lives, Gilani said in the message to Singh.        
	Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also sent her condolences to Singh.        
	Helplines        
	Helplines have been set up in Delhi, Mangalore and Bangalore.        
	The Delhi numbers are 011-25656196 and 011-25603101 while the Mangalore number is 082-42220422. The Bangalore numbers are 080-66785172 and 080-22273310.

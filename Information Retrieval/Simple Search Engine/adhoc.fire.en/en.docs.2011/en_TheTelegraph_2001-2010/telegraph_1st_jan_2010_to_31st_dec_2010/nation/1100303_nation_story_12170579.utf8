The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress ready to face petrol storm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress ready to face petrol storm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 2: The Congress is prepared to face the storm over the hike in fuel prices when Parliament resumes tomorrow, with the leadership deciding not to yield to demands for a rollback.         
	The tough stance sparked fears that the Opposition, united in calling for a reversal of the move, may disrupt proceedings again.        
	The Congress core committee met this evening at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs residence and discussed the strategy to be adopted in the House. It was decided that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee would explain the rationale behind the decision to the ruling UPAs allies who have been demanding a rollback.         
	The Opposition will be criticised for ignoring the pressing need to rationalise oil subsidies. The ballooning subsidies, paid to insulate consumers from high prices, have strained the Centres finances and necessitated the hike.        
	Sources said the Congress leadership was in touch with allies like the DMK and Trinamul, and claimed that both partners were against rocking the UPA boat. The Congress parliamentary party is meeting tomorrow and party chief Sonia Gandhi may speak her mind on the issue there.        
	The Prime Minister had indicated yesterday that the hard decision to hike the prices was taken with a long-term view. Sonia relies primarily on Singh and Mukherjee on policy issues, particularly those related to the economy.

	Kuala Lumpur, Oct. 26: China today said it was not rethinking the policy of stapling visas for residents of Jammu and Kashmir, rejecting New Delhis concerns three days before the Prime Ministers of the two countries meet in Hanoi.        
	Though China has friendly relations with India, its policy towards the stapled visas for residents of the state remained unchanged, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said in Beijing.        
	Reacting to the assertion, an official accompanying Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said in Kuala Lumpur: Our position on this issue is very well articulated and conveyed unambiguously to China. Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and we expect that the unfair practice of issuing visas, regardless of the domesticity of the applicants, will be changed.        
	Prime Minister Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the East Asia summit in Hanoi.        
	The practice of issuing stapled visas, which is being seen as an attempt to question Jammu and Kashmirs accession with India, was started by China about two years ago.        
	The issue snowballed into a controversy when China gave a stapled visa to northern army commander Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal in July. India reacted angrily and suspended high-level defence exchanges with China.        
	New Delhi has already made it clear that the defence exchanges will remain on pause till Beijing changes its position on Jammu and Kashmir.

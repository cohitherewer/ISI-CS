  - Workshop on Chilika survey          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Tokyo University-guided technology will be used to study Irrawaddy dolphins                                        
	Bhubaneswar, March 24: The Chilika Development Authority will use an advanced technology to study and monitor the underwater behaviour of Irrawaddy dolphins to approaching objects like boats and noise.        
	Developed by the Underwater Technology Research Centre in Japan under Tokyo University, this new technology is being called a complete device with an array of eight hydrophones with an in-situ data capturing system. The device can be deployed in the lake to capture uninterrupted data.        
	This will help to develop a protocol for dolphin watching. It will also able to determine size, shape, speed, distance and direction of movement, its migration within and outside the lake, said CDA chief executive A.K. Pattnaik.        
	A two-day international workshop on conservation of Irrawaddy dolphin with special reference to the underwater acoustic study will be held from tomorrow to discuss the technology threadbare.        
	Based on the outcome, the wider application of the technology for conservation of the Irrawaddy dolphin in Chilika will be developed. CDA will also ink an MoU with Tokyo University for next two years during the workshop, he said.        
	Significantly, Chilika contains the most important lake population of Irrawaddy dolphins in South Asia. The main identified threats are from the operation of variety of fishing nets, gears and operation of mechanised boats.        
	The Underwater Technology Research Centre and the CDA have been working together since 2006 after the latter approached the Centre, seeking their association in developing customised hydrophones to study the dolphins.

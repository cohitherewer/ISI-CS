The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Voters brave Maoist diktat in Bihar Round II
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Voters brave Maoist diktat in Bihar Round II
          DIPAK MISHRA                          Women line up to vote in Naxalite-affected Motihari in Bihar on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Oct. 24: Voters defied the Maoists poll boycott call today, with booths in Bihars rebel zones recording an average 52.5 per cent polling, up from the previous Assembly elections 45 per cent.         
	The people have rejected the Maoists call and virtually everyone, including women, has voted fearlessly, said Bhola Nath Sah, resident of Turki in the Minapur Assembly seat of Muzaffarpur.        
	Sah and his family were among the first to vote in an area that has witnessed frequent rebel raids.        
	I had never seen such a peaceful election before, said 75-year-old Asharfi Rai of Rupaulia village in the Madhuban constituency of East Champaran district.        
	A few years ago, over 200 Maoists had attacked the town and burnt the house of the then local MP, Sitaram Singh.        
	Four polling agents were kidnapped by alleged Maoists at Runnisaidpur in Sitamarhi district, but all have returned home safely.        
	In five of the 45 Assembly seats that voted in the polls second phase today, however, the exercise had to be wound up by 3pm, two hours before the scheduled close.        
	Polling was 58 per cent in Minapur constituency of Muzaffarpur. Sheohar, where the rebels exploded a landmine and killed six policemen on Friday, too witnessed a good turnout.        
	As in the first round, women voted in large numbers but the average turnout was slightly below the first rounds 55 per cent.        
	The 45 seats stretched across six districts from the Mithilanchal region to the Tirhut zone, covering a large part of Bihars sugar belt.        
	All government sugar mills in the region have remained closed for more than a decade and a half. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had promised to get these mills reopened with the help of private companies but the plan did not work out.        
	The days polling saw a few hiccups. Rashtriya Janata Dal supporters allegedly stoned the car of the minister for minor irrigation and Janata Dal (United) candidate, Dinesh Kushwaha, at Minapur in Muzaffarpur. In Sheohar, a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate was attacked by members of a rival party.        
	In Darbhanga, there was a flutter as two voters tried to snatch a constables rifle after being prevented from voting because they were not carrying valid documents.

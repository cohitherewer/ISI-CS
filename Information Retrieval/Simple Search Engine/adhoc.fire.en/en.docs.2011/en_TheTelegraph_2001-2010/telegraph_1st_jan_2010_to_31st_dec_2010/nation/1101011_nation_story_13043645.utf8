          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Oct. 10: A law that legalised prostitution in Jammu and Kashmir has been removed from the statute books, almost 90 years after it was promulgated by the erstwhile Dogra rulers.         
	Dogras had legalised prostitution through the Public Prostitution Registration Rules, Samvat-1977, in 1921, but it was rendered useless by the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act, 1956.         
	The law continued to be on the statute books, though it was not used. But its presence on the statute books itself was not in good taste, a government officer said.

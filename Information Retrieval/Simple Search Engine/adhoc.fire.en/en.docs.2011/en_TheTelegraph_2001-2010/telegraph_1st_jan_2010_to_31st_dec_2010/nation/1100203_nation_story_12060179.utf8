	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 2: Hackers have managed to sneak into the official email ID of the Central University.        
	The official ID used by the university  banerjee_surabhihotmail.com  has been also used to send vicious mails to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, contents of which are yet to be known.        
	The unidentified sender has reportedly sent four emails to the chief ministers official email ID besides mails to some top government officers. The matter came to light when complaints poured in from some quarters. The authorities could not open the id when they tried yesterday to find out what was wrong.         
	The official ID created in my name has been hacked and vicious mails have been sent to many, including the chief minister. Its shocking and we have informed the matter to the police. Now its up to them to tackle the criminals, said vice-chancellor Surabhi Banerjee         
	The university has filed a complaint with the CID and the state crime branch.         
	However, the police commissionerate and the cyber cell of the state police are investigating the case. An FIR has been lodged by the university at the Sahid Nagar police station.        
	Investigation is on into the varsity email ID hacking case, said Jugal Das, the inspector of Sahid Nagar police station.        
	Cyber crimes, including hacking, piracy, copyright violation and fraudulent and deceitful activities, have been clearly defined with punishment ranging from six months to three years of imprisonment or a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 300,000 in cash or both under the Electronic Transaction Act, 2006, Das added.        
	The hacking comes close on the heels of the chief ministers office receiving a threat mail on the eve of Republic Day.         
	Investigations revealed that the mail was sent by one Pratap Behera (32) of Astarang village in Puri district, police commissioner Bijay Sharma said here this evening.         
	The youth had created a new ID (prakashbehera lt; babuli.1980rediffmail.com) to send the mail from a city-based cyber caf Spider Web, said Sharma. The motive behind the offence was to take vengeance on his cousin Prakash Behera and his family, he said.        
	According to Pratap, his cousin Prakash and his family were torturing him in connection with some land dispute and he committed the offence in sheer desperation. During investigation, he had shown the cyber caf and the desk from where he had sent the email, said Sharma.         
	Pratap was forwarded to the court today.

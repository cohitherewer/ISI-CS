	Lucknow, Oct. 11: The Taj Mahal is getting many foreign visitors this season after a three-year slump, thanks to the Commonwealth Games.         
	This morning, 520 foreign tourists arrived at the Taj by a special Shatabdi Express and 200 reached by other transport, taking the number to a high of 720. Yesterday, there were 405 foreign visitors. On Saturday, the number was 218, state tourism department officials said.         
	We are expecting a 40 per cent growth in tourist inflow this year and the good thing is, at least some of these tourists are staying back in Agra for a day to enjoy the Taj grandeur better, said A.K. Srivastava, assistant director of the Uttar Pradesh tourism department.         
	This growth began after the Commonwealth Games started on October 3. Before this, the average was not more than 200 a day, he said.         
	Before heading back home once their events are over, Games participants are making a trip to Agra with friends and family.                     
	Noeline Davida of the Cook Islands netball team, with some teammates, squeezed a visit to the Taj between two match days on Sunday. After the tensions in a competitive match, it is wonderful to visit the Taj, tourist officials in Agra quoted her as saying.         
	Samantha Cornett, a Canadian squash player, visited the monument yesterday with friends, officials said.         
	A Taj Commonwealth Special Shatabdi is being run by the Northern Railway at the request of the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee since October 3.         
	According to the state tourism department, a total of 2,925 foreign tourists visited the Taj between October 4 and 11. The number was almost double that of the previous eight days  between September 26 and October 3, the monument had received 1,500 visitors from abroad.         
	This week, we expect 1,000 to 1,200 tourist visits per day. The challenge is to keep up the flow. It is expected to fade away by the middle of October, a department official said.         
	Four senior officials of the tourism department are in Agra to monitor the facilities for tourists.         
	Last year, there were 1,545 foreign visitors in September and and 1,928 in October.         
	There were days when just about 50 foreign tourists visited the city during the weekends in September and October 2009, a source said.         
	Surendra Sharma, president of the Agra Hotels and Restaurants Association, said: The Taj Mahal was always tipped as the number one tourism destination in India but because of lack of basic infrastructure, the number of foreign visitors had begun to drop since 2007.         
	The state tourism department was campaigning since July to draw foreign visitors to the Taj. But only a few of the tourists are staying overnight in Agra to catch the night view and the early morning view of the Taj.         
	The rest spend about three hours on average at the monument before heading to one of the five-star hotels for lunch and then returning to Delhi.         
	In many cases, tour guides have hired special buses to ferry foreign tourists to the Taj Mahal from Delhi, which is about 200km away, a tour operator said. As many as 20 such buses operated yesterday, bringing visitors from England, New Zealand, Canada, Sri Lanka and Malaysia.

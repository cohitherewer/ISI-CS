	New York, Sept. 17: After the high-profile expression of India-Pakistan solidarity at the US Open earlier, it was the turn of the Indian and Pakistani permanent representatives to once again come together today in the presence of UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.        
	The opportunity for another display of the thaw, flourishing at least in New York, was provided by the occasion of the handing over of a cheque for $20 million to the UN as Indias contribution to flood relief in Pakistan.        
	Pakistans UN envoy, Abdullah Hussain Haroon expressed his utmost thanks to Indias permanent representative Hardeep Singh Puri, the people and the government of India for the contribution.        
	The secretary-general also thanked India after receiving the cheque from the Indian ambassador.        
	Puri said in remarks at the UN headquarters that natural disasters do not respect national boundaries. This is a small but significant gesture from the highest levels of the Indian government conveying the message that the people of India stand by the people of Pakistan in their hour of need.         
	Puri forcefully recalled the messages of solidarity, sympathy and support from Indias leadership in the immediate aftermath of the devastating floods that affected Pakistan recently.        
	The camaraderie between the Indian and Pakistani envoys to the UN here has become the talk of the town at a time good news about friendships which transcend politics has become increasingly rare in international relations.         
	Ban told Puri and Haroon he would launch a revised flood emergency response plan for Pakistan this afternoon after a meeting attended by the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator.        
	It is likely that India will be among the permanent missions to the UN which will be present at this meeting.        
	Ban said the world body was putting in an extraordinary amount of effort and energy for flood relief in Pakistan and that the afternoon meeting was expected to issue an additional request for help.        
	The cheque for $20 million handed over today is in addition to the $5 million that India has already contributed to the UNs World Food Programme for helping Pakistan.

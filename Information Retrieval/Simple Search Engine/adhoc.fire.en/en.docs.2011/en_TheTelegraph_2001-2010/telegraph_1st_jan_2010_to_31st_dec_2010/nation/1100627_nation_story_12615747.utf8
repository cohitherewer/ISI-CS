          TAPAS CHAKRABARTI                              
	Lucknow, June 25: The CBI has filed an FIR against 11 policemen, including an IPS officer, for their involvement in a 2007 encounter in which the son of a state govern- ment employee was gunned down in Bareilly on the suspicion that he was a bank robber.        
	J. Ravinder Gaur, a 2005 batch IPS officer, had allegedly ordered the encounter when he was posted in Bareilly as the additional superintendent of police.        
	This is the first time in over two decades that an IPS officers name has figured in an FIR in Uttar Pradesh, from where the maximum number of police encounters are reported.         
	Other than Gaur, who is now the Balrampur superintendent of police, the FIR names four inspectors and six constables.        
	The CBI has filed a case of murder and conspiracy against the 11 policemen.        
	On June 30, 2007, the accused inspectors and constables had allegedly shot dead Mukul Gupta, 23, suspecting him to be a bank robber.         
	The FIR said the police had received information that day that five men who were planning to loot a bank would pass through Fatehganj in Bareilly in a Tata Sumo.        
	The policemen arrived at the spot at 10.30am and when they saw a Tata Sumo passing by, they chased the vehicle.        
	The police later claimed that the car did not stop in spite of being asked to do so.         
	The police also said those travelling in the car fired at them when they realised that the police were at their heels.         
	Mukul was killed when the police fired back.         
	Gaur was not present during the encounter.         
	Three of the four others travelling in the car were arrested but were later granted bail because of lack of evidence.        
	However, a CBI probe revealed that the encounter was carried out on the basis of wrong information.        
	Mukuls father Brijendra Kumar Gupta, a retired government official in Uttar Pradesh, had appealed to Allahabad High Court, which ordered the CBI to file an FIR against the accused on June 15.         
	The CBI filed the FIR on June 23.        
	Some police sources said the encounter was a result of mistaken identity.         
	Earlier this year, the CBI had filed FIRs against six IPS officers in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case in Gujarat.         
	However, in Uttar Pradesh, only police officers of the rank of inspector and sub-inspector have so far been booked in encounter cases, human rights lawyers in Lucknow said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, May 29: CPM leader Sitaram Yechury today accused Mamata Banerjee of using yesterdays rail tragedy to influence public opinion on the eve of civic polls in Bengal while shielding the culprits by suggesting that Maoists might not be behind the crash.         
	The politburo member also urged the Maoists to emulate their counterparts in Nepal and enter the political mainstream.         
	Yechury expressed displeasure over the railway ministers insinuations that the CPM could be behind the train disaster. It is cynical. All this is being done to influence the public before tomorrows municipal polls in Bengal.         
	The CPM leader said the Trinamul Congress chief had failed to discharge her duties as minister and was attempting to cover the lapses by shielding those responsible for the incident. She has chosen to shield the actual culprits by suggesting that Maoists may not be behind the sabotage, he said.         
	The Union railway minister continues to maintain that there was a blast that led to the accident, while the Union home minister has denied that possibility. It is clear that the Union railway minister is seeking to cover up for the serious lapses in her leadership of the railway ministry.         
	He added: Let the Maoists here join the political mainstream.

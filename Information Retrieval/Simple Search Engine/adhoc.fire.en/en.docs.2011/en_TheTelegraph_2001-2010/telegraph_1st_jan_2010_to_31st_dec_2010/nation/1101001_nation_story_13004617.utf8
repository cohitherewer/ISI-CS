The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Only play at Games Village 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Only play at Games Village

	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Most of the 5,000-plus athletes and officials at the Commonwealth Games Village appeared indifferent to the Ayodhya verdict today.        
	It doesnt worry our athletes, said Steve Moneghetti, chef de mission of the Australian contingent.        
	Hours before the verdict was announced, top officials from the Australian high commission, including the deputy high commissioner, were seen at the Village but none of them touched on Ayodhya.        
	Asked whether any security advisory had been issued by the Australian government, Moneghetti, a former 10,000-metre Games champion, said: There was an update involving the court verdict but it had no bearing on the athletes security.        
	Delhi police increased security at the Village but the athletes, even those who knew about the ruling, remained unperturbed.        
	 Yes, I know it (the verdict) was to come today. But I did not enquire about it as it does not concern me much, said Mohammed Salaam, a Pakistani wrestler.        
	But another Pakistani grappler, Mohammed Inam, appeared more than interested, even suspecting an international hand in the long-running Ayodhya land dispute. Big people are involved in it maybe America you never know.         
	Salaam had bigger things on his mind, mainly how his Indian rival, world champion Sushil Kumar, was gearing up for the bout.        
	Teenaged Maldives table tennis players Mohammed Alam Zahir and Mohammed Nasim had no clue about the verdict. We have no interest in politics, said one of them.        
	An unusual take came from an Indian team official. As long as we are here, we have no link with the outside world.        
	Ironically, the information blackout had its roots in lapses by the Games organising committee, panned for shoddy preparations, delays and alleged corruption.        
	The organising committee has not yet managed to supply newspapers. There is a cyber caf but it is difficult to get a terminal free there. The TVs have not been working for the past three days, the official said.        
	In Chandigarh, the visiting Australian cricket team also kept to matters of the pitch. Weve seen it (the verdict) in the local media, but it doesnt really concern us, Lachy Patterson, the squads media manager, said.

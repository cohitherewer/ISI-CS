          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: An Andhra Pradesh police teamtoday raided the Delhi home of Hemchandra Pandey, the freelance journalist killed with Maoist top-rung leader Azad in July, and seized Maoist literature.         
	We have seized a lot of incriminating documents, including Maoist leaflets and literature, from his rented house. A laptop, scanner and printer were also seized, said Md Abdul Bari, the deputy superintendent of police, Karimnagar.         
	Bari said Pandey, who was based in Uttarakhand, had lived in the Shastrinagar flat in east Delhi for almost a year.         
	We got the address of the flat after examining his wife Babita a month ago at Swami Agniveshs office, said Bari.         
	Pandey, 30, was killed on July 2 along with Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad, who ranked No. 3 in the Maoist heirarchy.         
	His widow Babita alleged a fake encounter and demanded a probe by the Centre saying she did not trust the state authorities. Human rights groups and civil liberty activists also called for a central investigation.        
	We have also seized several books and magazines on Peoples War and Naxalbari along with documents of meetings by Maoists in the last 20 years, Bari said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Double surprise on Rao amp; Priyanka
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Double surprise on Rao amp; Priyanka
          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Congress plenary sprang two surprises today, one with an omission and the other with an addition.        
	Sonia Gandhi caused one by including the long-forgotten P.V. Narasimha Rao in her list of leaders who had shaped Indias growth  probably the first time she has mentioned him publicly during her 12-year stint as Congress president.        
	Ordinary party workers were, however, left shocked at what was another first in recent times  the absence of Priyanka Gandhi from the posters and banners that peppered the plenary route.        
	P.V. Narasimha Rao gave fresh impetus to the process of economic reforms, Sonia said in her speech.        
	The late Rao has virtually been an outcast in the Congress since the end of his Babri demolition-tainted term in 1996. Sonias move appeared to be a calculated course correction as the omission of Raos name used to become news during all major party events owing to her perceived coldness towards the first Congress Prime Minister from outside the Gandhi family.        
	During the 2007 Uttar Pradesh poll campaign, Rahul Gandhi had said that if anyone from his family were at the helm of the government, the Babri Masjid would not have been demolished.        
	Earlier this year, when Sonia laid the foundation stone for the partys new office and kicked off the Congresss 125-year celebrations, she had mentioned all important leaders and Congress Prime Ministers except Rao. She had then credited Rajiv Gandhi with sowing the seeds of economic reforms.        
	At this plenary, too, the backdrop to the dais excluded the photograph of only one Congress Prime Minister  Rao  but Sonia made up for it by mentioning him in her speech.        
	For many Congress delegates from the various states, though, it was a case of woh baat jiska sare fasane mein zikr na tha, woh baat unko bahut nagawaar guzri hai (the subject that did not figure at all in the script hurt them the most).        
	Although Priyanka was not present at the last plenary (in Hyderabad in January 2006) either, where Rahul was the main attraction, her smiling visage alongside the faces of her brother and mother had lit up the posters.        
	Priyanka, who has always been out of the Congress system, is now out of the posters too. But her popularity hasnt faded. Dejected party workers from Bihar even wondered if she was not the answer to what seemed to them as the Congresss irreversible decline.        
	At the plenary, Sonia today suggested an innovative idea: an institutionalised party think-tank that would help the Congress update its views on myriad subjects in consultation with experts from various fields.        
	She said this would take shape at the next brainstorming session the party would hold on the lines of the Panchmarhi and Shimla confabulations of 1998 and 2003.        
	Such new ideas, however, often fail to take off in the Congress. At Shimla, Sonia had announced a decision to set up a training institute for party members but it has remained a pipedream.        
	Sonia accepted that the Congress had to become more than an election machine  although the idea that the Congress is an election machine may raise a few laughs in the CPM and Trinamul Congress.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Oct. 26: BrandKat has aroused the wrath of a cat lover.        
	A Green activist and founder of an organisation to protect tigers has filed a case against celebrity couple Katy Perry and Russell Brand for flouting wildlife rules during their stay in a luxury resort near Rajasthans Ranthambhore National Park, famous for its big cats.        
	The American singer and the British comedian got married at the resort on Saturday in a traditional Hindu ceremony that included walking around the fire before leaving in a helicopter yesterday.        
	Ranthambhore Bagh Bachao Andolan founder Akshay Sharma today told The Telegraph he had complained to the chief judicial magistrates court in Sawai Madhopur that Perry, Brand and their guests violated Green laws, the Wildlife Protection Act and rules laid down by the Supreme Court. But nobody from the Rajasthan government or the forest department tried to stop them. So he had no option but to move court.        
	The court will hear the complaint on October 30.        
	Sharma said Brand and four of his friends went on a tiger safari a day after the wedding and smoked, drank and even carried arms.         
	They also changed their allotted route and visited areas frequented by tigers but where tourists are not allowed. The human presence, he said, scared the tigers and other animals.         
	The guests, Sharma alleged, also played loud music.         
	Earlier, journalists, too, had drawn attention to the noisy wedding celebrations just outside the tiger sanctuary that went past midnight.        
	Sharma said he had filed complaints against the celebrity visitors and forest and state officials as well for not taking any action.        
	The complaint came a day after Perry and Brand, intoxicated with everything Indian, got a taste of Indian mismanagement too.        
	Their helicopter was recalled mid-flight because the star couples Indian tour operators had not taken permission from authorities to fly.         
	They had to sit in the chopper for over half an hour before finally getting clearance for take-off.        
	Now the court complaint has taken a bit more sheen off their Indian tryst. Seems the tigers are having the last laugh  er, growl.

          ARCHIS MOHAN                                     
	New Delhi, March 10: The home ministry came close to issuing an advisory asking the 4,000 Indians working for private agencies in Afghanistan to exercise extra caution, but the move was nixed over fears it would send a wrong signal.         
	The plan was apparently prompted by indications from a team of Intelligence Bureau officials led by national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon that the group of 4,000  not covered by Indian governments security  faces the greatest risk. Menon had visited Kabul after the February 26 terror strike there in which seven Indians died. The terrorists had targeted guesthouses frequented by Indians.         
	Objections to the planned advisory appeared to have come from the external affairs ministry, whose spokesperson today denied reports of such an alert and plans to scale down Indias presence. Indias commitment to its development partnership with Afghanistan remains undiluted, he said.         
	Home ministry officials said, however, the planned advisory would not, in any case, have asked Indians to return.

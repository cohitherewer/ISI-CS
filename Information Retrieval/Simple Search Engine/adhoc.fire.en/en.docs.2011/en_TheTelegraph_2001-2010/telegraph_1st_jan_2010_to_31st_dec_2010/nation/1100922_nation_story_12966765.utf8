          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Pre-flight checks for alcohol will be mandatory for pilots and cabin crew of all flights, according to new rules framed by the aviation regulator after increasing cases of such staff reporting drunk for duty.        
	Pilots found drunk the first time will be suspended for three months. Those who repeat the offence will lose their licence permanently.        
	At present, such checks are random, covering about 50-60 per cent of the domestic flights, but they are mandatory for pilots on international routes.        
	A post-flight check on the crew, which should be done during duty hours after the passengers have disembarked, has also been proposed by the regulator, the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).         
	The new rules have been notified through revisions in the Civil Aviation Requirement, 2009.        
	If a crew member refuses to undergo the pre-flight test, he or she will be considered alcohol-positive. Any member attempting to evade the procedure by leaving (the) airport premises before undergoing the complete test will be considered to have tested positive, the new regulations say.        
	Last year, 42 cases of pilots reporting drunk were reported, most of them from Delhi and Mumbai airports.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taking RSS leaf, BJP backs actor
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Taking RSS leaf, BJP backs actor
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: The BJP was more forthright in its defence of Shah Rukh Khan today after yesterdays caution and condemned the Shiv Senas threats of violence against those who screened My Name is Khan.        
	Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: We do not support the violence. If the Sena does not have a problem with the film, why are they indulging in violence? The Sena spokesperson branded Shah Rukh Khan as an enemy of the nation. We think this is incorrect. As an actor he has enhanced the countrys prestige.        
	Yesterday, another BJP spokesperson, Prakash Javdekar, had said: The BJP does not accept politics in games. Games should be games, reacting to the stars comment that Pakistani players should have been chosen at the IPL auction.        
	Encouraged by the praise RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat got from liberal opinion-makers for unequivocally condemning the Senas attacks on north Indian settlers in Mumbai, the BJP decided not to blunt the advantage that came its way after years.         
	We also have to re-brand ourselves and discard some of the baggage we are carrying from (Narendra) Modi and Varun Gandhi. The mood of the nation is pro-Shah Rukh Khan and we cannot go against the tide as the major Opposition, an office-bearer said.        
	But old habits may prove hard to shed.        
	Immediately after Prasads statement of support for Shah Rukh, members of the BJP womens wing met President Pratibha Patil and almost asked her to ban Draupadi, a book in Telugu chosen for the Sahitya Akademi Award this year, because its derogatory representation of mythological characters would hurt Indian culture.        
	Led by Indore MP Sumitra Mahajan, the BJP women handed over their letter of protest, appended with excerpts from the book, to Patil.        
	The womens wing claimed Patil had agreed with the delegations stand that the derogatory representations of mythological and religious personages amounted to hurting Indian culture.

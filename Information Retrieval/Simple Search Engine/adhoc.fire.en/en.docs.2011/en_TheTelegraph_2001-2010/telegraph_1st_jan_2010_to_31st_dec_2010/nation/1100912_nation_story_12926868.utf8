          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The navy chief, Admiral Nirmal Verma, is scheduled to visit the US in another high-level military visit in the run-up to the expected trip by US President Barack Obama to India.         
	Shortly after Admiral Vermas return, defence minister A.K. Antony is slated to visit the US.         
	This week, the chief of the US Pacific Command (PACOM), Admiral Robert Willard, was in New Delhi, exchanging notes on the growth of the Chinese military and on Indias position on pending defence co-operation pacts like the Logistics Support Agreement and the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA).        
	Admiral Verma, who is slated to visit Washington DC and the US PACOM headquarters in Hawaii, will review the P-91 Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft that Boeing is making for the Indian Navy under a $4.7 million contract signed in January 2009.         
	The naval chiefs trip reciprocates the visits by US PACOM Commander Admiral Robert F. Willard this week and Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead in April.

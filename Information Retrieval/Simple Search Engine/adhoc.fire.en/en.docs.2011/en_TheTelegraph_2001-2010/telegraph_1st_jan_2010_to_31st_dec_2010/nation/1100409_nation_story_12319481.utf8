	Patna, April 8: When the hangmans rope beckons, jail seems to be the safest place to be in.        
	Ask Barmeshwar Mukhia, the mastermind behind the 1997 Dalit massacre, and he could tell you why.        
	Declared an absconder, the founder of the Ranbir Sena escaped trial and punishment, though 16 members of the erstwhile militia of upper-caste Bihar landlords were yesterday sentenced to death for butchering 58 Dalit Maoist supporters in Jehanabads Laxmanpur-Bathe village 13 years ago.        
	Mukhia, however, has been in jail for the past six years for involvement in several cases.        
	The court couldnt have done anything on his (Barmeshwars case) for the prosecution (CID in this case) did not investigate the case against him and did not give its report which could have been the basis for the court to put him on trial, a sessions court judge said.        
	Prosecution lawyer C.K. Sinha said Barmeshwars name figured in column III of the charge-sheet submitted in 1998. But column III included the names of 16 others who were absconding for they had not been arrested.         
	In 1999, the case was transferred to the Patna district and sessions court, which asked the prosecution to complete the investigation on the 16 absconding accused so that they could be put on trial. But CID sleuths didnt complete the probe against Barmeshwar and the other absconders, which helped them escape trial.        
	Barmeshwar, a landowner whose name figures in several Dalit massacres besides the one at Laxmanpur-Bathe, remained an absconder though he was arrested from Patna on August 29, 2003, and sent to Beur Central jail.        
	Judicial officers wouldnt comment but admitted they were perplexed why the mastermind escaped trial.        
	Witnesses and relatives of the victims were aghast. We dont understand why Barmeshwar has escaped unpunished. He should be hanged, said Uma Devi, who lost nine family members.        
	The police never recorded our statement on Barmeshwar, said Bouddh Paswan, another resident.        
	The voices of frustration coincided with allegations by a retired Patna High Court judge who today said the masterminds of the massacre were still unpunished and were also enjoying the fruits of power.        
	Amir Das, who headed a commission that probed the nexus between the Ranbir Sena and politicians, said: There are several patrons in power in Bihar who masterminded the massacre. Several politicians in power had deposed before the commission.        
	However, the commission Das headed had failed to submit a report even after 17 extensions.        
	Set up in 1998 by the then RJD government, the panel was scrapped by the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United)-BJP regime in 2006. Apparently, the commission was scrapped because of its inefficiency. But the panel interrogated several top politicians from the BJP-JD(U) and the RJD.        
	The escape of Barmeshwar is a classic case of criminal-police-politician nexus in the massacre of Dalits, said CPI(ML)-Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya.

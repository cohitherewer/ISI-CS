          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: BJP leader Vinay Katiyar has asked his party to take a relook at its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena.        
	Katiyar, an MP and a party general secretary, said today that while he understood and appreciated the primacy that should be given to a regional language, those who didnt speak the language should not be assaulted and killed. His allusion was to the attacks on north Indians by alleged Sena activists.         
	The BJP endorsed Katiyars stand. Spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said: Katiyar is a senior leader and his views should be heard and respected.         
	Maharashtra BJP sources agreed with party president Nitin Gadkaris statement yesterday that people had the right to work in any part of the country. But the stand apparently arose from local considerations: it seems Gadkari never hit it off with Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. There was a feeling the BJP had to give in (to the Sena) always, a Gadkari aide said.

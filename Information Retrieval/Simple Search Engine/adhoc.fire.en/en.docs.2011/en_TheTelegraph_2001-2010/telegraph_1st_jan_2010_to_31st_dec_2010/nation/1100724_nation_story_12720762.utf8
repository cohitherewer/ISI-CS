          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 23: Bangaru Laxman, the disgraced former president of the BJP, is back in Nitin Gadkaris team as prabhari (in-charge) of the Tamil Nadu elections due next year.         
	Laxman, a Dalit from Andhra Pradesh, was showcased as the BJPs answer to Mayavati and Ram Vilas Paswan when he was made the party chief in 1999.         
	But in a year, he was forced to quit when he was caught on camera taking Rs 1 lakh in an undercover sting operation on corruption in defence deals by Tehelka.         
	Although the position he was given today when the BJP president announced the state prabharis and the heads of the front organisations was hardly commensurate with the post he once held, sources said it was the first step towards Laxmans rehabilitation.         
	Others to get some kind of a leg-up were Yashwant Sinha and Shanta Kumar who were asked to mind Punjab and Karnataka, respectively. Both belong to that generation of the BJP that was sandwiched between the two patriarchs, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L. K. Advani, and the arrivestes who are referred to as the Dilli-4.        
	This generation has lost its moorings in the present dispensation.

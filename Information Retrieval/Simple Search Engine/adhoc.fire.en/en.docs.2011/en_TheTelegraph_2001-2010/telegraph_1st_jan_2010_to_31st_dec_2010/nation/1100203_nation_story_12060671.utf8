The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Surgery plucks out Amar, Jaya Prada
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Surgery plucks out Amar, Jaya Prada
  - Expelled duo can remain as unattached MPs but Samajwadi exploring legal options        OUR BUREAU                          Amar Singh                                        
	Lucknow/New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Samajwadi Party today carried out what it called a painful political surgery when a revamped parliamentary board expelled Amar Singh and Jaya Prada, ending their primary membership of the heartland outfit.        
	The two will, however, retain their seats in Parliament  Amar in the Rajya Sabha and Jaya Prada in the Lok Sabha  for the rest of their terms as unattached members.        
	It essentially means they are free to slam the party that got them elected without the risk of being disqualified.        
	Samajwadi sources, however, said the party was consulting legal experts to see if Amars membership could be terminated before the budget session.        
	We are consulting legal experts and plan to approach the presiding officers of both Houses and the Election Commission to end their membership (in the House), spokesperson Mohan Singh told reporters in Lucknow.        
	Amar, who like Jaya Prada has nearly five years left in Parliament, said he wouldnt utter a word about Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his former party.        
	I express my gratitude to Mulayam for expelling me. I will not say anything against him. I have great respect for him whether I am with the party or not, the 54-year-old told journalists in the capital shortly after his expulsion.        
	The expulsions came less than a month after Amar resigned from crucial party posts. Spokesperson Singh said the two were sacked to free the party from intruders who wanted to dent its socialist image.        
	Before the disease spreads further, the party decided to undertake a corrective surgery, Singh told reporters after the parliamentary board, chaired by Mulayam, met in Lucknow.        
	Amar ruled out joining another party, saying he was on sick leave after a recent surgery and said he would promote the Lok Manch, a non-political outfit he had floated.        
	The Manch will set up computer and English tutorial centres all over Uttar Pradesh, starting with one in his village, Pakdi. His older brother, film star Amitabh Bachchan, will inaugurate the first centre on February 26.        
	A Samajwadi source said the intention was loaded because Mulayams party has been ideologically opposed to the use of computers and English.        
	Observers said Bachchans acceptance letter yesterday following an offer from chief minister Narendra Modi to become Gujarats brand ambassador was a sure sign of Amars exit.        
	But if Bachchan has found political asylum, Amar and his other friends are out on a limb.        
	The Congress and the BJP claimed they had no space for him  the Congress publicly and the BJP privately.        
	We have to factor in many things before considering Amar. We have too many problems of our own and cant add any more, a BJP official said.        
	It is reliably learnt that a big industrial house with largely unfulfilled stakes in Uttar Pradesh was working overtime for a meeting between Amar and chief minister Mayavati. But the BSP boss has not yet responded.        
	Bachchans wife Jaya has been spared the rod. Her Rajya Sabha term lasts until July and it is believed she will be allowed to complete her tenure. She has not indulged in anti-party activities so we have nothing against her, Mohan said.                                                  
	But Amar maintained if Jaya had to choose between him and the Samajwadi, she would go with the family.

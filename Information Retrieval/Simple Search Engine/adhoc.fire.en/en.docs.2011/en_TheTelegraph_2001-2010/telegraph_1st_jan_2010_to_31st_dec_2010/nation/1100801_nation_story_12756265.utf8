The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi invokes Gujarati pride
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi invokes Gujarati pride
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, July 31: When in trouble, invoke Gujarati pride  this seems to be Narendra Modis mantra.         
	The chief minister, who could be questioned by the CBI in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, today said his blood boils when somebody maligns Gujarat.        
	Speaking at the meeting after media reports said the CBI had sought the transfer of the case outside the state for a free and fair trial, Modi thundered that this was an attempt to give a bad name to Gujarat.        
	First they targeted me, then the police and now the courts. My blood boils, he said a day after the CBI submitted its status report to the Supreme Court. The CBI says they want to transfer the cases. Is this not an insult to Gujarat, to the lawyers of Gujarat? How long will we tolerate this? Is Gujarat a part of India or not? Why are we being treated like an enemy state, are the judges of Gujarat useless?         
	This is not the first time Modi has invoked Gujarati pride to wriggle out of a tight spot. He has used it to win elections in the past when his role in the Gujarat riots and in Sohrabuddins death was questioned.        
	There has been a buzz about the noose tightening around the chief minister after his confidant Amit Shah, also the former junior home minister, was charged with ordering Sohrabuddins murder and arrested last week.         
	The CBI has proof that top police officers acted on Shahs instructions to eliminate Sohrabuddin, sources said. The CBI believes Sohrabuddin was killed because he was extorting money from marble traders.        
	An internal CBI report also refers to the chief minister and suggests it might want to question him. Modi holds the home portfolio and the transfer of IPS officers now under scrutiny was ordered by him.         
	There is an attempt to pollute the environment of Gujarat... to insult the judicial system of Gujarat, its judges, its lawyers, he said today. They are trying to malign my name for the last eight years. But now they have started maligning the judicial system of the state. I will not tolerate this.        
	Am I doing anything wrong by fighting terrorism? Have I done anything wrong by arresting the accused of the Ahmedabad blasts? A loyalist of the chief minister and former BJP MLA, Yatin Oza, added: If Modi is summoned by the CBI, the Congress party will be wiped out in the state.        
	Not everyone in the BJP agrees though.        
	Many BJP workers are happy Shah is in trouble. Some supporters of a senior BJP leader distributed sweets the day he was sent to judicial custody, a sign of his alienation from the grassroots.         
	After becoming minister, Shah refused to recognise me, complained Shailesh Rathod, a BJP functionary in the Sabarmati area who had worked with the disgraced minister before he got elected.

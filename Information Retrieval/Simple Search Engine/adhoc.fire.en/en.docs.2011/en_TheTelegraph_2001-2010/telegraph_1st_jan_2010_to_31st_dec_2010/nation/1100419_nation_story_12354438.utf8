The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu gift snatched from dwarf 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu gift snatched from dwarf 
          NALIN VERMA                          Rinku Basak                                  
	Patna, April 18: A dwarf girl whom Lalu Prasad had spotted at a rally and given a railway job two years ago has been sacked because the railway board has found her appointment was illegal.        
	Bengali girl Rinku Basak, 28 years old and three feet tall, had in May 2008 been a recipient of the famed generosity of the then railway minister, who often bypassed rules while handing out largesse to those he thought deserving or those who caught his fancy.        
	Her sack letter came last month following a routine review of appointments  perhaps done with a fine-tooth comb this time because of current minister Mamata Banerjees talk of issuing a white paper on the ministrys functioning under her predecessor.        
	Rinkus parents Pulak and Kalyani, both day labourers, praised Lalu Prasad as Bhagwan ka avatar (incarnation of God) but refused to blame Mamata.        
	Our daughter is simply unlucky. We never expected her to get a job. Only someone godly like Lalu would have given her the job. We cannot blame Mamata Banerjee, for she may not be aware of our daughters plight, Pulak said at his home in Barsoi town, Katihar district, near the Bihar-Bengal border.        
	Rinku has written to Mamata and the railway board and is waiting for a reply.        
	Some senior railway officials are believed to be trying to get her reinstated as a clerk at Barsoi railway station because she is handicapped, poor and had served the railways for two years without a break.        
	A local railway source recalled: When Lalu Prasad ordered his officials to give Rinku a job under the disabled quota, they tried to explain to him that jobs that had not been advertised could not be given.        
	But he began shouting. Appoint her under the MR quota (minister of railways quota), he told them.        
	No such quota exists but the ministers orders could not be ignored.        
	The Basaks remember vividly how Lalu Prasad had spotted Rinku among a crowd at a rally in Barsoi and asked his guards to bring her to the dais. He asked how far she had studied and what her father did for a living, and was impressed by her fluent answers.        
	Within days she had been appointed a clerk with Northeast Frontier Railway in the payscale of Rs 3,200-4,900.        
	The commercial officer at the Katihar railway divisional office, S.B. Jagbandhu, declined comment on the subject, saying only that Rinku had been sacked on the railway boards orders.        
	The review would have cost many others their jobs too but Rinkus case has received publicity because of her disability and poverty.        
	Pulak and Kalyani have two sons and two daughters. The other daughter, who is of normal build, is married.        
	Its hard to find a match for Rinku because she is so short. Laluji had given her a life and a livelihood. Now she is crestfallen. She wants to meet Lalu Prasad again, Kalyani said.

	New Delhi, May 12: The eclectic Sarosh Homi Kapadia, who took over as Chief Justice of India today, began his innings by issuing a warning against frivolous petitions that make judges work like tehsildars.        
	The 38th Chief Justice, who was sworn in by the President, said heavy costs would be imposed on those filing such petitions. The warning comes at a time concern has been mounting over the pile-up in courts  over 80,000 at the last count.         
	Dismissing a handful of PILs soon as taking over as the top judge of the country, he said: We are warning you that heavy costs will be imposed if such petitions are filed in the future. We have to read these files. You make us work like tehsildars.        
	Some petitions did get his attention, though. One related to displacement of people by an irrigation project in Nagpur, on which he issued notices to authorities.        
	Another plea found worthy of the courts time dealt with workers of an ailing company. Every worker has to get back his job in this case, Kapadia said.         
	The case involved a dispute between the employees union of Kamani Tubes and the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. The bench headed by Kapadia told the firms board of directors to ensure that every worker kept his job.        
	The management claimed that it was willing to take back all workers but they were unwilling. The case will be taken up again after the summer vacation.        
	Such petitions involving business matters arent new for Kapadia, an expert in tax and accountancy cases.        
	He has dealt with several rent, negotiable instruments, land revenue, industrial disputes, land acquisition, coastal regulation zone, mergers and acquisitions and pension cases. He was a judge of the special court dealing with the securities scam of 1992.        
	The Supreme Court website says Kapadia is keenly interested in economics, public finance, theoretical physics, and Hindu and Buddhist philosophies.        
	Kapadia will retire on September 29, 2012.

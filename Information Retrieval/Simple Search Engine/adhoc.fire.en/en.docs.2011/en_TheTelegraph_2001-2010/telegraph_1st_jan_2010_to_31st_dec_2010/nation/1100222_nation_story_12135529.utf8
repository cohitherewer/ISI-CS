The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hint of regret on CPM purge haste

          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: A section of CPM leaders in Bengal has raised doubts whether the party had inconclusive proof to strip W.R. Varadarajan, whose body was found in a lake near Chennai, of the membership of the central committee.        
	Some leaders also offered a glimpse into the partys regimented disciplinary and punishment mechanism, which decides the fate of individuals, as well as the clash of social and cultural values.        
	Veteran Benoy Konar was not sure if the complaints of an extramarital affair against WR were beyond doubt or not.         
	The Tamil Nadu unit had unanimously asked for the disciplinary action against him. The CC (central committee) only approved it. But the party inquiry commission that probed his case had no conclusive evidence of an extramarital affair against him, Konar said.         
	He mentioned that Varadarajans wife and former party member Saraswathy had undergone psychiatric treatment earlier and was known to have developed the tendency to suspect her spouse.         
	In other cases, the party may have been lenient since conclusive proof was found wanting. But the party didnt want to be indulgent in the case of leading comrades like him. Now his wife is also sharing the sense of our loss, Konar said.        
	The couple had a long history of marital discord. However, according to central committee sources, a common lady friend of both Varadarajan and his wife claimed to have accessed obscene SMS and e-mails he had allegedly sent to another woman. The party leadership primarily acted upon the complaints of this vigilante woman who persuaded his wife to file a complaint against her husband.         
	At the Calcutta session of the CPM central committee earlier this month, Vardarajan was given the chance to defend himself and he denied the charges. We didnt debate the issue since the state unit wanted the punishment unanimously and the CC approved accordingly, Konar recalled.         
	His mood was not defiant, rather despondent. He defended himself calmly, Konar added.        
	Asked if the Varadarajan case underscored the interference of the party, which had once made it mandatory to seek the leaderships nod before tying the nuptial knot, inpersonal relations, the clash of values was unmistakable.         
	If the charge of an extramarital affair was right, then it was no minor sin, octogenarian Konar said.         
	But a younger member said: I didnt like the CC discussing such issues. It may not gel well with changing values that the party decides our personal relationships.        
	Another younger member said: It was difficult for us to object to the punishment since the party already faced charges of being male-dominated. We would have been accused of being indulgent to a fellow male leader if we had given a different opinion. The feminist voice in the party is still marginalised but quite vociferous.        
	Some others were apprehensive about the fallout on future disciplinary measures. Now some of them can start blackmailing the leadership that they would follow Varadarajan if they are punished, a CC member said.        
	Varadarajans body was found in Porur lake, which supplies fresh water to Chennai, 10 days after he disappeared. On Sunday afternoon, his wife Saraswathy came to the mortuary in Central Chennai and confirmed that the body, recovered on February 13, was her husbands.        
	Since the body had started to decompose, she made the identification on the basis of clothes, inspector Prem Anand said.        
	However, the police are planning to match his fingerprints with the American Consulate here  he had travelled to the US last year  with that lifted from the body and also carry out a DNA test.

	New Delhi, Nov. 17: Mamata Banerjee tonight visited the site of the building collapse that killed 69 people  30 of them from Bengal  and announced that the railways would make arrangements to transport the bodies.        
	A special coach would take the bodies home to Murshidabad in Bengal and Katihar in Bihar, the railway minister said. Most of the victims are either from Bengal or from Bihar, she said.        
	The dead were migrant labourers who lived three to six in a room in the four-storey building that collapsed on Monday. Lalita Park, the site of the building in east Delhi, is home to countless workers from Bengal forced to migrate in search of a living because they would starve at home.         
	Mamata noted that 15 of the dead from Bengal had already been cremated in Delhi, and said the railways were ready to help if anyone wanted bodies to be taken to their native place.        
	She drove straight to the collapse site from the airport and later went to a nearby community hall where the survivors have been housed.         
	Accompanied by Dinesh Trivedi and Sisir Adhikari, ministers of state from the Trinamul Congress, Mamata met the families of the dead and promised all help. Delhi finance minister A.K. Walia was also present.        
	Walia said the toll so far was 67 and that nine bodies were yet to be identified. Mamata asked him to paste colour pictures of the bodies in the community hall to help in identification.         
	 She said she had spoken to Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. I urged her to ensure that the victims get all kinds of help, including compensation, the railway minister said.         
	A judicial probe was ordered today into the collapse as authorities declared 38 buildings in the area dangerous and asked the residents to vacate.         
	Officials said Dikshit had decided to order the judicial inquiry in view of the scale of the mishap, large number of casualties and number of complex issues connected with the incident.         
	The inquiry, to be conducted by former Delhi High Court judge Justice Lokeshwar Prashad, will look into all aspects, including whether there was any procedural, administrative and statutory lapses that led to the tragedy.        
	Prashad has been asked to submit his report within three months. A magisterial probe is already on and its report is to come within 10 days.        
	The order asking the residents of 38 more buildings in Lalita Park to vacate their quarters was issued by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Surveys found their basements filled with water from the floods following this years heavy monsoon. We have issued notices to vacate these houses immediately for the residents safety, MCD spokesperson Deep Mathur said.        
	A city court today remanded Amritpal Singh, the owner of the collapsed building who was arrested yesterday, in two days police custody.

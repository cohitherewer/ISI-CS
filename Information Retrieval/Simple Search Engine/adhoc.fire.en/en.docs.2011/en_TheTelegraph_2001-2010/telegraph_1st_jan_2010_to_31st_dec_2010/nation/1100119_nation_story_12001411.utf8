          SANJAY K. JHA                          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pays homage to Jyoti Basu at the CPM headquarters in Delhi on Monday. The country has lost a great son who was a great statesman and great patriot. I convey my deepest condolences to the members of the bereaved family and countless admirers, comrades and followers of Shri Basu, Singh wrote in the condolence book. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Mamata Banerjees demand for three days of national mourning for Jyoti Basu has placed the Centre in a dilemma.        
	Neither the Congress nor the government was willing to respond today, arguing that such issues were handled by the Union cabinet alone.        
	I am requesting the Centre to observe three days of national mourning, Mamata Banerjee had said after Basus death yesterday.        
	The request has faced Delhi with a tricky problem. On the one hand, the tradition is to declare national mourning only for a President or Prime Minister, past or present. On the other hand, the Centre has often deviated from the norm in the past.        
	In 1987, the Congress government of the day had announced a seven-day national mourning period after the death of former Tamil Nadu chief minister M.G. Ramachandran (MGR).        
	One of the most notable departures from the norm came after Sheikh Abdullahs death in 1982, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi not only declared national mourning but also attended the funeral.        
	The then President, Giani Zail Singh, too broke with protocol to be at the funeral, citing the extraordinary circumstances in Kashmir and Sheikh Abdullahs role in the states merger with India. No serving President has done this since then.        
	In 1979, the Charan Singh government had declared national mourning for Jayaprakash Narayan (JP), who never held any government post. The decision to honour JP was, however, not surprising: the non-Congress parties gave him most of the credit for Indiras defeat in the 1977 elections.        
	The Congress decision to honour MGR in 1987 too was political  the party was then struggling to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu.        
	The short-lived Charan Singh government, however, outdid all others by declaring seven days of national mourning for Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India. The move attracted controversy, especially since Mountbattens death wouldnt have triggered any such extravagant mourning even in his own country, Britain.                
	B.R. Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia or N.T. Rama Rao, however, were not bestowed the honour.        
	Previous Congress governments had sprung surprises of a different sort by declaring national mourning for actor and party MP Sunil Dutt and shehnai maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan.        
	Some have since argued that JP, MGR and Bismillah were recipients of the countrys highest civilian award but this does not explain the national mourning, for the Bharat Ratnas were awarded posthumously.        
	The inconsistency in declaring national mourning has triggered many controversies. The Bahujan Samaj Party was unhappy when Kanshi Ram was ignored, and many were surprised when the honour was withheld from General Sam Manekshaw, who led India to victory in the 1971 war.        
	As for Basu, he has not only been the countrys longest-serving chief minister, he was a respected national leader who sacrificed his chance to become Prime Minister at the altar of party loyalty. If he is denied a period of national mourning, many may wonder why his stature was deemed lower than that of, say, MGR.

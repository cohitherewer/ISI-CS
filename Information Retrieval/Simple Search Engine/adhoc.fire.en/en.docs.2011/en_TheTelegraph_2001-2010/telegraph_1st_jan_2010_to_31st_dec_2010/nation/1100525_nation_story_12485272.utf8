The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aila-scarred Sunderbans waits for embankments
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Aila-scarred Sunderbans waits for embankments
  - Saline water rushes into fishery ponds and submerges all roads everyday as villagers watch helplessly                            A woman walks on the temporary embankment built by villagers of Madhabkati in the Sunderbans. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	Time: 1pm        
	Place: Madhabkati in Jogeshganj gram panchayat, Hingalganj block        
	Scene: Saline water from the Raimangal river creeps up the bank during high tide, brims over and seeps into the bheris (fisheries) even as the hapless villagers look on. Soon, water gushes in freely.         
	The sudden entry of saline water has washed away efforts of Paran Gyne, as the lobsters and the parshey and bhetki fish he has been rearing for three months would now escape into the sea.        
	The embankments along the Raimangal river had given way three months ago and I lost all the fish. The same problem is back, said the man in his early fifties.         
	For Gyne, a Sunderbans fisherman, the vagaries of nature are not new, but as the calendar draws close to May 25, his fear quotient moves northward. The memories of Aila, which struck the Sunderbans exactly a year ago and killed more than 150 people besides razing 40,000 houses, are still fresh in his mind.         
	A year has passed since the tragedy struck Madhabkati, around 85km from Calcutta, but life has not changed for the over 150 families who live there.         
	Under the force of the water, the pucca jetty here crumbled, as did the embankment when Aila struck. The storm had flattened our homes, water from the river flooded our bheris and stayed there for months, said Rabindranath Raptan, 40, looking at his feet and scratching the embankment on which he stood with his toenails. Our lives will not change unless proper embankments are erected along the rivers, he added.         
	Such voices can be heard in almost all the 54 inhabited islands of the Sunderbans, where 778km of the 3,500km-long embankments had crumbled under Ailas fury.         
	The maintenance and upkeep of the mud embankments, built during the British rule around 150 years ago, is the responsibility of the Bengal governments irrigation department. But after the devastation, it emerged that the department never carried out any survey to assess their strength.        
	The state government hardly made any attempt to strengthen the embankments and left the villagers at the mercy of nature, said Sunderbans expert Tushar Kanjilal, who has been working in the area for 24 years.        
	Following the outcry over the inaction, the state government sent a proposal to the Centre for a comprehensive embankment repair and reconstruction plan. Although Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced in his budget speech last year that the Centre had sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore for building and bolstering the embankments, state irrigation minister Subhash Naskar has a different story to tell.         
	Of the Rs 1,000 crore sanctioned for development work in the Sunderbans by the Union government, only Rs 187.5 crore reached us, and that too, on March 30, 2010, a day before the (previous) financial year ended, Naskar claimed.         
	The quibble over funds and their utilisation are beyond the grasp of the poor villagers as they fight a daily battle with nature. When the Met office sounded a Laila alert in the coastal areas last week, people like Gyne and Raptan hit the panic button.         
	Last week, the embankment along the river gave way, leading to flooding of paddy fields and bheris during high tide. Although we can deal with high tides, another big storm, accompanied by heavy rain, will spell doom for us, said Gyne.        
	When The Telegraph visited Madhabkati last week, every bit of land, except an elevated road running through the centre of the village, was flooded. The Madhabkati Primary School, which had housed families for a month after Aila struck, closed again  this time because it was flooded and inaccessible.        
	Most of the teachers have left for Basirhat And who wants to study when life is at risk, said Paritosh Mondal, who is still feeling the impact of Aila as he has not been able to sow paddy seeds this season.        
	The salinity of the Sunderbans waters has rendered his two-bigha plot infertile and it would be at least two monsoons before Mondal can hope to get anywhere near his pre-Aila harvest.        
	In several parts of the Sunderbans, large tracts  covered with a white salty layer  can be spotted where even grass hasnt grown in the past 12 months since Aila hit. As river water during high tides gushes into the villages through the breaches in embankments, people in the villages are living on the edge.         
	A case in point is the plight of 36 families at Radhanagar in Sandeshkhali Block I. Bereft of homes since Aila, these people were living on the embankment along Dansa river, which was repaired in June 2009 but collapsed earlier this month, forcing the homeless men and women to scout for a new place.        
	We are living in ramshackle huts put together with tarpaulins provided by the government just after Aila and with mud and bamboo, said Sunil Bhuniya, who has lost his toes to gangrene.        
	Sitting on the banks of the Dansa river, Swapna Bhuniya, 22, a mother of two, rued that the family did not own any plot inland and so living along the river  ringed by weak and crumbling embankments  was the only option.         
	Minister Naskar suggests he has done his best. We have taken the embankments issue seriously and tried our best to carry out repair work, he claimed.         
	But the repairs  done in a hurry and without proper expertise  has done little to save the farmers and fishermen, as the embankments have given way in several places. Not just the man-made errors in fixing the embankments, natures whims have added to the woes of Sunderbans residents.         
	In some places, the river has eaten into the soil below an embankment, causing it to crumble and expanding the river. Unless new embankments are built, the villagers cannot be saved. But the exercise requires regular monitoring of the rivers course and periodic assessment of the strength of the embankments. No such effort has been taken up in the past 50 years, said Sunderbans expert Kanjilal.         
	According to other experts, only a sustained attempt to secure the 3,500km-long embankments can save the 50-lakh odd residents of Sunderbans, spread over North and South 24-Parganas.         
	Naskar told The Telegraph that a blueprint for using a special brick-laying technology to strengthen the embankment was already in place, but could not give a project completion deadline.         
	With the government clueless about time, people like Sunil Bhuniya dont see much hope in the promises. We will have to fight the battle on our own, said the frail man, twirling the gamcha wrapped around his neck.

  - imd to install 187 devices in orissa for hourly monitoring          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          An automatic rain gauge                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 7: As part of its modernisation programme aimed at enhancing weather monitoring facilities, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is installing a network of 187 automatic rain gauge stations across the state.        
	When installed, the network would help in accurate collection of rainfall data from various parts of the state. It would update information on an hourly basis.        
	The satellite-based stations would be monitored by the Earth Station at Pune and data regarding rain would be made available hourly. Some rain gauges installed will also have sensors to measure temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure and humidity.        
	At present, the IMD depends on the existing district emergency offices having manually operated systems for the purpose.         
	Setting up more manual observatories will need more staff and thus more expenses. The automatic stations will make the system of data collection all the more convenient and faster, said India Meteorological Department director S.C. Sahu.        
	At least 187 automatic rain gauge stations are being installed at the block headquarters of all districts in the state.        
	Installation of 120 stations is already over. The work is on and we expect it will be over by March, he said.        
	The systems would, however, not have the features of forecasting sky condition and visibility as is being done now through manual weather observatories.        
	Automatic rain gauges are self-contained battery-operated data collection system for measuring rainfall.

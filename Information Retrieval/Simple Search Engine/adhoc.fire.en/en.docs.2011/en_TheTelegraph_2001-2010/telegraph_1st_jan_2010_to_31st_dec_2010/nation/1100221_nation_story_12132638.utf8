The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fee control plan for deemed varsities

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: Deemed universities may soon lose the power to fix fees and may be subject to an independent external review every five years under a central panels recommendations that the government has accepted.        
	The human resource development ministry committee has also recommended that a panel of national and international experts scrutinise every proposal to grant deemed status to a brand new or de novo institution.        
	The recommendations are part of the confidential report, accessed by The Telegraph, which found 88 of Indias 130 deemed universities unfit for the tag that allows them to award degrees.         
	In an affidavit before the Supreme Court in January, the ministry has disclosed a list of 44 deemed universities from which it plans to withdraw the tag immediately. But the report also lists 44 other deemed universities found unfit for the tag, and contains recommendations aimed at preventing the abuse of the status by substandard institutions. The apex court has asked the ministry to submit a sealed-cover copy of the report by early March.         
	A national-level committee alone should fix a rational fee structure for deemed universities, instead of independent institutions setting their own  often exorbitant  fees, the panel has recommended. The panel, appointed by HRD minister Kapil Sibal within days of taking charge, has suggested stiffer norms for granting deemed status to de novo institutions.         
	While deemed status is normally awarded only to institutions functioning as colleges for at least 10 years, it can be granted under the de novo category to institutions offering courses in emerging fields. This provision has, however, been widely abused, the review panel has found. It has recommended that any proposal for de novo category should be scrutinised by a high-level committee consisting of national and international experts.        
	Sibals review  conducted by four eminent academicians  is the first-ever external probe into the functioning of the deemed universities. The panel has recommended a mandatory external review of every deemed university once in every five years.         
	It has also proposed greater participation of independent academicians in running deemed universities, many of which the panel found were being run like family affairs. The chancellor (the highest administrative head of an academic institution) nominating his/her close relatives to the board or appointing them as vice-chancellor... must be discontinued, it has said.        
	At least 50 per cent of the members on the governing body of a deemed university must be eminent academicians and experienced professionals capable of providing independent ideas, advice and guidance, the report has recommended. At present, the chancellor can appoint the first vice-chancellor of a new deemed university, under the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines.         
	But the panel has recommended that the provision be scrapped. Even the first vice-chancellor, it has said, must be appointed through a transparent search-and-selection process.

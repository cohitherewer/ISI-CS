The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Green nod to study ghost-like particles

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Union environment ministry today approved a proposal from Indian scientists to build an underground laboratory to study ghost-like subatomic particles called neutrinos in a forest 110km west of Madurai, 11 months after rejecting the project at another site.         
	The ministry said the approval for the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) in the Bodi West Hills forest in Tamil Nadu is on condition that there would be no cutting of trees and no damage to forest cover and that steps will be taken to minimise the effect of tunnelling.        
	In November last year, the environment ministry had spiked the original plan to build the INO at a site named Singara beneath the Nilgiri Hills as it was close to a tiger habitat and elephant corridors.        
	The five-year project, estimated to cost Rs 1,000 crore, will involve drilling a 2.1-km tunnel into a hillside to create an underground laboratory that will house the worlds largest magnet to study the effects of neutrinos.        
	Were relieved  weve now got a site, Naba Mondal, a senior physicist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, said today, after he and three other physicists involved in the INO project met Union environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh.        
	This is a large science project that will allow India to engage in cutting-edge research and technologies through our very own laboratory, and it will provide a platform to stimulate our young researchers, Mondal told The Telegraph.        
	The INO is designed to study neutrinos -- tiny subatomic particles from space that interact with almost nothing and thus pass right through the Earth. While neutrino laboratories are active elsewhere in the world, the INO is expected to complement their studies.        
	Neutrinos excite physicists because they have thrown us hints of a new physics beyond the Standard Model [a theoretical construct to explain the zoo of fundamental subatomic particles], said D. Indumathi, a physicist at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.        
	Groups of physicists from nearly 25 academic institutions across India, including the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Calcutta, are involved in the INO project.        
	The INO project now awaits cabinet approval. Project scientists believe that more than 200 senior scientists as well as research scholars and students will participate in the project which is expected to be completed by 2015.

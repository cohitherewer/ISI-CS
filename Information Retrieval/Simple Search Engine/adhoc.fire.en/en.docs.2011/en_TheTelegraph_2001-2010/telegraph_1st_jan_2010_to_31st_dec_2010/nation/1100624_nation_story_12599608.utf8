          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Raipur, June 23: A Kingfisher plane from Calcutta, with more than 75 people on board, had a close shave at Mana airport here tonight following a tyre burst.         
	Flight IT 2804 was bound for Hyderabad from Aizawl via Calcutta and Raipur. One of its tyres burst during touchdown at Raipur around 7.40pm.         
	Pilots, however, managed to avert an accident by applying brakes in time.         
	The plane stopped midway on the runway. It sounded like someone was dragging a tin can on a rough surface, Bhaskar Bhowmick, a passenger from Calcutta, said. He added that most of the 75 passengers on board were from Calcutta.        
	Passengers were ferried from the aircraft to the terminal building half an hour later. The flight to Hyderabad was cancelled.        
	Kingfisher officials refused to comment.

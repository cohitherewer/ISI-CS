	 Dharmabad/Hyderabad, July 17: Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and 74 party legislators, who were arrested by Maharashtra police at Dharmabad, refused to take bail today and remained firm on their demand that they be allowed to visit the controversial Babhli irrigation project.          
	After failing to obtain the arrested leaders signatures on blank bond papers, the police finally brought the local district magistrate to the Industrial Training Institute campus, where the arrested legislators were lodged, to hear the case.          
	The magistrate asked the TDP leaders to return to Andhra immediately and offered to grant bail. Chandrababu and others, however, stoutly refused to do so and asserted that they would return only after inspecting the controversial project, which they alleged was illegally built by the Maharashtra government                  
	Durgapur: An armed gang robbed three houses in Durgapur early on Saturday. They took away cash and ornaments worth around Rs 2 lakh. The houses were empty because the residents had gone to attend family events.

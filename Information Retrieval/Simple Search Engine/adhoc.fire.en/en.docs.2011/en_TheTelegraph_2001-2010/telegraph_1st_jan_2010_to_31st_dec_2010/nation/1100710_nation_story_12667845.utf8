The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One man, one post back on Cong table
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      One man, one post back on Cong table
          RASHEED KIDWAI                        One man, multiple posts: (From left) A.K. Antony, Veerappa Moily, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Prithviraj Chavan and Mukul Wasnik       
	New Delhi, July 9: A renewed effort to enforce the one-man-one-post norm is under way in the Congress with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh likely to take a fresh look at the council of ministers before Parliaments monsoon session begins on July 26.        
	Union ministers Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan, M. Veerappa Moily, A.K. Antony and V. Narayanasamy will be affected if Congress chief Sonia Gandhi reverts to the principle of one person occupying one post either in the party or in the Union government.        
	The one-man-one-post norm was incorporated in the Congress constitution at the AICCs Surajkund session in 1994. The ball was set rolling by P.V. Narasimha Raos opponents who wanted to prevent him from simultaneously holding the posts of Prime Minister and Congress chief. But Rao scuttled the move by bringing an amendment saying the norm would not be applicable to the Congress president.        
	In 2008, a Congress panel headed by Antony had recommended that Union ministers should not be asked to undertake party work. Sonia Gandhi had accepted the recommendations, but months later she asked Antony to look after party affairs in Karnataka in addition to serving as defence minister. Along with Ahmad Patel and Pranab Mukherjee, Antony is Sonias key trouble-shooter for party affairs in many states.        
	AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh, who was part of the Antony panel, said Sonia was determined to implement the one-man-one-post norm. But he added that political exigencies sometimes required a degree of flexibility and party norms and conventions were not rigid.        
	In principle, there is an agreement that the one-man, one-post norm is applicable to all except for the Congress president, he said.        
	Congress insiders said Sonias dependence on crisis managers Mukherjee and Antony, and to a lesser extent, Moily, Chavan and Wasnik, was so deep that she was unable to remove them from party work. A senior AICC official said: Each Congress president has a distinct style of functioning. Over the passage of time, the party chief picks a team that performs key responsibilities.        
	If M.L. Fotedar, R.K. Dhawan and others were indispensable in most part of the Indira-Rajiv Gandhi era, Ahmad, Antony and Mukherjee have dwarfed all other members of the Congress Working Committee on account of the quality of advice, sincerity, integrity and near-absence of personal ambitions.        
	There are many in the Congress  Arjun Singh, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ambika Soni and Janardhan Dwivedi  aspiring to make the elite group of decision makers, so far largely confined to Ahmad, Antony and Mukherjee. But it is unlikely that power equations in the party will be drastically altered in the near future.        
	Congress sources said if Sonia re-enforced the one-man-one-post norm, most Union ministers looking after party affairs would prefer to stay in the government. The party leadership would also have to make an exception in the case of Mukul Wasnik, who is Union social justice and empowerment minister and the AICC general secretary in charge of Bihar.         
	Since Assembly polls are due in Bihar this October, Sonia will not be in a position to change his assignment. Besides, Wasnik hails from the weaker sections, so his continuation in the Union cabinet is equally important.

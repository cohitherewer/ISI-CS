The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata terms rejected 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata terms rejected 
  - Maoists refuse to give up arms but ready for talks        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Jan. 24: Maoist leader Kishanji tonight wrote to Mamata Banerjee that it wouldnt be possible for the rebels to give up arms and sit for talks.        
	The CPI (Maoist) will never agree to abandon arms before talks, be it with the Centre, the state government or any political party. Maoists dont believe in parliamentary politics, Kishanji said in the letter, released to the media.         
	The communication follows the railway ministers appeal to the rebels at a January 15 rally in West Midnapores Jhargram to shun violence and give up arms. I appeal to you with folded hands to shun violence and give up arms. I can even touch your feet. But for gods sake, start negotiations, she had said.        
	Mamata wasnt available for comment this evening but Subrata Bakshi, the Trinamul Congresss Bengal chief, said talks were possible only if the Maoists gave up arms. If they give up arms, she would persuade the Centre to talk to them as she had promised at the rally.        
	Referring to Mamatas declaration to start padayatras to Lalgarh, Belpahari, Binpur and Salboni if the Maoists didnt agree to talks, Kishanji said in his letter: You have said you will launch a padayatra. You can come without bringing police with you. Come and see how the harmad bahini (a reference to armed CPM gangs) and the joint forces are torturing the people.        
	But Bakshi appeared to suggest that the march would not be organised immediately. She (Mamata) will take a decision on the padayatra after waiting a few more days to give them (the Maoists) more time so that good sense prevails.        
	In an apparent attempt to reject the allusion that the Maoists were trigger-happy, Kishanji alleged that local Trinamul and the CPM members had more arms than the rebels. You (Trinamul) have one-third of the quantity of arms that the CPM has. We dont have one-tenth of the arms that you have. But arms that you people (both parties) have will not be taken into account (when calls are made to us to give up weapons).        
	The rebel leader, however, said the Maoists were open to talks with Mamata herself and listed some issues. These include development of Jangal Mahal, a movement to scrap special economic zones, steps against the terror unleashed by the harmad (armed) gangs and ways to stop Trinamul-CPM clashes outside Jangal Mahal.        
	We will hold talks if you discuss these issues. But you have to make it clear whether you want to talk as a Trinamul leader or a central government representative, Kishanji said.

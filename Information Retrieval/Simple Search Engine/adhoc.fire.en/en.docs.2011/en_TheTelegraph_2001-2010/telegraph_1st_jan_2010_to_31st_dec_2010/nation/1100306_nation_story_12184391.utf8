The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Seniority is not a fundamental right: CAT
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Seniority is not a fundamental right: CAT
                            
	New Delhi, March 5 (PTI): The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has said public employees cannot claim seniority as a fundamental right.        
	The tribunal made the statement while refusing to set aside an order by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) revising the seniority list of its junior stenographers.        
	As per the settled law, seniority is not a fundamental right of a public employee. It is only a civil right. There cannot be any change in this contrary to the principles of natural justice, the tribunal bench said.        
	It dismissed the petition of some junior stenographers seeking to set aside the order of the civic agency, which had revised their seniority list.        
	The tribunal noted that the MCD had revised the seniority list of junior stenographers in 2000 while duly considering the objections it had invited after circulating a provisional seniority list.        
	The revision of seniority list of 2000 had been preceded by circulation of a provisional seniority list and inviting the objections. Even though the applicants still insist that their objections had not been considered, this is not proved, the tribunal said.        
	It rejected the plea by the petitioners, who had claimed that natural justice had been violated, on the ground that no proof in the form of relevant documents was produced in support of it.        
	The petitioners were aggrieved at the changes in the revised seniority list of 2000 and had approached the tribunal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bugle sounded for DMK succession battle
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bugle sounded for DMK succession battle
          G.C. SHEKHAR                  
	Chennai, April 1: A Reliance-like fight has broken out in the DMK on who will inherit the political legacy of party chief M. Karunanidhi.        
	Eldest son M.K. Alagiri, a Union minister who has already sounded the bugle signalling a succession struggle, today declared he would not allow younger brother M.K. Stalins elevation as DMK president unchallenged in the post-Karunanidhi scenario.        
	I accept Karunanidhis theory that after him the party leader will be elected democratically by the party. I will also accept only a democratically elected president. If there is a democratic election, I will definitely contest, he said while justifying his recent interview that he will not accept anyone else as leader.         
	Sources said Alagiri met Karunanidhi this morning and demanded that a post of vice-president be created for him within the party, which would make him No. 2 in the DMK hierarchy.        
	Alagiris defiance means he is refusing to comply with Karunanidhis calculated moves to anoint Stalin both as chief minister and party president, twin responsibilities that the DMK patriarch has donned whenever he has been in power.         
	This is the most direct challenge made against Karunanidhis leadership. If it had been anyone else, they would have been booted out of the party. But coming from within his own family, the old man is helpless, a senior minister clucked in sympathy.        
	Alagiri pointed out that the issue would be decided after Karunanidhi since as long his father is around there was no need to discuss it. But by baring his mind about the future, Alagiri is in effect discussing the issue of Karunanidhis successor as party president even when the DMK veteran is very much around.         
	The message Alagiri is sending out is that since Karunanidhi is around this is not an issue, but he should know that it would be one after him.        
	The succession struggle is similar to the war between the Ambani brothers over the legacy of their father, Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani. The difference being that the bitter battle between Mukesh and Anil erupted after the death of Dhirubhai.        
	Stalin is already in line for the chief ministers post, with his fathers blessings. Karunanidhi had signalled as much when he recently said: He is not just a deputy CM but also a chief minister who is assisting me. The younger son has also been indicating that he should inherit both posts so there are no two power centres in the DMK.        
	Alagiri has now made it clear that Stalin cannot take for granted the party presidents position.         
	After Alagiris interview last week, Karunanidhi had recently said that if the two brothers clashed only he (Karunanidhi) would be hurt and that only his blood would be shed. But the fact that Alagiri has made this challenge after meeting Karunanidhi today proves that he does not care if the fratricidal war hurts his father. It is now clear the fight within the family has reached new levels, said Cho Ramaswamy, editor of Thuglak magazine.        
	By pitching only for the DMK chiefs post, Alagiri is letting know that he would like to take control of the party first and weaken Stalins hold on the government thereafter.         
	In Tamil Nadu, the party is supreme and the chief ministers power devolves from the party. This was proved after MGRs death in 1987. While his widow Janaki had more MLAs than Jayalalithaa, the latter, however, was seen as the mass leader and the true inheritor of MGRs political legacy, pointed out a DMK MP.         
	Alagiri reckons that if he could take hold of the party apparatus, the MLAs with Stalin can be won over easily.         
	Stalin has chosen not to respond to this direct challenge from his elder brother. But unless he can wangle some kind of assurance from his father that he would be the sole inheritor of his legacy, he may well have a battle in his hands.

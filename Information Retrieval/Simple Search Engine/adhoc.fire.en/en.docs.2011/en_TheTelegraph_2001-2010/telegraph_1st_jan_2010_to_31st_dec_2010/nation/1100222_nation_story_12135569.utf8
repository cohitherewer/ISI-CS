The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul riddle for Sonia loyalists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul riddle for Sonia loyalists
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: Rahul Gandhis emergence as a key power centre in the Congress has triggered a scramble in the party, compelling even leaders well entrenched in Sonia Gandhis system to expand loyalties.        
	Although loyalties to Sonia and Rahul are not mutually antagonistic, many senior leaders are worried about their future.        
	When Rahul became a general secretary, powerful members of Sonias team presumed they would get the opportunity to work with him and gradually become an integral part of his system.         
	They had not foreseen that Rahul would work in isolation by setting up a separate secretariat.        
	The young MP has set up his own system, which operates almost independently without any functional relationship with the All India Congress Committee set-up at 24 Akbar Road.        
	Rahul rarely visits the party headquarters. Even the AICC secretaries attached to him operate independently though they have their offices on the party premises.        
	The stark difference between the stature of AICC secretaries and those attached to Rahul  like Jitendra Singh and Meenakshi Natrajan  explains why some veterans are a worried lot. Rahuls political aide Kanishka Singh is considered to be more powerful than a party general secretary.        
	The desperation among Sonia loyalists to get closer to Rahul is evident from the concern at various levels over the sharp rise of Digvijay Singh in the party hierarchy. An impression has gained ground that Digvijay has emerged as the most powerful general secretary after Rahul because of the opportunity he got to interact with the young leader in his capacity as the man in charge of Uttar Pradesh.        
	There was a move to get Digvijay out of Uttar Pradesh but it would be difficult now after his recent visit to Azamgarh, branded a terror hub since several suspects were picked up from the heartland district in the wake of the September 2008 Batla House encounter in Delhi. Party sources said Muslims might view this as a punishment for his bold gesture that involved meetings with relatives of several arrested suspects.        
	But there is more to Digvijays rise than just proximity to Rahul. Apart from being a former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, he is seen as a leader who is active in the field, has good manipulative skills and has shown courage to confront people like Amar Singh head-on.         
	Insiders said Digvijay had definitely beaten other general secretaries  many of whom are busy with ministerial work  in the race for future political stakes.        
	Apart from younger leaders like Jitendra Singh, Jitin Prasada, R.P.N. Singh, Deepender Hooda, Sachin Pilot, Ravneet Singh, Meenakshi Natrajan and Ashok Tanwar  who have become part of Team Rahul  a few older faces like Jairam Ramesh, Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma have also found a place in his system.        
	Ahmed Patel, the most trusted Sonia loyalist, doubtless remains an integral part of the future system. Sources said Pranab Mukherjee, Veerappa Moily and A.K. Antony were among the veterans Rahul turns to for advice.        
	Some leaders who have not succeeded in creating an axis with the future Prime Minister resent in private conversations Rahuls exclusive politics. He is running a Rahul brigade, not Congress, one leader said.        
	But such remarks have no takers as these leaders have scarcely ever contributed to the partys growth and had even dismissed the comeback election of 2004 as a semi-final for the Congress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VHP smells Ayodhya chance
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      VHP smells Ayodhya chance
          RADHIKA RRAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 1: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad hopes to flog the Ram temple issue and its own fortunes alive, eyeing an opportunity in the approaching court verdict on the ownership of the disputed land.        
	VHP general secretary Champak Rai said sadhus and sants would meet in Hardwar on April 6 and form a plan to coerce the judiciary to deliver a pro-Hindu verdict or reserve its judgment.        
	A court is expected to rule by September whether a Ram temple indeed stood at the site and was pulled down by Babar to build a mosque in 1528, thus disposing of a six-decade-old lawsuit.        
	For 60 years the case has been pending. If the authorities want, they can prolong it for another 60 years. But the case is not about the courts, it is about respecting peoples sentiments, Rai said.        
	Zafaryab Jilani, counsel for the Sunni wakf board, the principal litigant from the Muslims side, said the community would not react to the VHPs latest efforts.        
	We are interested in securing an impartial judgement based on evidence and law. If we do not respond to the VHPs provocation, the Hindu community will also remain passive and the VHPs objective will fail, he said.        
	The Sunni board has concluded its arguments while two of the Hindu litigants are waiting to be heard. Jilani said he expected the arguments to conclude in July and the judgment to be pronounced in August or September.        
	The VHP has repeatedly tried and failed to revive passions over the temple before recent elections, and the issue seems to have lost political relevance for the BJP too. The temple movements spearheads are either dead (Mahant Ramchandra Das Paramhans and Onkar Bhave) or old and sick (Ashok Singhal and Giriraj Kishore) or politically irrelevant (Vinay Katiyar).        
	The first petition in the case was filed in 1950 by Ayodhya resident Gopal Singh Visharad in the court of the Faizabad civil judge, seeking permission to worship the Ram deities installed clandestinely inside the mosque in December 1949. An interim injunction restraining Muslims from removing the idols was granted.        
	A maze of lawsuits was filed in different courts since then, and was compressed into one case by Allahabad High Court in 1989. It said a three-judge bench in Lucknow would hear the five title suits  four by Hindus and one by the Sunni board  while all sides maintained status quo and did not change the nature of the property.

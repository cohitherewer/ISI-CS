                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Visa bust at airport 
                            
	New Delhi, July 6 (PTI): Twenty-seven people were detained at the Indira Gandhi International Airport when they were trying to board two Dubai-bound flights allegedly with forged travel documents.        
	The detentions by the CISF came after call centres of Kingfisher and Jet Airways received calls from an anonymous person who said the suspects were to board two flights to Dubai with fake visas. The caller also gave PNR numbers of the tickets, official sources said.         
	All those detained claimed they had paid nearly Rs 60,000 to agents to get visas for Dubai where they were promised jobs, the sources said.         
	Some of the detainees are of Bangladeshi origin while the others are from north India, they said.        
	We have detained 27 people with fake visas, Udayan Banerjee, CISF deputy inspector-general, said.        
	The Jet Airways call centre in Delhi received the call at 2pm. The person who called said 15 people were planning to fly to Dubai today with fake visas and they could hijack the flight, the sources said. The call came from Dubai.        
	The caller who alerted the Kingfisher call centre in Pune said 12 passengers with fake visas would be flying to Dubai. The person also claimed immigration officials were involved in the racket, the officials said.        
	Soon after the calls were received, CISF personnel were deployed at the international terminal and the airline staff were briefed and provided with the PNR numbers of the suspect travellers. They were allowed to enter the airport and as soon as they approached the staff at the counters and produced their tickets they were apprehended, a senior security official said.         
	The official said the security personnel at the gates were also briefed. They identified the suspects and signalled to the personnel inside.         
	They (the suspects) came in groups of five or six. The whole operation took around two hours to complete, one of the officials said.

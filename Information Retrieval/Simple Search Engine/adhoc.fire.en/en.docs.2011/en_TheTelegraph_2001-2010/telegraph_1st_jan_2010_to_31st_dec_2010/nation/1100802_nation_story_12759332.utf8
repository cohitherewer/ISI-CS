	New Delhi, Aug. 1 (PTI): The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it is planning to set up a special authority to evaluate and regulate genetically modified crops (GM) and food.        
	Solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium has informed a bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia that the proposed authority will look into the grievances of the anti-GM crop activists.        
	We are looking at setting up a special authority to resolve such issues. It will also look into the issue of untested GM crops and foods, Subramanium informed the apex court and requested for adjourning the matter for eight weeks, which was accepted by the bench.        
	The bench was hearing a PIL filed by environment scientist Vandana Shiva, who wants the court to strike down a government notification that allows import and manufacture of GM foods and crops without mandatory tests.        
	Shiva claimed there was no regulatory and legal framework to assess, evaluate and regulate GM food products and their effects on human health.        
	On September 2007, the Centre had issued a notification exempting GM foods from mandatory approval of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC).        
	Shiva pointed out that despite the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, which says proper sanction is required before sale, import or production of GM items, the government illegally granted a blanket exemption.        
	While most countries are banning GM products the Centre on the other hand is opening the floodgates of GM foods by relaxing and diluting the limitation imposed by the Environment Protection Act, Shiva alleged.

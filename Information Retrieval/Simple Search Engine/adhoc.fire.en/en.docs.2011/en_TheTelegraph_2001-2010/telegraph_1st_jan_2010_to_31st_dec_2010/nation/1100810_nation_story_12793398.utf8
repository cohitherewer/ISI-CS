	Vijayawada, Aug. 9: Distance must have made the CPMs heart grow fonder of Lalgarh.        
	CPM leaders today trained their guns on Mamata Banerjee from Vijayawada, having left the political space in Lalgarh vacant for her to occupy.        
	If Sitaram Yechury publicly chose to bank on the perceived contradictions between the Trinamul Congress and the Congress to pull apart the allies, sources said the CPM devoted considerable attention to the issue on the third day of the extended session of the central committee in Andhra.        
	CPM leader Mohammad Salim addressed criticism that the party had turned its back on Lalgarh. Not that we didnt try to hold our ground in Lalgarh. Our local party made efforts in that direction. But the Maoists began threatening the poor villagers, who have been with our party for several years and succeeded to some extent. This way, the rebels gained ground. But when an area becomes a liberated zone, which is what the Maoists want, its not the party but the government that has to step in to establish the rule of law, Salim said.

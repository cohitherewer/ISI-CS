	Bhubaneswar, May 16: Police today described the situation at Jagatsinghpur, the proposed Posco steel plant site, as tense but under control, following yesterdays clash between the forces and anti-plant protesters.        
	An uneasy calm prevailed in Balitutha and nearby Dhinkia and Nuagaon villages as armed policemen retained control of the entry point to the proposed plant site.         
	Fearing further police action, anti-plant protestors maintained a vigil last night, but their movement was restricted due to heavy police deployment at Balitutha.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Jagatsinghpur SP S. Devdutt Singh said adequate forces have been deployed in the sensitive pockets to prevent any untoward incident.        
	 He, however, refused to shed light on the administrations plans to enter and take control of Dhinkia, a stronghold of anti-plant protestors.         
	 The plant area had been out of bounds for the police, state government and Posco officials for the last five years after those opposed to the plant erected barricades at the entry points of each village in the vicinity.        
	Meanwhile, CPI supporters gheraoed Kujang and Paradip police stations last night, demanding the release of party MP Bibhu Prasad Tarai and other leaders.        
	 Tarai was arrested early yesterday when he was on his way to the Posco project area along with party leaders to lend support to the anti-plant agitation. He was released this morning.         
	Yesterdays incident evoked protests in Jagatsinghpur district and the state capital today as well.        
	Anti-Posco agitators today observed a bandh at Balitutha, the site of yesterdays clash and Kujang, the block headquarters, in protest against alleged police excesses. Shops remained closed, but traffic on the Cuttack-Paradip route was not affected.         
	CPI(M) activists today protested in front of the DCPs office in Bhubaneswar against police terror.        
	 Six non-Congress and non-BJP parties today met at the CPI state headquarters to condemn yesterdays incident. We decided to observe a protest day across the state on May 21, said CPI state secretary, Dibakar Nayak.        
	Other like-minded parties were also urged to support the call. The Left and other parties also decided to hold a protest meeting at Balitutha on Wednesday.

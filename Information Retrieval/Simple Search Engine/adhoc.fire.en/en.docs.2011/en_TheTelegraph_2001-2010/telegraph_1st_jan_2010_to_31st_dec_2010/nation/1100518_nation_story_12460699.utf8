The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raj praise for Uddhav snaps

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Raj and Uddhav Thackeray                                 
	Mumbai, May 17: Genuine praise or a clever political stunt, Raj Thackeray has set the cat among the pigeons.         
	Last week, Raj uttered his first words of praise for estranged cousin Uddhav, nearly four years after he quit the Shiv Sena and launched the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.         
	Inaugurating a photography exhibition, Raj, himself a cartoonist, mentioned that the love for the arts ran in his family. His father was a musician, his uncle, Sena patriarch Balasaheb Thackeray, was a seasoned political cartoonist and cousin Uddhav a photographer.         
	Yes, Uddhav is really a good photographer, Raj said, referring to a new photo-book on Maharashtra that Uddhav has published.         
	The next moment, he asked reporters and cameramen: Milala ka re (Did you get what you wanted)?         
	Even as he said it, he knew this would capture the imagination not just of the media, but the political workers of both parties and provide enough fodder for the gossip mills at Shivaji Park, the cradle of Marathi manoos politics and where both parties are headquartered.        
	Many interpreted the praise for Uddhav as a thawing of relations between the cousins, who have been at loggerheads since Raj quit the Sena. Both indulged in an acrimonious campaign full of personal attacks ahead of the October 2009 Assembly polls.         
	The MNS, by splitting the votes, helped the Congress win all six Mumbai Lok Sabha seats in May 2009, wiping out the Sena from its traditional strongholds.         
	The feud between the cousins turned bitter when the MNS further cut into the Sena-BJP votebank and helped the Congress-NCP return to power despite poor performance. Rajs party won 13 seats, proving that two similar organisations vouching for the Marathi votebank would only spell disaster for the Sena-BJP.        
	Though Rajs warm words for Uddhav were personal remarks, they were seen in the context of the fact that the MNS supported the Sena when the Ambernath civic body elections threw up a hung House earlier this month.         
	Moreover, a group of Shiv Sainiks launched a campaign, Majhi Chalwal, Mee Maharashtracha (My movement, I belong to Maharashtra) yesterday for bringing the estranged cousins together in the interest of Marathi politics.

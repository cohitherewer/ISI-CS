	Jorhat, Nov. 11: A new dimension has been added to the Tibetan struggle for freedom with the beginning of a unique Free Tibet campaign, propagated through price tags attached to woollen garments sold by Tibetan refugees in India.        
	The refugees, known for their winter wear trade for decades, have printed price tags this year with the flags of India and sovereign Tibet with a slogan: Save Tibet for world peace.         
	Lobsang Chomphel, the secretary of the Tibetan refugees woollen market in Jorhat, said that along with the Dalai Lama, the other refugees also harboured the hope of returning to their motherland one day, when it would be free from Chinese occupation.        
	Chinese troops occupied Tibet in 1959 and those who fled from the country to India then are now too old to make the annual trek from the Himalayan foothills of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim, where we have been settled by the Indian government. But we, the second and third generation refugees, would still like to keep the refugee tag intact and return home some day, Chomphel said.        
	It is ironical though that the Tibetan refugees are, in small measure, still dependent on China for their bread.         
	T. Nima, a trader, said the price tags were customised for different states and had different pictures and logos and with the address of the Tibetan woollen market printed on it.

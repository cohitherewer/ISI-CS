The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Students grade for teachers? HRD nods
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Students grade for teachers? HRD nods
  - Sibal accepts scheme of peer-and-pupil review of classroom performance          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, May 21: The human resource development ministry is likely to stick to a performance-grading scheme that links promotions of university teachers to their ratings by students and peers, a plan teacher unions across the country have opposed.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal is learnt to have accepted the proposed grading scheme at a meeting with the University Grants Commission today.         
	But teacher unions are expected to protest any move to ram through the scheme.         
	After an upward revision in pay scales last year, university teachers now start, for the first time in India, with salaries higher than their counterparts in the civil services.         
	But the ministry has been arguing that higher pay must be linked to greater regulation to evaluate the performance of teachers.         
	A UGC panel under former Madras University vice-chancellor S.P. Thyagarajan last year submitted a set of regulations linking pay and performance.         
	The UGC has accepted the panels recommendations.         
	But teacher unions have dubbed the grading scheme, under which teachers receive points for fulfilling various criteria, illogical and counterproductive.         
	The Federation of Central Universities Teachers Association and unions of specific varsities like Delhi University and Indira Gandhi National Open University have observed protest strikes on more than one occasion against the grading plan. They have accused the UGC and the ministry of ignoring their concerns.         
	A total of 150 points are allocated under the proposed scheme for performance in the classroom, innovative teaching methodology and for taking on examination-related work.         
	But teacher unions have argued that students and peers who will be involved in this judgement may be biased.         
	Other parameters fetching additional points include taking on governance responsibilities and membership of professional bodies.         
	Points for governance responsibilities will only promote sycophancy, while membership of professional bodies will encourage teachers to spend more time outside campus than on campus, the critics argued.         
	The grading scheme also awards additional points for research publications, participation in conferences and recognition in the form of awards from academic agencies. But international publications, conferences and agencies carry greater weightage in the grading than local counterparts.         
	This, the critics argue, will discourage teachers from research in Indian languages.         
	In addition, India will be openly undermining its own publications, conferences and awards, the teacher unions have argued.         
	Undermining Indian publications and conferences could kill their growth, as good researchers would now have a greater incentive than before to approach foreign journals for publication.         
	This would starve Indian publications of good research.         
	The unions have also pointed to the limited financial support the UGC offers for travel to conferences to argue that it is next to impossible for them to attend many international seminars.         
	Only senior faculty members generally receive awards  in recognition of a body of work built over several years of research.         
	Awarding points based on awards received will place younger faculty members at a disadvantage as compared compared to senior counterparts, the unions have argued.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP slams Mamata 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP slams Mamata 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 30: The BJP today urged the Prime Minister to ask his ministers not to sit in judgement on the Jhargram tragedy before a proper probe had revealed the cause and the chain of events leading to it.         
	The party saw in this utter state of confusion signs of vote-bank politics for the Bengal civic polls.        
	The BJP was particularly unsparing of its former ally, Mamata Banerjee, and rejected the conspiracy theory she had floated.         
	It is surprising that the railway minister is keen to give a clean chit to Maoists without even a proper inquiry having been held. This smacks of rank opportunism, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said.        
	He slammed the Congress, Trinamul Congress and the CPM for their blame game and apathy for the hapless victims who are desperately looking for the bodies of their dear ones.        
	These parties are only desperate to extract political mileage from the tragedy and reap electoral gains. Their energies appear to be concentrated only on shifting the blame and shirking their responsibility rather than concentrating on actual relief work, he alleged.        
	Javadekar referred to reports that there were not enough gas cutters and rescue personnel to extricate the bodies from the mangled remains of the Jnaneswari Express.        
	Angry relatives are anxiously waiting for the (central and Bengal) governments to put their act together.... It is saddening to note that at this tragic moment, the central government, railway ministry and state government are busy blaming each other, he said.        
	He asked the parties to cast aside their considerations of electoral gains and evolve a co-ordinated response to the tragedy.        
	The people of the country would like to ask the PM, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and the home minister how many more gruesome civilian deaths would be required to jolt the government out of slumber, said Javadekar.

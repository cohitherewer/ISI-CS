          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The Centre today tried to bring around the BJP and hardliners within the Congress with an amendment to the Enemy Property Act, dealing with properties left behind by those who migrated to Pakistan at the time of Partition, which balances the interests of owners and tenants.         
	Nothing contained in this act shall affect any claim made by any person before any court or other authority against the owner or his lawful heir to whom property may be returned under this act and such claim shall be decided in accordance with the law by the court or other authority as the case may be, the amendment reads.        
	In other words, the tenant or occupier of an enemy property can challenge the legal owners right to reclaim his property.        
	But the BJP has so far refused to support the bill introduced in the Lok Sabha today. Our expectations remain unfulfilled. We have told the government we will not back the proposed change, said Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	The Centre hopes to pass the bill on Monday with the support of the Left and secular regional parties.         
	Created after the 1965 war, the Enemy Property Act of 1968 controls the fate of 2,618 properties left behind by migrants. Most are in Uttar Pradesh but Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar also have a sizeable number.         
	According to the law, the government is the custodian of all enemy properties and has the right to rent them out. However, in view of attempts by Indian legal heirs of the owners to reclaim the properties, the home ministry in July this year brought an ordinance to block all Indian heirs from going to court. But when the amendment was tabled in Parliament, several Muslim MPs and ministers met the Prime Minister to oppose the change.         
	The home ministry then modified the amendment to state that if the Indian legal heirs established their status to the satisfaction of the courts, they could claim such properties with certain caveats that limited their right of recourse.         
	The BJP and a section of the Congress  unwilling to brook this concession for fear that existing tenants and occupiers may be imperilled if the legal heirs were given the upper hand  ensured the amendment was kept in abeyance.        
	The BJP said the change was brought in to help one individual, Raja Mohammed Amir Khan, who never migrated to Pakistan and remained an Indian citizen throughout. His father had left the country in 1947.        
	Today, home minister P. Chidambaram tried to mollify the BJP by consenting to uphold a tenants right to challenge the owner. We want the government to revert to the Ordinance. Nothing short of that will do, Sushma said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          RS Rana being taken to a New Delhi court on Tuesday. (PTI)		    
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: A CBI team searching the home of a Bar Council of India member who was caught red-handed taking bribe was last night attacked by a bamboo-wielding mob headed by three advocates.        
	The mob of around 40 people barged into R.S. Ranas north Delhi house around 10pm while an eight-member team was at work, beat up an inspector and fled with incriminating documents and about Rs 6.8 lakh in bribe money found on the premises, CBI sources said.        
	The agency had sprung a raid on Ranas Pitampura residence around 7pm, two hours after he was caught accepting a Rs 1 lakh bribe from Manish Tyagi, a member of the advisory board of a Ghaziabad law college, in front of the Bar council office. Both were immediately arrested.        
	A law college cannot start operations unless it is affiliated to the Bar Council of India.        
	As our team was conducting searches, a violent mob overpowered the team which had seized a huge amount of cash suspected to be part of illegal gratification received by Rana, a senior CBI officer said.        
	They manhandled our team, beat up an inspector and fled with part of the seized cash amounting to Rs 6.8 lakh and incriminating documents seized from Ranas house.        
	According to the officer, the CBI team had noticed a group of about 15 persons gathering around Ranas home and sniffed trouble. When they began raising slogans, the team called the local police station for help.        
	Although four policemen showed up, the mob began to swell. Around 10pm, around 40 people armed with bamboos stormed the home. They manhandled our team, CBI spokesperson R.K. Gaur said.        
	The CBI has filed a complaint against the three advocates and their accomplices for assaulting government servants and preventing them from discharging their duty.        
	A case has been registered against Rana for accepting bribe to give the law college a favourable affiliation report. A Delhi court today dismissed his bail petition and granted the CBI custody of Rana for two days.        
	Tyagi had paid most part of the bribe to Rana. Only a lakh was to be paid on Monday. Our officers laid a trap and arrested them both, a CBI officer said, adding the agency had been monitoring his phone calls.        
	Rana alleged at the CBI headquarters that the agency was trying to frame him. He was elected to the Bar Council of Delhi in 1998 and to the Bar Council of India this year.

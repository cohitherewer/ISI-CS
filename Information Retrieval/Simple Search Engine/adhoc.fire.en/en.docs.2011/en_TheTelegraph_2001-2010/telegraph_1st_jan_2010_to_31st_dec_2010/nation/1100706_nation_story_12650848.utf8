          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, July 5: Chief Justice of India S.H. Kapadia has indicated that the Supreme Court will now deal with infrastructure bottlenecks plaguing the judicial system at the subordinate level on a weekly basis.        
	A special bench will be set up soon, which will meet every Monday, to deal with problems being faced by the bench and the bar in the subordinate courts, Justice Kapadia, who was heading a three-judge bench, said.        
	This special bench will sit every Monday and address problems faced by advocates and lawyers state-wise, he said.         
	We will also appoint an amicus curiae (officer of the court) to assist us in this, he said. The high courts will be asked to list the problems they are facing and these will be forwarded to states for action, the Chief Justice said.        
	The chief secretary of every state will be asked to provide all facilities to lawyers and other members of the judiciary, he said.         
	The special bench will deal with cases on a state-to-state basis, he indicated. We cannot deal with all problems, but we can solve some problems, Justice Kapadia said.        
	The bench passed this order while hearing a petition seeking implementation of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The top court had earlier passed orders to all states and Union territories to set up district consumer courts. However, such bottlenecks still exist.        
	The Chief Justice had earlier expressed concern over the lack of even basic amenities in the lower courts in most states.         
	The lack of basic infrastructure has been blamed for the excessive backlog of cases at this level.         
	Todays move is part of the Chief Justices efforts to clean up the system, which is breaking under its own weight.        
	Over 3 crore cases are pending in courts across the country. Of these, 1.5 crore cases are pending with the lower courts. The rest are pending with high courts and the Supreme Court. Average delay of five years or more is common.        
	In Bengal, the backlog is put at over 15 lakh cases. Of this, Calcutta High Court alone accounts for 3.75 lakh, or 25 per cent. The infrastructure problems of the high court came into focus last month when police forcibly removed lawyers protesting the lack of seating arrangements by occupying a room in the building.        
	The Chief Justice also indicated that he would set up a Constitution bench which would dispose of all important issues involving interpretation of the statute that were pending for years before the Supreme Court.        
	Among other prominent legal disputes, the top court is yet to take a decision on the water row between Haryana and Punjab.         
	The matter had been referred to the court by the President for adjudication. Inter-state disputes can only be resolved in the top court, but with a backlog of 70,000 cases, they are still waiting to be heard.        
	Some lawyers reacted with scepticism to Justice Kapadias moves. They pointed out that the apex court already has a green bench to deal with environmental issues.         
	That bench, which sits every Friday, has been criticised for having exceeded its jurisdiction and encroaching into the executives domain, the lawyers said.         
	A new bench, ordering states to summarily provide infrastructure to the judiciary, would only attract more criticism, they added.

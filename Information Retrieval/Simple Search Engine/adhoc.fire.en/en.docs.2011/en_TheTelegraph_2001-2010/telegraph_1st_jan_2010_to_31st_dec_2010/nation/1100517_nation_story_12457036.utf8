          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, May 16: A youths death after an apparent fall from the roof of his house has become mired in controversy with his mother alleging that police had thrashed him mercilessly late on Friday evening.        
	Mukesh Beldars mother Sakri Devi told reporters that the police raided her Dhaniabaghich house under the Delha police station area of the town. The men in uniform were looking for Mukeshs brother Rakesh, a suspect in a recent bank loot. Rakesh, who was present at the house during the raid, managed to give the police a slip.         
	The angry policemen, however, picked up Mukesh, a private electrician. Scurrying for safety, Mukesh ran upstairs and the policemen followed him, said Sakri Devi. From the roof, Mukesh either jumped to escape the police or accidentally fell or was pushed by the men in uniform.        
	Sakri Devi also alleged that even as her son lay writhing in pain, asking for water, the policemen did not allow her to give him water. From Dhanibaghich, Mukesh was taken to the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital and due to his serious condition, he was referred to Patna where he succumbed to his injuries today.        
	Denying the allegation, Gaya superintendent of police Amit Lodha said the police had gone to the house for verification, as Rakesh was a suspect in the Rs 10-lakh loot. On seeing the police, Mukesh jumped from the roof and injured himself. The self-inflicted injury turned fatal, he said.        
	He said Mukesh also figured as an accused in cases registered in 2001 and 2004. The case pertained to dacoity and possession of illegal weapons, Lodha said.         
	Magadh range DIG Jitendra Kumar said the statement of Mukeshs mother would be verified and action would be taken against the policemen if the allegations were found to be true.

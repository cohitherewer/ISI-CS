The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD-U rift resurfaces
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      JD-U rift resurfaces
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish: No longer at ease?                                  
	Patna, Jan. 29: Will state JD(U) president Lallan Singh do an Amar Singh with Nitish Kumar?        
	Lallan has not been performing his duty as the state party chief for the past month. He has not been attending the office for over a month also. Unusually for him, he has not been seeing the chief minister, either, a senior party leader said, referring to the Amar-Mulayam Singh Yadav incident in Uttar Pradesh.        
	In fact, there is strong indication of the rift between Nitish and Lallan, his long time associate, one of the founding members of Samata Party and then JD(U). A key petitioner in the fodder scam cases against Lalu Prasad, Lallan joined JD(U) with Nitish in 1994 and since then their bond has grown stronger.        
	Primarily a backroom operator, Lallan is described to be what MP Prem Gupta is to Lalu and Amar to Mulayam in political parlance. Lallan has also earned the image of the partys fund-raiser. Senior party leader Prabhunath Singh recently took to the streets by organising a Rajput rebellion rally on Maharana Prataps birth anniversary. Now, Lallan, and MP Shivanand Tiwary are believed to be nursing bitterness against Nitish.        
	The rift among these leaders gained ground after the inclusion of Upednra Prasad Kushwaha, a leader of Koiri caste, which constituted the ruling JD(U)s Law-Kush (Kurmi-Koiri) combination in December last year. Kushwaha, who was initially in the JD(U) and had been expelled for anti-party activities in 2007, has joined the party again.        
	But the primary reason of the rift, as the grapevine goes, is Nitishs refusal to give tickets to the wards of MPs and MLAs in the Assembly polls.        
	That the rift in the party is out in the open is also evident from the fact that Kushwaha, who is not yet an office-bearer of the party, called a meeting of the district JD(U) presidents on January 26. He is scheduled to organise a Kushwaha rally on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Jotiba Phule on February 2 for which handbills and cutouts have been put up on the Patna streets.        
	Interestingly, Lallan does not figure in any of the cutouts and handbills which of course have the pictures of Nitish, Kushwaha and other party leaders. Tiwary and Lallan had accompanied Nitish in few of his vikas yatras (development journeys) undertaken in February-March last year.        
	But these leaders have neither been seen around Nitish on his recent Gaya and Vaishali sojourns, nor have attended any of the functions with him in over a month.        
	Another important reason for the rift in the party is said to be the annoyance of the upper caste leaders against what they feel as Nitishs undue promotion to extremely backward classes (EBCs) and the maha-Dalits.        
	The developments in the JD(U) must have come as music to the ears of the Congress trying to revive itself in Bihar and Lalu-Ram Vilas Paswan combination trying to wrest power from Nitish in the election year.

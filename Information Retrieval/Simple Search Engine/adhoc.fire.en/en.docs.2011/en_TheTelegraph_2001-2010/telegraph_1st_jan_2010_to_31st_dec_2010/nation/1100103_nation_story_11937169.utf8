	Lucknow, Jan. 2: Two train drivers blinded by fog rammed their locomotives into two others from behind half an hour apart in Uttar Pradesh today, killing 10 and injuring 45, but questions were also being asked about human error and instrument failures.        
	A third train ploughed into a tractor trolley at an unmanned level crossing sometime later, wounding two passengers, on a morning when visibility fell to near zero on the tracks.        
	Former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi of the BJP and a Congress MP escaped unhurt in the days worst accident, at Panki station near Kanpur, which witnessed all the 10 deaths apart from injuries to over 30 people.        
	Fog alone cannot be blamed for the train collisions, each of which resulted from two trains being allowed to get on the same track without any alert reaching the one behind.        
	Around 8.35am at Panki, the engine of the Bhiwani-Gorakhpur Gorakhdham Express tore into the rear of the stationary Delhi-Allahabad Prayagraj Express at 50kmph, turning its guards cabin and luggage van into a heap of junk, shaped like a pyramid.                        (Top)Murli Manohar Joshi, who was on the Prayagraj Express, escaped unhurt, and (above) two other passengers of the same train comfort each other after the crash         
	Both trains were travelling from Delhi, said officials, who added that the Prayagraj guard, six other men and three women died in the accident.        
	Earlier, around 8am, the Delhi-Sitamarhi Lichchavi Express had hit the stationary Magadh Express at Sarai Bhopat near Etawah, about 275km southwest of Lucknow. Ten passengers were injured while the Lichchavi driver got trapped inside his mangled engine, from which he has been rescued.        
	At Panki, the severely damaged rearmost passenger coach of Prayagraj stood grotesquely on the tracks for hours as trapped and horrified passengers watched gas cutters being used to extricate them. The Gorakhdham engine had been twisted out of shape.

	Railway officials confessed themselves puzzled how the Gorakhdham driver could miss the signals, which are especially powerful since Panki is just 1.5km from a major station, Kanpur. If the signals werent visible, they said, the automatic cracker-burst mechanism should have worked, or the driver should have been warned over the communications system.        
	They were also surprised that the Gorakhdham was travelling at 50kmph in such poor visibility.        
	Sharad Asthana, a passenger on coach S4 of Prayagraj, said: We were woken from sleep by a huge jolt. It was very cold. We stepped out of the coach to see two compartments (guards cabin and luggage van) of our train twisted into a heap of junk the shape of a pyramid.        
	The Congress MP from Bahraich, Kamal Kishore, and his wife Poonam were travelling on Gorakhdham. We survived thanks to the blessings of Baba Gorakhnath, Kishore said.        
	Varanasi MP Murli Manohar Joshi, who was travelling to Allahabad on Prayagraj, said: There was a severe lapse on the part of the drivers and guards. The fog was not the only reason.        
	He ripped into railway minister Mamata Banerjee. While the railway minister is busy announcing new plans, she has not made the basic arrangements to cope with the winter fog. Let her say what plans she has for tomorrow, when more trains will be affected by fog and may meet with this kind of accident, Joshi said.        
	Former railway minister Lalu Prasad said officials were at fault for letting trains run in near-zero visibility. Normally, trains are cancelled or held back at stations, he said.        
	The commissioner of railway safety will start an inquiry on Monday.         
	The days third accident, involving the Sarayu Express, took place around 9.30am in Pratapgarh, 161km from Lucknow.        
	The railways have announced Rs 5 lakh for the family of each of those killed, Rs 1 lakh for those with serious injuries and Rs 10,000 for the other injured.        
	The accidents disrupted services on the Delhi-Kanpur section, forcing the railways to reschedule eight trains, cancel nine and divert another nine. Fifty-two trains were running late this evening and hundreds of passengers were stranded at stations for hours.

          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, May 11: The best advertisement is that which the public pays to receive.        
	So the UPA government will turn the rural job scheme into a diploma course in its universities, teaching students about the pro-poor programmes achievements against a small fee.        
	The one-year course, which starts from the 2011-12 academic year, will also impart education in the nitty-gritty of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Schemes implementation.        
	Fittingly, at the end of it the students will be eligible for rural jobs themselves  as technical personnel to help the government run its flagship social scheme better.        
	It may not be wrong if you see the diploma course as a free PR exercise for the government, a rural development ministry official said. But then, the job scheme is a programme the entire world is watching keenly. It is natural for a government to try and gain the most out of something it has done.        
	The course will create a pool of trained manpower that will bring in professionalism and more efficiency to the scheme, the official said.         
	The diploma-holders may be hired at various levels, panchayat to district, as lok karmis and lok sevaks. They will educate people about the scheme, help beneficiaries write applications and help them deal with the panchayats and banks. They may also co-ordinate with government employees and officials engaged in the other development programmes, thereby helping enlarge the job schemes scope, the official said.        
	For starters, the government plans to introduce the diploma programme in all central universities and the Industrial Training Institutes, and may later extend it to other vocational training institutes. NGOs affiliated with universities too can teach the course.         
	The official said the idea had come from the Planning Commission, which had suggested in its mid-term appraisal that the government launch a course on the job scheme to increase its output through more technical manpower.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 31: Manmohan Singh has intensified his efforts to introduce the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill in the second phase of the budget session, not by an aggressive push but by engaging the Opposition.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of the Padma awards programme today, the Prime Minister said: We have an open mind on the bill. If there are deficiencies, we can discuss them. Then, he quickly added: If necessary, the bill will be referred to a parliamentary standing committee after introduction.        
	The BJP, the Left and the non-UPA parties had blocked the bill, saying the compensation that nuclear plants would have to shell out for accidents had been fixed too low in the legislation.        
	The bill is a key step to operationalise the Indo-US civil nuclear deal because private nuclear suppliers in the US do not want to engage in nuclear commerce with India without a liability clause.        
	The Samajwadi Party, which had rejected the bill along with the Left and the BJP, showed signs of a thaw. Its general secretary and spokesperson Mohan Singh said the proposed law was required for atomic power generation but would have to be vetted by a parliamentary panel before it was passed.        
	Mohan Singh said the bill needed to amend certain imbalances, such as fixing culpability on the supplier-countries for accidents, and not shift the blame entirely to the operator countries. A select committee should vet it and it should be passed only after consultations with all parties.        
	A Samajwadi source insisted there were two views, not on the bill, but on the implications of backing it. We paid a price (in the Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh) for bailing out UPA-I on the civil nuclear deal. Our voters saw us as the Congresss B-team. They either didnt vote for us or shifted their votes to the Congress. We need to keep a balance between being a responsible Opposition and retaining a political identity, the source said.        
	The BJP, too, is expected to review its stand after Singhs assurance.        
	It is believed that the governments main argument will centre around the concept of a no fault liability. Although the idea has not been enshrined in the bill, it means that immediately after an accident, victims will be handed a substantial tranche of compensation without entangling them in a legal maze of proving who was culpable and who was not.        
	It is being stressed that the no fault liability does not mean there will be no criminal liability or that victims will be stopped from moving court to claim more compensation. The bill allows the government to scale up liability.        
	The official argument is that the compensation cap of Rs 500 crore compares favourably with the amount paid in China.        
	The government has denied the Oppositions charge that the bill was drafted under US pressure. It has claimed that the bill was conceptualised much before the 2005 civil nuclear deal, with the idea of ramping up nuclear energy production.

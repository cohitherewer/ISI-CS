The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Power acrobatics in Taj city
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Power acrobatics in Taj city
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Taj Mahal: Have moon, need no power                                  
	Lucknow, April 4: A private firm took over electricity distribution in Agra last week, sparking protests against the Mayavati government by employee unions affiliated to the BJP which, ironically, had started Uttar Pradeshs power reforms in 2000.        
	The Ahmedabad-based Torrent Power Ltd started services in the city of the Taj from April 1 under a 20-year deal that was announced almost a year ago by the Mayavati cabinet. The unions had slammed the decision then and held demonstrations over the last several months, but without stalling work or shutting offices.        
	But, after the formal handover, the simmering tensions bubbled to the surface. The employees called it a black day and started a strike. The government, fearing sabotage, deployed security forces around sub-stations in Agra.        
	Torrent may not make much of a difference to the Taj itself: it is a tomb, and gets light from the full moon, with visitors watching it from a distance at night. When it is not full moon, the monument reflects a strange aura, shrouded as it is in darkness, and the little dots of lights from beyond Yamuna form the backdrop.        
	But Tajganj, the area where the monument is located, could see an improvement in power supply with Torrent taking charge.         
	One of the reasons why Agra was chosen first for privatisation of power distribution is not because of the Taj monument. It is because state power minister Ramji Upadhyay happens to be from Agra, a senior official said.        
	The authorities called the move historic and promised big gains for consumers in the power-starved state where prolonged blackouts have earlier forced people to hit the streets in protest. This is the first culmination of the process of reform that had begun in January 2000. It is a historic decision, said Navneet Sahgal, chairman and managing director of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. The state-owned firm had been distributing power in Agra so far. Torrent has taken over its network there.        
	The private firm, which services Ahmedabad in Gujarat and Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, will get the network in Kanpur, Uttar Pradeshs biggest city, soon, Sehgal said. The authorities insist consumers will get better service, electricity thefts will come down and earnings will rise as a result of the privatisation.         
	But the unions are on the war path. Leading the agitation is the Vidyut Karmachari Sangh, the largest of the unions that is affiliated to the BJP, which had initiated the reforms in 2000 by trifurcating the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Board.        
	Sailendra Dubey, the president of the Uttar Pradesh Power Employees Federation  an umbrella group of unions, including the Karmachari Sangh  said engineers in generation units had been exempted from the strike now but would join the agitation if the government didnt roll back the privatisation in Agra move within two days. Mayavatis BSP does not have any power sector union affiliated to it.

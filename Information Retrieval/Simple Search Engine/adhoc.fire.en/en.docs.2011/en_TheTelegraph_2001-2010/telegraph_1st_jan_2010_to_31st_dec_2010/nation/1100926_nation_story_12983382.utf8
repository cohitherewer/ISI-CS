The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Sonia leads eunuchs to polls 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      A Sonia leads eunuchs to polls 
          BASANT RAWAT                           Sonia Dey                                  
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 25: Sonia Dey, 27, and nine other eunuchs will contest the upcoming civic elections from Ahmedabad.        
	While eunuchs have made political inroads in cities like Sagar in Madhya Pradesh and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, this is the first time so many are fighting an election in Ahmedabad.        
	Sonia, who contested the 2007 Assembly election and also stood against L.K. Advani and Mallika Sarabhai in the 2009 Lok Sabha election, claims to have ambition for a cause.         
	I lost elections but gained enormous confidence and experience to lead from the front, says Sonia, who claims to have a masters degree in English literature and runs a carpet business.        
	Articulate and aggressive, Sonia is president of the All India Kinnar (Eunuch) Association.        
	Eunuchs will make their presence felt loudly and effectively, Sonia claims, adding this will be a new beginning.         
	Although the eunuchs will be contesting as Independents, with the bangle as their election symbol, Sonia has registered the group as Jeeti Jitaayi Party with the state Election Commission.         
	 Corruption will be their main poll plank, says Sonia, who will contest from Shahpur in the Old City. She had fought the Assembly election from the same constituency.         
	Unlike politicians, we dont loot and fool the people, we only bless them. We live in harmony, eunuchs are not parochial or sectarian  Hindus and Muslims live together, Sonia adds, explaining why people would vote for them.         
	Sonia is, however, all praise for her more famous namesake and her son Rahul Gandhi as well as for Narendra Modi. She describes the Congress president as an extraordinary pro-poor leader, Rahul as very humane and the Gujarat chief minister as dynamic, charismatic and workaholic.

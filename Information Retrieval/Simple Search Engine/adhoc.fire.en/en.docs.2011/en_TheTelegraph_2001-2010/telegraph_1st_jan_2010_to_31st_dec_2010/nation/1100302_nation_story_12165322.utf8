          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, March 1: Four bandh enforcers allegedly involved in last weeks death of a 11-day-old ailing infant during a Baramulla protest have been arrested, days after the incident triggered outrage across the country.         
	Tanveer Ahmad Saleh, Bilal Ahmad Channa, Akhtar Hussain Bhat and Mohammed Ramzan Siraj have been arrested in connection with the murder of the baby. Tanveer was the person who dragged the infants mother out of the vehicle, Jammu and Kashmir law minister Ali Mohammad Sagar told the Assembly today.        
	The baby, Irfan, died on February 22 after he slipped and fell when the bandh enforcers dragged his mother out of a minibus while enforcing a shutdown at Chakla village in Baramulla. Police had said the baby suffered internal injuries. The family of Irfan  his father, mother, grandfather and elder sibling  were on way to hospital for his treatment. Obaid, Irfans four-year-old brother, was injured in the head.        
	Police sources said Tanveer was a former militant, and was leading one of the many stone-throwing mobs  who have become as big a challenge as militancy for the government  which clashed with cops that day. We have booked him on murder charges. He is from a business family which owns a hotel in Baramulla, an officer said.        
	It is not clear whether Tanveer and others acted on their own, at the behest of separatists or a mainstream political party. The government has accused the Peoples Democratic Party, the principal Opposition party, of encouraging stone-throwing and separatist leaders of paying trouble-makers to stoke unrest in the Valley. But many youths who have joined the protests claim they do it for ideological reasons.        
	In the House, the law ministers statement didnt satisfy the PDP members, who asked the government to specify the motives of those arrested for the baby-death incident. But Sagar claimed everyone in Baramulla knows the background of the four accused, stopping short of blaming any political party for the incident.         
	No political party in the Valley called for a shutdown against Irfans death, though the incident had sparked outrage across the country, rocked the Assembly and prompted a vow by chief minister Omar Abdullah to have the culprits arrested. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti had demanded a discussion and her party accused the government of raising a counter-stone pelters force to deal with stone-throwing youths.         
	The announcement about the arrests came on a day the Valley observed another shutdown called by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani against the destruction of houses in Sopore during an encounter between militants and security forces last week. Four army personnel, including a Captain, and two militants had died.

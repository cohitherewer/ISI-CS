The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security nudge to BlackBerry 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Security nudge to BlackBerry 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: The home ministry today asked the makers of the BlackBerry for access to encryption keys or data transmitted through the smartphones as the government reiterated a security concern, this time more sternly.        
	We have asked the department of telecommunication to tell the company to provide us transcripts when we need them, said a source, adding that action could otherwise be taken against the Canadian service provider.        
	Several such messages have been sent to the telecom department in the past two years, but the A. Raja-headed ministry has been unable to convince Blackberrys manufacturers Research In Motion (RIM) about Indias security concerns, sources said.        
	Security agencies are worried in the light of rumours that the wireless giant quietly allowed China to set up a server, thereby giving Beijing access to encryption keys.        
	The Canadian company has, however, informed Indian authorities that it has no other server except the one in Canada, sources said.        
	Sending a message through a BlackBerry phone is secure as the encryption level is very high and difficult to decode. While privacy is ensured, the advantage is misused often by terrorists, security experts say.        
	Doubts were first raised in 2008 when investigators suspected terrorists had used Blackberry messages that couldnt be traced to their origins.        
	The government has been insisting that BlackBerry should have a local server to host emails in India. Once a server is in India, it will be easy to track messages. But RIM, which has a central facility in Canada, has cited problems in setting up country-specific servers.        
	Asked if the US had a BlackBerry server within its control, home ministry sources said that since the server was in Canada, Washington could perhaps have access to it because of its special relationship with the neighbour. For India, the concerns are different as we have some neighbours with problems, said an official.        
	Although it has over 40 million subscribers worldwide, BlackBerry users in India account for a miniscule percentage.         
	But these days are about potential markets and India is a huge one, said a home ministry source, implying that Delhi held the bargaining chip and should use it if it concerned security.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena ban on Aussie cricketers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sena ban on Aussie cricketers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray today called for a complete ban on Australian cricketers playing in India until the racist attacks stopped Down Under.         
	Till the attacks on Indians continue on Australian soil, the Shiv Sena will not allow Australian players to enter Mumbai and Maharashtra or play any matches, Thackeray was quoted as saying in a front-page report in the party mouthpiece, Saamna.        
	No one cares for self and national pride these days, especially Indian cricketers. While our Indian brothers who have gone to study in Australia are being fired upon or stabbed or being torched in the middle of the street, our cricketers are displaying sportsmanship to the Australian team and are playing cricket with them. This is shameful for the country, the Sena boss said.        
	Thackeray praised superstar Amitabh Bachchan for declining a doctorate conferred on him by the Queensland University. Amitabhji had politely declined the honour. I would have been happy if our cricketers had shown similar national pride. But, money (in cricket) has made them forget national pride, Thackeray was quoted as saying.

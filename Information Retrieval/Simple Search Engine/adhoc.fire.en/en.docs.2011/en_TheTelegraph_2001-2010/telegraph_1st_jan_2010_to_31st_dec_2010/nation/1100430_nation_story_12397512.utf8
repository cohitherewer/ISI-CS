	Mumbai, April 29 (PTI): Bombay High Court today imposed Rs 5 lakh as cost on a petitioner for filing a frivolous public interest litigation that sought action against top bureaucrats and police officers for failing to avert the 26/11 terror attacks in the city.        
	Petitioner Goldie Sud had contended that top government officers, including the director-general of police and the chief secretary, failed to protect citizens from terrorists and action should be taken against them.        
	The high court held that the petition had no foundation or basis and amounted to abuse of the process of court.        
	The court has directed the petitioner to pay the cost within four weeks.        
	In case Sud fails to pay up, the collector of the Mumbai suburban district may take action to recover the amount.         
	On November 26, 2008, ten Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists attacked two hotels and a Jewish prayer house, killing over 170 people.

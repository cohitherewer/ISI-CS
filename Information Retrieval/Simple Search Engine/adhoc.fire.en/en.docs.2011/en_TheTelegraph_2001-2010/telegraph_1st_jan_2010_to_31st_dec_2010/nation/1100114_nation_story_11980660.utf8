The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nehru on lips, Rathore to keep smiling
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nehru on lips, Rathore to keep smiling
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rathore outside the court on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Chandigarh, Jan. 13: He learnt to smile from Jawaharlal Nehru, so he will continue to be a loyal disciple.        
	Shambhu Prasad Singh Rathore, the disgraced former Haryana director-general of police convicted of molesting Ruchika Girhotra, today announced he would keep smiling no matter what happened to him.        
	I will not say anything about the inquiry or the judicial process. But I will run away (from the media). When I was young, I used to run with other boys to get a glimpse of Jawaharlal Nehru. I learned from him to smile in times of adversity and I will continue to smile, Rathore told reporters outside a court.        
	Rathores wide grin on the day he was sentenced  six months in prison and a fine of Rs 1,000 for molesting the girl who committed suicide  had provoked outrage across the country and had become a talking point on television shows.        
	His comments came after the district and sessions court extended his bail till February 8 in the molestation case to enable the appeal against the conviction.        
	The judge of the appellant court said the final arguments in the case would be taken up continuously for three days, beginning February 8.        
	Rathores wife Abha, who was present in the court, did not initiate the arguments today as she had been doing earlier, leaving it to another lawyer, Ajit Kumar, to defend her husband.        
	Rathore, however, could be seen prompting Abha and holding her hand every now and then.        
	Asked how relieved she felt after Rathores bail was extended, Abha said: Sab upar wale ke upar hai (Everything is in Gods hands).        
	Rathore, who had entered the courts premises much ahead of the scheduled time for the hearing, looked relaxed, occasionally speaking and smiling with Abha and an acquaintance.        
	A lawyer assisting the Rathores claimed that todays extension of bail would have a bearing on the three new cases registered by Panchkula police against the former top cop.        
	The charges include attempt to murder, conspiracy, destruction of evidence and abetment to suicide.         
	While a Panchkula court has dismissed Rathores bail plea in two of the three cases, the matter will now be heard in Punjab and Haryana High Court on January 18.

  - JD-U replaces Lallan, Cong mulls over Anil          NALIN VERMA                            (Top) Sharad Yadav with Bihar JD(U) president Vijay Choudhary (right) in Patna on Sunday;(below) former Bihar Congress president Anil Sharma.

	Patna, Feb. 14: While the JD(U) today replaced its defiant state chief, the Congress high command, too, is learnt to be gearing up to find a suitable replacement for Anil Sharma as the president of its faction-ridden state unit in election-bound Bihar.        
	JD(U) MP Rajiv Ranjan, alias Lallan Singh, raised the banner of revolt against chief minister Nitish Kumar, questioning the latters dictatorial style of functioning and offering to resign from his position as the state party chief about a fortnight ago.        
	JD(U) president Sharad Yadav, who landed here on Friday, talked to Lallan and other dissident leaders to forge the much-needed unity in the party.         
	But Lallan, till recently a close lieutenant of Nitish, stuck to his guns, asking for more say in the deployment of officials and participation of his political supporters in the critical areas of governance which Nitish did not accept.        
	Eventually, Yadav announced Vijay Choudhary  belonging to the same upper caste, Bhumihar, which Lallan belongs to  as the state JD(U) chief, while accepting Lallans resignation. There is no difference in the party. Lallan was over-stressed while doing his duty as MP and the state chief. So the party has got a new state president, relieving Lallan to perform his role as a parliamentarian better, Yadav said.         
	But Lallans exit as the state party chief signals a long battle between the rebels led by him and Nitish.         
	Bihar excise minister Jamshed Ashraf, believed to be Lallans man in Nitishs cabinet, has openly alleged a scam to the tune of Rs 500 crore in his department for which he has held the chief ministers office and its officials responsible.         
	The CMO officials, defying my order, allotted a contract of liquor to fake contractors in violation of the laws. I want a vigilance inquiry against the CMO, Ashraf said. On the other hand, party MLAs Rampravesh Rai has demanded the chief ministers resignation, while Saleem Parvez has described Nitish as dictatorial.        
	In fact, there is a Congress angle to the JD(U) infighting. The grapevine has it that Lallan has been working for the JD(U)s alliance with the resurgent Congress rather than the BJP  something Nitish is strongly opposed to at this stage. Lallan reportedly feels that with the resurgent Congress roping in traditional upper caste votes in Bihar and weakening the BJP, it was politically beneficial to have ties with the Congress.         
	Almost similar considerations have stepped up the war in the Congress against the embattled state unit chief Anil Sharma, whose resignation was reportedly accepted yesterday. All the 10 Congress legislators and most of the state office-bearers have asked to Sonia Gandhi in writing to replace Sharma.        
	The dissidents in the Congress openly said Sharma had neither popularity, nor clout, nor charisma to translate the growing attraction towards the party general secretary, Rahul Gandhi, and the party as a whole into votes in the poll-bound state.         
	The dissidents have been using that damning list  where Sharma allegedly put Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumars caste against her name  as a pretext to gun for his head. Sources in the Congress said the party was looking for a Muslim face to replace Sharma. The names of Mehboob Ali Kaiser, MLA, and Congress spokesman Shakeel Ahmad are doing the rounds.

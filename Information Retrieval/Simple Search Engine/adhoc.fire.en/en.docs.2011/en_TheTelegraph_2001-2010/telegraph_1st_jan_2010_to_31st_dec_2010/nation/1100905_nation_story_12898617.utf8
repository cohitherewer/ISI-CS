          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          P Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Four central paramilitary companies reached Bihar today as the police hostage stand-off entered the sixth day, but Union home ministry sources said the Centre wouldnt get involved in any negotiation the state government was planning with the Maoist abductors.        
	While home minister P. Chidambaram is known to have spoken to Nitish Kumar, officially he maintained a studied silence, underlining the governments hands-off policy regarding the state since the chief minister turned down an invite to come to Delhi for deliberations.        
	Yesterday, one of the four policemen abducted on Sunday by the Maoists was found with a bullet hole in his chest. But Lucas Tetes death hasnt moved the Centre enough to change its stand on the rebels.        
	We have already said it  abjure violence and come for talks, said a home ministry official. Officials, however, said the ministry would support Bihar in every way possible.        
	Nitish has been one of several critics of Chidambarams hard-line policy on Maoists. Earlier this year, he had turned down an invite from Chidambaram to come to Delhi for talks on how to tackle the insurgency.         
	Sources said this was one reason the Union ministry had adopted a hands-off policy on the current crisis, apart from the fact that Nitish was in a tight spot with elections approaching.        
	On July 14 again, Nitish had insisted that Maoists were misled elements of society, underlining an approach different from that of Chidambarams.        
	But Nitish has also been asking for central police forces to help him out. Yesterday, the Bihar government asked for 40 CRPF companies. Four companies  approximately 500 personnel  reached the state today. Twenty-one more would reach the affected areas in two days, sources told The Telegraph.        
	But the sources said Chidambaram still ran the risk of conveying the impression that Centre-state relations would determine the way Delhi reacts to crises in states.        
	A senior official, however, said: Whatever the state is doing we are supporting.

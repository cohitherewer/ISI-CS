          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, April 7: Ashish Bangal, the only CRPF jawan from Bengal to be killed in the battle of Mukram, was supposed to visit his Bankura home this month to celebrate his first wedding anniversary.        
	Shortly before he was posted to Jagdalpur, my son visited us for the last time in July last year. We were expecting him to visit us later this month to celebrate his first wedding anniversary, said Ashishs father Kanai, breaking down.         
	Ashish was 30, his widow Kadam is 23.        
	Kadam was helping her mother-in-law with daily chores when a call came around 11am yesterday from the CRPF base in Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, informing the family of Ashishs death.        
	Neighbour Ardhendu Pal, a carpenter, rushed to the Bangal household when he heard wails from the house at Doboni village in Bankuras Sarenga, about 210km from Calcutta.        
	Ardhendu rushed over to find Ashishs father Kanai bending down over his wife Jyotsna, who had lost her consciousness. Kadam was weeping, leaning against the wall.        
	I didnt realise at first what has happened. I asked Kanaida. Kanaida said Ashish was no more, said Ardhendu.        
	Ardhendu informed other villagers, who soon gathered at the house. Some of the women sprinkled water on Jyotsna, and the village physician was called.        
	Suman Pal, a childhood friend of Ashish, said: We grew up together. Ashish was six-foot-two-inches tall and I had to look up to speak to him. He was a brave man and went out of his way to help those in trouble.        
	Ashishs younger brother Nilkantha, 27, was farming in a small plot of land they own and rushed home after a villager informed him.         
	Nilkantha said Ashish had joined the CRPF in 2006 and had been posted in Chhattisgarh in 2009.

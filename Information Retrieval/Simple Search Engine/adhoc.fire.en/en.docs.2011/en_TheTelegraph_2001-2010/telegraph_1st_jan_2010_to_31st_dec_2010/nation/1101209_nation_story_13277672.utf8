          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 8: Prithviraj Chavan today announced a judicial probe by a two-member commission into the Adarsh housing scam, headed by a retired Supreme Court or high court judge.         
	The Maharashtra chief minister made the announcement in the Assembly while replying during a discussion on the scandal.         
	Rejecting the Oppositions demand of a joint legislative committee investigation, he said the commission would probe the case under the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act.         
	According to the available documents, the land on which the 31-storey building stands belongs to the state government but the plot was in possession of defence authorities, the chief minister told the House.         
	The CBI, however, has already started a probe on who holds the ownership of the land, Chavan said.         
	The housing society has allegedly violated the coastal zone regulations. Also, the building was supposed to house Kargil War widows but several high-ranking state officials and as well as former chief minister Ashok Chavans in-laws have been allotted flats.        
	Chavan also promised stringent action against bureaucrats found guilty.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov 26: The Union environment ministry has turned its glare to a proposed 6-million-tonne Jindal steel plant in Orissas Angul district and a city-in-the-making in the Sahyadri hills in Maharashtra, sending notices to both projects.         
	The ministry has sent a notice to Jindal Steel and Power for serious non-compliance of conditions that had been stipulated when it got environmental clearance for its steel and captive power plants in Angul more than three years ago.         
	The ministry has also sent a notice to Lavasa Corporation in Mumbai for violations of environmental impact rules in the early construction of its proposed city nestled in the Sahyadris about an hours drive from Pune.         
	Some of its construction on hills at an altitude higher than 1,000m violates the terms of the clearance issued by the Maharashtra government in March 2004, the ministry said.         
	Jindals proposed project had received environmental clearance in February 2007. But the ministry had stipulated that no construction should begin until approval for 168 hectares of forest land is obtained under the Forest Conservation Act.         
	Last year, forest officials in Angul sent a notice to the company saying construction of storage, roads and foundations for the power plant and a stockyard plant had been started on non-forest government land  and should be stopped until forest clearance is obtained.         
	The ministry has asked Jindal to explain in 15 days why the governments green clearance granted to the company in 2007 should not be revoked.         
	Jindal officials were not available for comment.         
	In its notice to Lavasa, the ministry has asked the company to show cause within 15 days why the structures erected without environmental clearance should not be removed forthwith in entirety.         
	A Lavasa spokesperson said the company had yet to receive a notice.

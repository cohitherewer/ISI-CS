The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 4-leg poll, after Dussehra 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      4-leg poll, after Dussehra 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	Patna, Aug. 24: Bihar will go for a four-phase Assembly poll beginning shortly after Dussehra on October 17 and culminating before mid-November.         
	Preparatory discussions on security deployment and scheduling the elections have been completed. The Election Commission is likely to formally announce the dates later this week, political sources here said.        
	The sense hitherto was that the announcement was being held back for a major campaign rally Congress president Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul, who dictated the go-it-alone line in Bihar, were meant to address in Patna in the last week of August. That rally had to be indefinitely postponed owing to the uncertainty in Sonias plans because of her mothers illness. Congress leaders here say they have received no indication on a new date from the high command and are resigned to hosting the rally after the election code of conduct has been invoked.         
	Although Bihar is the only state to go to the polls this year  which means security forces will not be stretched  there appears to have been a general consensus between the state government, the Centre and the Election Commission that a multi-phase election is unavoidable.         
	Thats mainly on three counts: central paramilitary forces are stretched on account of the strife in Kashmir and anti-Naxalite operations in Bastar and surrounding areas; there is a considerable area in central and south Bihar which itself is Maoist-affected; and the state on the whole has a history of malpractice on polling day.         
	Security forces, therefore, will have to be moved from region to region if there is to be optimal deployment.         
	Bihar is already taken by the first stirrings of campaigning with both major contenders  chief minister Nitish Kumar and chief challenger Lalu Prasad  out on the vote trail and both besieged by ticket-seekers. Nitish is campaigning on a development ticket, making a strong case for being given another term to continue the work his government has done over the past five years. Lalu Prasad is fighting a survival war with an unenviable handicap  he cannot recommend his years in power to the people, for memories of poor governance and decay during the 15 years from 1990 to 2005 still haunt the state.         
	His tack is to blow holes in Nitishs claims of development, but he has been a strangely defensive man so far, seeking forgiveness for mistakes of the past and promising a new, improved Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).         
	We are no more the same lampat (ruffian) party, please note, everyone in RJD will have to behave now, he told The Telegraph. We are changed and disciplined and committed to the real development of Bihar, not the fraud development of Nitish, which is only propaganda on paper.         
	He also spoke of the world fame he achieved as railways minister and said, Let the people of Bihar give me another chance and I shall brighten up the state just like I brightened up the railways, ekdum chaka chak.        
	But Lalu Prasad is well aware that the deficit of his years in power still weighs heavy against him and it wont be easy to convince the electorate of his assurances on good governance and development. That loss of credibility he is attempting to make up for with bits of ragged political engineering. His wooing of former MP Prabhunath Singh, a staunch rival and Rajput strongman from the Saran belt in north Bihar, is part of the effort to erode Nitishs flanks and broaden his own electoral base.         
	It is learnt that Lalu Prasad is also actively soliciting the support of another tainted Rajput chieftain, Anand Mohan Singh, who is known to have considerable influence over upper caste votes in the Kosi region of northeast Bihar.         
	Anand Mohan, who stands convicted for the murder of IAS officer G. Krishnaiyya, is also being pursued by the Nitish camp but has yet to declare his preference.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, May 24: Home minister P. Chidambaram today received what could be interpreted as a public rap on the knuckles by the Prime Minister on issues related to the fight against Maoists.        
	Manmohan Singh said the matter of limited mandate  something Chidambaram had rued during a television interview  would be discussed in the appropriate forum, in an apparent hint that such issues should be kept within the cabinet.        
	The Prime Minister also refused to subscribe in public to the combative policy pursued by the home ministry towards human rights activists.        
	On both counts, Singh did not say anything that is not expected of a Prime Minister but the comments helped the critics of the home ministers policies to underscore their differences with him.        
	 With regard to what has been stated by the home minister, he has explained what he meant by his having a limited mandate. These are issues which are strategy issues which will be discussed in the appropriate forum of the cabinet whenever the opportunity arises, Singh told a news conference held on the occasion of the UPA II governments first anniversary.        
	He maintained that Maoism was Indias biggest security challenge.        
	When the Prime Minister was asked about a possible ban on human rights groups that allegedly speak for the Maoists, he said: There cannot be a ban on human rights groups.        
	He added: India is a democratic country; everyone has a right to air their views. Until and unless these voices are advocating violence, there can be no gag on them.        
	The home ministry had last fortnight issued a veiled warning to activists and writers against speaking for Maoists.        
	Pressure from within the party had forced the home minister to declare that all he had meant by limited mandate was that the Centres mandate in combating the Maoists was limited compared with the states.        
	Singh today said that although law and order is primarily the states responsibility, the Centre must help them in every possible way to face up to the problem which has acquired (such) a magnitude.        
	To a related question, the Prime Minister said: I have spoken to all chief ministers regarding this, and I have no doubt that all of them agree that it is critical to contain Naxalism for the sake of progress.        
	Some civil society groups apparently feel Chidambaram has been treating them on a par with the Maoists, and fear the misuse of the unlawful activities act. Social activist Swami Agnivesh met Chidambaram this evening to ask him on behalf of civil society organisations if the home ministry planned to crack down on them.        
	Many of them are agitated, Swami Agnivesh later told The Telegraph. The home minister has assured me that the act will be used only against people who assist in funding (violence) or incite violence.

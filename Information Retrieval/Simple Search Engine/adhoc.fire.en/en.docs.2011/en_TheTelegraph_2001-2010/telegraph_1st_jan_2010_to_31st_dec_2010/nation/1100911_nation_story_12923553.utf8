          SUJAN DUTTA                          INS Shishumar, an HDW submarine of the Indian Navy                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Its silent arm in danger of going into deep slumber, the navy is asking major submarine-makers to participate in a competition to replenish its fleet.        
	This week the Indian Navy sent requests for information (RFI)  the precursor to a global tender  for a second-line of six conventional attack submarines.         
	The submarine fleet of the navy that officially has 15 boats could be down to just half-a-dozen by the end of next year because they are being retired faster than the government can acquire new vessels and also because the procurement through a deal with France has fallen way behind schedule.        
	The Indian Navy seeks to maintain a submarine fleet that is capable of operating in an environment where adversarial (Chinese and Pakistani) vessels often intrude into waters around the country, tracking its ships and picking up and recording their electronic signatures.         
	The RFI has asked manufacturers for details of contemporary submarines that are already in service or on sea trials and are capable of operating in dense ASW (anti-submarine warfare) and EW (electronic warfare) environment.         
	The manufacturers have been asked to give the information by the end of this month.        
	The first-line of new submarines are the Scorpenes that are being bought from DCNS Armaris (a Franco-Spanish) venture.         
	Four of the six submarines under the 2005 contract are to be made through transfer of technology in Mazgaon Docks in Mumbai. But the $3.6-billion deal is in rough waters with the delivery of components delayed, the assembly line construction tardy and with the French having asked for the cost to be escalated to upwards of $6 billion.         
	The delivery of the Scorpenes was to begin from this year but now it looks unlikely before 2012.        
	The contract for the Scorpenes had a provision for further orders. But the navy has decided against ordering from the same maker under the same contract because of the cost and time overruns.         
	Among the likely competitors are  the navy is expecting  Russias Rubin Design Bureau, Germanys HDW (which was blacklisted in the past but is now cleared to compete), Swedens Kockums and DCNS Armaris. Along with transfer of technology, the cost of the second-line could be up to $10 billion or more.        
	The navy is also expecting the Russian-build Nerpa nuclear submarine to join its fleet by January 2011. There is no official word on the nuclear submarine that is being taken on a 10-year lease, the second time since the navy had the INS Chakra (also on lease from Russia) in the mid-1980s.         
	Indias own nuclear submarine (the INS Arihant), unveiled last year, is due for sea trials next year. The current submarine fleet is officially stated to comprise 10 Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 21: A senior Maoist leader who oversaw operations in the Triple U region of Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Uttar (north) Bihar was arrested today in Calcutta.        
	Musafir Sahni, 53, a postgraduate in physics who used the aliases of Alok and Nishant, was nabbed during a joint operation by Calcutta and Bihar police.        
	Sources described Musafir, a zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist), as a big catch.        
	He also supplied arms and ammunition to the outfit in other states, said a Bengal police officer.        
	The rebel leader, who was also the secretary of the Maoists simant (border) regional committee, carried a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head.        
	Musafir was wanted in over two dozen cases of violence in Vaishali, East Champaran, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi districts of Bihar.        
	Bihars additional director-general of police (headquarters), P.K. Thakur, said a team from the Champaran force had been sent to Calcutta following a tip-off that Musafir was in the city.        
	He was arrested near the intersection of Raja Subodh Mullick Square and Creek Row in central Calcutta, where police teams were lying in wait. The police are, however, yet to ascertain why Musafir came to Calcutta.        
	We suspect he came either to collect ammunition or meet other leaders of the outfit, said an officer of Bengals special task force. Or perhaps he came to take shelter in Calcutta since no case is registered against him in Bengal.        
	The rebel leader has been taken to Patna on a four-day transit remand.        
	Police sources said he had masterminded an attack on a police station in Madhuban in East Champaran district on June 23, 2005, in which five people, among them two policemen, were killed. He was also allegedly involved in attacks on banks at Jandaha in Vaishali and Righa in Sitamarhi district.        
	Musafir, who is from Vaishali, is said to have helped strengthen the base of the CPI (Maoist) in north Bihar. After the killing of Maoist leader Naimuddin in East Champaran, Musafir became commander of the outfit.        
	Musafir had done his MSc in physics from R.N. College in Hajipur. He joined the Maoist movement about a decade ago after being assaulted by a co-villager from an upper caste. His son Babloo too later joined the organisation.        
	Father and son were expelled from the outfit for a brief period on the charge of misappropriating Rs 15 lakh collected from a businessman. They were later re-admitted.        
	Musafir is being interrogated by senior officers, ADG Thakur said, adding that he would be produced in court after questioning.

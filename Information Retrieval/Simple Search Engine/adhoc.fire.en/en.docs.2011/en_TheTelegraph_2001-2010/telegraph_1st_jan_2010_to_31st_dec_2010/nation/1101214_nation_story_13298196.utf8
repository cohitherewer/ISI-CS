          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 13: The Andhra Pradesh government today withdrew criminal cases filed against students involved in the Telangana protests, after a years delay.        
	However, not all cases were withdrawn, with the government differentiating between simple cases and serious offences. In all, 565 cases filed between December 2009 and September 2010 were taken back.        
	The move comes at a time the government is bracing for disturbances following the submission of the Justice Srikrishna Committee report on Telangana on December 31.        
	Home minister Sabita Indra Reddy informed the Assembly that the 565 cases withdrawn involved 2,436 students of all regions. Of these, 440 cases involving 1,011 people were from the Telangana region alone. A total of 1,667 cases were filed against 8,047 people during the period.        
	Amid protests in the house by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti and other Opposition parties for not releasing all the students unconditionally, as agreed by Union home minister P. Chidambaram on December 9 last year, the minister said the government could not shirk its responsibility of maintaining law and order and protecting the lives and property of citizens.        
	We have classified the cases into two categories with the first consisting of simple cases like road and rail rokos, violation of prohibitory orders, making provocative statements instigating violence, attempt to commit suicide and insulting national leaders by garlanding their statues with objectionable material. The second category of cases includes serious offences like damage and burning of government and private properties and assault on public servants, she said.        
	The government has decided to withdraw all simple cases in the interest of career prospects of youth and students.         
	Reddy also pointed out that at the time Chidambaram made the promise a year ago, only about 400 cases were registered. But we took the cases registered subsequently also into consideration and studied each case thoroughly. We have taken legal opinion before withdrawing the cases, she added.        
	Chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, who intervened in the debate, voiced peoples concern over expected disturbances in the state after December 31. We are all for the welfare of students and the pending cases will be studied case by case and effort made to get them out of legal bindings as early as possible, he said.        
	However, Opposition leaders claimed that cases against criminals, militants and politicians have been withdrawn in the past and questioned the undue diligence in the case of students.        
	Jayaprakash Narayan, president of Lok Satta and an MLA, said over 8,000 cases were withdrawn after the assassination of Kapu leader Ranga, nearly 14,000 cases were withdrawn after Indira Gandhis assassination and about 7,000 cases after Rajiv Gandhis assassination.         
	Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu wanted all cases withdrawn immediately to protect the future of students.        
	The leader of the MIM (Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen), Akbaruddin Owaisi, pointed out that cases were framed against 427 boys from the community. These included some cases relating to communal riots. Why is nobody bothering about Muslim boys, they are also from Telangana, he said.        
	Amid the protests, the House adjourned without conducting any business for the third day. The Assembly is being run by the deputy Speaker since the Congress high command has yet to decide on the appointments of Speaker, deputy chief minister and state Congress president.

	Mumbai, Nov 18: A fire spread up the electrical wiring to the top of a nine-storey commercial building in Mumbais Bandra this afternoon, but timely evacuation ensured that no one inside was injured.        
	The Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) building has offices of other companies such as DHL, DHFL, Standard Chartered Bank and Religare too.        
	Chief fire officer Uday Tatkare said the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained but promised a complete report in three days. At least 16 fire engines, six ladders and eight tankers battled the fire for over four hours, with one fireman suffering minor injuries.        
	The fire began around 1pm on the second floor and caused the worst damage to the ninth floor, whose acrylic roof collapsed. But by then, the about 200 employees in the office had been evacuated.        
	The electric supply was cut off and there was some amount of panic. But we were rushed down through the fire escape, said Sameer Iswalkar, an architect with HDIL.        
	The 32-year-old watched in silence as he tried to ascertain the damage to his work. I was working on at least 15 to 20 projects. The drawings, blueprints and all the data of buildings new and old have gone up in flames, he said.        
	HDIL, one of the top realtors in the country, was the title sponsor for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPLs Season 1 before pulling out in the next season because of the economic slowdown.        
	Residents of the nearby Behrampada slums came out to help with evacuation and rescue operations.        
	We saw the fire break out and rushed with fire extinguishers. We tried to use the pump at the building but the water ran out within five minutes. Our boys rescued people from the basement; some of them suffered minor injuries while breaking the glass to help people out, said Asif Khan, a slum resident.        
	People gathered on the Bandra skywalk, which runs across one side of the building, to take a closer look at the dark smoke billowing out. The road was cordoned off.

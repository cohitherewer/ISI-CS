The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister in BCCI? HC has questions
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minister in BCCI? HC has questions

	Mumbai, April 26 (PTI): Bombay High Court today asked the Maharashtra government whether any conflict of interests arose if a minister was part of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or any other sports body.        
	Although the court did not name any individual, the reference was apparently to Union minister and former BCCI chief Sharad Pawar. It asked the state to file a reply whether there was any code of conduct for ministers in this context.        
	The bench was hearing a PIL filed by Shiv Sena MLA Subhash Desai, who alleged that the government was not collecting entertainment tax from the IPL despite deciding to levy the tax in January.        
	The court asked the state if any decision had been taken on this.        
	At the previous hearing, the division bench of Justices P.B. Majumdar and Rajesh Ketkar had wanted to know about the constitution of the cricket body.         
	Today, the court grilled BCCI lawyer Raju Subramaniam on whether a minister could be a functionary of the cricket body.        
	Would it be moral? Would a conflict of interests arise if a minister is the head of a sports association? the court asked.        
	Subramaniam said he could not comment on this but added that the BCCI constitution did not stop any minister from contesting its election.        
	The reply is to be filed before May 5.        
	On the issue of entertainment tax, Subramaniam said the BCCI would pay the tax if the government levied it.        
	However, the lawyer said that except for the final, semi-finals and the play-off for the third position, tickets were not sold by the BCCI or the IPL but by the franchisees, and the cricket body would not be liable for tax owed by them.        
	Government lawyer D. Nalavade said the state government had waived entertainment tax on all sporting activities in 1964.        
	But the government now intends to withdraw the exemption because these (the IPL) are not just sporting activities, he said.         
	Nalvade added that a policy was needed for all sporting events where entertainment was a primary element.        
	However, the judges remarked that now that the IPL was over, it would be difficult to recover entertainment tax in retrospect.        
	The damage that is done is unpardonable, the judges said.

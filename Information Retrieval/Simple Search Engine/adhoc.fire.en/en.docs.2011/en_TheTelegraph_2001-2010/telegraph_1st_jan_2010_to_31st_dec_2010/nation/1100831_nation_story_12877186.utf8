          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        The Charminar    
	Hyderabad, Aug. 30: Part of a Charminar minaret came off following heavy rain last night, creating panic among Ramazan shoppers and reinforcing a heritage campaigners case that vehicular and noise pollution have weakened the 419-year-old structure.        
	Good heavens, it happened during Ramazan or else it would have triggered a riot (as someone could have sniffed a conspiracy), said Parameswar Goyal, a jeweller in Pathergatti, a stones throw from the Charminar.        
	Traffic came to a standstill in the old city, where the monument is located, after the 10.30pm incident with rumours rife that the Charminar was in danger.         
	The chunk that came off was part of the stucco floral decoration on the minaret. B. Prasad Rao, the police inspector in charge of the Charminar police station area, said the pieces fell on the shed of a temple located partially inside the monument. Some of the debris also hit a car, Rao said. No one was injured.        
	An official of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), responsible for the Charminars upkeep, said after a visit to the site that the monument was safe.

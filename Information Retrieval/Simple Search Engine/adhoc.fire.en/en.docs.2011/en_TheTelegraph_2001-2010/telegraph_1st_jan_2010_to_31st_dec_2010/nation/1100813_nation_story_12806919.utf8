The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Foreign fairs to draw college teachers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Foreign fairs to draw college teachers
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: A government panel to examine the shortage of teachers in higher education has suggested a multi-pronged strategy to solve the problem, including organising fairs in India and abroad to attract talent.        
	Such fairs should be directed at the sizeable number of Indian students pursuing research abroad who may be keen to come back and teach, the panel has said. It pointed out that China has experimented with the idea successfully, and concluded that it could well help solve the dearth of faculty in India to a great extent.        
	The proposal is among the many suggestions by the five-member task force, headed by IIT Kanpur director S.G. Dhande, in its interim report to the Union HRD ministry, which had set up the committee in September last year.         
	The recommendations are for all higher educational institutions, including IITs, IIMs, central universities, state universities and colleges. Even private institutes are covered.        
	Another key proposal is for a special cell in each institution to oversee recruitment and promotion of teachers and to enhance their motivation levels, official sources told The Telegraph.        
	The panel has said contractual appointment of teachers  a bone of contention in many institutes can continue but the strength of such teachers should not exceed 25 per cent of the total. At present, most private institutions survive on contractual hiring.         
	Visiting teachers and international adjunct faculty can be engaged, as can scientists of research labs and managers of companies on part-time basis as they are experts in their fields and can contribute immensely to teaching, the committee has said.         
	It also mooted a best higher education award, both at the national and state levels, to reward outstanding teachers.        
	Regulatory agencies such as the All India Council of Technical Education, University Grants Commission, National Council of Teachers Education and the Medical Council of India should give approval to institutions if they are found to have adequate teachers.        
	Alternatively, accreditation agencies like the National Assessment and Accreditation Council and National Board for Accreditation should consider the faculty strength before giving recognition to an institute, the panel said.        
	The panel also touched on a grey area: exploitation of reputable academics names. It has proposed that such misuse should be considered a malpractice and action taken against such institutions. Many private institutions issue ads highlighting the names of certain academicians who may not have links to them.        
	The Faculty Induction Development Cell  the name proposed for the special units in all institutions  should be headed by a senior faculty member. It should conduct teacher appointments and oversee promotions. Faculty strength and recruitment plans should be disclosed on institutes websites, the panel said.         
	Chairs (endowment professorships) devoted to teaching and research should be started in public-private partnerships.         
	The panel consulted a number of institutions and academics before preparing the interim report. Its final report, expected in December, will suggest an objective and transparent performance-appraisal system for faculty.        
	Even the IITs, IIMs and central universities are grappling with teacher shortages.         
	The seven old IITs now have 2,983 teachers against the sanctioned strength of 4,267. The figure is 388 at the seven IIMs. They should have 468 teachers.

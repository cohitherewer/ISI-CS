          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 20: Former junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor today aggressively defended his decision to resign from the council of ministers, rejecting allegations that the move implied guilt.         
	Explaining his resignation in a statement to the Lok Sabha, Tharoor insisted that his conscience was clear and that he had done nothing improper or unethical, let alone illegal and dubbed the allegations levelled by the Opposition parties against him fanciful and malicious.         
	Tharoor peppered his statement with references to his love for Kerala, and quoted legendary poet Vallathol Narayana Menon to insist that my heart swells with pride for India and Keralite blood throbs in my veins.         
	But his statement did not draw united support even from the treasury benches, with many Congress MPs and government ministers sitting stoically unmoved.         
	Tharoor said he had requested the Prime Minister to investigate the allegations levelled against him of misusing his office to swing a sweat equity for close friend Sunanda Pushkar on an IPL consortium he mentored.         
	He said he had resigned because he was aware that the controversy surrounding him was distracting the government and stalling Parliament proceedings.         
	He had no desire to be an embarrassment to the government, he added and thanked supporters from the state, his constituency and the country.         
	He thanked the Prime Minister and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi for giving him an opportunity to serve the country.         
	He said he returned to India because he believes in an India of hard work, openness, pluralism, freedom and hope for the downtrodden.         
	This is the vision with which the voters of Thiruvananthapuram sent me to sit in your midst, he said.         
	Tharoor also took a dig at IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, without mentioning his name, saying that he believed in an India where opportunities are available to all and not just to a chosen few.                    
	Tharoor has been arguing that Modi was biased against the consortium that bid for the Kochi IPL team and had tried to rig the bidding in favour of other industrial groups.

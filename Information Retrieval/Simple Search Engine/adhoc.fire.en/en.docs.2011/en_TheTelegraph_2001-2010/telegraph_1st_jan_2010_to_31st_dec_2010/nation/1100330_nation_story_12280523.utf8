The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBSE sets global target 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBSE sets global target 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           The CBSE board logo                                  
	New Delhi, March 29: The Central Board of Secondary Education plans to launch an international curriculum hoping to attract schools in foreign countries and compete with other global bodies like the Cambridge and International Baccalaureate systems.         
	There are already 45 schools outside India that are affiliated to the CBSE and they currently study the same curriculum taught in schools here affiliated to the board.         
	Under the new plan, unveiled by CBSE chairman Vineet Joshi today, schools outside India will be offered a choice of the current board curriculum taught here and the international curriculum.         
	The idea is to use the new curriculum to reach out to foreign schools that are interested in the CBSE but fear that the current curriculum is too focused on India to cater to the needs of their students.         
	At present, only 25 schools that are already affiliated to the CBSE have signed up for the international curriculum. These schools are based in Muscat, Dubai, Qatar and Singapore and mainly cater to Indian students there.         
	In time, we hope the reach of CBSE International will expand, Joshi said.         
	The international curriculum will offer greater flexibility than the Indian version.         
	Unlike the curriculum taught here, the international version will divide the math syllabus into two components  core and elective  and students not keen on the subject can skip elective math.         
	In the social sciences, students will not necessarily have to learn Indian history or geography and can instead opt for a syllabus more in tune with their local surroundings.         
	The move comes even as global degrees like those offered by the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge International Examinations gain popularity in India.         
	If the international syllabus is popular in foreign schools, it may also be introduced as an option in Indian schools later, sources said.         
	The CBSE hopes to leverage cheaper affiliating costs to try and beat the international boards.

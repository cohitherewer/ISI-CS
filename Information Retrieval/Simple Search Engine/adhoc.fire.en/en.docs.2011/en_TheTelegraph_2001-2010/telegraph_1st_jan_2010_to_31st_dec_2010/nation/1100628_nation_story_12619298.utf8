	Dhaka, June 27 (PTI): Life in Bangladesh was crippled today by a nation-wide Opposition strike, called against the governments policies and its deals with India that compromised national interests, including an agreement on terrorism.        
	Vehicles were off the roads and schools and shopping malls remained closed across the country as hundreds of paramilitary troops and policemen patrolled Dhakas streets, often clashing with cadres of the main Opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.        
	The dawn-to-dusk general strike is part of a campaign by the BNP, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, against the ruling Awami Leagues alleged misrule.        
	The BNP has accused the government of compromising national interests by inking deals with India during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajeds New Delhi visit in January.        
	The three agreements relate to a joint fight against terror  with Bangladesh promising not to allow its soil to be used for terrorism against India  a $1-billion line of credit to Dhaka from New Delhi, and 250MW of power to Bangladesh from Indias central grid.        
	The former Khaleda government is said to have sheltered many of the leaders of Indias northeastern insurgent outfits, and turned a blind eye to anti-India activities by Islamist terror groups.         
	After Hasina came to power, Dhaka has unofficially handed over several northeastern militant leaders wanted by India.

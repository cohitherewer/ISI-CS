          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 11: Adding a new twist to the ongoing cold war between the state government and the Orissa Medical Services Association, government doctors part of the association today threatened to go on strike from April 18 demanding the implementation of Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DACP).        
	The doctors have decided not to admit patients to surgical units from April 12.        
	The medicos, in a high-level meeting today, have also decided to approach the state administrative tribunal against the order of mass transfer by the government.         
	Health minister Prasanna Kumar Acharya on Friday had ordered the mass transfer of 159 medicos who had completed six years of service at one place. Those transferred include Orissa Medical Services Association president Madhusudhan Mishra, who has been has been transferred to Sundergarh from Bhubaneswar-based Capital hospital.         
	The executive committee is certainly disturbed by the recent developments. What is not understood is the haste with which the government transferred so many doctors. We have decided to continue with the agitation, Mishra said.         
	Some of the doctors transferred have not yet completed six years of service. The senior doctors are being sent to the interiors and young doctors have been transferred to cities, Mishra rued.         
	As per a previous high court judgement, no union leaders can be transferred. We will challenge this order.         
	The association members have been threatening mass resignation for some time, unless their 19-point charter of demands is met.        
	The demands include, among other things, implementation of DACP as recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission and cadre restructuring. In March, the association had postponed its agitation by a month after the health minister assured action on their demands at the earliest. The association has been arguing that six states have already implemented the DACP in their states and Orissa should follow.         
	In the past the state had invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act to stop agitating doctors.

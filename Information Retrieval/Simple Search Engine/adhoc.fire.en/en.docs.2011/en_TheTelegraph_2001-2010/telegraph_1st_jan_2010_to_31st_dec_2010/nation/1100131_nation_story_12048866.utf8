The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rs 1-lakh rider to bail after public asset damage 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rs 1-lakh rider to bail after public asset damage 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Students set a vehicle on fire at a pro-Telangana protest. File picture                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 30: Andhra Pradesh High Court has passed a landmark order to nudge students away from violent protests, asking a Telangana agitator to deposit Rs 1 lakh as compensation for damage to public property if he wants bail.        
	The single-judge benchs order to college boy Mallikarjun yesterday came less than a year after the high court held political parties liable to pay damages for loss of property during bandhs and demonstrations.        
	Justice B. Chandrakumar made it clear that the intermediate student, arrested for violence during the Telangana agitation, must shell out this sum over and above the bail bond. He did not fix the bail surety amount, which is usually around Rs 5,000.        
	Lawyers said Mallikarjun would lose the Rs 1-lakh deposit if he was later found guilty but would probably get it back if acquitted of violence but added they were not entirely sure because the order was unprecedented.        
	Mallikarjun has been in a Hyderabad jail for 37 days after he and other students of his college (affiliated to Osmania University) in Mahboobnagar went on the rampage on December 10.        
	Police had shown footage of students throwing stones and torching buses to successfully oppose his bail application in the trial court, following which he had appealed in the high court.        
	Mallikarjuns lawyer told the high court its order would set a dangerous precedent, and that his client wasnt rich enough to pay it anyway. The student is from a family of petty traders and farmers and is studying on a social welfare scholarship. The judge later adjourned the bail hearing to Monday.        
	The government had arrested 310 students in connection with the Telangana protests but let off 298 without booking them in cases. Of the remaining 12, eight have got bail from the lower courts and four, including Mallikarjun, are in jail.        
	Also yesterday, a division bench of Chief Justice Anil R. Dave and Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy asked the state government if it had registered cases and started proceedings against political parties involved in violent demonstrations, and whether it had recovered damages from them.        
	Last month, the bench had told the government to formulate guidelines within three weeks to recover damages from political parties for property destruction, both in the coastal Andhra and Telangana regions.        
	Why has the state government not taken our directions seriously and (not) framed charges against the political parties responsible for such violence? the chief justice asked the government counsel. The bench was hearing a petition by a lawyer, Mohammed Adam, who said several private and public vehicles were burnt or damaged across the state during the two-month-old agitation.        
	A media release from the police had, during the height of the Telangana protests, said nearly Rs 35 crore worth of public and private properties  including buses, government offices, shops and stalls  had been damaged or destroyed.        
	After the high court last year held political parties responsible for damage to property during protests and bandhs, the state government had filed cases against the BJP, Telangana Rashtra Samiti, Telugu Desam and the Majlis-e-Ittehad Muslimeen. All the cases are pending and no penalty or costs have been assessed.        
	No cases have been registered against any party so far in connection with the violence over Telangana statehood.        
	Possibly the only instance of political parties paying damages in India came in December 2008 when the BJP and the Shiv Sena coughed up Rs 20 lakh each for the financial loss caused to Mumbai citizens during a 2003 bandh. Bombay High Court had passed the order in July 2004.        
	Andhra Pradesh High Court has in recent years taken a strong stand against disruptive protests. In 2008, it ordered striking junior doctors of government hospitals back to work because the poor were suffering.        
	Earlier, the government was told not to allow demonstrations on busy thoroughfares but to confine all protests to a designated zone.        
	Yesterday, hearing another petition, Justice T. Gopalakrishna of the high court ordered local TV channels not to telecast gory visuals of dead bodies or scenes of violence against women and children, or of people destroying property or committing suicide. They were also asked not to beam provocative or objectionable speeches and debates.

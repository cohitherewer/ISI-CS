The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anand seat in doubt
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Anand seat in doubt
                            
	New Delhi, June 4: Union commerce minister Anand Sharmas wait for a Rajya Sabha nomination will get longer as his name is missing from the Maharashtra list announced by the party today.         
	There was speculation that Sharma would be accommodated from the state, but Sonia Gandhi preferred two local candidates. Media baron Vijay Darda has been re-nominated. The other is Avinash Pandey. Information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni was re-nominated from Punjab and general secretary Mohsina Kidwai was given a ticket from Chhattisgarh.         
	Sources said Sharma, who hails from Himachal Pradesh, would eventually be accommodated. There is still scope for his nomination in this round itself from Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh.

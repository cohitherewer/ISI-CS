          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish Kumar with the Dalai Lama in Dharamshala on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Feb. 8: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today met the Dalai Lama at Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh and formally invited him to inaugurate the grand Buddha Memorial Park being built at an estimated cost of Rs 125 crore here.        
	The park, likely to be completed by April-May, is being built to commemorate the 2550th year of Siddharth Gautam Buddha attaining enlightenment at Bodh Gaya.        
	Working to improve the tourist destinations in Bihar, the chief minister is apparently hard-selling the spots and heritage related to Buddha.         
	The Buddha Memorial Park, which will have a meditation hall, is coming up at the site where the Bankipore central jail near Patna junction station once situated. The place was vacant since the jail was shifted to Beur on the outskirts of Patna.        
	Over 30,000 visitors from across the globe, including the US, Australia, Canada, England and other western countries, besides the Buddhist one assembled at Bodh Gaya in January to listen to the five-day world peace discourse of the Dalai Lama.        
	Sources close to the chief minister said the Dalai Lamas power to attract such a huge number of foreign tourists might have inspired Nitish to invite the Tibetan spiritual leader in exile for the inauguration of the park.

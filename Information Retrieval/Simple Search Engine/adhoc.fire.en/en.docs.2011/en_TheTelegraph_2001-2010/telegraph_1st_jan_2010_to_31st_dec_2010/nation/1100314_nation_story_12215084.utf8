The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clueless cops blame Pune bakery staff
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Clueless cops blame Pune bakery staff
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, March 13: A month after the Pune blast, the police, with little headway to show, have blamed the utter negligence of German Bakery staff for the terror strike that killed 17.        
	Investigations have revealed that the unclaimed backpack containing the bomb had been lying at the popular caf for nearly 90 minutes, Pune police commissioner Satyapal Singh said. He slammed Bakery staff for failing to pay attention to it.        
	The backpack was noticed by Nepali employee Paras just before it exploded.        
	It (the bag) lay there for not 10 or 15 minutes but more than one-and-a-half hours, and yet nobody bothered to notice it, he told a peace rally organised by a social foundation to mark one month after the blast.        
	The Pune police chief added that some customers had informed cashier Praveen Pant about the suspicious bag. Singh claimed the cashier neither did anything about it nor informed the police.        
	Singh said the improvised explosive device, containing a mix of RDX, ammonium nitrate, and petro-hydrocarbon oil, exploded 20 minutes after Pant was informed.        
	If the German Bakery employees and its patrons had been more alert and had they informed the police, the blast could have been averted, he said.        
	The police have claimed they had written to the caf on October 13, 2009, asking them to follow security guidelines. One specific suggestion was that in the case of any suspicious, unclaimed baggage, the staff should evacuate the place, surround the baggage with sandbags and promptly seek police assistance.        
	German Bakery manager Gopal Kharkee said it was not proper to blame his staff.        
	We are trained to make and sell bread and cakes. We cannot read the faces of our patrons. Many of our customers are Osho disciples who are into meditation. Every day, at least two or three people forget their bags. We even created a lost-and-found baggage counter. It is wrong to blame us. But now that we know there is a threat, we will take adequate security measures, he said.        
	The explosion, the first major terror attack in India since 26/11, killed nine people on the spot besides wounding 60. Since the backpack was kept below a table, several of the injured suffered severe wounds below the waist, leading to limb amputations. The death toll later rose to 17.        
	A month on, Kharkee and German Bakery owner Smita Kharose are still waiting for the police to hand over the premises so they can reopen the caf.        
	I phoned the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) officers yesterday, but they are not saying when they would give back the place. It will cost us a lot of money to reopen it as almost everything is destroyed, Kharkee said.         
	The Kharose family has asked the government for Rs 25 lakh in compensation but it is yet to arrive, Kharkee said.        
	The police have so far questioned over 140 suspects, but no arrests have been made or any sketches released. K.P. Raghuvanshi, the state ATS chief, refused to reveal anything about the investigation.        
	The particular mix of explosives has been used before in several blasts by the Indian Mujahideen, and the group continues to be the prime suspect.

	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Electronic cigarettes that use battery power to generate nicotine vapours and are touted by their sellers as safer than traditional cigarettes may also pose health risks, medical researchers have cautioned.         
	US-based researchers have said that virtually nothing is known about the chemicals in the aerosolised vapours produced in e-cigarettes, and that there is no evidence to suggest they are safer than conventional cigarettes, which burn nicotine.         
	Their assessment of e-cigarettes, published this month in Tobacco Control, a medical journal, comes at a time the market for e-cigarettes, according to distributors, is growing fast in India.         
	A number of e-cigarette kits imported or assembled by local companies are sold directly to end-users and delivered via couriers. A Chennai-based company that sells in southern India plans to appoint stockists in Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai.         
	People who want to quit smoking or try a nicotine-based alternative to smoking will be our primary market, said Ayush Jain whose Delhi-based company is assembling e-cigarettes with components procured from Taiwan and liquid nicotine from China.         
	Manufacturers are promoting e-cigarettes as safer products that recreate the experience of smoking without the worry of the harmful side-effects. In e-cigarettes, an atomiser produces vapours from liquid nicotine but these vapours makeup and properties have not been studied yet.        
	 There are virtually no scientific studies on e-cigarettes and their safety, said Prue Talbot, a professor of cell biology at the University of California, Riverside, and the co-author of the study.         
	The study found that batteries, atomisers, packs and instruction manuals lacked information about e-cigarette content or use, and did not provide essential warnings. It found that liquid nicotine leaked from some e-cigarette cartridges and that manufacture and quality control remained largely unregulated.         
	Contrary to claims by manufacturers and marketers about e-cigarettes being safe, virtually nothing is known about the toxicity of vapours generated by e-cigarettes, said Kamlesh Asotra, a research administrator for cardiovascular diseases at the University of California Tobacco Related Disease Research Programme.         
	When a smoker draws air through an e-cigarette, an airflow sensor activates the battery, heating the atomiser enough to vaporise a solution of nicotine and propylene glycol. When inhaled, the vapour delivers a dose of nicotine into the smokers lungs.         
	Earlier this year, Talbot and researchers Anna Trtchounian and Monique Williams found out that generally e-cigarettes demanded stronger vacuum or suction to smoke than conventional cigarettes. The effects of this (strong suction) on human health could be adverse, they wrote.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul to visit Bihar on Feb. 1
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul to visit Bihar on Feb. 1
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul: Bihar waiting                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Congress leader Rahul Gandhis much-awaited visit to Bihar, delayed by unbridled factional fights in the partys state unit, will finally happen on February 1.        
	Rahul will interact with groups of students, youth, Dalits, backwards and minorities separately during his two-day visit.         
	While the AICC general secretary will address conventions of Dalits, backwards and minorities in Sasaram, Rohtas and Kishanganj, he will interact with students in Darbhangas Lalit Narain Mishra University and Patna Womens College.         
	The BJP kicked up major controversies during his visits to universities in Madhya Pradesh and Goa but he is continuing with his programme to contact youth on campuses. His focus will be youth and students as the primary purpose of his visit is to support the ongoing enrolment drive for the Youth Congress.        
	Rahul will also meet party leaders at the PCC headquarters, Sadaqat Ashram, on February 1 evening and state leaders are curiously waiting for his advice to the faction-ridden organisation.         
	Sources said the dissidents are firm on their demand for removal of PCC president Anil Sharma and may bluntly convey this to Rahul. The dissidents, which include 10 MLAs, a few MLCs, three former PCC presidents and a large number of middle-rung leaders, may reach Delhi on February 3 and submit their resignation from the PCC executive. These leaders are refusing to work with Sharma and have even been planning to split the party before the Assembly elections if the state leadership was not changed.         
	Rahul will start his visit from Champaran, which is associated with Mahatma Gandhis civil disobedience movement. Rahul will also go to Gaya and Bhagalpur to attend functions there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Name game nudge to govt

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar has written to all central ministers asking them not to indiscriminately name programmes and schemes after past national leaders, particularly Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.        
	The confidential note, dated October 6, says the cabinet secretary was directed to convey to the ministers that there is a need to be sparing and selective in associating names of national leaders with such programmes to prevent proliferation of such nomenclature.        
	Since Chandrasekhar could have been directed by the Prime Minister alone, the note raised a few eyebrows. But sources said Manmohan Singh could not have taken the step without Sonia Gandhis concurrence. They said Sonia too was against the indiscriminate use of these leaders names.        
	After a recent controversy when the surface transport ministry used Sonias pictures on signboards along national highways, she herself wrote to the minister advising him against such a practice.        
	While governments in Congress-ruled states such as Andhra Pradesh have named hundreds of sundry schemes after Indira and Rajiv, even Union ministries have been competing to name programmes after them, presuming this would please Sonia.        
	In August last year, The Telegraph had reported that 175 schemes had been named in India after a Nehru-Gandhi.        
	While Congress leaders do like it when big and prestigious projects are named after Indira or Rajiv, some have complained that the random use of their names was proving counter-productive.        
	Many small projects were started in the names of Indira and Rajiv and not properly carried out, a government official said, suggesting that this failure may have got associated with the Congress icons names.        
	The cabinet secretarys letter reflects this sentiment. It says: As you are aware, a number of programmes under execution in the country are named after national leaders, particularly Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.... This practice has become widespread and indiscriminate. This reduces the value of identifying programmes with national figures, particularly as implementation and impact of many of these programmes are not always as (they) ought to be.        
	It adds: As such, many of them do not merit such association.        
	Some of the major central programmes named after Nehru-Gandhis include the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Indira Awas Yojana and the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vikas Yojana.        
	But there is also a glut of smaller programmes, some of which have failed to take off, named after Indira and Rajiv.        
	Some of these are: the Rajiv Gandhi National Water Mission, Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship Scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitrak Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Creche Scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme and the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojna.

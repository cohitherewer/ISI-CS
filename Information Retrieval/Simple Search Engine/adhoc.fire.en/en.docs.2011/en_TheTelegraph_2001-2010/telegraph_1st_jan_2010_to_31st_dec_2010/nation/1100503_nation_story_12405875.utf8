The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bodo boss held

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, May 2: Ranjan Daimary, the man behind Assams most terrifying blasts, has landed in custody, raising hopes for the governments attempts at restoring peace in the Bodo belt through talks.         
	Daimary alias D.R. Nabla, 50, the founder of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), was handed over by Bangladesh to the BSF at Dawki in Meghalaya yesterday. The government may now try to get Daimary, leader of the NDFBs anti-talks faction, to the negotiating table.        
	Sooner or later we need him to join the ongoing peace process between the Centre and the NDFB, a police source said. Although the Centre has begun a dialogue with an NDFB faction, any talks without the Daimary faction is unlikely to ensure lasting peace. A section of armed NDFB cadres are under Daimarys control and they still have a nuisance value.        
	Daimary is wanted in several cases, including the serial blasts of October 30, 2008. He is said to be a father of two.        
	Daimary was remanded in 12 days police custody by a magistrate this evening.        
	No lawyer appeared on his behalf, with the Guwahati Lawyers Association having decided not to represent anyone involved in the October 30 blasts. The decision was later endorsed by the All Assam Lawyers Association.

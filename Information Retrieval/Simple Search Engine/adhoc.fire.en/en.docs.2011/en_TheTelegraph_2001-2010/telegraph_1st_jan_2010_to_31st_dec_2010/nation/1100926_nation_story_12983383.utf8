          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        A guard near the Games Village in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)      
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Heads have begun to roll in the Suresh Kalmadi-headed Commonwealth Games Organising Committee with one of his handpicked officials being shown the door.         
	The cabinet secretarys office today sacked Manish Kumar, head of press operations, for alleged irregularities in issuing security passes to journalists covering the event and obstructing government officials from doing their work.         
	Senior government officials charged Kumar with obstructing the Press Information Bureaus work of issuing accreditation passes to some journalists resulting in delays. Irregularities were also reported against him in selecting journalists who would get the passes. He also allegedly delayed work at the press centre.         
	Kumar, who is also a deputy director general of the committee, is one of several officials that Kalmadi had handpicked from the private sector to work for the organising committee.         
	He was asked to explain his questionable conduct at a high-level meeting today morning chaired by Ajit Seth, secretary (co-ordination) in the cabinet secretariat.         
	The sources said an altercation ensued between the government officials and Kumar at the meeting.         
	Kumar, however, claimed later that he was very much there (in the committee). I am very much part of the OC, he repeated.        
	A colleague at the organising committee said Kumar was made a scapegoat because he had complained several times about the Press Information Bureaus lackadaisical attitude about issuing passes.         
	Jiji Thomson, a 1980 batch IAS officer, has been selected to head the Games press operations. Thomson was till now in charge of catering and transport for athletes.

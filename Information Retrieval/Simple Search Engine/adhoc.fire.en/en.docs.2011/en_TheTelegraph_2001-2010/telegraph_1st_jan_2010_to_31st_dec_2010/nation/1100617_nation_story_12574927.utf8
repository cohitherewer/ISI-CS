  - $5.5m party drug seized at airport        OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                                                   
	June 16: Two persons from Calcutta have been arrested on the charge of trying to smuggle into Bangkok 63kg of a party drug, the biggest such seizure since the Suvarnabhumi airport started operations in 2006.        
	Joy Chakraborty, 30, and Abhijit Roy, 28, reached the Thai capital yesterday on a Jet Airways flight from Calcutta. According to agency reports, the value of the ketamine consignment has been put at $5.5 million (Rs 25.3 crore).        
	Agency reports quoted the Thai authorities as saying they got suspicious when the duo tried to pass through customs with 10 brown cardboard packages containing glassware. As the packets were unusually heavy, the authorities checked them. The examination revealed that ketamine packets were hidden in concealed compartments.         
	Chakraborty and Roy apparently told the officials that they were not aware that the boxes they were transporting contained narcotics.        
	They face up to 20 years in jail, if convicted, in Thailand, one of the toughest countries in the world when dealing with drug-related offences. Drug trafficking carries the death penalty there.        
	We have learnt from the Thai authorities that two persons who flew with us from Calcutta to Bangkok were detained on charges of smuggling ketamine, said a Jet Airways official in Calcutta.         
	At the international terminal of Calcutta airport, airline and CISF personnel scan passenger baggage before check-in.         
	Asked how 63kg of the drug could be taken out without being spotted, the airline official said: But we scan the baggage for arms and ammunitions and explosives. Besides, ketamine is a prescription drug.         
	Ketamine is an ingredient in human and veterinary medicine and is primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug.        
	As it has amphetamine type stimulants, it is a sought-after recreational drug on the party circuit. Ketamine drugs have a huge market in Southeast Asian countries, where it is called Special K. Recently, we had made two major ketamine hauls in Calcutta before they were being shipped to Bangkok, said an official of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.         
	According to him, ketamine reaches Calcutta from Chennai and adjoining areas before carriers ferry the drug to Bangkok and other Southeast Asian countries.         
	A senior customs official told The Telegraph that the department had been informed about the detention of the two Indians in Bangkok.         
	We have also been informed that there was a third person with them and the Thai authorities are looking for him. But we do not have any details about the two men, said the official.

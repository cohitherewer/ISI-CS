The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mines, Marx and angels make a court cocktail
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mines, Marx and angels make a court cocktail
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 1. Landmines at Ayodhya. The storming of the Bastille. Marx and angels (yes, not Engels).        
	All of them figured in yesterdays Ayodhya verdict as the judges held forth on some larger subjects beyond the legal issues at hand.        
	Here is a small piece of land where angels fear to tread. It is full of innumerable landmines. We are required to clear it, Justice S.U. Khan said in the prelude to his 285-page judgment.        
	Some very sane elements advised us not to attempt that. We do not propose to rush in like fools lest we are blown. However, we have to take risk. It is said that the greatest risk in life is not daring to take risk when the occasion for the same arises.        
	The reference was to the belief of many in the country, including some petitioners, that the court ought to let sleeping dogs lie and put the verdict off lest it inflame passions.        
	But Justice Khan said: Once angels were made to bow before man. Sometimes he has to justify the said honour. This is one of those occasions. We have succeeded or failed? No one can be a judge in his own cause.        
	Some of the eloquence may have appeared a little bewildering to some. Justice Dharam Veer Sharma, even as he ruled that the disputed 2.77 acres was the birthplace of Ram, appeared to take the deity beyond the confines of space.        
	The spirit of divine ever remains present everywhere at all times for anyone to invoke in any shape or form in accordance with his own aspirations and it can be shapeless and formless, he said.        
	He also seemed to identify a place with a deity, saying: Place of birth is a juristic person and is a deity.        
	Justice Sudhir Agarwal, however, left the door open for interpretations not with purple prose but with a piece of officialese: as per.        
	The area covered under the central dome of the disputed structure is the birthplace of Lord Rama as per faith and belief of Hindus, he ruled, prompting some legal experts to wonder if he was merely attempting to say what everyone knew from the start (that many Hindus believe the spot to be Rams birthplace).        
	One example of loose wording with the potential to cause confusion came in Justice Khans final order that divided the land among Hindus, Muslims and the Nirmohi Akhara.        
	The Hindus, of course, meant only the Ram Lalla Virajman, the plaintiff purportedly acting as guardian for the child Ram, and the Muslims referred to the Sunni Central Wakf Board.        
	Bastille and Marx came in when Justice Khan quoted from columnist Swapan Dasguptas article, published in The Telegraph on September 17, twice in his judgment.        
	He said the Babri demolition and the events that followed had not been the Indian equivalent of the storming of the Bastille (which had irrevocably changed French history).        
	The demolition caused almost unprecedented communal disturbance and divide. In independent India only the frenzy and madness which was unleashed immediately after Independence and Partition... could surpass the magnitude of the situation, he observed.         
	However, it goes to our credit that we the people of India showed remarkable resilience and disproved the doomsday predictors.... We could again sing with fresh charm Sare Jahan Se Achcha, Hindustan Hamara.        
	The demolition remained a turning point in Indian history when history refused to turn, he said quoting from Dasguptas article. He added: In this process, some role of revival of economy cannot be ruled out.        
	His conclusion: One need not fully agree with Marx in his interpretation of history relating... only and only with economics. However, it will be perilous to deny even partial truth in the said (Marxs) approach.        
	Justice Khan said the verdict had given Indian Muslims an opportunity to showcase the teachings of Islam before the world, which they were best placed among all Muslims to do.        
	They (Indian Muslims) are not in majority but they are also not a negligible minority. In other countries, either the Muslims are in huge majority which makes them indifferent to the problem in question, or in negligible minority which makes them redundant, he said.        
	Indian Muslims have also inherited huge legacy of religious learning and knowledge. They are, therefore, in the best position to tell the world the correct position. Let them start with their role in the resolution of the conflict at hand.                                WITH PTI INPUTS

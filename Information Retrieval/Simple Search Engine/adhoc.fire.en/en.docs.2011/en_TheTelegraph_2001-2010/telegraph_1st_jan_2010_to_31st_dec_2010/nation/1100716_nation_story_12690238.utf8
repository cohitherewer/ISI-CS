The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In crime gloom, Buddha signals Congress
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In crime gloom, Buddha signals Congress
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, July 15: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today painted a grim picture of crime in Bengal where women appeared to be at high risk and flagged the law and order concern to make a distinction between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress.        
	I could call an all-party meeting (to discuss law and order). But please try to understand the situation. The Opposition is not even attending the proceedings of the Assembly. I do not know what is on their minds, Bhattacharjee said in reply to a question by MLA Barry Brien in the Assembly.        
	However, if I call such a meeting, I think the Congress will co-operate, the chief minister added.        
	The Congress today attended the Assembly but Trinamul continued its boycott of House proceedings.        
	The chief minister conceded that crime rate was on the rise in the state but added that it was a nation-wide trend not unique to Bengal.         
	The growth in crime across the state is a matter of concern. But let me remind you that the number of crimes is increasing across the country. Crime rate is on the rise in states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, Bhattacharjee said, while replying to a question by Congress legislative party chief Manas Bhuniya.        
	He added that if it (crime rate) was going down across the country and on the rise here, it would have been a reason for concern. The chief minister hastened to add that I am not stating this in defence. Im just stating facts.         
	Reliable data from other states were difficult to come by, given the poor nature of information management in the country, to establish a pattern.        
	But a comparison of the figures Bhattacharjee listed with those in the states he named suggests that Bengal has registered a large number of rapes. (See chart)         
	Bengal tops the list of four states on the assault on women and turns up second on atrocities against them.         
	It is not clear if the figures were the result of more women coming forward to file complaints or whether the number had gone up from the corresponding period a year ago. State government officials said it would take time to furnish earlier figures.        
	Were the police doing enough to detect and prevent murders, asked CPM MLA Manas Mukherjee. I believe they are doing enough, Bhattacharjee said.        
	The chief minister accepted that dowry torture was a problem in the state but said that unlike in north India, honour killings were non-existent in Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar wants Rahul first, then mom 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bihar wants Rahul first, then mom 
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: For once, Sonia Gandhi is not the first choice, but she wont mind.        
	Its her son Bihar Congress leaders are desperately seeking.        
	Party sources say almost every Congress candidate wants Rahul Gandhi to campaign in his constituency and, although Sonia too is in demand, her son is clearly the first preference.        
	The majority of voters in Bihar are committed to one political party or the other. Their caste and religious loyalties are also very strong. But Rahuls appeal is working among the floating voters, particularly the youth and the women, who are fed up with the prevailing political culture in the state, a senior leader said.        
	Several candidates said the freshness and sincerity Rahul brings were swaying apolitical voters. One Congress contestant from Madhubani, where polls were held yesterday, told The Telegraph: I am confident but victory would have been certain had Rahul campaigned anywhere in the district. Even if not in my constituency, his presence anywhere in Madhubani would have helped.         
	Senior leaders here said both Rahul and Sonia could have campaigned more vigorously in Bihar but the negative propaganda after the process to select candidates was over had somewhat dampened the mood.        
	Sources said after the initial expectation of 40-50 seats gave way to a more realistic appraisal, Sonia and Rahul were advised to go slow. But now, amid reports suggesting a significant inclination of Muslims and even forward-caste voters towards the Congress, party strategists have been encouraged to grant more mother-son rallies in the next four rounds of the six-phase polls that end on November 20.         
	Congress leaders pointed out that Rahul had evoked strong reactions from all the three main rivals  the RJD, Janata Dal (United) and the BJP  which show the impact the MPs meetings have had.        
	Dal(U) leader Sharad Yadavs comment that Rahul should be thrown into the Ganga is also being seen as a measure of the frustration in the ruling camp. At an election meeting today, Sharad said: ...You (Rahul) should have been picked up and thrown away in the Ganges. But the people are sick... this country is unfortunate.

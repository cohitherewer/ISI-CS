The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Reasonable reader test for book bans   Judge contents first, says SC

  Judge contents first, says SC          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Activists of the Sambhaji Brigade burn an effigy of James Laine during a protest against his book, Shivaji  Hindu King in Islamic India, in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, July 12: Before banning a book, a government should judge if its contents would offend even reasonable and strong-minded people and not just hypersensitive and paranoid readers, the Supreme Court has said.        
	The power to ban a newspaper, book or document is a drastic power (with) a direct impact on the freedom of expression, the top court said, defending its Friday order to lift a Maharashtra ban on a book on Shivaji by an American scholar.        
	A publications potential to offend must be judged by the standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous men, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of those who scent danger in every hostile point of view, it said in its judgment, made available on the court website today.        
	The class of readers for whom the book is primarily meant would also be relevant for judging the probable consequences of the writing, the court said referring to James Laines Shivaji  Hindu King in Islamic India, which contains controversial passages about the Maratha heros parentage.        
	The states powers to ban any book under Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code must be construed narrowly, and any exercise of them must conform with procedure, the top court said.        
	The state cannot extract stray sentences and come to a finding that the said book as a whole ought to be (banned); the intention of the author has to be gathered from the language, contents and import of the material, it said.        
	If the allegations made in the article are based on folklore, tradition or history, something in extenuation could perhaps be said for the author.        
	It added that other than the impact on the right to free expression, such bans impinge on the right to privacy by empowering police to seize copies and search places where they can be reasonably suspected to be found.        
	The Maharashtra government had in December 2006 banned Laines book, after an earlier notification had directed that all copies of the title be seized. The controversy had prompted the publisher, Oxford University Press (OUP), to withdraw the book from the Indian market.        
	The book had caused, and was likely to continuously cause, enmity between those who revere Shivaji and other persons who may not so revere, the ban notification had said.        
	Some private citizens and social activists had challenged the ban, which the high court struck down in August 2007 citing insufficient grounds.        
	On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the high court verdict on the ground that the notification had not named the communities whose feelings were allegedly hurt.        
	We feel that the statement that the book is likely to result in breach of peace and public tranquillity and in particular between those who revere Chhatrapati Shivaji is too vague a ground, the court said.        
	Late in 2003, Punes Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute was vandalised, allegedly by the pro-Shivaji Shambhaji Brigade, for helping Laine research his book.        
	On January 7, 2004, Laine explained in an interview his reasons for writing the book and expressed deep anguish at the destruction of rare manuscripts and books at the Pune institute. Four days later, the Maharashtra government filed an FIR against Laine, OUP managing director Manzar Sayed Khan and printer Vinod Hansraj Goyal.        
	But the top court quashed the FIR. At that time the state government had argued that the book intended to resurrect the enmity between the Marathas and the Brahmins.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: BJP leader Arun Jaitley today warned the Centre that the path to convert autonomy to azaadi in Kashmir was a stones throw away.        
	Addressing a meeting of the Delhi BJP on the partys national Save Kashmir Day, the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of lacking a vision and a road-map for the state.         
	It seems as if the easiest post to hold in the country is that of the PMs. Twice-thrice a month, he reads out a speech written out by his speech writer. But he has run out of ideas.        
	Jaitley said when Singh visited Jammu and Kashmir in 2005, he announced the setting up of a committee for the states economic and industrial development, to be headed by his economic adviser, Dr C. Rangarajan. He pointed out that last week, when Singh addressed the states political parties, he said he would constitute an identical committee that Rangarajan would chair. This is a living example of lack of vision and imagination, Jaitley said. He alleged that the government was unconcerned about Jammu and Ladakh.         
	Yesterday, on Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary, the government doled out ads to almost every newspaper. A friend of mine whos in the advertising business estimated that the ads would have cost the government at least Rs 1.5 crore. When Leh was flattened, all the Centre released was Rs 1.25 crore.

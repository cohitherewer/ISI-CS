          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 1: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has written to human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, stating his reservations about some of the provisions of the right to education law.         
	The law entitles all children between six and 14 years to schooling.        
	State school education minister Partha Dey said: Under the law, the state government will be answerable to the Centre if it fails to achieve the target (providing free and quality education to all students). But the Centre wont be responsible for providing funds to the state governments for implementing the law. Such sections need to be changed.        
	The SFI, the CPM student wing, demanded that the entire expenditure for the implementation of the education law be borne by the Centre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi protests UN reports conflict-zone tag over Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi protests UN reports conflict-zone tag over Maoists
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                              
	June 18: India has protested the inclusion of its Maoist problem under the head armed conflict in a UN report, saying the ultra-Left violence does not make the country a zone of armed conflict as defined by international law.        
	Indias envoy to the UN, Hardeep Singh Puri, while objecting to the recent UN report on Children and Armed Conflicts, made it clear that New Delhis protest related only to the term armed conflict.        
	Officials in New York confirmed to The Telegraph that India was not keen to make it a big issue and had no objection to the rest of the report. Rather, they said, India welcomes the reference in the report to children being used by the Maoists because it suits New Delhis position.        
	I should make it clear that the violence being perpetrated by these groups, though completely abhorrent and condemnable, certainly does not make this a zone of armed conflict as defined by international law, Puri told the UN Security Council.        
	We, therefore, cannot accept reporting on these incidents as falling within the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict, he said, referring to top UN official Radhika Coomaraswamy.        
	The report, drawn up by the office of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and submitted to the Security Council, highlighted the recruitment and use of children by the Maoists in Chhattisgarh.        
	Coomaraswamy did not respond to questions on Indias specific objection but spoke generally to reporters about the difficulty of defining an armed conflict.         
	What is an armed conflict is contested, she said, adding that many countries cited in the report claimed that they were not in situations of armed conflict.        
	What we determine is that there has to be a political dimension to it for an armed conflict, she said, adding that the report made a disclaimer that this was not a legal determination of the situation.

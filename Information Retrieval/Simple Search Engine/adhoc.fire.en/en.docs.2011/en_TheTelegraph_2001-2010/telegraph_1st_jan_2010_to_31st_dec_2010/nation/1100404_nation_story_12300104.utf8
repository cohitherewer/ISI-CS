          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 3: Two cases of alleged baby swaps rocked the Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital here in the past four days.        
	In both the cases, the hospital had a harrowing time convincing the two families that the newborns were actually girls, not boys as some ward attendants apparently told the respective mothers.        
	Apart from hurling abuses at the hospital staff, the families filed complaints with the Mangalabag police station.        
	Anupama Sahu of Kakudikuda village near Brahmbarda in Jajpur district was admitted at the gynaecology ward around 2.10pm on Thursday. She delivered a baby around 12.10am on Friday. Yesterday morning, her husband Sushanta and other relatives alleged that their baby had been swapped.        
	The same was the allegation of Gyanendra Khuntia of Kolathapatna village under Balikuda block of Jagatsinghpur district on Wednesday evening. Sumitra, his wife, was admitted at the gynaecology ward around 9am the same day and she had delivered a baby around 12.10pm.         
	Hospital administrative officer Bhubanananda Maharana said: Scrutiny of records revealed that not a single male child was born on the days referred to in the complaints.        
	Manglabag police station inspector-in-charge P.K. Rath said the allegations were made after Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) attendants at the labour room of the gynaecology ward told them that boys were born to the mothers.         
	The hospital today constituted an inquiry committee to look into the allegations.

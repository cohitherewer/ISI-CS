          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 27: The Congress-led Opposition has routed the ruling Left in the Kerala local polls, retaining the gains of last years Lok Sabha elections and exuding confidence ahead of the Assembly battle six months away.         
	The Left Democratic Front won two out of the four city corporations where results were declared, down from all five in the 2005 elections.         
	Its tally of municipalities came down to 10 from 32. Out of the 999 village panchayats, trends indicate that the Left would end up with 360, against 688 last time.         
	The Congress-led United Democratic Front won the city corporations of Kochi and Thrissur by huge margins, re-establishing its hold in central Kerala. It looks set to romp home in 500-plus panchayats, up from 230 in 2005. Out of the 14 district panchayats, the UDF won eight, the LDF five and one returned a hung verdict.         
	The Congress on its own made huge gains, aided by chief allies Indian Union Muslim League and the Kerala Congress (Mani), across the south and central districts. In the northern districts, especially rural Kannur, the CPM held fort.         
	The UDF victory is being attributed to a consolidation of Christian and Muslim votes in its favour. On the other hand, the CPM strategy of distancing itself from minorities did not lead to a Hindu consolidation in favour of the Left. Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said the Congress was the beneficiary of communal polarisation.

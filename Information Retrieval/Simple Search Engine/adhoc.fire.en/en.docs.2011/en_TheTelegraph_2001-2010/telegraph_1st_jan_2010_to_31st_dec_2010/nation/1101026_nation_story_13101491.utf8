The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre readies forces for Bengal poll   60000 troops on early list

	New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Centre is giving finishing touches to a plan to send 60,000 paramilitary personnel to Bengal during the Assembly elections next year, the early preparations reflecting apprehensions of a possible surge in violence.        
	Assembly elections are due in Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Assam early next year. Although most of these states hold political significance for the ruling UPA, it is Bengal that is causing concern in the internal security establishment.        
	We fear mayhem and we will send 600 companies of paramilitary forces. Preparations will start by February next year, a senior government official said.        
	The proposed figure is far higher than the 220 companies (each company will have around 100 personnel) sent to Bengal for the parliamentary polls last year. In the last Assembly polls in 2006, around 600 companies were sent but the main concern then revolved around Maoists.        
	The proposal to set aside more central forces for Bengal comes at a time Mamata Banerjee has been demanding the withdrawal of security personnel from the Maoist-affected Jungle Mahal.         
	Mamata is unlikely to oppose the despatch of central forces to check violence during the elections. She would like the turnout to be high for maximum impact of anti-incumbency in the toughest elections for the Left in over 30 years.        
	However, the areas where the central forces will be deployed can cause some friction between the Centre and the Trinamul Congress. Trinamul feels that under the guise of fighting Maoists, the CPM is using the cover and might of central forces to annihilate political rivals.        
	Since the Maoist trouble began, six battalions of the CRPF have been deployed in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore. Some of these battalions were moved temporarily for polls in neighbouring Bihar but they are likely to return.        
	Moreover, the BSF has significant deployment on the India-Bangladesh border. The border force has close to 30,000 troops in the state, some of whom could also be deployed during elections, sources said.        
	The number of troops being proposed for Bengal exceeds the 45,000 deployed in Bihar, which is in the middle of elections and faces Maoist threat.        
	However, there is more to Bengal than just Maoist violence. The Centre is keeping two aspects in mind while deciding the force requirement in Bengal.        
	One, the possibility of the CPI (Maoist) involving itself deeper in the state during the polls. Two, clashes between CPM cadres and Trinamul workers, already on the rise, turning into full-fledged battles as the election dates draw closer.        
	We have already begun to prepare ourselves for the tough task ahead. Among all the states going to polls, Bengal is going to be the most important, said a home ministry source.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram says Mamata is a valuable ally but he has also made it clear that central forces are sent on the request of the state government. The Left Front government has sounded out Delhi on its concerns about the alleged nexus between the Maoists and Trinamul supporters.

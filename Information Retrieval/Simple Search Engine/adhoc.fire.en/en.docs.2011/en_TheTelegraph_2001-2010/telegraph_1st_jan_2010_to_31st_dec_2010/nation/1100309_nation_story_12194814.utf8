The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From the streets, a contrary mood
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      From the streets, a contrary mood
          Ananya Sengupta                      OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: A campaign in Delhi on Monday to oppose violence against women. Picture by Prem Singh                                
	New Delhi, March 8: As Parliament got steamed up over the womens bill today, the woman in the street appeared uninterested.        
	From corporate employees to website editors to illiterate grandmothers, many women The Telegraph spoke to said the noise over the bill was so much fuss about nothing.        
	There shouldnt be reservation in Parliament for women. I think women are competent enough to enter Parliament without any quota, said Antara Nag, a technical writer, but added that she supported reservation for women in panchayats.        
	There are very strong women who have come through in the panchayats; they should be allowed to move upwards. This bill will create a new breed of women, mostly wives of politicians or spouses of industrialists and actors, who will grab the seats that these ground-level workers deserve.        
	If this barb about the elite bucks up Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad, the wives of politicians bit may not be too palatable  both Yadavs have fielded women from their families in elections.        
	Suman Devi, 75, echoed Nag. Our leaders should be from among us. They should fight standing on the same ground as men, said the grandmother of five who travels by the Delhi Metro every day to meet her friends and family in other parts of the city.        
	I never taught my daughters to accept any favours because they are women. I am illiterate but gave the same opportunity to my male and female children to educate themselves and fight their own battles, at home and at work. These women whom I see on television or the newspapers every day seem well educated and refined; so why do they need reservations?        
	Her namesake Suman Raj, an employee of a multinational, who was born in a poor Dalit family in Uttar Pradesh, too supported reservation only at the panchayat level.        
	Whats going to change for us if the bill is passed? she said. I went to college over my parents opposition and even did my PhD, and today my salary is on a par with my husbands. If I could do it, so can all the women who dream of becoming parliamentarians  they dont need reservation.        
	To Aparna Joshi, editor, Radiomusic.com, the bill is a piece of tokenism.        
	It may end up being a front for men to grab power through their wives who get elected from reserved seats. Its time we stopped treating women in this country as another breed and started treating them as equals  at school, at the workplace and in Parliament, she said.        
	Women need equal opportunity to study, work, voice their opinion. Quotas like these are not enough to change the mindset of a patriarchal society. If all the women in this country could get equal opportunities with the men throughout their lives, reservations like these would become redundant.

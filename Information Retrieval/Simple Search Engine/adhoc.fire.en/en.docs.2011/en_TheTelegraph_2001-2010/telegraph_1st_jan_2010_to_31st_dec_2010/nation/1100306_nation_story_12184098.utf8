	Patna, March 5: The continuous infighting came out in the open in the Bihar Congress today with a large section of party leaders, including all its 10 legislators, holding a parallel meeting against the official one and demanding replacement of state party chief Anil Sharma.        
	Even a section of BPCC members, who were part of the official executive committee meeting, created a ruckus disturbing the proceedings midway and demanding Sharmas replacement. Ranjita Ranjan, the wife of Purnea don-turned-politician Pappu Yadav who joined the Congress on the eve of the last Lok Sabha polls and contested the Supaul seat, led the revolt against Sharma.        
	The developments have come as a big blow to the party trying to revive its fortune in the election-bound state. It was a common perception that Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhis visit last month had injected fresh life among the workers. But the rebellion today made it abundantly clear that Rahuls visit was an apparent failure.         
	We do not wish to go to the polls with Sharma as the state party chief, said Ashok Ram.        
	The legislators having a parallel meeting at the house of party MLA Ram too came in herds to the SK Memorial Hall where the official meeting was in progress and began shouting slogans against Sharma and Jagdish Tytler, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bihar.

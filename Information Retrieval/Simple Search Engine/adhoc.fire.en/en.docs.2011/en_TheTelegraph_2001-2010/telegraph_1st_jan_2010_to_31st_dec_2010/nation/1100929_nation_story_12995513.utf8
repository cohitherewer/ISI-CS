	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The slightest hint of trouble, and the planes will take off.        
	As the countdown began for the Ayodhya verdict just two days away, a tense Delhi put air force planes and paramilitary troops on the ready at several strategic locations across the country.        
	The Centre has identified more than 30 sensitive areas in five states and kept reserves of paramilitary forces ready at 16 strategic locations  most of them near airports  for quick deployment.        
	Eight IAF planes, including AN-32s, have been deployed in Delhi, Bagdogra (north Bengal), Coimbatore, Ahmedabad and places in Maharashtra to transport troops in case of any exigency.        
	The forces will be ready at 10 minutes notice, said a senior government official.         
	Bulk mobile phone text messages will remain banned till September 30, when Allahabad High Court will rule on the title suit. If needed, the ban may be extended, home ministry sources said.        
	A home ministry source, however, refused to press the panic button.        
	Sources in the government said the security establishment was already stretched for forces with air force jets and army personnel turning the capital into Fortress Delhi for the Commonwealth Games, and there was little time for security manoeuvres if things went wrong.        
	There are only three days between the judgment date and the Games opening, and in that two days are when government offices will be closed, a senior official said. We would have preferred if the judgment was on September 24 or three months later (after US President Barack Obamas scheduled visit in November).        
	Last night, the home ministry issued an advisory to all states and Union territories asking their police forces to remain alert to the slightest signs of a communal situation.        
	Special attention is being paid to sensitive areas in Kerala and Karnataka besides Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Four of the 30-odd sensitive locations identified by the Centre are in Uttar Pradesh, but officials said they didnt think the risk of a communal flare-up in the state was as great as that in the other five.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram took stock of the security situation in the country and directed all concerned to ensure peace after the verdict, but refrained from making a statement today.        
	His ministry has been able to provide 5,200 paramilitary personnel to Uttar Pradesh. Chief minister Mayavati had asked for more than 65,000 central paramilitary forces to assist the states more than one lakh police personnel.

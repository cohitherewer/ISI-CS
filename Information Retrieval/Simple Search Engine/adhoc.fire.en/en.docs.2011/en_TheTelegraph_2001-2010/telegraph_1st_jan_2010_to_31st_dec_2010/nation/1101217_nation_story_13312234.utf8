The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Law officer slams malicious lobby
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Law officer slams malicious lobby
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, who defended the beleaguered telecom department in the 2G case, today hinted that a corporate lobby might be behind the recent spate of orchestrated and malicious media attacks on him.         
	Reacting to the court order that widened the probe to cover the decisions from 2001, he said it had vindicated his arguments in the case.        
	Subramanium had pointed out that there was policy continuity on these matters to show that at no time had there been any breakdown of governance. He had also drawn attention to licences awarded in 2001 under the NDA.        
	He had also said in court that individual lapses in the case should be probed. I have noted with great anguish the orchestrated, malicious attacks on me in the media, Subramanium said over the phone while on way to Mumbai.         
	I am ashamed to say who the designers and actors (behind it) are, he added.        
	He said he would identify these forces at an appropriate time. I will deal with the subject fully and thoroughly at the appropriate time, he said.        
	He said that corporate houses whose interests were being threatened by his pro-public stand were orchestrating the recent spate of adverse media reports against him. His open advocacy of a thorough probe into individual lapses to establish responsibility may not have gone down well with vested interests, Subramanium said.        
	HC error        
	Before it passed the order, the Supreme Court found fault with Delhi High Court for dismissing the petition on 2G filed by an NGO, the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, at the threshold.         
	The high court, committed a serious error by dismissing the writ petition at the threshold, ignoring that the issues raised by the appellants, whose bona fides have not been doubted, are of great public importance, it said.         
	We are, prima facie, satisfied that the allegations. need a thorough and impartial investigation, the judges said.         
	The court said that at this stage, it did not think it necessary to appoint a special team to probe the case since the government and the CBI had agreed to a court-monitored probe.

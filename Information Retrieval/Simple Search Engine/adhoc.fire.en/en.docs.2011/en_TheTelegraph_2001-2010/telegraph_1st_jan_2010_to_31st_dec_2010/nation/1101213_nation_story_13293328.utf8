The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajarhat grievance at ruler and rival
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rajarhat grievance at ruler and rival
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: If housing minister Gautam Debs claims of acquisition by consent have come under fire from Rajarhat landlosers, many are also sceptical of Mamata Banerjees pre-poll land agitation.        
	Both sentiments were expressed at a public hearing, organised yesterday by the Rajarhat Jami Bachao Committee, where around 100 landlosers narrated their plight.        
	The committee, led by former CPM leader Nilotpal Dutta and made up of affected villagers with different political loyalties, had been formed much before the Trinamul Congress waded into the land row.        
	Prahlad Mondol, a resident of Pathargatha village, said he was forced to give up three bighas under coercion from the Deb-led Hidco and armed CPM cadres. He was one of the committee members jailed for obstructing the land survey by Hidco in 2004.         
	In 2006, a large group of armed CPM cadres descended on our village and adjoining areas to ensure the forced acquisition. They threatened us with dire consequences if we made further trouble. Police stood mute spectators when the CPM men brandished their weapons, Mondol said.        
	Mondol added that he later accepted Rs 3.5 lakh as compensation as no other option was left. No political party came to the farmers rescue at that time, he said.        
	Virtually accepting that most of the acquisition could not be undone, the assembled land-losers expressed a sense of betrayal.        
	Many landlosers accused a section of local Trinamul, Congress and BJP leaders of conniving with the CPM and Hidco for personal gains as Deb had co-opted Opposition members to ensure trouble-free acquisition.         
	Neither the Congress nor Trinamul extended any support to us when much of the acquisition took place. Now Trinamul is interested in Rajarhat, eyeing the polls, said Prasenjit Chatterjee, a youth from a landloser family and a Forward Bloc leader.         
	Recalling that he had approached Mamata earlier, Dutta said the reason behind the Trinamul chiefs initial lukewarm response was her knowledge of her party supporters involvement in the housing ministers game plan.        
	The committee members are happy with Mamatas decision to expel former party MLA Tonmoy Mondol and a panchayat samiti functionary, Jaydev Karmakar.         
	The leaders of the committee insisted they wanted the demonic government to go, but added that they would watch Mamatas actions after the elections. Since the current acquisition law has no provision for returning land, we would like to see how Mamata ensures justice to landlosers, Dutta said.        
	Several members complained that the ruling party, Hidco and land department officials tried to drive a wedge within farmer families. Married sisters were contacted behind the back of brothers unwilling to give up land or one brother was played against another to ensure hearing for the acquisition and acceptance of compensation, said Pulak Chatterjee of Naskarhati.        
	Around 40 bighas of his family land were acquired. His brothers accepted compensation for their share of the land but Chatterjee resisted and went to jail.        
	Deb had denied forcible acquisition and dared Mamata to give a list of such cases while pointing out that Calcutta High Court did not find anything illegal.        
	But committee leader Dutta said Debs recently published list of acquisition covered only 622 hectares in six mouzas (revenue villages) under 529 landowners. What about the other villagers in the remaining 19 mouzas that cover 3,075 hectares of the New Town project area? he asked.        
	Citing the recent suicide of a landloser in Baliguri mouza, Dutta said many gave up under duress but could not weather the economic and psychological impact of dispossession.

	New Delhi, April 12 (PTI): Eleven Indian crew members of a UAE-based cargo vessel have been taken hostage along with 15 others by Somali pirates.        
	The incident adds to the 53 Indians already in the captivity of the pirates for about a fortnight. We have received information that a general cargo ship MV Rak Afrikana with 26 crew members, including 10 Tanzanians, 5 Pakistanis and 11 Indians, has been hijacked near Seychelles enroute to Zanzibar on April 11 morning, an official said.

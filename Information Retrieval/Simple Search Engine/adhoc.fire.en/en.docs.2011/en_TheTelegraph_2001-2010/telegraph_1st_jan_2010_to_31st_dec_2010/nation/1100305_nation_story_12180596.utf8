The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt works on numbers for twin tasks 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt works on numbers for twin tasks 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 4: The Centre has begun crunching numbers ahead of two challenges in Parliament: see the womens reservation through the Rajya Sabha and ensure the numbers to pass the finance bill (budget).        
	The governments floor strategists and number crunchers are configuring the best and worst-case scenarios that could arise if say, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), were to withdraw support and the unattached and Independent MPs, whose size is considerable, were to bail it out.        
	Summing up the tasks ahead, a Congress cabinet minister said: The problem is while we have the numbers for the womens bill and can technically pass it without hassles, it would be improper to enact a path-breaking legislation without a discussion. We dont expect a problem with the budget but the numbers might be tight.        
	Asked which of the two was more worrisome, he said: If the womens bill is not carried for some reason, at least we would have made the point that we tried our best. The finance bills passage cannot be left to chance and good sense.        
	However, the Congress believes that beyond a point, it will not be politically tenable for RJD boss Lalu Prasad, Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Left to align with the BJP. The three parties depend on Muslim votes. Lalu Prasad has an election in Bihar later this year and the Left in Bengal and Kerala in 2011 and Mulayam in Uttar Pradesh in 2012.        
	 The NDA, Left, RJD, Samajwadis and the BSP have declared they will move cut motions separately against the hike in price of petrol and the scaling down of fertiliser subsidy. If the motions are voted on and carried through, the government loses its majority. It is like a confidence vote, a minister said.        
	The BJP has stressed its intention is not to topple the government. We are accountable to people. Price rise is a peoples issue. I will not talk of the cut motions potential because I dont know if the RJD, Samajwadis and the BSP will vote for it. Theres nothing more at stake for us, said Sushma Swaraj, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, but added, even if the Opposition gets a single additional vote, its a gain.        
	The Lok Sabha total is 544. The UPA has 325 votes, with the RJD, Samajwadis, BSP and the Janata Dal (Secular). The last has not opened its hand.         
	The RJD, Samajwadis and the BSP have 47 members, so their withdrawal would bring the UPAs tally down to 278, a cushion of just six MPs above the 272-majority mark. Not a comforting thought, a minister admitted.        
	Therefore, the government has started building up its buffer. Sources denied the possibility that the womens bill, opposed by the RJD and the Samajwadis, would be used as a lever to cajole Mulayam and Lalu Prasad to drop their anti-budget stance.        
	 An issue (womens bill) so close to Sonia Gandhis heart is non-negotiable, a source said.        
	The BJP agreed the bill was beyond deal-making. We are not looking at the bill as a mechanism to divide Opposition. Opposition unity is only issue-based. If the Yadavs want to oppose the bill, so what, let them. They will be with us on price rise again, Sushma said.

	Cuttack, April 21: The Orissa State Bar Council has decided to take the PIL route against police apathy in investigating the sensational murder of Kalicharan Pradhan, a lawyer of Baripada in Mayurbhanj district.        
	Bar Council chairman Gopal Krushna Mohanty said the decision was taken at a special meeting yesterday to discuss the demands of the Mayurbhanj District Bar Association. The body has been agitating for two months in connection with the murder.        
	The octogenarian lawyer was found dead on February 8 at his house at Kumbharmundakata village under Bangriposi police station, about 27km from Baripada town.        
	The district bar association had demanded identification of the culprits involved in the murder of the lawyer. They also called for a dawn-to-dusk bandh on April 6 to protest against police failure to achieve a breakthrough in the case.

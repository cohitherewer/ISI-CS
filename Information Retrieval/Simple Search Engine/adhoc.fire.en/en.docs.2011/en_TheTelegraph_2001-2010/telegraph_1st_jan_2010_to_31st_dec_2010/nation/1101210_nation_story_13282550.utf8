          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Varanasi, Dec. 9: Varanasi blast investigators have named an Azamgarh resident as the prime suspect and raided villages in the district, prompting residents to allege that clueless sleuths were treating them as soft targets.        
	No one was picked up during last nights raids on Azamgarh, 80km from here, which saw a spate of terror arrests in 2008 and where police went looking for Mohammad Shahnawaz.        
	Today, the police requested Interpol to issue a red-corner notice for Shahnawaz, an Unani medicine practitioner believed to be hiding in Sharjah. Shahnawaz is the elder brother of Mohammed Saif, who was arrested after the September 2008 Batla House encounter in Delhi and whose module is accused of carrying out the 2008 blasts in Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Delhi.        
	Sources claimed the hitherto little-known Shahnawaz had been involved in all these 2008 blasts but had fled by the time his name came up during investigations. They alleged Shahnawaz had, from abroad, revived the module after the late-2008 arrests.        
	Among those arrested were at least 15 youths from Azamgarhs Sanjarpur, the home village of Shahnawaz. Many in Azamgarh today threatened a stir if the police harassed them again. The next time the police raid Azamgarh, people will hit the streets, said Ulema Council chief Amir Rashidi.         
	A local Congress leader, Anil Singh, said: The police should take care. Sanjarpur residents should not be harassed without evidence.        
	However, the police claimed that three people they had detained in Varanasi yesterday had spilled the names of Shahnawaz and some other Azamgarh-based suspects.        
	Shahnawaz had studied Unani at Siwan, Bihar, and got a job at Lucknows Mayo Hospital in 2005. He was soft-spoken and withdrawn, said a former colleague.        
	Every time there is a blast, my son Shahnawazs name crops up. I dont know where he is and whether he is alive, said father Shadab Ahmad, a former Samajwadi Party leader.        
	Three crude bombs were found in a garbage heap in Allahabad today, but police said the low intensity explosives were unlikely to be related to subversive activity.

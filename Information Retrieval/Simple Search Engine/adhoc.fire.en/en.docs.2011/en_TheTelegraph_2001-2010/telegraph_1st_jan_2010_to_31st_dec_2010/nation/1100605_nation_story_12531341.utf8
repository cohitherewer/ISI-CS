	Chandigarh, June 4: A court has ruled out early bail for S.P.S. Rathore, the former police chief held guilty of molesting Ruchika Girhotra, leaving him in jail at least till the end of this month.        
	Given the seriousness of the offence, bail cannot be granted so early, said Justice Ajay Tewari of Punjab and Haryana High Court.         
	The judge adjourned Rathores bail plea till June 29.        
	The court has also adjourned the sentence-revision petition of Rathore, who is undergoing an 18-month term.        
	The former Haryana director-general of polices wife, Abha, who is his lawyer, had sought the bail on medical grounds, stating that Rathore had undergone a bypass surgery.

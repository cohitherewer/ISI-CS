The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Like PC, like CM:   party a pain 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Like PC, like CM:   party a pain 
          J.P. YADAV                                                             
	New Delhi, May 19: The CPM today distanced itself from the hardline stand Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appears to be favouring against Maoists, slamming the Bengal comrade for lapping up home minister P. Chidambarams tough approach towards the rebels.        
	The criticism came amid intensifying debate over the wider mandate Chidambaram has sought to deal with the menace.        
	CPM sources said the party was perturbed that Bhattacharjee was being seen on the same page with the Union minister and the BJP on the need for a tough line against the Maoists.        
	We dont want to be equated with the BJP (and seen as) advocating an all-out war against the Maoists. Unfortunately, the Bengal chief minister appears to be favouring the line advocated by Chidambaram. Why should the CPM be seen as lapping it up when the Congress itself is attacking it, a senior CPM leader said, alluding to the divisions within the ruling party at the Centre on the Maoist strategy.        
	In an interview to NDTV, Chidambaram had clearly indicated that the Bengal chief minister was on the same page with him regarding a wider mandate like use of air support in anti-Maoist operations.         
	(The) chief ministers of Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Orissa have all asked for air support, Chidambaram had said.         
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today lashed out at the Centres (read Chidambarams) assessment of the issue as a law and order problem and went on to blame its mining policy for alienating tribals.         
	As far as tackling Maoist violence is concerned, the UPA government tends to treat it solely as a law and order problem without realising that some of its own policies, like licence for indiscriminate mining in the forest areas, are alienating tribal people, Karat said in an article in CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy.         
	Party leader in the Lok Sabha Basudeb Acharya made it clear he was against any move that could give Chidambaram more powers to deal with the rebels. The Centre has enough power and ammunition to deal with Maoists. Why cant they use it? There is a need for change of strategy, Acharya told The Telegraph. What was required, he added, was a political fight.         
	The party wants Bhattacharjee to revert to his strategy of dealing with the rebels politically. At the chief ministers conference last year, Bhattacharjee had said he would deal with the menace politically rather than crush the rebels with force. However, after the Lalgarh flare-up, he was learnt to have sought the Centres help for a joint security operation.         
	With Assembly polls in Bengal barely a year away, CPM leaders want the party to focus more on targeting Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. Unlike the rest of the country, lack of development did not bring the Maoists in Bengal. They were invited by Mamata Banerjee, said Acharya who, along with politburo member Sitaram Yechury, is scheduled to meet Chidambaram tomorrow.

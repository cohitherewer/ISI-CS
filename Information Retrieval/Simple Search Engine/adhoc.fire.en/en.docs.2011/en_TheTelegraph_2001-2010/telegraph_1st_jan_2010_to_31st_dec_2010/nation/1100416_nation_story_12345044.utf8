          SANJAY K. JHA                            Sonia Gandhi; Tharoor in Parliament on Thursday. (PTI)                                      
	New Delhi, April 15: Shashi Tharoor met Sonia Gandhi today but Congress leaders are waiting for the return of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to hunt for clues on the timing of a decision on the junior foreign minister.        
	Tharoor and the Congress earned a breather today as Parliaments attention was focused more on the Maoist problem. The IPL controversy is expected to erupt tomorrow as the BJP and other Opposition parties have given notices to raise it in the Lok Sabha soon after Question Hour.        
	Some Congress leaders who till yesterday were extremely pessimistic about Tharoors survival in the ministry began singing a different tune today after he got an audience from Sonia. They said Sonia never met a person who had fallen out of favour with her, and that the time given to Tharoor to explain his position was a very positive signal.        
	However, others asserted that little had changed overnight. Sonia was not expected to ease out Tharoor, who was handpicked by the Prime Minister. Singh, not Sonia, will have to remove Tharoor. The picture will be clear only after Singh returns on Saturday.        
	These sources discounted suggestions of Tharoor earning a fresh lease of life. It is a question of timing. Sonia may give more time to ensure that the Congresss rivals within and outside the coalition do not get victory on a platter. But if the Opposition keeps crying corruption, the Congress leadership is unlikely to allow such a cloud to persist, a source said.        
	Tharoor is a minister because of the Prime Minister, not because of the party as a whole or his personal political clout. He will obviously be heard out before any decision  positive or negative  is taken. Both Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi are aware of the dominant feeling in the party, an AICC official said.        
	By late evening, party sources said the raids on IPL offices indicated the governments seriousness in ferreting out the truth and conceded that the issue may become a little more complex.        
	The raids indicate that Tharoor will survive only if there is no credible evidence against him. We cannot act against others and protect our own. This will send a wrong message. If the government wants to unearth the rot in the IPL, it will have to deal with Tharoor with total objectivity, another party leader said.         
	The Congress leader of the Lok Sabha, Pranab Mukherjee, has allowed Tharoor to present his case before Parliament. The junior foreign minister was asked at yesterdays late-night meeting to prepare a statement to be made in the House and sources said Mukherjee had cleared that statement today.        
	Tharoor had come prepared today to argue his case against the Opposition charge but the Lok Sabha was busy debating the Maoist issue. He used the time gained to meet Sonia and Mukherjee.        
	Some sources said that by allowing Tharoor to make a statement, the party was trying to kill two birds with one stone. While Tharoor has been left to fend for himself, he has also been given the freedom to attack those calling for his head.        
	Congress leaders will assess the reaction in Parliament after Tharoors explanation: if he manages to convince the Opposition and the overall situation appears manageable, he may be let off the hook for now. If the majority view in Parliament still remains hostile to him, the party will leave the matter to the Prime Minister, who returns on Saturday.        
	By then, the larger picture within the IPL may also be available with the government, allowing the Prime Minister to take an overall view.

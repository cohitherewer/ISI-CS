The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rules flouted? Govt not sure

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, May 20: Maoists looted 16 tonnes of the fertiliser-cum-explosive ammonium nitrate in Chhattisgarhs Bastar today, setting off a guessing game in the government on the rules regulating the sale and movement of the chemical.        
	Some rules were drafted in 2009  after a series of blasts in 2006-07 using ammonium nitrate  to bring the over-the-counter fertiliser under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. But the draft was never finalised and lay forgotten, which means free movement and sale of the chemical continues to be legal.        
	Still, after a truck carrying the chemical from a Vizag manufacturer to, apparently, a stockist in Maharashtra was hijacked and looted in Bastar, the Centre told the Chhattisgarh government to lodge cases against the manufacturer for violating rules. The impression in the home ministry is that rules regulating the movement of ammonium nitrate are in force and that the licence-holder is expected to provide security during transport.        
	But ministry officials could not explain what rules had been flouted. In reality, there is still no clarity on the rules, either at the Centre or among state governments.         
	We dont know about any violation of rules or licensing. We have asked the home ministry to send a copy of the rules, Chhattisgarh police chief Vishwaranjan said.         
	The home ministry too apparently failed to find the rules till late evening and quickly passed the buck to the chemicals and fertilisers ministry, saying it would know. Without clarity on the rules, the matter is likely to stop at the questioning of the private transporter over any possible Maoist links.

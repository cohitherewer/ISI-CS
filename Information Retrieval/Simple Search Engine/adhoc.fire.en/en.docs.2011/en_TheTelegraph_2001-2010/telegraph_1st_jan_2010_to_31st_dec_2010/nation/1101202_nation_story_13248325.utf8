	Dec. 1: The BSF today expressed hope that detained Ulfa general secretary Anup Chetia might be handed over to India by Bangladesh before talks with the banned outfit commence in January.         
	The inspector-general of BSF (Assam and Meghalaya frontier), R.C. Saxena, said this while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event to mark the 45th raising day of the force in Shillong today.        
	Efforts are still on to get Chetia handed over to India before commencement of the tripartite talks, Saxena said, adding that a team from the home ministry had gone to Dhaka to discuss the modalities of the hand-over with the Bangladesh government.        
	There are chances of getting him before the commencement of the talks in January, he said.         
	Chetia was arrested by Dhaka under the Foreigners Act and the Passports Act for illegally carrying foreign currency and a satellite phone in December 1997 and is still under detention.        
	Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa had agreed to the peace talks on the condition that it should include Chetia. However, the Centre had pointed out to the Ulfa leaders in jail that Chetia would have to spend time in prison even if he was handed over to India, which would further delay the talks.        
	Ulfa leaders are insisting that the talks should commence only after all jailed leaders are released.        
	The BSF officials revelation came on a day Pranati Deka, the Ulfa cultural secretary, walked out of jail on bail in Guwahati.        
	Talking to reporters outside the jail, Deka said the outfits central committee would take a decision on talks and insisted that there were no divisions in the Ulfa.         
	On Ulfas commander-in-chief Paresh Barua, she said he had never opposed talks.         
	The governments at the Centre and in the state have been maintaining that while Barua was welcome to the talks, he should not keep everyone else waiting forever.

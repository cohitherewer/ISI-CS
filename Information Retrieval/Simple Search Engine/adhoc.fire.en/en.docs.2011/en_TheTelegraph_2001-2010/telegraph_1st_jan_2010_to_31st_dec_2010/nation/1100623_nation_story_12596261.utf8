	New Delhi, June 22: Two male cousins murdered their sisters on Sunday for marrying outside their caste and religion and have gone into hiding from where they are planning more honour killings, police said today.        
	The body of Shobha, 20, rotted for two days in a black Santro parked in an alley in Ashok Vihar, northwest Delhi, before the police found it today. Residents drawn by the stench had been unable to see past the black film covering the windows.        
	Yesterday, Shobhas cousin Monica, 23, was found shot in her flat and her husband Kuldeep Singh Baliya dead in his car outside the apartment block, close to where the Santro was parked.        
	Officers alleged the triple murders were carried out by Mandip Gurjar and Ankit Gurjar, both in their early 20s and from well-to-do families, who had told their friends they planned to murder all Gujjar couples who had defied community traditions. The police believe they are hiding somewhere on Delhis outskirts, in Uttar Pradesh or Haryana.        
	Shobha, Mandips sister, had angered her family by marrying a non-Hindu two to three years ago. The cousins decided to kill her when she recently helped her teenaged sister Khushboo elope with Ravi, a non-Gujjar, police sources said.         
	But first they killed Ankits sister Monica  whom they blamed for starting the trend of defying tradition among Gujjar women by marrying a Rajput four years ago  and Kuldeep, the sources added.        
	The police have moved Khushboo and her husband Ravi to an undisclosed location.        
	With the triple murders, five people have fallen victim to honour killings in Delhi in the past one week, starting with a young couple on June 15. Yesterday, the Supreme Court had issued notices to the Centre and seven states asking them to explain what they had done to stop honour killings.        
	Shobha was strangled and shot in the head. Officers said the killers had planned to dump her body in a canal in Ghaziabad before changing their plans and leaving the car near the scene of the first crime.        
	An attempt-to-murder case is pending against Ankit. Soon after Monicas 2006 wedding, he had allegedly beaten Kuldeeps cousin Rahul, a key player in arranging the marriage, within an inch of his life and dumped him in a vat.        
	The police have detained 10 people for questioning, including Monicas father Lilu, uncle Dharmendra, youngest brother Shanky and friend Suraj.

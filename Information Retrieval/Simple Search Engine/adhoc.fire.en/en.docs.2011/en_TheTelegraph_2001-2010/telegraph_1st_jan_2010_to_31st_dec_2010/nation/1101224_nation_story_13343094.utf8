          A STAFF REPORTER                          Yasmin (name changed)                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: Yasmin Khatun, the Bengal teenager rescued from traffickers in Delhi last week, told a court today that she would not go back to her parents as she was not comfortable staying with her father Khater Bhisti.        
	The court in South 24-Parganas Kakdwip, where Bhisti had moved a plea seeking her custody, ordered that Yasmin (name changed) be kept at the Narendrapur home where she has been staying since being brought from Delhi on December 19.        
	Yasmin cried loudly in court and said her father had made ganda (dirty) overtures while she lived with her parents at their home in Kakdwips Balikhali village. She made it clear she would just not stay with her parents. It was difficult to pacify her, said Sarbari Bhattacharya, the CID inspector overseeing the case.         
	The court was to decide she could return to her parents or be taken to some other place. On Friday, Yasmin will be in Calcutta High Court, which had ordered the Bengal government to produce her by October 1.         
	At the Kakdwip court, almost all of Yasmins family, including her stepmother Johora Bibi, mother Samira, sister Tajmera and some villagers had turned up seeking to take her back with them. But Yasmin turned them down and kept crying.        
	At the end of the proceedings, Yasmin met Samira and Tajmera briefly. But she refused to speak to Johora, who played a key role in launching the efforts to trace the teenager since she went missing on April 15, 2009.         
	Yasmin screamed when father Bhisti approached her for a possible conversation. A team of doctors, including a psychiatrist, who had examined Yasmin at the Narendrapur home yesterday said the outburst was a reflection of deep-seated mental scars whose roots lay in her disturbed childhood.        
	Yasmin had told a three-member child welfare committee yesterday that she had not found any support from her parents or her extended family when she wanted to pour out her feelings about how she was being tortured.

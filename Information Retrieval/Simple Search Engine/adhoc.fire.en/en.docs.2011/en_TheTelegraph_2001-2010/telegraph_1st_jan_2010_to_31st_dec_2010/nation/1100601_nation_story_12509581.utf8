	New Delhi, May 31: A play on the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujam created by a British theatre company and evoking a key episode in the history of the subject, will debut in India this year coinciding with a world mathematicians meet.         
	The play, A Disappearing Number, which premiered in the UK in 2007 and has toured several countries, will be performed in Mumbai and Hyderabad which will host the International Congress of Mathematicians in August.         
	The play, directed by Simon McBurney of Complicite, a British theatre group, portrays the collaboration between the distinguished Cambridge mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy and Ramanujam.         
	This is the first time this play will be presented in Ramanujams home country, said M.S. Raghunathan, chairman of the ICM 2010. Mumbais Prithvi Theatre is facilitating the plays two-city tour in India.

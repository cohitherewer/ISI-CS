          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Before the year ends, the Congress will have another crisis on its hands in Andhra Pradesh when the Srikrishna Commission hands over its report on Telangana in the next five days.        
	The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) has already served the Centre a 15-day deadline to facilitate the creation of a separate state after the report is submitted.        
	The Congress MPs and MLAs from the region have swung into rearguard action. It is reliably learnt that at least six of 13 MPs of Telangana have threatened to resign if the Centre remained passive.         
	Warangal MP Rajaiah Siricilla told The Telegraph that the Congresss Telangana leaders will meet on Sunday in Hyderabad to draw up their strategy. We are at the end of the road, we have to swing into action, he said.        
	Sources said they were peeved with the leaders for doing nothing on a petition submitted to Sonia Gandhi by Telangana MPs and 32 MLAs, including 13 ministers, on December 19 at the Congress plenary.         
	Karimnagar MP Prabhakar Ponnam, a signatory, said they conveyed to the Congress president that they would be rendered helpless before people if Telangana was not given and the party would be wiped out from the area in the next election.         
	All we are asking of her and the Prime Minister is please try and understand the problems of the people. I wont be allowed to step inside my constituency if they remain mute. I cannot do my politics from Delhi, said Ponnam.        
	Another MP, who didnt wish to be quoted, said if Sonia and the Prime Minister thought their inputs were politically biased, they ought to get independent reports on the mood of the people.         
	Asked if there was a response, the MP asked: Does the Congress ever react except when its pushed to the wall?        
	Congress sources in Delhi, monitoring the developments, said if half the 32 MLAs of Telangana left the party in protest and joined the other 15 who were seen with former Congress MP Jaganmohan Reddy in his hunger fast this week, the Andhra government would be perched precariously. The Congress has a surplus of just seven MLAs in the 294-member Assembly.        
	Sources, however, claimed that seven of those in solidarity with Jagan had returned to the Congress.         
	Its strategists had conceived a back-up plan to take care of such a contingency. It essentially involved tapping the 18 Praja Rajyam Party MLAs and seven of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) to fill in for potential defectors.        
	This proposal floundered because six Praja Rajyam MLAs had backed Jagans fast. Any day he can spirit away the lot, a source said.         
	Sources rued the fact that the Centre so far only responded to the law-and-order challenge by despatching 18 CRPF battalions. Sadly nobody is applying his mind to the political dimensions of the issue, a source said.        
	A leader who is dealing with the state admitted that the partys big mistake was to underestimate Jagans damage potential.         
	He has changed enormously in the past six months. I watched video recordings of his campaign and what struck me is how well he emulates his late father (YSR Reddy). Lets face it, the southern states have a history of relating to regional satraps rather than the Delhi bosses be it NTR (Rama Rao) or YSR, he said.

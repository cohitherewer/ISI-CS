	Patna, March 19 (PTI): Stressing on the fact that no farmer in Bihar had committed suicide because of maize crop failure, chief minister Nitish Kumar today announced that the state government would provide Rs 10,000 per hectare of crop damage to farmers as subsidy for the next crop.        
	Making a statement in the Assembly and Council on the issue, Nitish said district agriculture officer and superintendent of police in Katihar probing the alleged suicide by a farmer, Jagdish Sharma, found that he had died after inhaling strong pesticides while spraying it on his field. Sharmas viscera is being sent for further investigation, he said.        
	Speaking on the maize crop failure, he said the private firms, which supplied the seeds for the maize crop, had been asked to explain the reason for its failure. Stern action would be taken if any of these firms were found to be responsible for supplying poor quality of seed, he said.        
	Several questions were raised by legislators in the two Houses of the state legislature during the past week, seeking compensation for the farmers.

	New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): A Delhi court today ordered framing of charges against Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in a 1984 anti-Sikh riot case.         
	Additional sessions judge Sunita Gupta allowed the CBIs plea seeking prosecution of Kumar under various sections of the IPC after finding evidence against him.         
	The court said charges under sections 302 (murder), 395 (dacoity), 427 (mischief to property) and 153A (promoting enmity between different communities) will be framed on May 18.         
	The framing of charges will pave the way for trial.         
	The CBI had accused Kumar of provoking people against members of the Sikh community following the assassination of Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984.        
	Kumar has claimed that the accounts of the CBI witnesses were not reliable as they had changed their versions several times.

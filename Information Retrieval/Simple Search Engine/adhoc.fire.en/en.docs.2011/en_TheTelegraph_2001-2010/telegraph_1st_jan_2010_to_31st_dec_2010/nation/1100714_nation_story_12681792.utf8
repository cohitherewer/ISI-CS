	New Delhi, July 13: Mamata Banerjee today visited the Rashtrapati Bhavan for a courtesy dinner with President Pratibha Patil and gifted her a Dhanekhali sari.           
	Sources said the railway minister had got the sari for the President from Calcutta. Mamata has gifted Dhanekhali saris to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi too.           
	Although Mamata said the meeting was just a courtesy visit, sources in her own Trinamul Congress said she may have briefed the President about the political situation in Bengal. Patil is likely to visit Calcutta in September.                   
	Srinagar: A namesake of the Prime Minister who claimed to be Manmohan Singhs adviser and took police for a ride on Tuesday was taken into custody after he fought with Vaishnodevi shrine officials over a bill.           
	A police official said Singh arrived at Katra on Monday for paying obeisance at the shrine and had been provided an escort by Punjab police. But he aroused suspicion when he started fighting over the bill, the official added.                   
	Ghaziabad (PTI): A caste panchayat here has threatened a couple who got married within the same gotra with dire consequences if they try to enter their native Kakodh village, after asking them to treat each other as brother and sister.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): Family members of a 20-year-old college student, who was beaten to death by a gang of youths, set fire to the house of one of the suspects after barging into the house. The house was ransacked before being set on fire.

	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Eight deemed universities found unworthy will keep the tag even after the lapse of the five-year period for which it was granted because the UGC has deferred a decision on their fate.         
	The institutions were granted the deemed university status provisionally under the de-novo category over five years ago and are awaiting its confirmation.         
	According to the rules, confirmed deemed university status is conferred on institutions with a standing of at least 10 years.         
	Institutions offering courses in emerging areas with promise of excellence and at least five years standing can be considered for provisional deemed university status under the de-novo category. The deemed status of such institutions is subject to confirmation after five years.         
	The UGC has to send an expert team to a deemed university in the de-novo category every five years and recommend to the government if the institution should be confirmed as a full-fledged deemed university or continue as a provisional deemed university or have the deemed university status withdrawn.         
	The eight institutions in question are among 44 deemed universities found unworthy of the status by a government review panel headed by P.N. Tandon, which said their academic standards were poor.         
	Since the institutions completed five years as provisional deemed universities recently, the UGC sent its expert teams to assess whether the status should be confirmed. The expert committee reports were placed before the UGC meeting on September 27 which decided to keep in abeyance these cases.         
	This means the institutions will keep the deemed tag by default, a source said.         
	No decision could be taken on these cases because they have been placed under category C (the 44 institutions found unfit by the review panel). Moreover, the matter is pending before the Supreme Court, which is yet to decide the fate of the category C institutions, UGC chairman Sukhadeo Thorat said.         
	The eight institutions are Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Vadodara, Modi Institute of Education and Research, Laxmangarh, Rajasthan, Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth, Pondicherry, Academy of Maritime Education and Training, Chennai, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Kancheepuram, Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth Development, Sriperumbudur, and Shobhit Institute of Engineering and Technology, Meerut.         
	Out of 130 deemed universities in the country, more than 60 have come up in the past five years. The government set up the Tandon committee last year to review the functioning and academic standards of the institutions. The committee found 44 institutions unfit for the status and another 44 deficient on several counts.

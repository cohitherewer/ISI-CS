The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Passport heat on Lalit-baiter
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Passport heat on Lalit-baiter
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, Feb. 11: Sanjay Dixit, the IAS officer who famously defeated IPL czar Lalit Modi and ousted him from the Rajasthan Cricket Association, is facing the heat with the CBI today conducting raids on his home and offices for attesting the passport application of a known history-sheeter.        
	The raid on Dixits government quarters and offices in Jaipur and at his home in Lucknow comes days before the India-South Africa ODI on February 21 at the Pink Citys Sawai Man Singh Stadium, which was to have been the showpiece event organised by the new association office-bearers.        
	A CBI team of 35 officers led by the bureaus superintendent of police, R.D. Kallia, conducted the raids from the morning, but have so far not searched his plush office at the Rajasthan Cricket Association at the SMS Stadium.         
	Dixit is at present the RCA secretary, having teamed up with Union panchayati raj minister C.P. Joshi, the current president, to hand Modi a second straight defeat last year. Dixit first defeated Modi in March 2009 in a bitterly contested fight.        
	Dixit, who is director in the state horticulture department, is in trouble over verifying the passport of Ranjit Singh, who had several cases against his name, in July 2007. Singh had applied for his passport under the Tatkal scheme and Dixit had attested it.        
	CBI spokesperson Atul Gupta said: Ranjit Singh, a known history-sheeter in the citys Mahesh Nagar area, is wanted in as many as 20 cases, including murder, extortion and kidnappings. Singh, who had tried to flee the country in 2007, was arrested at Delhi airport the same year.        
	The CBI team searched Dixits government quarters in Gandhi Nagar, his office in the secretariat and his house in Lucknow. The agency also raided Singhs native house in Todaraisingh in Tonk district and his residence in the Gopalpura area of Jaipur.        
	Asked whether the sudden raids would affect the upcoming ODI, cricket association chief Joshi told The Telegraph: There would be no effect. It is a simple case of anomalous passport verification.        
	Dixit, a Modi loyalist-turned-bitter foe and critic, first defeated the IPL commissioner in March 2009.

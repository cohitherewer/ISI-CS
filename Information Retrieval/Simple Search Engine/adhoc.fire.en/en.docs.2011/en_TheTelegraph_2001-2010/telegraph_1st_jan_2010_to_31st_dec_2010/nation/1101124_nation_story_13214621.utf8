          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: India is among 56 countries that have begun to reverse the HIV epidemic, a UN agency said today but warned about continuing new infections, funds shortage and the dangers of complacency.        
	The number of new HIV infections in India has dropped by 50 per cent over the past decade, from more than 240,000 new infections in the year 2000 to 120,000 new infections in 2009, UNAIDS said. New infections have dropped by more than 25 per cent in 55 other countries.        
	The trends captured by the global report suggest that prevention strategies such as the promotion of condoms among commercial sex workers and educational campaigns for high-risk groups have helped reduce the number of people getting infected.        
	The world is truly beginning to reverse the epidemic, said Charles Gilks, UNAIDS country coordinator in India. But, he said, this is no time for complacency. Budgets are flatlining globally, too many people are still getting infected, too many people are dying.         
	India has about 2.4 million people infected with HIV, and the prevalence rate among adults (15 to 49 years) is 0.3 per cent  less than the 2001 figure of 0.4 per cent. But UNAIDS officials said tens of thousands of HIV-infected people who need treatment do not get medicines.        
	About 320,000 people across India are currently on anti-retroviral therapy, which can prolong the lives of HIV-infected people. If new WHO guidelines for therapy are applied, the number of people in India who require drug treatment would be more than one million, Gilks said.         
	In the absence of treatment by anti-retroviral drugs, infected people die faster. The report estimates that about 170,000 people died from HIV infections in India last year, accounting for more than half of Asias estimated HIV death count of 300,000.        
	The data, based on information from Indias National AIDS Control Organisation, show that the prevalence of HIV in India is highest among intravenous drug users, followed by commercial female sex workers and men-who-have-sex-with-men.        
	But Gilks said Indias transgender community was probably most at risk. This concern has prompted Indian AIDS control authorities to launch surveillance of HIV among transgender groups in Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai.         
	India is doing well, but this is not the time to be complacent and reduce spending on prevention, said Gilks. The challenge will be to prioritise prevention when budgets for treatment rise as more and more infected people seek treatment.        
	The UNAIDS report shows that as treatment programmes expanded, the number of AIDS-related deaths fell. More than five million HIV-positive people worldwide were receiving the anti-retroviral therapy in 2009, compared with 700,000 in 2001.        
	UNAIDS has warned that funding available for the response to AIDS was $15.9 billion in 2009, which is $10 billion short of what is needed in 2010. Funding from international sources appears to be reducing, the agency said.        
	Bangladesh is among seven countries where HIV infection has worsened  the number of new infections has risen by more than 25 per cent since 2001. The number of new infections has shown little change in 23 countries, including France, Germany and the US.

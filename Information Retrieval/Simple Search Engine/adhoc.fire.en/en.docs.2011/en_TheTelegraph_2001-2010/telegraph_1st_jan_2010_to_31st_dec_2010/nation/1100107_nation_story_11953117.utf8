          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 6: Natural disaster prone Orissa has demanded an additional allocation of 30 per cent of the aggregate size of the Calamity Relief Fund and 90 per cent central share instead of the existing 75 per cent.        
	State finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei said the state had urged the 13th Finance Commission for the additional allocation on the lines of recommendations of the previous two commissions. The state has proposed an allocation of Rs 4,000 crore for disaster management and Rs 7,431.64 crore for disaster mitigation, he said. The commission has also been urged to enhance the central contribution to the Calamity Relief Fund from 75 per cent to 90 per cent for low-income states like Orissa, he added.        
	The state has submitted a memorandum to the 13th Finance Commission for recommending grants of Rs 2.20 lakh crore for five years.        
	Orissa has demanded a hike in vertical transfer of central taxes and duties from 30.5 per cent to 50 per cent. The share of central taxes has been marginally increased by the 12th Finance Commission from 29.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent which is grossly inadequate to meet the developmental needs of the state, he said. The 13th Finance Commission may consider the high percentage of below poverty line population, poverty ratio, index of backwardness and fiscal discipline while deciding the devolution of resources for Orissa, he said.        
	Ghadei said early revision and rationalisation of the royalty on ad valorem basis would benefit not only Orissa but all poor mineral-rich states that are less developed.        
	States like Orissa having chrome ore deposits should also be fully compensated out of the proceeds of export duty levied by the Centre, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stand-off chink in Opposition ranks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stand-off chink in Opposition ranks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sitaram Yechury                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: A top CPM leader today said the telecom stand-off could stretch to the budget session if the government kept rejecting the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe, but other non-NDA opposition parties refused to commit.        
	The hint of a chink in the ranks came after a meeting of 11 parties that included the Left, the Janata Dal (Secular), the AIADMK and the Rashtriya Lok Dal.        
	It depends entirely on the attitude of the government and the Congress party, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told a joint media conference, warning the agitation could spill over to the budget session early next year if the government stuck to its stand. If they continue to reject, then it could go on.        
	JD(S) chief Deve Gowda, however, intervened immediately to clarify that stalling Parliament for a JPC probe was limited to the winter session and the future course would be decided later.        
	After the media conference, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said his party at least was not in favour of disrupting the budget session.        
	We are not in favour of stalling the budget session. Parliament must function to allow the Opposition to raise peoples issues. We can take our issue among the people, Dasgupta said.         
	The leaders were, however, unanimous that nothing less than a JPC probe would be acceptable to them and said they would stage a dharna in the Parliament complex tomorrow to press for their demand.        
	They also blamed the government for the deadlock and said its stand smacked of authoritarianism.         
	Asked whether the demand for a JPC probe was aimed at embarrassing the government by summoning the Prime Minister, Yechury said: The Honourable Prime Minister is most experienced in facing JPCs. He has faced it as finance minister.        
	But he added that the Congress, and not the Prime Minister, was afraid of a JPC probe.         
	Dasgupta said the Prime Minister could not shirk moral responsibility. When the whole government is in the dock, how can we say the Prime Minister is not morally responsible? he asked.         
	If the Prime Minister is called for a discussion, what is wrong? he added.        
	The Left parties did not forget to distance themselves from the BJP, which has also called for a JPC probe into the spectrum controversy.        
	The BJP has no credibility to fight against corruption when it is justifying it in Karnataka, Yechury said, referring to the allegations against chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa who has been accused of freeing government land to favour his relatives.

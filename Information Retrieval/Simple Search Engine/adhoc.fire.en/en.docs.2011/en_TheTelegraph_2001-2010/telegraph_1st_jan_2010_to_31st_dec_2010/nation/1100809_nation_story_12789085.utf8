The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Towering task under slush mountain   Bodies buried in mud pile 3-storey high 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Towering task under slush mountain   Bodies buried in mud pile 3-storey high

	Srinagar, Aug. 8: Rescue workers in Himalayan Leh are facing a different kind of mountainous challenge  that of damp, muddy slush, sometimes as high as a three-storey building.         
	You have to shift mountains of slush to rescue and retrieve bodies, said Aijaz Ahmed, a shopkeeper who has become a rescue volunteer in Choglamsar, one of the areas worst affected by Thursday nights flash floods. The locality has been levelled. It would seem there were no houses here, but there were hundreds. You will need a lot of machinery and men to dig out bodies and it will take weeks.         
	Defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel J.S. Brar gave a reason for the slush accumulation. Parts of mountains caved in during the cloudburst, he said, accumulating as high as 25ft of slush at some places. At some places, the slush is as tall as a three-storey building. It is also quite damp, making rescue work more difficult, Brar said.         
	That is why rescue work is very slow but thousands of our men are on the job. Heavy engineering equipment, including some bridges, were airlifted here today to improve connectivity and help in the rescue operation, he added.                     
	In the last two days, rescue workers have been able to find just 20 bodies.        
	A senior police officer in Leh said: The death toll may cross 500. We have recovered 136 bodies and 400 are injured. At least 500 are still missing.         
	Around 90 tourists are believed to be stuck at Lamayaru, which is over 100km from Leh town. A list of 76 more foreign tourists, who are stranded in other parts of Leh, was being forwarded to concerned authorities, an official said.        
	In Leh town, Suhail Ahmad Khan, a Srinagar resident who has a shop, said: Dozens of houses have crumbled in the main town. There was a market and several houses near the main bus stand. They have disappeared. The rescuers are still clearing the area close to the bus stand and survivors living only 100 metres away are wondering how long it will take to start work in their area.         
	Fiang village and adjoining Phey, 20km from Leh town and on the Kargil highway, were also badly hit. Eighteen bodies have been found in three mohallas of Fiang.         
	Shamsuddin Khan, an inspector in the state consumer affairs department who is now a volunteer in Fiang, recounted the escape of a resident. When the cloudburst hit the village, Hussain Ali climbed a tree, his son on his shoulders. But his house was swept away with his three other children and his wife.         
	In Phey, a makeshift camp of about 200 labourers has reported 30 deaths. The labourers had come from Bihar, Uttarakhand and several other states.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Five Indian Mujahideen (IM) operatives with Pune bases could prove the missing link for the investigators of Saturdays blast, though intelligence agencies dossiers give no idea of their present whereabouts.        
	According to Shehzad, an IM suspect held from Uttar Pradeshs Azamgarh earlier this month, another operative, Sahibuddin, who was allegedly involved in the Ahmedabad and Delhi blasts of 2008, had recently visited Pune.        
	The intelligence agencies, sources say, believe that there may be as many as three sleeper cells of the IM in Pune, consisting of at least 60 men ready to fan out to the rest of the country. Like Sahibuddin, four others  brothers Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal, and Mudassar and Mohsin Chowdhury  are said to be based in Pune but their current locations are not known. The intelligence agencies have failed to track their movements since the Pune arrest of IM suspect and computer engineer Mohammad Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy in connection with the Ahmedabad blasts.        
	According to an officer who has interrogated IM operatives arrested in Delhi, Sadiq Sheikh, one of the founder members of the outfit along with the Bhatkals, had told the investigators that at least two to three modules were active in and around Pune even after the IMs national network had been busted in June 2008.        
	While Riyaz is said to be a top operative, younger brother Iqbal is active in south India  he travels frequently between Karnataka and Pune and has been recruiting youths after many operatives were held. Intelligence agencies say Iqbal had met members of the IMs sleeper cells in Ahmedabad, Surat and Mumbai last August.        
	Mohsin Chowdhury, another alleged Pune point man, is said to be helping with finance and logistics. A resident of the city for years, Mohsin is believed to have sheltered IM cadres when the Pune cell was busted. The Bhatkals are said to have stayed with Mohsin in Pune on several occasions, the last in 2006.        
	Mudassar is also said to be based in Pune, though he hails from Bangalore. Absconding for a long time, his name has cropped up in various blast probes, but anti-terror cops and other agencies are yet to release his photo.         
	In October 2008, Mangalore police apparently came close to catching Riyaz and Mudassar. Naushad, an IM operative picked up in the Karnataka town, had led them to a house where Riyaz had stayed. Riyaz wasnt found, but five grenades and pipe-bombs were seized along with 12 mobile handsets, SIM cards and jihadi literature.        
	Later, Naushad led the same cops to Mudassars hideout where they recovered a laptop, a hard disk, Rs 11.39 lakh in cash, five mobile handsets, passports, CDs and jihadi literature. A confidant of the Bhatkals, Mudassar is one of the many faceless IM operatives who have been helping it flourish in Pune.         
	In Delhi, Shehzad, the IM operative arrested in Azamgarh, is said to have indicated there were several modules in India, but denied having any knowledge about their operations.

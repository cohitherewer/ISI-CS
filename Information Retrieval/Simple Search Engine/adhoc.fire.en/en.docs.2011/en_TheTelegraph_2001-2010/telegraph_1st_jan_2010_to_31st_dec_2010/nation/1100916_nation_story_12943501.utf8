	New Delhi, Sept. 15: India today sent out a message to high commissioners of countries participating in the Commonwealth Games that there was no cause for worry.        
	At a closed-door meeting in Hyderabad House, government officials allayed the concerns of about 40 envoys over security for the October Games and the dengue outbreak.        
	The officials shared details of security arrangements made to counter possible terrorist attacks, efforts to combat dengue and plans to manage traffic during the Games.        
	The meeting was organised after the foreign ministry and the Games organising committee were flooded with queries on player security and the rise in dengue cases last month.        
	There has been some disquiet within the government after reports that New Zealand might drop out of the Games. Australian media today reported that many athletes were having second thoughts fearing a possible terrorist strike during the Games.        
	Officials felt that any country refusing to send its team might set off a cascading effect. Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, sports secretary Sindhushree Khullar, health secretary Sujatha Rao and Delhi chief secretary Rakesh Mehta were present at todays meeting.        
	The Indian government has said there were no specific intelligence inputs about any terror strike but tight security measures were in place.

	New Delhi, Nov. 2 (PTI): Dental students from colleges established abroad who are awarded degrees by authorities in India can practise in the country without appearing for a screening test unlike those passing out of foreign universities, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	Interpreting the Dental Council of India Screening Test Regulations 2009, the court said the provision which mandates a test to screen students from foreign varsities intending to practise in India would not apply if the degree is awarded by authorities in India.        
	The court passed the judgment while upholding an appeal filed by students of the Mauritius-based Mauras College of Dentistry Hospital and Oral Research Institute, which is affiliated to Gujarats Bhavnagar University. The students had challenged the stand of the Dental Council of India that they should undergo mandatory screening tests.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Jan. 1: A government school teacher who allegedly drove a woman to suicide after drugging and sexually exploiting her for nine years has been arrested.         
	Jammu and Kashmir police have charged Ghulam Mohammad Dar, a 56-year-old teacher from Brakpora in Anantnag, with rape and abetting the suicide of a 28-year-old woman from the same district.         
	The police said the teacher told the woman, who was then 20 years old and a secondary school pass-out, he would give her a job in his school.         
	He got her a temporary job in 2000, Anantnag police chief Showkat Ahmad Malik said.         
	Police sources said when the girl again approached the teacher for a job, he sought sexual favours. This exploitation continued for nine years, a source said.         
	The womans body was found near a spring at Sherbagh in Anantnag on December 17.         
	There was no mark of violence on the body. We thought she may have some family problem. But the preliminary investigation made us suspicious, a source said.         
	The probe revealed the woman had become a psychological wreck and the teacher would give her drugs to exploit her. She became perturbed after acquaintances learnt about it, a source said.         
	The teacher has admitted to the crime, a police officer said.

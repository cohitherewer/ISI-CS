          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                               
	Suri, July 20: Ashraful Haque, a 12-year-old boy from a Malda village, is lying in his Suri Sadar Hospital bed and waiting for his uncle to show up. But Sadek Ali has been missing since the Sainthia train crash.        
	Head and left arm swathed in bandage, Ashraful, a class III dropout, said his visually challenged uncle had been taking him to Ranchi by Vananchal Express to initiate him into begging.        
	My father sent me with Sadek mama because we are very poor. My parents have two of my younger brothers to bring up. So I was going with Sadek mama to Ranchi to beg on the streets, the boy said.        
	Ashraful had been squatting at the train door, and Sadek sleeping on the floor beside him, when the Uttar Banga Express rammed into Vananchal from behind. The boy said he passed out after his head banged into the door by the impact of the collision.        
	I regained consciousness only at the hospital. I have been waiting for Sadek mama since, but he cannot be traced, said the boy who received four stitches in the head and has deep gashes on his arm.        
	Ashraful, who boarded the train from Pakur in Jharkhand, said his father, Imtiaz Ali, worked with a mason in Mumbai and earned only about Rs 1,500 a month. His mother Sarifan Bibi, a bidi worker, earned some Rs 600 a month.        
	Hospital officials said Ashrafuls family had not been contacted because the boy had forgotten his fathers mobile number. We have shown him photographs of the dead but he has not been able to identify anyone. We dont know how to contact his family, an official said.        
	Officials from Suri Sadar Hospital and Burdwan Medical College and Hospital (BMCH) said there were many more persons looking for their loved ones.        
	Homemaker Siuli Das, from Rampurhat in Birbhum, has been running from hospital to hospital hunting for her husband Debasish. The 42-year-old railway cabin man, posted in Nagarnabi station in Jharkhands Sahebganj, had boarded the Vananchal Express to go to Dhanbad to train as a guard.        
	Weeping under a tree in Suri Sadar Hospital, with nine-year-old son Rajdeep looking on, Siuli, 37, said she had last spoken to her husband around 11pm on Sunday over phone. He was supposed to call her after reaching Dhanbad the next morning; instead, she got a call from a policeman who had found Debasishs mobile at the crash site.        
	Since then, we have been running from Suri Hospital to Sainthia to Burdwan Medical College with Debasishs photograph but we cant trace him. We have contacted SSKM hospital in Calcutta but havent got any information, said Aloke, Debasishs brother.        
	Like Siuli, Parbati, also from Sahebganj, is hunting for husband Lalan Shah, a Jharkhand armed police constable. They have a seven-month-old baby.        
	I have been looking for my husband since yesterday. I have already visited Suri Sadar Hospital and BMCH but havent got any information. I dont know if he is alive or injured, Parbati, accompanied by mother-in-law Indira Devi, said.        
	Another boy, Manoj Marandi of Sahebganj, is looking for a cousin. My sister is lying unconscious in Burdwan Medical College. But my cousin is missing, said Manoj, 12, who has head and arm injuries.                    WITH INPUTS FROM INDRANIL SARKAR

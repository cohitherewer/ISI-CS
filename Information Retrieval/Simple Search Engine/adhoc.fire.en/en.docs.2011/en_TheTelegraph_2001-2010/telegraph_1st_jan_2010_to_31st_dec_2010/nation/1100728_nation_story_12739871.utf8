          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaya Prada arrives in Parliament on Tuesday when the House was paralysed by Opposition protests. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 27: Parliament was paralysed today but the Centre appeared unperturbed by the disruption over the demand for an adjournment motion to discuss price rise and made no effort to break the deadlock.        
	Government sources said Parliament would return to normality as and when the Opposition realises its mistake.         
	The business advisory committee of the Lok Sabha met this afternoon but did not discuss the disruption in Parliament. It focused on allotting time to issues such as ratification of Presidents rule in Jharkhand, the State Bank of India Act, population stabilisation and a pesticides bill.        
	Neither the Opposition nor the government raised the topic of the stalemate over the adjournment motion, despite the realisation that the schedule decided by the advisory committee would mean little if the House didnt function.         
	Asked about the fate of the Lok Sabha tomorrow, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said: What can I say? It is between the Speaker and the Opposition. Today, there were three adjournments but no occasion came when the government could have expressed its views. The leader of Opposition (Sushma Swaraj) expressed her views but we were not asked anything.        
	He refused to speak on the adjournment motion but said: The government will debate any of the 62 issues listed by the Opposition under the relevant rules.        
	Other Congress leaders were more forthright, asserting there was no question of accepting an adjournment motion. Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: If the Opposition is interested in voting, not prices, there are other parliamentary instruments it can resort to. What he didnt say was that the Opposition could bring a no-confidence motion instead of forcing a trial of strength in the garb of price rise.        
	Another Congress spokesperson, Manish Tiwari, said the BJP was creating a ruckus on price rise instead of debating the issue as it wanted to divert the attention from its leaders links with extortionists and illegal mining.         
	The BJP, too, appeared to be recoiling. Its leaders indicated that the Left, Janata Dal (United) and the BSP were pushing for an adjournment motion more keenly as they wanted to corner Trinamul Congress, RJD and the Samajwadi Party respectively, in their states.        
	The BJPs worries are different. It would rather spend its energy on targeting the government on issues such as the alleged misuse of the CBI, the Bhopal tragedy and train accidents. The BJP has listed politicisation of the CBI as a matter to be discussed in the House and is planning to make the release of former Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson a big issue.         
	Party leaders today indicated they would not mind taking up some other issue first if the deadlock on price rise continued.         
	The Left said it was pushing for an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha and a debate under rule 168, which entails voting, in the Rajya Sabha. Trinamul has given a notice for debate on prices under rule 193, which does not require voting.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 25: The health ministry today ruled out giving up control of medical education despite efforts by the human resource development ministry to bring the subject under a proposed overarching higher education regulator.        
	Medical education will be controlled by a new regulator the health ministry has been working on for over a year now but which many thought was dead before its birth, health officials declared today.        
	There is no question (of health education being brought under the regulator proposed by the HRD ministry), health secretary Sujatha Rao told reporters after a meeting with her HRD counterpart Vibha Puri Das. Medical science cannot be divorced from actual health policy, Rao added.         
	The meeting took place amid an open turf war between the health and HRD ministries over regulating medical education.         
	The President had last year announced two new higher education regulators  the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) and the National Council for Human Resource in Health (NCHRH).        
	The NCHER was envisaged as a regulator that would subsume all higher education regulators, except those involved in medical education which would be under the NCHRH.        
	But the HRD ministrys draft NCHER bill impressed the Prime Minister significantly more than the health ministrys efforts on the proposed regulator for medical education.        
	Attempts by the HRD ministry to argue that medical education be brought under the NCHER received a fillip after Medical Council of India president Ketan Desai was arrested on charges of corruption.        
	The decision to disband the MCI represented an acceptance of the corruption that critics have long accused the council of. The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) indicated that medical education may be transferred to the NCHER.        
	But health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is understood to have informed the Prime Minister that he would not accept losing charge of medical education.        
	Government officials said that the final decision on the turf war would be taken by the Prime Minister, but added that he was unlikely to shift medical education from the health ministry against Azads wishes.        
	If the Prime Minister convinces Azad, medical education may still come under the NCHER. Otherwise, the health ministry is likely to retain the subject, a source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Womens quota plan for disabled
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Womens quota plan for disabled
  - Reservation proposal with cabinet        CITHARA PAUL                                                
	New Delhi, March 24: Away from the limelight, the government is planning a new womens quota  job and education reservations for the disabled.        
	People with disabilities now have 5 per cent government jobs earmarked for them, as well as 3 per cent seats in government, state-aided and private educational institutions. The Centre wants a sub-quota for women within these reservations but has not finalised the percentage yet, a social justice ministry official said.        
	Since we have a 33 per cent model (the womens reservation bill passed by the Rajya Sabha) right before us, we are thinking of replicating it. However, a final decision has not been taken, the official said.        
	The ministry, which offers incentives to private-sector firms that recruit disabled employees, also wants a share for women under this scheme and in all the governments welfare programmes for those with disabilities.        
	The proposals are now before the cabinet, the official said.        
	Disabled women are doubly disadvantaged compared with their male counterparts. Viewed as a financial burden and social liability by their families, they are vulnerable to physical, sexual and emotional abuse, the official said.        
	He said a parliamentary steering committee had asked the Centre to curb violence against disabled women.        
	They are viewed as asexual, helpless and dependant; their vulnerability to physical, sexual and emotional abuse is enormous; their aspirations for marriage and parenthood are often denied; they grow up ensconced within the walls of their homes or special institutions, isolated and neglected with no hope of a normal life. Violation of their reproductive rights in the form of forced sterilisation, contraception and abortion, especially in institutions, must be dealt with severely, the committee report says.        
	The government plans to collect data on violence against women with disabilities, and to open a separate wing for disabled women in the disability commissioners office in every district, the official said.        
	We have been mulling over this for quite some time, and the (womens reservation) bill has encouraged us, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Union territory cry in border row

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, July 13: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan will lead an all-party delegation to the Prime Minister tomorrow to demand Union territory status for 865 Marathi-speaking Karnataka villages at the heart of a long-running border dispute.        
	There is no option other than making the villages a Union Territory. We will request the Prime Minister to co-operate with us, the chief minister said during a debate on the issue in the legislative council on a day pockets in both states continued to be on edge after a series of tit-for-tat attacks.        
	Chavan will meet Manmohan Singh at his 7 Racecourse Road residence in Delhi at 6pm tomorrow, the chief ministers office (CMO) said.         
	The (all-party) delegation will request the Prime Minister to ensure that Karnataka maintains status quo in the border areas and does not indulge in human rights violations, the CMO said in a statement.        
	Chavan said the disputed areas should be brought under central rule till the Supreme Court gives its final ruling on a petition related to the row. By raising the demand, the Congress chief minister almost appeared to echo rival and Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray.        
	Thackeray had made the central rule demand this morning and dubbed Karnataka police goondas in uniform for their lathi-charge on activists of the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, a group campaigning for the areas to be included in Maharashtra.         
	The police action took place when the Samiti members had taken out a march in Belgaum condemning the Centres stand in the Supreme Court last week that the border town with a large Marathi-speaking population would stay with Karnataka. Language, the Centre had said, was not the sole criterion for reorganisation of states.        
	Buses run by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation were attacked in Karnatakas border areas yesterday, prompting suspension of services to Belgaum and other destinations for 48 hours.         
	In a tit-for-tat move, workers of Shiv Sena and Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena pelted Karnataka buses with stones in Maharashtras Thane, Kolhapur and Sindhudurg, escalating the tension.        
	Thackeray had also demanded central security forces be deployed in the Karnataka areas to maintain law and order. The chief ministers office echoed the concerns when it said the Chavan-led all-party team would also request the Centre to take necessary measures to maintain peace, law and order in the area.

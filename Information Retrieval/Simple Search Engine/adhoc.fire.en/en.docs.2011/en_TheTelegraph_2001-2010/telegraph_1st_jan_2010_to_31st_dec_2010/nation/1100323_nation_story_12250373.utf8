                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AC coach attendants try to rape child
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, March 22: Two attendants of the Gondwana Express today allegedly tried to rape an 11-year-old girl when she was on her way to the train toilet.        
	The girl was travelling with her maternal aunt in an AC three-tier coach. She went to the toilet about half-an-hour before the train from New Delhi was to enter Jabalpur, its final stop.         
	Government railway police inspector Vijay Bhadoria said the attendants, Rahul and Manoj, have been arrested. But the two reportedly blamed a third person, a passenger called Praveen, whom the police are yet to find.         
	The police said the girl was perhaps drugged near Sehora station, some 35km from Jabalpur, after which the accused tried to take advantage of her.         
	But the girl became unconscious and in panic, the two hid her in a carriage cupboard meant to store pillows and bedsheets.         
	The girls aunt kept looking for her but could not find her. When the train arrived at Jabalpur station, the aunt approached the government railway police for help.         
	A search was launched and the girl was found lying unconscious in a sleeper coach.         
	Apparently, when the train emptied at Jabalpur and left for the yard for routine cleaning, Rahul and Manoj shifted the girl from the cupboard to the deserted sleeper coach.        
	Bhadoria said the two men have been charged under Section 354 of the IPC (assault or criminal force against woman with intent to outrage her modesty).        
	A statement issued by the railways, however, sought to underplay the incident saying that the girl was saved from getting sexually assaulted.

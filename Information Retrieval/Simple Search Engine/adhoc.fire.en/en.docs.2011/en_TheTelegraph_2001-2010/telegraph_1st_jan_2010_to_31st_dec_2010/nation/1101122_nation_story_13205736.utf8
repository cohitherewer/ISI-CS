	New Delhi, Nov. 21 (PTI): The CBI will soon send Letters Rogatory to the UK for questioning former director of AM Films and AM Cars Ashish Patel and seeking financial details about his two firms for allegedly making arrangements for the Queens Baton Relay at exorbitant rates.        
	While the CBI is questioning Sanjay Mohindroo, the sacked deputy director-general (marketing) of the Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games, and sacked joint director-general T.S. Darbari, their statements need to be verified and corroborated from Patel as well, official sources said.        
	Patel has been named in both the cases that have been registered by the CBI in connection with the baton relay, an event held in London and attended by President Pratibha Patil.        
	CBI sources said the letters will be sent as soon as possible because the questioning of Patel was necessary.         
	The first case was registered under criminal conspiracy (120-B), cheating (420) and forgery (468 and 471) of the IPC and some sections of Prevention of Corruption Act against the trio.        
	In this case, the CBI has alleged that the accused officials of the OC in conspiracy with the London-based transport firm and its director awarded the contract to AM Cars and Vans at exorbitant rates without following the standard tendering process.        
	The contract was awarded on the false premise that the firm was on the panel of the Indian high commission in London. Two emails were allegedly forged by the officials of the OC to justify the selection of the firm.        
	The second case was registered under criminal conspiracy and cheating and various sections of Prevention of Corruption Act against Darbari and Mohindroo and the Patel-owned AM Films.        
	It is alleged that the accused OC officials in conspiracy with AM Films awarded the work of installation of video screens at the relay venue at exorbitant rates without following the standard procedure.        
	Patel was in the news after his firms  AM Cars and Vans and AM Films  were allegedly paid 2.45 lakh for its services during the baton relay last year.        
	Kalmadi trips        
	About Rs 18 lakh were spent on six foreign trips, lasting 28 days, that Games Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi undertook in the build-up to the event even though the amount is not part of his travel allowances.

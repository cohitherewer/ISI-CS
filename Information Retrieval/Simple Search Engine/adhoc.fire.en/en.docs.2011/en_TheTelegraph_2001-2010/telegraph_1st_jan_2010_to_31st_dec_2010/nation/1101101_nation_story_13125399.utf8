	Union home minister P Chidambaram on Sunday toured Baramulla town, rocked by months of protests, with minimum security.         
	Baramulla police chief Mansoor Untoo said the minister wanted to have a feel of the situation on the ground. His drive was cleared after everything (about the security) was weighed properly, he said.         
	Police sources said the minister took two security vehicles with him and few residents noticed his presence. He stopped near a bridge where some of the worst stone-throwing has taken place here. There was no curfew in the area and some vehicles were moving at the time. Later, word spread that the home minister had come, a resident of the Old City said.         
	Earlier in the day, Chidambaram spoke to chief minister Omar Abdullah about the general security situation in Jammu and Kashmir (picture top). He also visited Kargil (picture bottom) where he wore a traditional robe and cap while interacting with the people.

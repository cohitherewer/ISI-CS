	Jaisalmer, Dec. 18 (PTI): A Brazilian woman threatened to jump off a water tower if her Indian lover did not accompany her to her country in a throwback to a scene straight out of the blockbuster Sholay.        
	The Brazilian lady, Andrena, climbed on the water tank and demanded that her lover should accompany her to Brazil in a day or two, for which he was not ready as his mother expired recently, Kotwali station house officer Virendra said.        
	Later, she came down from the tank after a US tourist pacified her and her lover assured that he will go to Brazil next month, Virendra said.

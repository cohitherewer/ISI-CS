The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ministries split over Jamia label
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ministries split over Jamia label
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, April 28: Two key ministries are divided on the controversial demand for minority status to Jamia Millia Islamia ahead of a crucial hearing on May 4 before Indias apex minority education watchdog.         
	The human resource development ministry will at the hearing ask for an adjournment to wait for the outcome of a similar case in the Supreme Court pertaining to Aligarh Muslim University, government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	But minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed wants Jamia to be given minority status  independent of the AMU case  sources said.         
	Minority status allows institutions greater autonomy from government norms than other institutions. The tag exempts institutions from quotas for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, mandatory for other government-funded institutions. Minority institutions can enforce reservations for minority community students.         
	The case before the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions is slippery for the Congress because of divisions within its supporters on granting minority status to Jamia.         
	The government has tried on at least two occasions to bring Khursheed and Sibal to a reconciliation but planned meetings have fallen through on each occasion, sources said.         
	With less than a week to go for the hearing, the two ministries are expected to negotiate and try to ensure that their differences do not spill out into the open.         
	After all, the government is one and it is not good for different arms of the government to appear to have divergent views on an issue, a source said.         
	Jamia, also a party to the case, will on May 4 take the stand that it abides by the law governing it at present  which does not declare the university as a minority institution.         
	A case on the AMUs demand for minority status is pending before the Supreme Court. Like Jamia, the AMU is a central university.         
	The HRD ministry is arguing that deciding on the minority status of Jamia before the Supreme Court verdict on the AMU may prove troublesome. If the apex court order were to differ with the decision on Jamia, the government would be forced to reverse its decision on Jamia.         
	Sections of the secular intelligentsia are opposed to the granting of minority status to Jamia, an institution with a history closely linked to Indias Independence movement. Many within the Jamia establishment today are also opposed to minority status for the university.         
	But others within the Jamia community, and powerful sections of the Muslim community, have for the past few years been adamant in demanding minority status for the university.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rathore faces suicide case as SC clears air     Stress on no option for victim
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              SPS Rathore (top), KPS Gill				                                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court today cleared the air on what constitutes abetment to suicide that could impact a similar case, also filed today, against S.P.S. Rathore, the former Haryana top cop who allegedly drove teenager Ruchika Girhotra to end her life.        
	The court today said abetment to suicide could be inferred if an accused by his continued course of conduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option.        
	The Girhotras have alleged that Rathore, after molesting Ruchika, harassed her further to make her withdraw the molestation case.         
	A false case of theft was slapped against her brother Ashu, who was tortured by police for not getting his sister to drop the case.        
	Today, minutes after Panchkula police registered the FIR against the former DGP under IPC Section 306 (abetment to suicide), the special investigation team set up by Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda recommended the case be handed to the CBI.         
	Four other policemen have been named as Rathores co-accused inspector-general (training) K.P. Singh, who was the Ambala superintendent of police in 1990, sub-inspector Prem Dutt and assistant sub-inspectors Sewa Singh and Jai Narayan.         
	All have been accused of harassing the Girhotras.        
	As asked by the Girhotra family, we have registered a case under Section 306 against Rathore on the complaint of Ruchikas brother Ashu and are recommending the matter be handed over to the CBI for investigation, Panchkula police chief Maneesh Chaudhary said.        
	The Supreme Court today said courts should be careful in assessing evidence and facts produced during trial and find out whether cruelty meted out to the victim had induced her to end her life.         
	The bench was dealing with a case from Andhra Pradesh in which farm hand Ramulu had committed suicide by drinking pesticide two days after his employer accused him of stealing gold ornaments.         
	Gangula Mohan Reddy, the farmer who had employed Ramulu, was convicted under Section 306 by a trial court and sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 10,000.         
	On appeal, his sentence was later reduced to five years by Andhra Pradesh High Court.         
	Reddy then came before the apex court, which released him on bail pending a hearing.         
	Today, the court cleared Reddy of the charge of abetment of suicide and set him free.         
	The bench also explained the law, citing previous judgments.         
	Referring to a case in which a woman had left a suicide note alleging harassment by in-laws and saying she wanted to die by setting herself on fire, the Supreme Court said that mere allegation of harassment by the deceased would not attract abetment charges.         
	In another case, a woman had committed suicide after her husband told her: You are free to do whatever you wish and go wherever you like. In that case, the court had held that the instigation could be inferred if the accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide.         
	The court also said if a person who committed suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life and such things were not expected to induce a similarly-placed individual to commit suicide, a court would not find the accused guilty.         
	In order to convict a person under Section 306, there has to be a clear mens rea (criminal intention), the court said.         
	Singh FIR support         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said it was the right of every citizen to register an FIR. Recently, concerns have been expressed that very often if people go to register an FIR, there are obstacles that they have to experience. It is the right of every citizen who has a genuine complaint to have an FIR registered, he said.

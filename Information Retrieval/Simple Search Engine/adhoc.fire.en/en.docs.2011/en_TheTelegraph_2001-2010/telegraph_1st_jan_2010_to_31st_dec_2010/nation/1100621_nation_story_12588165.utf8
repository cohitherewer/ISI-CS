	New Delhi, June 20: Even the toughest possible version of a nuclear liability bill to provide compensation to people for nuclear damage is unlikely to impose any direct liability on the suppliers, experts have said amid calls for stronger legislation.        
	India expects to accelerate the growth of its nuclear power programme through imports of large 1,000MW-class reactors from French and US companies. But experts say direct liability on suppliers would block nuclear trade.        
	This is a non-negotiable point, said an expert who has in the past advised the government on nuclear and strategic issues. With liability on suppliers, none of them would be willing to supply. We just wont get reactors.        
	A parliamentary committee is examining proposed legislation that sets a maximum liability of $460 million on the nuclear operators for each nuclear incident. Indias operators today are the public sector enterprises Nuclear Power Corporation and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam (Bhavini).        
	Non-government and environmental groups have pointed out that this cap is lower even than the $470 million settlement in the Bhopal gas disaster, widely seen as inadequate. They have intensified their campaign for stronger legislation that will also impose liability on suppliers, amid fears following the Bhopal verdict that foreign companies may go scot-free after a nuclear incident.        
	A senior official in Indias nuclear establishment said the suppliers would include Indian as well as foreign companies.         
	When you buy a car and injure someone, the injured doesnt claim compensation from the car manufacturer, the official said. But the person driving the car may argue that a flaw in the car caused the incident.        
	Clause 17 in the proposed legislation allows the operator of a nuclear installation to have a right of recourse where the nuclear incident has resulted from a wilful act or gross negligence on the part of a supplier.        
	Theres now a consensus that the presence of this clause is necessary, a source who participated in yesterdays meeting of the parliamentary committee said.        
	Critics, however, say the language in the current version of the legislation means the operator must establish in a court that the incident occurred from a wilful act or gross negligence on the suppliers part. This, the critics say, will be difficult to prove.

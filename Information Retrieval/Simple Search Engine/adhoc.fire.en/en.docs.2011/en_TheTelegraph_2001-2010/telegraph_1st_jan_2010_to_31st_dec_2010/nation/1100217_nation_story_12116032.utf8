                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UK duo detained on waiters alert
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Two waiters at a Delhi five-star hotel alerted police and had two suspicious British guests detained, days after a waiter in Punes German Bakery failed to show similar alacrity and opened an unclaimed bag that exploded.        
	The British duo turned out to be aircraft enthusiasts and not spies, but have been detained in their rooms since sleuths of Delhi polices special cell, the forces anti-terror wing, swooped down on the hotel last night.        
	Steven Martin, 25, and Stephen Hampston, 55, had checked into the hotel, near Indira Gandhi International Airport, on Saturday  the day of the German Bakery blast in Pune that killed waiter Gokul Nepali and nine others  and moved into a fourth-floor room overlooking the airport.        
	Police found in their room several gizmos used to track planes, high-powered binoculars, cameras and an instrument to monitor air traffic. A laptop containing Google maps of the airport was also found.        
	The duo claimed they had come to Delhi on a plane-spotting trip.        
	We are questioning them but cannot reveal details as nothing adverse has been found yet, said Delhi police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat.         
	But a senior officer found the plane-spotting explanation intriguing. They were recording conversations between pilots and the air-traffic control (ATC). That is shocking. They said it was their hobby. It is a dangerous hobby and a major security concern for us. We are checking if they have violated the Indian Telegraph Act, the officer said.        
	Fourteen such British plane-spotters were arrested and charged with espionage at a Greek airbase in 2001. They were later acquitted.

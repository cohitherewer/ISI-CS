The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi in UN safe city plan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi in UN safe city plan

	New Delhi, Nov. 29: Delhi is among five cities across the world selected by a UN agency for a programme to develop and evaluate initiatives aimed at reducing violence against women in urban centres and making cities safer for women.         
	The Safe Cities programme launched yesterday is expected to involve safety audits to identify unsafe locations, and initiatives relating to public transport, education and law enforcement that could help make public areas safer for women and girls.         
	The programme comes amid concerns that sexual harassment and violence against girls and women occurs during daytime and after dark in public spaces whether they are secluded or crowded.         
	A baseline survey in Delhi conducted by a non-government organisation ahead of the launch of the Safe Cities programme found that two out of three women had experienced harassment two to five times over the past year.         
	Besides Delhi, the Safe Cities programme will run in Cairo (Egypt), Kigali (Rwanda), Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea), and Quito (Equador). Each city will be expected to develop a mix of activities to stop violence against girls and women.         
	Weve picked these cities not because they have high levels of violence but because this programme needs local authorities and local participation of non-government organisations, said Ines Alberdi, executive director of the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).         
	UN officials said the initiatives might vary from city to city, even site to site within the same city. In some places, we may need actions on public transport  for instance CCTVs inside public transport vehicles, said a UNIFEM official.         
	Other actions could be improved lighting on streets and self-defence training to college girls. One of the most important goals of the project is to collect data and understand which activity works, said Gitanjali Singh, national programme officer with UNIFEM in India.         
	The analysis of results from the Safe Cities programme will, she said, hopefully lead to the identification of models that other cities in the world could adapt for themselves.        
	Talks with BPOs        
	The government today held a meeting with police officials and representatives of the IT and BPO industry to review and draw up an action plan for the security of employees, especially women staffers.        
	The move comes a week after a BPO employee was raped in the capital last week.        
	We have zero-tolerance for such things and we need to make sure that there is a secure environment. The meeting was called to have all the stakeholders on board on how to improve the security situation, minister of state for communications and IT Sachin Pilot said.        
	The meeting was attended by police officials from Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon; IT-BPO companies such as EXL, Genpact and HCL; and IT body Nasscom.        
	We have suggested that every employee, including (those in) security, transportation, sanitation and catering, are verified. If required, biometric identification should also be done, Pilot said.        
	A centralised number for women employees to call after reaching home has also been suggested, he added.        
	This is not the first time the IT industry has been rocked by an incident of rape. The rape and murder of a BPO employee in Bangalore by a cab driver in 2006 had jolted the industry.        
	BPO companies have been taking a number of steps to prevent such incidents. Drivers have been instructed not to drop women employees on roads, while speed governors and vehicle-tracking systems have been installed in cabs.        
	Pilot said companies were also looking at providing self-defence classes to female employees.

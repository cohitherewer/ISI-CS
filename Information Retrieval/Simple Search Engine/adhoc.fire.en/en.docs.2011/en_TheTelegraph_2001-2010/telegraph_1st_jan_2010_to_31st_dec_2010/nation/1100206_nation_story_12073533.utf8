The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak talks first, not Saarc
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak talks first, not Saarc
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The Saarc home ministers conference scheduled for February 26 in Islamabad was today conveniently postponed so that India and Pakistan would not have to hurry their proposed foreign secretary-level dialogue.        
	Pakistans envoy to New Delhi today officially accepted Indias offer for the dialogue, which both countries want to hold before the Saarc meeting. Shahid Malik promised to confirm the dates suggested by India  which have not been revealed  after talking to Islamabad.        
	Officials said the Saarc meeting had been put off indefinitely at a request from Nepal, whose home minister did not find the conference date convenient. Indian home minister P. Chidambaram was to attend the Islamabad meeting in the first Pakistan visit by an Indian minister after the Mumbai terror attacks.        
	Sources said the conference had become an irritant to the plans for the foreign secretary talks, announced yesterday. Foreign policy minders in both governments wanted the talks held before the Saarc conference but complained that the February 26 deadline didnt leave them with enough time to prepare for a composite dialogue of such importance.        
	This is the third time this edition of the Saarc home ministers meeting has been postponed.        
	Malik today met foreign secretary Nirupama Rao to discuss the dates for the bilateral dialogue. The foreign ministry spokesperson described the 45-minute meeting as positive and constructive.        
	Pakistan will approach the dialogue with an open and positive mind, Malik said, adding that all issues of mutual concern, including Kashmir, would be on the agenda.        
	Sources said India had proposed the dialogue two weeks ago and Rao had discussed it over the phone with her Pakistani counterpart, Salman Bashir, 10 days back. India had frozen talks with Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks.        
	BJP demand        
	The BJP has expressed fears that the composite dialogue would push Indias terrorism concerns to the margins and demanded a commitment from the Prime Minister that Kashmirs status would not be diluted. The party alleged the talks had been reactivated under US pressure.        
	Arun Jaitley, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said Singh should assure the country and Parliament that no part of Indian territory would be compromised and Indias control over Kashmir would not be diluted in whatever adventures or misadventures he may be doing.        
	Jaitley asked if the dialogue would prioritise terrorism as the first item on its agenda.

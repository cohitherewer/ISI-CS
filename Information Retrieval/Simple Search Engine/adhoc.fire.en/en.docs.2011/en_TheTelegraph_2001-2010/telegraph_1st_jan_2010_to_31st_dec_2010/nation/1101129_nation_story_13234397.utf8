The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shivraj bash ruffles feathers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shivraj bash ruffles feathers
          RASHEED KIDWAI                       Shivraj Chauhan                          
	Bhopal, Nov. 28: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans decision to celebrate the completion of his five years in office in grand style has upset predecessors Babulal Gaur and Uma Bharti and their supporters.         
	Over a lakh party workers are expected to felicitate Chauhan on Monday in the presence of central leaders L.K. Advani, Nitin Gadkari and Sushma Swaraj. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi is not invited though.         
	Alok Bhargava, a Guna-based BJP leader, has written to party president Gadkari, general secretary Ram Lal and state BJP chief Prabhat Jha protesting against what he described as the chief ministers ostentatious conduct.         
	All party workers have been directed to donate Rs 10 towards the cost of lunch on Monday. They will be served Ram Roti  chapatis, a dry vegetable, dal and a sweet.         
	Bhargava, who until recently headed the partys Gauvansh Vikas Pratosht (cow development cell), also asked why the BJP was turning its back on the Uma and Gaur regimes.         
	Uma was the architect of the BJPs spectacular victory in December 2003 that ended 10 years of Congress rule under Digvijay Singh. When an adverse court ruling forced her to step down, Gaur served as chief minister from August 2004 to November 2005. Chauhan replaced Gaur, and then returned to power in the next election.         
	Gaur told The Telegraph: While I feel good about chief minister Chauhan completing five years in office, a lot of hard work had gone into throwing the Congress out of power. Every party worker needs to be acknowledged on that count.         
	But state party chief Prabhat Jha justified the celebration on the ground that Chauhan was the first BJP chief minister of Madhya Pradesh  there have been seven from the party, out of a total of 26  to complete five years in office.         
	Jha said while the spotlight on November 29 would be on Chauhan, the day would be celebrated as Karyakarta Gaurav Divas (Workers Pride Day).         
	BJP insiders who did not wish to be named said Chauhan could have deferred the celebrations by a few days. Any date in the first week of December would have meant celebrating the partys seven years in office. That there is song and dance about Chauhans five years implies that Uma and Gaur did nothing, a former BJP chief minister said.         
	The very grain of the November 29 celebrations was against BJP culture because the party has always been opposed to personality cult, the former chief minister added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong ministers lobby for RS seats
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong ministers lobby for RS seats
          SANJAY K. JHA                                  (From top) AK Antony, MS Gill, Anand Sharma	                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Rajya Sabha terms of five ministers will end this year and all of them have begun lobbying for re-nomination.        
	Congress sources say that getting them back into Parliament would not be difficult, though a few of them may be somewhat handicapped by the change in electoral equations in the states they come from.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony and commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma will see their Upper House terms end on April 2, sports minister M.S. Gill on April 9, environment minister Jairam Ramesh on June 21, and information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni on July 4.        
	Soni and Gill were elected from Punjab, Jairam from Andhra Pradesh, Anand Sharma from Himachal Pradesh and Antony from Kerala.        
	Party leaders have little doubt about the re-nomination of Antony, Jairam, Sharma and Soni, but there is strong opposition to Gill. Sources say he may struggle despite his rapport with Sonia Gandhi and the Prime Minister.        
	One Congress lobby feels that nominating a chief election commissioner who had just retired from his constitutional office had been improper in the first place; another argues that Gills performance as minister has been pathetic.        
	This should be the ideal time to remove Gill since the Commonwealth Games are barely months away, a senior Congress leader told The Telegraph. We need a dynamic sports minister with a much greater sense of involvement and dedication.        
	Gills problem is aggravated by the new electoral equations in Punjab that can ensure the victory of only one Congress candidate. The other Congress candidate from Punjab whose term ends with Gills is former minister Ashwini Kumar.        
	Sharma cannot come back from home state Himachal because the BJP will wrest that seat from the Congress. He may find it tough to get re-elected in April since there would be just a few vacancies in other states at that time, but a minister has a six-month cushion to become an MP again.        
	States like Andhra, Maharashtra, Assam, Rajasthan and Haryana have the strength to accommodate a few outsiders.        
	These five ministers are among 65 Rajya Sabha members whose terms end this year. What has complicated the party high commands job is that the group of 65 includes several other senior leaders.        
	They include Congress general secretaries B.K. Hariprasad, Mohsina Kidwai and Oscar Fernandes, and veterans R.K. Dhawan, Shivraj Patil and Janardhan Reddy. Patil and Mohsina would step out of the race if they become governors, but the rest have to be accommodated in Parliament.

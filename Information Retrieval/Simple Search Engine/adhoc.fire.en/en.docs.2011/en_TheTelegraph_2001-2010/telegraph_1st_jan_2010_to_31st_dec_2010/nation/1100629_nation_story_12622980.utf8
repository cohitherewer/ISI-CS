The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak action pledge on new 26/11 names
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak action pledge on new 26/11 names
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 28: Home ministry officials today said Islamabad had promised action against more Lashkar-e-Toiba militants and even some people in the Pakistani establishment over 26/11, claiming success for P. Chidambarams visit.        
	Just yesterday, however, some officials who had accompanied Chidambaram to Islamabad had suggested that no movement had taken place in getting Pakistan to act against the 26/11 accused.        
	Today, sources said Pakistan had pledged to act before the two countries foreign ministers met on July 15.         
	They told us India will not be disappointed this time, so we are expecting some credible action, a senior official said.        
	Chidambaram handed Pakistan the names of several Lashkar activists and some in the Pakistani establishment, the sources said. These include the names of Brigadier Riyaz, Sajjid Mir, Abdul Rehman Saeed alias Pasha and Abu Khafa.        
	The sources said some of the names came from Lashkar operative David Coleman Headley, who was quizzed by Indian officials in Chicago. Since the interrogation took place in the presence of US authorities, Pakistan can hardly deny that new leads have emerged, the sources added.        
	The sources, however, said Pakistan had not promised any action against Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind. Pakistan is trying seven Lashkar activists in the case.        
	The officials said that when India sought voice samples of the accused, Pakistan cited a lower court order that prevented the samples being taken. But Pakistani authorities may now move higher courts to get the samples.

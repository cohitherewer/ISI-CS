The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Civilian deaths cant be helped: Maoists   Rebel leader reminder on travel warning 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Civilian deaths cant be helped: Maoists 
  Rebel leader reminder on travel warning           G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          A paramilitary soldier guards the blast site in Dantewada on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	Hyderabad, May 18: The Maoists have shrugged off the killing of at least 31 persons, several of them civilians, in Dantewada as collateral damage in their war against the state.         
	We are sorry. But it could not be helped, was the cryptic reaction of Azad, a top Maoist leader, in a telephone conservation with several reporters of Hyderabad.        
	Azad, a central committee member of the CPI (Maoist), heads the South Dandakaranya zone which covers the Sukma region of Chhattisgarh where the guerrillas set off a landmine under a passenger bus at Chingawaram yesterday.        
	Travelling on the bus, in violation of the rulebook, were 25 security personnel  locals drafted into the force to battle the Maoists in the forested terrain of Bastar. At least 16 of them perished in the explosion, so huge that it mangled the front portion of the bus into a ball of steel.        
	The attack, the first on a civilian bus, was a chilling signal that the rebels had upped the ante and were not willing to make a distinction between ordinary people and security personnel as long as they could scalp a few policemen.        
	Azad said as much, telling reporters that his organisation had warned civilians and the tribal people of Bastar of the consequences of travelling on buses along with the police, CRPF jawans or the SPOs.        
	We had issued circulars and also warnings that they should keep away from buses and lorries ferrying government forces. They did not listen and paid a heavy price, he said.        
	The dismissive response is a change in the Maoist stand. Earlier, the Naxalite leaders were more tolerant and responsive to public reaction. In the early 90s for example, the Maoists (then of the Peoples War Group) had torched some coaches of a local passenger train, targeting policemen in Andhra Pradesh. A few civilians were killed while policemen in other bogies had escaped unhurt. Not only had the Maoists apologised, they had also offered to pay compensation to the families of the civilians killed.        
	A few years later, the Maoists had identified some landlords as police informers and killed them but later realised that it was a mistaken identity. Then PWG top gun Ramakrishna had issued an apology and declared that they accepted the blame and were ready to pay penalty to the affected families.        
	Azad, who harped on the war against the state, instead offered a token apology in his conversation with the reporters.         
	We are sorry they (the civilians) got killed in the blast as we targeted only the SPOs who were being trained to become the eyes and ears of the security forces in villages and work against us, he said.        
	The SPOs are believed to have boarded the bus somewhere between Dantewada and Chingawaram, probably too tired to make the journey by foot as required under the standard operating procedures.        
	Azads defence is in line with a document issued by the Janadhan Sarkar (peoples government) run by the Naxalites in the forest-bound districts of Chhattisgarh that laid down strict dos and donts for the local people coinciding with Operation Green Hunt in the state.        
	The Telegraph had accessed the document, which framed strict rules for the civilians. Among them:        
	 Do not mix with jawans or police        
	 Do not invite them to villages for festivals or any social events         
	 Do not provide them food or shelter         
	 Report their movements and destinations to Janadhan Sarkar         
	 Keep track of number of policemen and also the firearms they carry        
	 Do not give any service to security forces  cooking food, giving water and transporting their goods        
	 Do not travel in vehicles of either police or the CRPF        
	Avoid travelling with police, SPOs or the CRPF in private buses or lorries        
	Quoting the circular, Azad said most tribals were aware of the consequences of flouting the guidelines. We are in a war with government forces who have swarmed our forests. The government is leasing out lands of the poor tribals to multinationals for commercial exploitation, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | FIR after Aligarh professor death
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      FIR after Aligarh professor death
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 10: Denied a hearing when alive, Professor R. Srinivas Siras might yet win the battle against his tormentors who had hounded him out of his university for being gay.        
	Police last night filed an FIR against all the suspects the late Aligarh Muslim University professor had named in a petition for breaking into his house early in February and clicking him with another man allegedly in the nude.        
	The action came four days after chief judicial magistrate Shyam Lal Kori ordered the police to register the complaint they had refused to accept when Siras was alive.         
	Yes, we registered an FIR on the order of the court last night, Aligarh City SP Mahendra Singh Chauhan said.         
	In his complaint, Siras  who was due to retire this year after over 20 years at AMU  had accused seven persons, including the university proctor and three top officials, of forcing their way into his campus home on February 8 and clicking him with the young man. Two days later, on February 10, AMU authorities suspended Siras for homosexual acts on the campus and forced him to leave his official residence.        
	Although Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on April 2, the court order reached the university on April 8, a day after the professor, who had gone into a depression, was found dead in a rented house. Sirass lawyer Satendra Singh Chauhan told The Telegraph the professor moved the petition on March 15 after the police kept turning him away.         
	The magistrates order came over three weeks later on April 6, the last day Siras had gone to the university only to be turned back on the ground that the high court order staying his suspension had not reached AMU yet.        
	Police sources said the FIR alleged charges of conspiracy, trespass, attempt to defame a person and criminal intimidation. AMU proctor Zubair Khan; PRO Rahat Abrar, deputy proctor Fareed Ahmed Khan and media adviser N.A.K. Dhurani have been accused of conspiracy to defame Siras.        
	Syed Ali Murtaza and Aashu Malik, both local journalists, and a third unidentified person who accompanied them have been booked for wrongful trespass, confinement, intimidation and use of criminal force.        
	Investigators probing Sirass death said they had seized two laptops of the dead professor but his mobile phone was missing. His estranged wife Mansi and his brother Sanjeev Ramchandra claimed the professor could not have committed suicide.

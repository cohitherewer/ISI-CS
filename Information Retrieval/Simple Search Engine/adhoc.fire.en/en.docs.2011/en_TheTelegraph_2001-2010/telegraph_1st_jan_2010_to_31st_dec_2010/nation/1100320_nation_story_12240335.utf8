          SANJAY K. JHA                       Mani Shankar Aiyar                          
	New Delhi, March 19: The President today nominated five eminent persons to the Rajya Sabha, one of them being Mani Shankar Aiyar.        
	Although politicians have been included in the nominated category in the past, Aiyars name generated much curiosity in political circles. He is not merely a Congress member but has been an integral part of the high command, a parliamentarian, a minister and, to some, even infamous for his fierce partisan politics.        
	Party leaders, however, dont think Aiyars selection is surprising. They see in the nomination Sonia Gandhis eagerness to utilise his intellectual prowess in Parliament and, possibly even in the government.        
	Aiyar had emerged as a balancing factor in the first UPA regime by fearlessly articulating his views against reckless economic liberalisation and a pro-America slant advocated by many in the Manmohan Singh cabinet.         
	Aiyar is a known Rajiv loyalist who enjoys the blessings of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. What has raised eyebrows in Congress circles is that Sonia chose this unusual route to get Aiyar in despite knowing the Prime Ministers dislike for him.        
	Aiyar had openly criticised several policies of the first UPA. Congress leaders feel his entry into the Rajya Sabha could affect the internal dynamics of the government  a job as a minister sooner or later cannot be ruled out.        
	He is the first active politician to be nominated by the government, which had earlier brought in Shyam Benegal, Shobhna Bharatiya, M.S. Swaminathan, Ashok Ganguly, H.K. Dua and Kapila Vatsyayan. The four others nominated today are Ram Dayal Munda, Bhalchandra Mungekar, B. Jayashree and Javed Akhtar.         
	Usually, politicians dont find a place in this group. Indira Gandhi had nominated active Congress leader Maragatham Chandrasekhar in 1970 and again in 1976.         
	The BJP too violated the norm by first nominating Ram Jethmalani and then Hema Malini, both active party members.        
	Among the other members nominated today, Mungekar is seen as the Prime Ministers choice. A Dalit, an economist and a former vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, Mungekar was brought to the Planning Commission by Singh. Ironically, Mungekar was initially opposed to economic reforms and was a critic of Singhs policies but changed his views after the UPA focused on agriculture and the common man.         
	Lyricist and poet Akhtar has been in the political circuit for long and his selection also fulfils the Muslim criteria. Jayashree, an actress and a musician, is from Karnataka. She became close to Sonia after attending a cultural programme of the Congress.        
	Munda, a former vice-chancellor of Ranchi University, is a social activist from Jharkhand. But Munda too had floated his own party, contested elections and then joined the Congress.

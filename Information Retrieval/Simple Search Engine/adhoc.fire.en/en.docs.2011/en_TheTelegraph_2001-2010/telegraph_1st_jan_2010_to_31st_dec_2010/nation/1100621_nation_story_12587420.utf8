  - Scam kingpin in net for second time        G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                    
	Hyderabad, June 20: Last Thursday was not the first time that Arun Kumar Jagannatham, alleged kingpin of the railway recruitment exam scam, was arrested with son Srujan on the charge of selling question papers, his former colleagues said today.        
	Both father and son had been arrested on the same charge in 1990, when Jagannatham was deputy chief operating manager of South Central Railway, but were let off for apparent want of evidence.        
	He was a power broker, a very PR-type character who ingratiated himself with almost every one of his seniors and wangled favours from them left and right, a former South Central Railway official said.        
	Over the past two decades, Jagannatham has repeatedly fallen under suspicion in connection with recruitment rackets but could not be prosecuted on criminal charges because of his political links, the official added.        
	Some of his former colleagues say that in the past 10 years, Jagannatham has bought six flats in Hyderabad and three plots in upscale Jubilee Hills. He is also alleged to have bought several plots in Bangalore and Mysore.        
	He may also have purchased some fish tanks and coconut farms in the Krishna and East Godavari districts, a former railway official said.        
	He added: During the recruitment exam for assistant loco pilots in 1990, one of the applicants was caught with a question paper. He said he had bought it from Jagannathams son for Rs 10,000. Jagannatham apparently made over Rs 37 lakh from the racket.        
	Jagannatham had worked as principal of the zonal railway training institute of South Central Railway and also as the zones deputy chief operating manager.        
	During both stints, there were several allegations of malpractice against him, the official said. But the only punishment the railways could hand him was a transfer to South Eastern Railway with a demotion, thanks to the patronage he enjoyed.        
	At the time of his arrest on Thursday, Jagannatham was additional divisional railway manager (Raipur) with South East Central Railway but was working on assignment as chief executive officer of South Central Railways Hasan-Mangalore Railway Development Corporation.        
	CBI sources said they were questioning Jagannatham and evaluating his personal wealth and that of his relatives. At least four members of his family, apart from Jagannatham and his son, are believed to have been involved in the racket and CBI sources said a quarrel among some of them over their share of the spoils had led to the ring being busted.         
	The CBI has arrested two other railway officials at Raipur  including Sanjay, personal assistant of the divisional railway manager raising the number of arrests to 10. They have been brought to Hyderabad.

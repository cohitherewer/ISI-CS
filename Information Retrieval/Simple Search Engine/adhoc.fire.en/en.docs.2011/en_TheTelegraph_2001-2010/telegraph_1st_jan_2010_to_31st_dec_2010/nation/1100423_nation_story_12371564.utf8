The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Munde bares BJP cracks on Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Munde bares BJP cracks on Maoists
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 22: The BJP appears divided on tackling Maoists, a week after the party accused the ruling Congress of speaking in many voices.        
	BJP leader Gopinath Munde today said in the Lok Sabha that Naxalism could not be crushed without development, an assertion at odds with party colleague Arun Jaitleys suggestion last Thursday that an offensive should come first.        
	It is correct for us to conduct operations and battle guns with guns, but this is not possible without development because we must think about why the villagers (who turn rebels) pick up guns in the first place, Munde said.        
	If we want to end the Naxalite menace, we must develop the tribal areas where Naxalites are dominant. Only development can solve this problem. There is no alternative. The question is, is the government ready? he said, speaking on the general demand for grants of the rural development ministry in the budget.        
	Last week, Jaitley had argued that development was impossible till the rebels were crushed almost echoing the argument given by home minister P. Chidambaram in the wake of the Dantewada massacre of jawans.        
	The BJP leader had dubbed Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyar, and railway minister Mamata Banerjee, half-Maoists for their criticism of Chidambarams tough approach. Maoism is not a poverty eradication scheme, Jaitley had said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong seeks attack probe on RSS
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong seeks attack probe on RSS
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 16: The Congress today demanded a thorough and in-depth investigation into revelations that suggest RSS functionaries were involved in terror acts.        
	We need to get to the bottom of this and unearth the whole truth, Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said.         
	She expressed concern that the representatives of an organisation claiming to be nationalist in character were involved in terrorism at a time the entire nation was engaged in fighting the threat.         
	Natrajan turned to the BJP too, saying it should offer an explanation as it had defended such elements in the past and dubbed Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare  slain during 26/11  as an anti-national for probing plots by alleged Hindu radicals.        
	L.K. Advani too had come to the defence of Pragya Singh Thakur, accused of involvement with Hindutva outfit Abhinav Bharat in the Malegaon blasts, Natrajan said. The RSS should explain the role of its leaders, she added.        
	Later, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh stepped up the tirade. I am not blaming the whole of the RSS or the BJP. But there are elements in the Sangh Parivars outfits who believe in violence against Muslims and have made and exploded bombs.        
	Several agencies are probing attack cases in different states but now the Union home ministry should co-ordinate them, Digvijay said. The suggestion was that the cases be handed over to the National Investigation Agency.        
	Singh singled out former Delhi BJP MP B.L. Sharma Prem, who was purportedly shown in a TV sting operation saying he supported terror attacks by Hindu radicals. What Prem has been shown speaking on a television channel is a clear example. He should be arrested immediately.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP on Big B side, Amar deals a jab 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP on Big B side, Amar deals a jab 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Jaya Bachchan (left) and Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: The equations that the Bachchans have in the capitals political circuit have shown signs of change as the Congress insistently cornered Bollywoods first family.        
	The BJP sprang to the familys defence after Amitabh Bachchans son, actor Abhishek Bachchan, was excluded from a Delhi government show yesterday at the last minute. But Amar Singh, who was part of the Bachchan clan, made it plain he did not approve of Jaya Bachchan continuing in the Samajwadi Party after he was booted out.         
	He invoked a wistful line from a Geeta Dutt song to get the point across to the Bachchans: Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam, hum rahe na hum (Times ways are so quirky, neither are you what you used to be nor am I what I was).        
	Amars discomfort with Jaya was apparent in a blog he posted on his website, www.thakuramarsingh.com late last night.         
	The former Samajwadi general secretary wrote that even after Amitabh accepted Narendra Modis offer to become Gujarat tourisms brand ambassador, the secular Samajwadi retained Jaya as a Rajya Sabha MP while expelling him and Jaya Prada. Of course, she said Amar Singh inducted her in the Samajwadi and the party did him wrong, he wrote.        
	In an informal chat with some journalists on Friday, Jaya was non-committal on whether she would stay on in the Samajwadi and whether she would like another Rajya Sabha term after her present one ended in July. She also said Amar should have suffered a bit and continued in the Samajwadi.        
	Today, while addressing a meeting in New Delhi, Amar said: Listen Jayaji, I dont know where you are (politically). I want to tell you that your brother-in-law was insulted. Mohan Singh (Samajwadi general secretary) said Jaya Bachchan is just a showpiece and all film actors are just actors.        
	The BJP lost no time in seeing how it could take advantage of the political churning.        
	Its spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman in a statement said the Congress was unabashed in practising untouchability that can only come out of its fascist character.        
	The way in which a well-known artiste belonging to an eminent and scholarly family is being targeted is revealing. Just because Amitabh Bachchans family has differences with one Congress family, the entire party, and even the governments in states where they are in power, are keen not to be seen on one platform with him, said Nirmala.

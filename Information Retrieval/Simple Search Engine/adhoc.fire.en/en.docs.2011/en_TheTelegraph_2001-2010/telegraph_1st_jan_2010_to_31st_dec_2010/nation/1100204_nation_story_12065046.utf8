          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Feb. 3: Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh today drove into a Muslim-dominated heartland village still seething at the arrest of an alleged terror suspect as his party came under attack for opening an old wound for political gain.        
	The visit to Sanjarpur came two days after Uttar Pradesh police arrested local youth Shehzad Ahmad, an accused in the September 2008 blasts in Delhi and the Batla House shootout six days later.        
	The encounter, where two natives of Sanjarpur were shot dead, had led to a crackdown on the village and Azamgarh, where it is located, with police picking up at least a dozen suspects from the district branded a terror hub.        
	Dubbed a hot spot of Muslim politics, Sanjarpur simmered in cold fury today as the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister reached the village, 260km from Lucknow, on what he called was a fact-finding mission.        
	Leaders of clerical body Ulema Council, however, said the visit was a political eyewash and waved black flags as the Congress leader got down from his car and walked towards the village.        
	S.P. Maurya, the state president of the ruling BSP, said the Congress was desperate to create tension and get political mileage out of it. This is another Congress-type gimmick.         
	Digvijay, the AICC general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, said he wanted to find out the truth behind the series of youngsters named in terror attack cases.        
	The representatives of the families of the terror suspects from Azamgarh had met me and said no one visited them to listen to their problems, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said after his visit to the village where authorities had declared a curfew fearing trouble.        
	Congress veterans in the state, however, said the party was trying to win back Muslim support after the communitys umbilical cord with the Samajwadi Party weakened recently.        
	Two months ago, Rahul Gandhi had visited Aligarh Muslim University, considered a crucible of minority politics.        
	In Sanjarpur, Digvijay met some relatives of the arrested suspects and spoke with them for about an hour. I thought I could at least give them a patient hearing. I am just trying to find out what had happened in the past which led to Azamgarh being named in terror attacks. It would be a kind of fact-finding, he said.        
	Ulema Council general secretary Tahir Madni said the visit was the height of hypocrisy. We have been demanding a CBI probe into the shootout at Batla House. That was not met. And here is another Congress politician pretending to give a healing touch. We dont want words. We want justice, he said.        
	Digvijay and other Congress leaders have backtracked from their assurance to conduct judicial and CBI probes into the Batla House encounter, Madni said. They (Congress leaders) are not coming to console family members of those who have been implicated in false terror cases, their visit is driven by politics.        
	Senior BJP leader Hridaynarayan Dixit said the Congress was desperate to play vote-bank politics.

	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Chief minister Nitish Kumar arrived in the national capital today, pursued by twin troubles: the prospect of drought conditions intensifying across the state and the even more worrisome thought of influential caste groups  Rajputs and Bhumihars in the main  deserting him in the Assembly elections due in October-November.         
	In a short meeting this morning, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh assured Nitish that a central team would visit the state to assess the drought damage but made no promise on the Rs 5,000-crore aid package demanded by Bihar.         
	Although he enjoys a good personal rapport with the Prime Minister  he even received praise for his governance record from Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi ahead of the last Lok Sabha polls  Nitish has consistently complained of step motherly treatment from the Centre on the funds front. His case for a special economic package for Bihar on the lines of the sanctions made for Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh, is still pending in New Delhi.         
	The Nitish government has declared 28 of the 38 districts drought-hit because of deficient rainfall. Many of these districts happen to be in north and north-west Bihar, the states rich rice-bowl region.         
	Stating that Bihar was under a severe drought situation, Nitish told mediapersons after meeting the Prime Minister that the government was keeping a watch on the remaining 10 districts where, too, rainfall has been scattered this monsoon. We may have to declare them drought-hit as well, Nitish said, adding that central financial assistance would be urgently required to bail the state out.         
	This is the fourth successive year that Bihar has been hit hard by natures vagaries; floods claimed huge loss of lives and property in 2007, 2008 and 2009, this year it has suffered the excesses of an unrelentingly dry monsoon.         
	Nitish is in the capital essentially to attend a key two-day national executive session of the Janata Dal (United) during which the partys strategy for the forthcoming Assembly elections will be discussed.         
	Nitish, who heads the only government run by the Dal (U), has said that development and social peace will be the chief electoral planks of the party and claimed that a cross-caste Bihari identity, as opposed to caste-based identity, will come to the fore in the polls.         
	Bitter differences with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi looked at one point like rupturing ties between Nitish and the BJP, but it appears that the allies have now got over that crisis.         
	There is an unstated, but firm, understanding that Modi will not campaign in Bihar and the local BJP unit will conduct its affairs within the parameters dictated by Nitish.         
	Nitishs real problems lie within rather than without. The Dal (U) is increasingly worried over possible erosion of its upper-caste vote base because of policy and personality differences that have arisen in recent months.         
	Speculation that the Nitish government is planning a comprehensive land redistribution effort has led to disaffection among sections of the Dal (U)-BJP combines rural upper-caste base.         
	Nitish has described the land redistribution issue as a phantom that the Opposition is unnecessarily invoking but it is true that he had set up a high-level committee on the issue last year. The committee recommended various steps that were quickly put in the cold storage because they were considered politically damaging by the JD (U) leadership.         
	At a personality level, Nitish has soured his relations with colleagues belonging to politically influential upper castes such as Rajputs (former MP Prabhunath Singh) and Bhumihars (former state Dal (U) chief Lallan Singh). Another former Rajput Dal (U) leader, Digvijay Singh, had turned anti-Nitish before the Lok Sabha polls, contested the Banka seat as an independent, and won.         
	Following Digvijays sudden death in London in June, Nitish made attempts to woo his widow back to the party, but in vain. There is a general sense that Rajputs and Bhumihars, who voted for the Dal (U) wholesomely in the last elections have turned against him, said a Bihar observer, And Nitish Kumars efforts to win them back have borne no fruit. It is a matter of serious worry for Nitish as he prepares for elections.         
	Nitish has been making backdoor attempts to woo Rajput support back  his visit to the family of indicted former MLA Anand Mohan Singh was seen as part of the effort  but to little effect.         
	Anand Mohan, sources indicate, is likely to strike an informal deal with Nitishs formidable adversary, Lalu Prasad of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Digvijay Singhs widow too has spurned overtures from Nitish and is most likely to contest the Banka Lok Sabha by-elections as an independent supported by the RJD.         
	Lalu Prasad, for whom the coming polls will be a make-or-break battle, is also said to be wooing Prabhunath Singh and should he join hands with the RJD, the former Bihar chief ministers challenge to Nitish will become bolder.

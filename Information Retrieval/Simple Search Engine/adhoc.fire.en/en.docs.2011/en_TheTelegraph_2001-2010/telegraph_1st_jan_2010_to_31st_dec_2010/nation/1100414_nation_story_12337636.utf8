The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress pressure on Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress pressure on Mamata
          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 13: Bengal Congress leaders today complained about Mamata Banerjees arrogance and protested in unison against her rigid stand on the partys claim for seats in the 81 civic bodies going to the polls next month.         
	At a meeting with state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee in Delhi today, they said asserting themselves before the civic polls was the only way of ensuring bargaining power ahead of the 2011 Assembly elections.         
	Mukherjee concurred and the Congress faxed a two-page missive to the Trinamul Congress chiefs home, requesting her to accept its claim to 51 of the 141 Calcutta Municipal Corporation seats.        
	The letter also requested her to meet state Congress leaders by Saturday to carry forward the seat-sharing talks.         
	The Left Front will release its list of candidates by Thursday.        
	The Opposition may still have a long way to go. Mamata had last week told Congress leaders she could not offer 51 seats in Calcutta if some of its leaders opposed the alliance in districts like Nadia, Murshidabad and Malda, where the Congress is on a stronger footing.         
	Todays Congress meeting decided to tell Trinamul it deserved all the seats where its candidates had come first and second in 2005.        
	The meeting followed state Congress leaders briefing to the their boss Mukherjee about Mamatas unwillingness to collaborate.         
	Mukherjee wrapped up the meeting by saying district Congress leaders were free to decide whether to tie up with Trinamul or fight the civic polls independently. Try to carry on the dialogue with your Trinamul counterparts. If the first round fails, go for a second or third round. But if the alliance does not work out despite our best efforts, field our candidates as a last resort, a Congress leader quoted Mukherjee as saying.        
	Mukherjee was not available for comment. State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said from Delhi: Pranabda had to give a free hand to the district leaders on not aligning with Trinamul after all of us spoke in unison against the manner in which we were being denied seats.         
	Insiders said not just leaders like Deepa Das Munshi, Adhir Chowdhury, Shankar Singh and Abdul Mannan, who have no love lost for Mamata, but also those like Subrata Mukherjee and Maya Ghosh protested Mamatas arrogance.        
	Chowdhury asserted that he would not offer any seat to Trinamul in Murshidabad and Singh threatened to do the same if the ally fielded 16 Congress deserters for the Ranaghat municipality.

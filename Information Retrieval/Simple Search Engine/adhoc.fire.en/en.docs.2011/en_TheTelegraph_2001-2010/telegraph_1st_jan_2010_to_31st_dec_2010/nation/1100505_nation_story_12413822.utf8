          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 4: The countrys apex body of churches has launched a fresh attack on the right to education law, describing proposed amendments aimed at addressing its concerns as unacceptable and threatening legal action against the government.         
	The amendments proposed by the government are totally unacceptable and do not solve our concerns at all. If our concerns are not taken into account, the Christian community may be forced to approach the Supreme Court for justice, Father Kuriala Chittattukalam, education secretary of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), said.         
	The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, implemented from April 1, requires all schools to establish a school management committee (SMC) that will oversee the administration of the school.         
	Guardians of students shall constitute 75 per cent of each committee with the remaining 25 per cent members consisting of local elected representatives and select personalities with the school principal as a convener.         
	Since the majority of students in most Christian schools in India are from other communities, the CBCI and other groups were concerned that 75 per cent guardians would hand control of such schools to non-Christians.         
	This, they argued, would be in violation of their constitutional rights to start and administer their own institutions.         
	Responding to the concern, the human resource development ministry earlier in this Parliament session introduced amendments to the law declaring that the committees would have only an advisory role in minority-run schools.         
	But the proposed amendment will merely lead to a duplicity of management bodies in charge of the school. Even with an advisory role, politicians on the SMC can try and pressurise us to do what they want. Why should we consider the advice of an SMC, Chittattukalam said.         
	The decision to reject the amendments was taken at a meeting of representatives of the CBCI across the country today. The CBCI is not only the largest Catholic group in the country but also represents most churches that run associated schools.         
	The CBCI today also decided to dare the governments will to implement the law in its current form, refusing to comply with a key provision for the recognition of schools.         
	The right to education law also requires all existing schools to seek re-recognition within three months of the law coming into force.         
	All schools associated with churches shall boycott this requirement. Why should schools that have existed as recognised institutions for over a century seek re-recognition, asked Chittattukalam.

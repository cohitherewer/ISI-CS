The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Parallel school bump

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 29: The Left Front governments efforts to fast-track its bill that creates a parallel school board in Bengal have been stalled, at least for another 18 days.        
	The government had pulled out the stops to hasten the bills clearance and get it passed tomorrow, the scheduled last day of the budget session. But the plan went awry after a report in The Telegraph raised concerns about the future of the students of the new primary and secondary education board, to be run by the panchayat and rural development department, which lacks the expertise for the job.        
	Amid protests against the bill from the Opposition and even some Left MLAs, Deputy Speaker Bhaktipada Ghosh today set a fresh date for the bills introduction.        
	However, the bill can be tabled on August 16 instead of having to wait till mid-December for the winter session to begin: the House business advisory committee today extended the ongoing session till August 16, with an adjournment between July 31 and August 15.        
	Earlier, the Assembly standing committee on panchayat and rural development, which was asked to look into the bills provisions only yesterday, almost set a record for promptness by clearing it today in toto.        
	The government wanted to get it passed tomorrow. But as the Opposition members are not happy with the provisions, the standing committee will have another look. The Speaker too will hold a meeting in the interim to explore the possibility of a consensus, a CPM member of the Assembly said.        
	The bill is a vote-winner because it will create 56,000 full-fledged teaching jobs in sishu siksha kendras and Madhyamik siksha kendras. However, since it threatens to condemn the new boards students to an inferior schooling system, it has failed to please many in the Lefts own education bodies.        
	We were not consulted. Now that we have got some time, we will try to stall its passage, said a leader of the All Bengal Teachers Association, the powerful Left teachers lobby.        
	The Trinamul education cell chairman, Manik Bhattacharya, said: We are determined to stall the bills passage and will intensify our protests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rs 2200-crore slash on Sibal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rs 2200-crore slash on Sibal

	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Development in education will miss the target this year after the human resource development ministry has had Rs 2,200 crore of its budgetary allocation for 2010-11 cut for non-utilisation of funds.        
	The finance ministry this month slashed Rs 1,200 crore from the Rs 11,000 crore allocated for higher education, while Rs 1,000 crore was cut from the Rs 35,000 crore allocated for elementary education.        
	The cuts were imposed because of slow release of funds for various schemes to states and institutions.        
	The HRD ministry is supposed to release 42 per cent of the allocated funds to institutions and state governments by September. But the actual release was 33 per cent. As a result, the finance ministry imposed the cut, a top source said.        
	The HRD ministry failed to release the funds on time because the target institutions and states had not utilised the money granted in the beginning of this fiscal.        
	The release of funds for Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan and Sakshar Bharat, schemes that were started in the past year, has been far below expectations. Allocation of funds for expansion of infrastructure in higher education institutions is also below, the source said.        
	The funds cut would slow down development and the creation of new institutions, the source added.         
	Sixteen central universities, eight IITs, six IIMs, 10 National Institutes of Technology and 20 Indian Institutes of Information Technology are in the process of being set up.        
	However, allocation of funds for Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, the main scheme for implementation of the right to education law, and the midday meal scheme has been on target. So these would not be affected.         
	The budgetary allocation for education was increased from Rs 36,400 crore in 2009-10 to Rs 46,033 crore in 2010-11.        
	Many new schemes and institutions, which have been planned, are yet to be started. That may be a reason for slow utilisation of funds, a ministry official said.         
	Giving an example, the official said Rs 40 crore was allocated for setting up an overarching authority and accreditation agency in higher education. Both are yet to start functioning.        
	The government last year started an education loan interest subsidy scheme, and Rs 500 crore was allotted for it. But the utilisation has been far below target, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Depression casts cloud on dry Puja
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Depression casts cloud on dry Puja
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Calcutta has to brace itself for a wet Puja if the forecast come true, and the course of a depression lying 550km off the coast of Digha this morning will determine how wet.        
	The Met office has forecast heavy rain in coastal Bengal, and cloudy skies and possible showers for parts of Calcutta on Saptami as a result of the formation in the Bay.        
	I am afraid theres bad news. Parts of south Bengal will experience heavy rain through the festival days, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	But Calcutta may still escape with only a few spells of rain because the formation  a low-pressure area on Tuesday and depression on Wednesday  is likely to intensify into a deep depression on Thursday and head towards Orissa.        
	The depression will steadily intensify into a deep depression and start moving towards Orissa on Thursday. The system will ensure a substantial amount of rain during Pujas, Debnath told The Telegraph.        
	In its present state, the formation is encouraging abundant incursion of moisture from the Bay into the atmosphere over south Bengal. The moisture has resulted in the formation of thunderclouds, which are likely to bring thundershowers till at least Ashtami (Friday) afternoon.        
	Given the present situation, spells of rain are quite likely in Calcutta till Friday afternoon. Coastal Bengal, especially East and West Midnapore, are likely to see a washout. Other parts of south and north Bengal are also likely to experience rain till then, said the weatherman.        
	The Met office has issued an alert for fishermen against venturing into high seas.        
	If the system continues to intensify after turning into a deep depression, a cyclonic storm is also a possibility. It is a little early to predict a cyclonic storm as of this evening.         
	But the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. A clearer picture will emerge by Thursday evening. There is no reason to panic just yet, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Delhi.        
	The worst-case scenario involves the depression changing course and veering north-east towards Bengal.        
	As of Wednesday evening, it is almost certainly headed for Orissa, said the IMD official.        
	If the formation stops intensifying, its impact would be reduced.        
	If there is no further intensification, south Bengal and Calcutta would escape with no more than a few spells of rain during the Pujas, with a general cloud cover hanging over the city. But the intensification is very much on the cards, said .P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	Meteorologists said the rainfall in the city could come down after Ashtami afternoon if the system dissipates following landfall in Orissa.         
	That, however, is an optimistic view. Rain, in varying intensities, through Pujas is the most likely scenario, said the IMD official.        
	Usually, monsoon leaves Calcutta around October 7, but like the delayed start, the exit is late this year.         
	The exit was delayed by 13 days in 2009.

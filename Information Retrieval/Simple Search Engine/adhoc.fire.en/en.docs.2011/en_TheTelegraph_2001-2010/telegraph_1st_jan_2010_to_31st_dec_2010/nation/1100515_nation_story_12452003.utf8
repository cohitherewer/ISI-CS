	Shillong/Guwahati, May 14: At least two persons were killed today when Assam police opened fire after a clash between two groups at Langpih (Lampi in Assam) on the Assam-Meghalaya border.         
	Unconfirmed reports put the toll at seven.         
	K.P. Pangniang, a member of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, told reporters in Shillong: An altercation broke out between Khasis and Nepalis around 11.30am. As the skirmish snowballed, the Nepalis went to an Assam police camp. The personnel fired indiscriminately for 30 minutes.         
	Pangniang said seven people were killed. He named five of the dead as Dismus Rani, Columbus Hujon, Charles Lyngkhoi, Detrus Nongsiej and Bring. A man is still lying inside the boundary of the Assam police camp and a schoolgirl died after she was allegedly taken inside the camp, he said.         
	But Kamrup police chief Partha Sarathi Mahanta said two persons had died.

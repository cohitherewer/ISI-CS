The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CAT firm admission

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 8: The test service provider for the Common Admission Test for the IIMs today admitted for the first time that inadequate pre-test rehearsals at testing centres were responsible for the glitches that plagued the 2009 examination.         
	Substandard infrastructure at some test centres, which went unchecked before the 2009 CAT, led to glitches that almost pushed the IIMs into cancelling their first computerised admission test, service provider Prometric said today.        
	The below-par infrastructure allowed computer viruses to cripple networks at 13 per cent testing centres, leaving thousands of students disadvantaged as they appeared for the CAT, senior Prometric executives said.        
	The problem was not our inability to conduct the CAT on a large scale. There were problems at specific testing centres where the infrastructure could not stop the viruses, Charles Keenan, Prometric chief operating officer told reporters here.        
	Keenan and Dave Meissner  a vice-president at Prometric  argued that the glitches were a result of the lack of uniform infrastructure standards across testing centres.        
	Pressed, they conceded that different testing centres had different levels of preparation for preventing virus attacks  the first time CAT 2009 organisers have accepted that all centres were not equally ready.        
	They also accepted that more rigorous pre-CAT rehearsals at all testing centres could have helped minimise the risk of test-day problems.        
	Common standards of protection against virus attacks could help ensure that 2010 does not see a repeat of the 2009 CAT, Meissner said.

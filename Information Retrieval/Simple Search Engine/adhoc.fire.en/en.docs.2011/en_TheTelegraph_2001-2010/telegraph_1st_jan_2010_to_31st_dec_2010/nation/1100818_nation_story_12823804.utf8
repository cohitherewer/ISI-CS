          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 17: The Mayavati regime sprung a land compensation deal on agitating Uttar Pradesh farmers around midnight on Monday but the angry protesters have refused to play ball.        
	Pushed to a corner after police firing on farmers on Saturday, the government said it was willing to raise the amount for every square metre of land acquired for the Yamuna Expressway from Rs 449 to Rs 570. But a section of the farmers, led by Randev Choudhary, said the money was not enough.        
	We will not stop till we are offered Rs 800 per square metre. Most farmers will be on the streets once they give up their land. We need money to fall back on, Choudhary, who is squatting at Tappal village on the border of Aligarh and Mathura district along with nearly 2,000 farmers, said.        
	Late on Monday night, Uttar Pradesh cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh, two ministers and additional DGP Brij Lal had landed at the Aligarh farmers protest site to strike a deal with them. They had even got Rambabu Kateria  the farmer leader whose arrest on Saturday sparked the clash with police  to convince them but to no avail.        
	Kateria was released from jail this morning. His loyalists were initially agreeable to the deal but later changed their mind and joined ranks with Choudhary, who is being backed by the Samajwadi Party.        
	At a news conference post midnight on Monday, the cabinet secretary said: We have agreed to hike the rate by Rs 121 per square metre. Let me also clarify that if any farmer wishes to withdraw his consent, he is free to do so.        
	Taking the cue from the Aligarh farmers, counterparts in Agra today hiked their rates. Saying the Rs 476 per sqm being offered to them was not enough, over 600 farmers blocked the Delhi-Agra highway, set fire to passing vehicles and clashed with the police.        
	Akhilesh Singh, the state Samajwadi chief, said: The agitation of the farmers will continue. The farmers have lost faith in the Mayavati government.

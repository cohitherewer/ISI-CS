The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist threat forces marathon Bihar polls
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist threat forces marathon Bihar polls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: When the Maoists abducted four policemen in Lakhisarai last week, they also unknowingly held the upcoming Bihar polls hostage.        
	The Election Commission today announced a marathon Assembly election schedule, a month-long, six-phase exercise from October 21 to November 20.        
	Sources said the commission was forced into a last-minute review of the schedule by the eruption of Maoist activity, and added two more phases to the planned four. This was dictated mainly by concerns over adequate security deployment in sensitive areas.        
	Some in the Bihar Congress wanted a much more compact election, perhaps a two-phase affair. The Nitish Kumar government, though, has been insisting that fair polls cannot be ensured unless the process is broken up into at least four phases.        
	Hours before chief election commissioner S.Y. Qureishi announced the dates, Nitish had pointedly demanded optimum security presence at each polling station so people can cast their votes without fear.        
	Sources said the commission had been considering a four-phase election, starting after Dussehra and concluding before the Chhath festival on November 11. But the hostage crisis, which ended this morning with the unconditional release of the three remaining captives, not only delayed the commissions announcement, it also led to a reworked schedule.        
	Qureishi did not specifically mention the Maoist threat, referring only to the climate, festivals, academic calendar and security arrangements as the factors taken into account. He said the commission was convinced that adequate security forces were available.        
	The poll dates are October 21 (47 seats), October 24 (45 seats), October 28 (48 seats), November 1 (42 seats), November 9 (35 seats) and November 20 (26 seats).         
	The Banka Lok Sabha by-election, necessitated by the death of Independent member Digvijay Singh this summer, will be held on November 1.        
	Thirty-three of Bihars 38 districts are Maoist-affected. Since the elections will start a week after the Commonwealth Games end in Delhi, adequate central forces are likely to be available.

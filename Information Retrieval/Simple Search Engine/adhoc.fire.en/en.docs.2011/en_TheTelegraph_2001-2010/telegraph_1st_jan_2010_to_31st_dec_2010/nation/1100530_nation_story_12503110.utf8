                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mangled bodies prolong agony
          AMIT UKIL AND SUBHAJOY ROY                          Tia Halder, a six-month-old passenger on the Jnaneswari Express, at SSKM Hospital with her mother Ranjana on Saturday. Tias father Bablu Halder, a jewellery shop artisan in Mumbai, died in the crash. Her uncle Shankar Halder is missing. Sister Ria, 3, got separated from the family but was reunited.

	May 29: Some identified their loved ones by their faces, some by scraps of their clothing or a watch. But till this evening, almost 90 of the 145 mangled bodies from the Jnaneswari train tragedy remained unnamed at the Midnapore morgue.         
	It raised some families hopes, sending them on a trip to the three hospitals in Midnapore and Kharagpur where the wounded are being treated. Some even searched the hospitals in Calcutta where at least 20 of the injured have been transferred.        
	Tapas Saha said at SSKM Hospital that a relative, Rabindranath Gupta, 51, and an acquaintance, R. Mukherjee, were travelling on coach S3.        
	I have gone to all the hospitals in Calcutta and our relatives searched those in Midnapore and Kharagpur. But we didnt find them anywhere.        
	Its not clear whether Gupta and Mukherjee are alive. Since the accident, Guptas cellphone has been dead while Mukherjees has been ringing unanswered.        
	We have requested the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital authorities to do DNA tests if all else fails, SER chief medical officer D.P. Singh said.        
	Till 4pm, 95 bodies had arrived at the medical college morgue, said inspector-general of police Zulfikar Hasan. Fifty-six have been identified and 35 handed over, he said.        
	But the process remained slow and with each passing minute, the heat and humidity hastened decomposition. The stench was overbearing within 100 metres of the morgue.        
	The morgue has only 12 ice-boxes or drawers. The rest of the bodies were kept on ice slabs on the floor. Now the floor space is used up, so the bodies are still in the trucks in which they came. Thats why we and hospital staff are doing our best to quickly hand over the remains, district police chief Manoj Verma said.        
	Brothers Ayan and Chayan Burman Roy were inconsolable after identifying mother Susmitas body. Their father Asit, who is in the male surgical ward with a leg fractured in three places, has not been told about his wifes death.        
	The unidentified two-year-old for whom the chief minister had shown concern yesterday was, however, united with his injured mother today but has lost his father. His uncles and grandfather came to pick up Baby Samir, who is nursing a head wound, from the Midnapore hospital. For the first time in two days, the baby smiled when he saw his mama, Md Naushad.        
	Samir was brought to the Kharagpur State General Hospital to be reunited with his mother, who has suffered fractures in an arm and a leg.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 19: Andhra Pradesh High Court today ordered a magistrate to hand Shoaib Malik back his passport, seized by police after city girl Ayesha Siddiqui filed a case of cheating and marital cruelty against him.        
	The Pakistani cricketer is expected to receive the passport tomorrow. Sources said Shoaib and his bride Sania Mirza plan to leave for the Pakistan leg of their wedding celebrations in two or three days.        
	Justice C.V. Nagarjunas order came after Shoaib said he had settled the dispute with Ayesha, who had accused him of neither acknowledging her as his wife nor granting her a divorce. Advocate-general D.V. Sitaram Murthy informed the court that Ayesha had withdrawn the case after Shoaib formally granted her divorce before marrying Sania.        
	Shoaib, who had moved the high court on Thursday to get back his passport, was in the courtroom today with Sania. The police had seized the passport on April 5 and deposited it with the additional chief metropolitan magistrate.

  - Questions over maintaining standard operating procedures in Koraput q Posters in Bihar        NALIN VERMA      
	Patna, April 5: Two days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced the right to education, Maoists circulated hundreds of leaflets, expressing their compulsion to keep blowing up school buildings.        
	The leaflets  written in Hindi and pasted on walls and trees in villages in the rebel-hit Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Gaya and Rohtas districts  read: The peoples guerrilla army has no way out other than blowing up schools, for the central forces had been using them as their abode to launch offensive.        
	The leaflets, issued by the Son-Ganga-Vindhyachal zonal committee of the outlawed CPI(Maoist), were stated to be in response to the school childrens appeal to the Maoist uncles to spare the schools about two months ago. But they came two days after the Centre made it mandatory for the state governments to ensure free education to children below 14 years of age.        
	It is practically impossible to ensure right to education in Bihar villages under the domination of the Maoists. We have no way out other than stationing the forces in government schools or community halls for we cannot compel villagers to spare their houses for the forces, said a senior police officer, on the condition of anonymity.        
	Sources at the police headquarters said the Maoists had blown up around 30 school buildings in Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Jamui and Nawada districts in the past four months.         
	A couple of months ago, achoolchildren from Gaya and Aurangabad districts had taken out processions carrying the placards, which read: Maoist uncles. Please spare our schools for we want to study.         
	IG (operations) K.S. Dwivedi described the Maoist leaflets as a gimmick and also a ploy to justify their sin.        
	They have been targeting school buildings as part of their strategy to obliterate the symbol of the state, he said, adding: The forces will keep on acting against them.        
	Twenty-three companies of central paramilitary forces are deployed primarily in the red zones of Bihar. Besides, the state government recently got one battalion of Cobra, a special force to deal with the Maoist guerrillas, from the Centre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ministers cant pick consumer panel: SC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ministers cant pick consumer panel: SC
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 11 (PTI): Members of a consumer forum cannot be appointed in an arbitrary manner at the behest of ministers and others, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	Although a state government is not bound by recommendations of the selection committee set up to appoint such members, it will have to give valid reasons for not heeding the suggestions and the decision is subject to judicial scrutiny, the apex court said.        
	If the appointment made by the state government is subjected to judicial scrutiny, it is duty-bound to produce records, including recommendations of the selection committee, to show that there were valid reasons for not accepting the recommendation, Justices G.S. Singhvi and A.K. Ganguly said.        
	The judges set aside an order by a division bench of Kerala High Court scrapping the appointment of Chandramohan Nair as a member of the state consumer disputes redress commission.         
	Another bench of the high court had earlier upheld his appointment and dismissed the plea of K.V. Thomas, whose name was recommended by the state minister for consumer affairs. The chairman of the panel had ignored the ministers recommendation and proposed Nairs name.         
	George Joseph, a person claiming to be the general secretary of a traders body, had filed the petition against the chairmans move.         
	Nair alleged in his appeal to the Supreme Court that Joseph was acting at Thomass behest.         
	The apex court appeared to agree. His (Josephs) position was nothing more than that of a meddlesome interloper/busybody. The division bench of the high court gravely erred in entertaining the writ petition filed by him.

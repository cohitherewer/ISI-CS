The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP welcomes order, Sangh gears up
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP welcomes order, Sangh gears up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Representatives of parties to the title suits in front of the Supreme Court on Tuesday. (PTI)		    
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The BJP, like all other mainstream parties, today welcomed the Supreme Court decision not to defer the Ayodhya title suit verdict, but hardliners within the Sangh parivar geared up to renew their Ram temple campaign.         
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said the apex court had cleared the uncertainty over a matter that was pending for so many years and expressed confidence that the Allahabad High Court verdict would be accepted by all.         
	All of us have appealed for peace. We are confident that there will be no negative reaction as our people and democracy are mature, he said.         
	RSS leader Ram Madhav, too, expressed happiness and said the Supreme Court had done the right thing by dismissing the plea to defer the judgment.         
	On the face of it, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders Ashok Singhal and Praveen Togadia, too, welcomed the verdict and promised their organisation would not resort to any violence.         
	But sources said the VHP, which had already started a campaign for the Ram temple, had now geared up to intensify it after the judgment comes on Thursday.         
	The matter will go to the Supreme Court but in the meantime we will renew the campaign for a grand Ram temple. We have already drawn up plans for it, a VHP leader said.         
	 The BJPs stated position on the issue is not very different from the hardline Hindu outfits. It wants an early end to the legal process to pave the way for a grand Ram temple.         
	The party has already stated its position that it does not desire any legal delay and this verdict of the apex court has cleared the way for the verdict to be pronounced by the high court, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.         
	The party has, however, chosen to exercise restraint for now, not sure how the issue would play out. Party insiders said they would wait and watch before renewing their hardline stand on the Ram temple.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cops break 15-hr CMC gherao
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cops break 15-hr CMC gherao
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 20: Police tonight freed Calcutta Municipal Corporation commissioner Arnab Roy after breaking up a Trinamul Congress gherao that dragged on for over 15 hours.        
	The leader of the Opposition in the CMC, Javed Khan, led the protest against Roy over the civic budget.         
	The gherao, which began at 10am on Saturday, continued till 1.15am on Sunday, following which the police forcibly opened the door, jostled with the 40 councillors and freed Roy. At least 70 police constables, including women, took part in the operation.        
	The Opposition councillors were demanding Roy give them the copy of a letter that he had apparently sent to the state government seeking permission to allow the Left-led board to legalise the budget. The budget has been placed in an illegal way. The commissioner used the back door to seek permission from the government to make it legal, Khan said.         
	The councillors said the commissioner could not write to the government without taking the board into confidence.        
	Congress councillors, who walked out with the Trinamul members on March 16 when the budget was presented, extended their moral support to the gherao.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said: This (the gherao) is barbaric. How can so many people forcibly keep a person in confinement?        
	The Opposition has threatened to gherao the mayor from Monday.

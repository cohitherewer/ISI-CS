                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Duo name confusion
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 20: Two men who were allegedly detained by police in Lalgarh in December last year were produced today in a Jhargram court but with different identities.        
	Court records say the two are Prasanta Mandal and Jhantu Das, residents of Malda. But their lawyer Kaushik Sinha today claimed that the duo are Raju Adak and Joydeb Bera, allegedly picked up by Lalgarh police in December 2009.        
	The court has told the police to produce before it the families of the duo on August 24. The families will have to bring the identity proof of the duo.        
	Sinha claimed that Raju and Joydeb were Lalgarh residents and the names given by the police were false. The families claimed Raju and Joydeb were picked up on the suspicion of being Maoists.         
	But Jhargram police said the two had been arrested by Jharkhand police and had suppressed their real identity. Recently, we came to know from our sources that they were lodged in a Jharkhand jail and brought them here. They are Maoist action squad members.

	New Delhi, Jan. 13 (PTI): The downturn-hit domestic aviation sector showed a marked improvement last year with the number of passengers carried by Indian airlines growing by almost 8 per cent over 2008.        
	The number of passengers carried by domestic airlines in 2009 was 445.13 lakh as against 412.71 lakh in 2008, registering a positive growth of 7.86 per cent, official figures released today said.

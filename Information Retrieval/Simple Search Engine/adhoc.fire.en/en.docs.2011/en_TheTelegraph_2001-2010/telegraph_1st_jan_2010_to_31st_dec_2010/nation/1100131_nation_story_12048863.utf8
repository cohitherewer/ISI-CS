          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 30: The family of a major who died fighting militants has alleged discrimination after the slain armyman was awarded the Shaurya Chakra, a notch below the Kirti Chakra conferred on two civilian siblings who killed a Lashkar commander.        
	My son sacrificed his life for the nation and saved the lives of five fellow soldiers, Major Akash Singhs father Shankar Singh said. His sacrifice should have been respected.        
	Major Singh, of 5 Maratha Light Infantry, killed two top militants in Poonch last year before he fell. He was 34.        
	Jammu siblings Ruksana Kausar, 22, and her brother Aijaz Ahmad, 19, killed alleged Lashkar commander Osama on September 27 after overpowering him and snatching his gun.         
	Today, the slain majors family said they held no grudges against Ruksana for getting the Kirti Chakra. She has done a great work and is like my daughter, father Shankar Singh said.        
	Political parties, too, cried discrimination. We have learnt that his (Major Singhs) name was recommended for the Kirti Chakra but he ended up getting a Shaurya Chakra. He deserved better, said Rakesh Kak, Jammu spokesperson for the Shiv Sena.        
	The family of the dead armyman said they were perturbed by the discriminatory act. He had two kids and ageing parents but sacrificed his life for his nation, a family source said. How can the government differentiate between the bravery of the two?

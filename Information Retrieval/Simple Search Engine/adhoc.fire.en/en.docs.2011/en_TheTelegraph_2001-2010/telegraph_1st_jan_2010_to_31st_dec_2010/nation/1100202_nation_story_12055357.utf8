          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                            Vaishnavi      
	Hyderabad, Feb. 1: Kidnapped 11-year-old schoolgirl Naga Vaishnavi was found dead this evening, two days after she was taken captive for the second time in her short life.         
	Vaishnavis mutilated body was found near Guntur, about 310km southeast of Hyderabad, after a 48-hour search by the police failed to trace the young girl and her captors.        
	The Class IV student was the daughter of P. Prabhakar, a liquor merchant from Vijayawada. Vaishnavi had been kidnapped once five years ago, but was released after her parents paid a ransom.        
	On Saturday, Vaishnavi was abducted on her way to school along with her brother Sai Tejesh in their family car.        
	The kidnappers, who had come riding a motorcycle, took away Vaishnavi after killing driver Lakshman Rao (28). The criminals drove away with the girl in the same car.        
	The distraught parents said they had not received any ransom demand, and declared through television channels that they were ready to pay any amount.        
	The police had raided the home of Prabhakars first wife, who is locked in a property dispute with the family. Vaishnavi was the daughter of Prabhakar and his second wife.

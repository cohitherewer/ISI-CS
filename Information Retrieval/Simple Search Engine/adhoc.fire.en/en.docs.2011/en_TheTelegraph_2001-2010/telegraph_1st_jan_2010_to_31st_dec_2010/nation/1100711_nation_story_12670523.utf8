	Calcutta, July 10: A Bengal minister has decided to boycott a rail ministry programme tomorrow at which Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to flag off three new trains.        
	State PWD minister Kshiti Goswami told The Telegraph this afternoon that he would not participate in the railway ministers programme on principle despite being invited for it.        
	Asked if his decision was in protest against rail minister Mamatas continuing non-cooperation with the state government, Goswami said: That is up to you to interpret. But I dont like the way she is not involving the state government while undertaking development projects for the state.        
	He said he felt humiliated that he had not been consulted before his name was included in the invitation letter. I am an elected RSP MLA from Dhakuria. I should have been consulted before my name was printed among other invitees. This was humiliating.        
	Left Front sources said the immediate provocation for Goswamis boycott was yesterdays programme at which an MoU was signed between the Calcutta Port Trust, the Indian Railways and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for beautification of the Hooghly river front without any participation from the state government. Mamata and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee were present at the programme.        
	State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya of the CPM asked: How can the state government be left out when a beautification plan for 48 ghats in the Hooghly under the CMC area are being undertaken?        
	Saying that a bad precedent had been set, Bhattacharya talked tough without naming Mamata. If she does not rise above narrow politics to carry out development projects for the state, she will be paid back in her own coin.        
	He said Mamata would have a challenging job on hand if she were to win the Bengal elections next year and the Left were to sit in opposition.        
	We will have to perform our job as a responsible Opposition if we lose the polls. But it would be more challenging for her to carry out development projects as chief minister if she is unable to take the Opposition into confidence.        
	In a parliamentary democracy, the Opposition and the government should always work in tandem for the welfare of people, rising above petty politics, Bhattacharya said.        
	He cited his decision to invite Calcutta mayor Sovan Chatterjee for development talks despite his being from the rival Trinamul. Its good that Chatterjee responded to my gesture and came to discuss the citys development projects with me, he said.        
	Commenting on Mamatas style of functioning, a Trinamul leader said that even in Gujarat, Narendra Modi kept in constant touch with the Congress in the interests of better governance. Bengal is the sole exception where the Opposition does not see eye to eye with the ruling party.

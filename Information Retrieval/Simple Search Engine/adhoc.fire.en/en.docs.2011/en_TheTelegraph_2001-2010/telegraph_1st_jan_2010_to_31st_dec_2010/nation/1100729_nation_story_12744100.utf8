The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP in two minds on crippling House
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP in two minds on crippling House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: The BJP is undecided about persisting with the price rise issue in Parliament after Speaker Meira Kumar today rejected the Opposition demand for an adjournment motion.        
	The party is, however, being pressured by Bihar ally Janata Dal (United) to hold up proceedings until the Speaker agrees to a discussion.        
	BJP sources said leaders would briefly disrupt Parliament tomorrow. Around noon, they would call on the President and submit the purported 10 lakh signatures collected against the Centres failure to stem food inflation.         
	Gopinath Munde, the deputy leader of the BJP parliamentary party, said: Whether the House runs or not will be decided tomorrow morning after we talk to all. But he refused to specify who he meant by all  the NDA or the Left and its allies.        
	Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav, who has been trying to cement an anti-Congress front, said under no circumstance would he allow the BJP to give in on price rise. Who can run away from the issue? We will expose those who do this, he said.        
	He claimed his aggressive stand had forced RJD chief Lalu Prasad to tear into the government today. Even he has not run away from the issue, he said.        
	Underlying the BJPs tentativeness is the realisation that efforts to unite the Opposition were futile. The Left doesnt want to be seen openly with us because they are chasing Muslim votes in West Bengal. Lalu sounded iffy he declared he will not take dictation from another party. Mulayam (Singh Yadav) and Mayavati are equally dicey, a leader said.        
	The BJP plans to take its protest against price rise and the Centres alleged CBI misuse in Gujarat to the streets.

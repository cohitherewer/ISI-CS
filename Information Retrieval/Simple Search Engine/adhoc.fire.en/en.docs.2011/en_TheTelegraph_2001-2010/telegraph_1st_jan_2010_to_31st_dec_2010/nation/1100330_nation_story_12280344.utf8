          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, March 29: A fathers investigation into the disposal of the body of his dead son has blown the lid off an illegal trade in corpses being carried out allegedly by a section of the police in a border district of Rajasthan.        
	As many as 13 policemen, among them inspectors and sub-inspectors, in Sriganganagar district bordering Punjab and Pakistan, were charge-sheeted today for irregularities in dealing with bodies.        
	Superintendent of police Umesh Chand Dutta said a detailed probe was on, but refused to say anything more.        
	The nexus between the police and corpse collectors was uncovered after Rajkumar Soni, a jeweller in Sriganganagar, 581km from Jaipur, filed an application under the Right to Information Act on unidentified and unclaimed bodies over the last five years.        
	Soni began his quest following a search for the body of his son, 19-year-old Rahul, last year.         
	Unknown to his family, the youth had been seriously injured in a scuffle with friends on May 25 last year and was taken to the district hospital in an ambulance.         
	Rahul died early on May 26, but the family was not informed of his death. The body was marked as unclaimed in the hospital records.        
	Soni later alleged in an FIR that the district hospital did not give his son any medicine or attention and neither was any attempt made to establish his identity despite Rahuls name being tattooed on his hand.        
	V.P. Seeja, head of the district hospital, Sriganganagar, refused to comment on the allegation of negligence.        
	Soni also alleged that the police, after conducting a post-mortem in 10 minutes on May 27, handed over the unclaimed body to Tantia Medical College in Sriganganagar for experiments. This, he said, violated Section 5 of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, which says unidentified bodies cannot be disposed of before 48 hours.        
	The police, Soni added, also violated the Rajasthan Anatomical Act, 1986, which lays down a detailed procedure for disposing of unclaimed bodies, which includes issuing advertisements in local newspapers for identification of the corpse and circulating information in adjoining districts.         
	The jeweller learnt of his sons death on May 27. Soni was first told by the police that Rahuls last rites had already been performed. When the family wanted to know the cremation site to collect his ashes, they were told that his body had been handed over to Tantia hospital.        
	Soni said he got Rahuls body from Tantia Medical College on May 28.         
	In November 2009, Soni filed an RTI application with the police for detailed information on unidentified and unclaimed bodies in the last five years. He received a reply a month later that at least 23 unclaimed bodies had been handed over to two private medical colleges in Sriganganagar  Surendra Dental College and Tantia Medical College.        
	The colleges denied the allegation. Shyam Sundar Tantia of Tantia Medical College said: We follow all rules in acquiring the bodies. It is done through proper channels and all bodies given to us are properly documented. There is a limit for acquiring bodies, we cant exceed two or three in a year. Regarding Rahuls body, we had preserved it in chemicals and handed it over once his father came to claim it.        
	Sources in Sriganganagar said unofficially at least 50 such bodies had been disposed of by the cartel.         
	Soni said a young mans body fetches about Rs 5 to 6 lakh, the bones being the most sought after. He pointed out that private medical colleges in remote areas find it difficult to acquire bodies as the critical cases are usually referred to government hospitals.

	London, Aug. 5 (PTI): Manish Sood, the Indian-origin Labour candidate who was suspended for calling Gordon Brown the worst Prime Minist- er has decided to sue the party.         
	Sood said he deserved a payout of 100,000 because MPs have not been supportive following his comments. Sood is an Independent councillor from the Fosseward in Leicester.        
	He said: Never has someone been so vilified for speaking the truth. I feel like the party has completely washed its hands of me. I said Gordon Brown was the worst Prime Minister and if I was wrong why did he step down after losing the election? His comments had caused embarrassment to the Labour party which was struggling to retain power. In the May 6 election, Sood saw the party drop in Norfolk North West from second place in 2005 to third place.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US to remove curbs on high-tech exports
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US to remove curbs on high-tech exports
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: The US announced today that it would pull down key barriers that have obstructed Indias space and missile programmes from accessing dual-use high technology items from US companies and said India would be treated similar to other close allies.        
	The US will re-align India in its dual-use export control regulations to reflect Indias status as a strategic partner, effectively treating India similar to other close allies, the White House said, outlining US-India partnership on export controls and non- proliferation.         
	India and the US have also agreed to continue discussions on ways to collaborate on future lunar missions, the international space station, and human space flight, a joint statement issued tonight by the two countries said.         
	The US said it would remove all of Indias civil space and defence-related entities from the department of commerces entity list which imposed restrictions on US exports of dual-use items to these entities  four Indian Space Research Organisation centres involved in launch vehicle development and satellite launches, and four defence research laboratories involved in missile development.         
	Although current dual-use export controls affect only 1 per cent of US-India trade, the perception of onerous US export controls remains a barrier to high technology trade, the document outlining the export controls initiatives said.         
	Indias missile production house  Bharat Dyanamics Limited  which will also be removed from the entity list hopes to manufacture the Javelin anti-tank missiles, designed by the US company Raytheon under a transfer of technology pact.         
	The US also said it intends to support Indias full membership in the four multi-lateral export control regimes  the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia Group (for chemical and biological controls), and the Wassenar Arrangement (for dual-use and conventional arms controls)  in a phased manner. Each of these groups is intended to prevent proliferation of weapons systems through export restrictions.         
	Full regime membership will enable Indias active participation in setting rules for members for trade between the members and non-members, said a former space scientist. This is realistic because India is a potential exporter of nuclear items.         
	Although all its current members are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  either as nuclear weapons states, or non-nuclear weapon states  some analysts believe members of NSG do not have to be NPT signatories.         
	Under other India-US agreements, the US Centers for Disease Control will help improve Indias ability to forecast and track infectious diseases, and Indian and US scientists will work jointly on weather simulation models to improve monsoon forecasts, starting early enough to take a shot at the 2011 monsoon.         
	India will spend $480,000 (Rs 2.4 crore) and the US is expected to contribute up to $100,000 over the next five years for a monsoon desk aimed at improving accuracy of monsoon forecasts tailoring weather simulations developed in the US for the monsoon.         
	India and the US also agreed to establish a joint clean energy research centre that will mobilise $100-million public and private funding over the next five years to work toward potential breakthrough technologies in solar energy, biofuels, and building efficiency.         
	The US has also expressed its interest in Indias Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNCEP), a research-training complex that India has proposed to set up for anti-proliferation research and nuclear security studies.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 25: Police have shifted gangster Abu Salem to a different prison after Mustafa Dossa, another mafia undertrial, attacked him in Arthur Road Jail yesterday.        
	Salem, 43, was transported to Taloja jail in Raigad district late last night. Dossa too was moved from Arthur Road Jail and taken to Thane central prison late last night.        
	Salem reached Taloja jail around 2am. I could not meet him personally, but Salem was okay. The jail is very secure. Arun Gawli is also lodged there, jail officials told me, Salems lawyer Saba Qureshi said.        
	Deven Bharti, the additional commissioner (crime), said the crime branch would probe the assault incident.        
	Asked if the spoon with which Dossa slashed Salem had been sharpened with a knife, Bharti said: If the stem of the spoon is broken slightly, it would make it a sharp weapon. We will look into the aspect if the attack was premeditated.

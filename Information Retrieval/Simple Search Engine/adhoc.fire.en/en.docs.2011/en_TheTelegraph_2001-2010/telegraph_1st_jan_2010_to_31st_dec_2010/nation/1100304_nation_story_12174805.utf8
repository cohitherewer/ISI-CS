          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 3: Four tribal girls of a kanyashram in Nabarangpur district have accused three teachers, including the headmaster, of sexual assault.        
	The incident took place at Government (SSD) Upper Primary School in Bada Ambada in Kosagumuda block of the socially underdeveloped district, about 550km from the state capital.        
	In a written complaint to the district collector yesterday, the students spoke of the repeated harassment they have been facing from the teachers  headmaster Pradip Sahu, Ishwar Bhatra and Padman Bhatra.        
	Padman is reportedly the husband of the cook of the school, more popularly known as Bada Ambada Sevashram in the area where female literacy rate is quite low.        
	The students, all from Classes VII and VIII, first reported the matter to an assistant teacher and sought his help in absence of a lady teacher at the school.         
	The assistant teacher had submitted a detailed written report yesterday. District collector Rupa Mishra has asked the district welfare officer and child development project officer to inquire into the allegation, said a district-level government official.        
	The teachers, including the headmaster, were taken into police custody today for interrogation.         
	All the three teachers have been arrested and taken for medical examination. Medical examinations of the victims were also done, said investigating officer T.K. Patra of the Kosagumuda police station.        
	Whether or not the teachers are guilty can be known only after the medical reports are out. Interrogation of the accused is on, said Patra.        
	The state government-run kanyashrams are residential secondary-level schools meant for girl students, mostly tribals. Students and teachers live together within the school-cum-dormitory premises.         
	The SC/ST welfare department secretary, Ashok Tripathy, has also sought a report from district collector Mishra.        
	Disciplinary action has been taken against the teachers. The headmaster has been suspended and the two others who were working on contractual basis have been disengaged, said Tripathy.        
	The department is also mulling appointing a lady teacher and a lady supervisor in each of the 253 kanyashrams run by the department, said an SC/ST department source.

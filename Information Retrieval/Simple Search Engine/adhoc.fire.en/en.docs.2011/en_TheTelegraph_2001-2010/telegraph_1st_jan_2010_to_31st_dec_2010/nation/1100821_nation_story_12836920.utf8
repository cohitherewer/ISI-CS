          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The government gave in to the BJPs demand to drop an offending and that had yesterday threatened to upset the passage of the nuclear liability bill.        
	The word sneaked into the report of an all-party parliamentary panel that had vetted the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010, and took the BJP and the Left by surprise when it sprung up on a certain page that was clumsily stapled over the original sheet that made no mention of and.         
	Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari has ordered a probe into the mishandling of the bill report by the standing committee on science and technology.         
	With the word out of the way, the bill looks set to be passed in the ongoing session after the cabinet endorsed all the other 18 proposals made by the committee.        
	Parliamentary affairs ministry sources said in all probability, it will be first tabled in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.        
	The BJP had argued that the inclusion of the word and, linking two sub-clauses of Clause 17, would dilute the obligation of suppliers of equipment and material in the event of a nuclear disaster. It recorded its objections in a note given to the government yesterday.        
	Although the BJP had no credible answer on why the word caught the attention of its leaders such as Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Yashwant Sinha a day after the parliamentary report was released and why it waited for a news report before reacting, government sources were at pains to establish that the Opposition party was not really at fault. The BJP behaved most responsibly on the bill. We will be petulant if we picked holes in its contention, a Congress minister said.        
	The minister indicated that T. Subbarami Reddy, who headed the standing committee, was at fault. For some reason, he was keen on putting the word and even though he was told the Left would protest. However, the report was printed without this word. We were told that Reddy made a song and dance of its absence and had the page reprinted to include the and. In his zeal, he forgot to remove the original page and gave away the gaffe, the minister said.        
	Independent observers of Indias nuclear roller-coast ride, however, believed that Reddy was singled out as the fall guy. They said the world over, the nuclear industry resisted making suppliers liable for paying damages in a disaster. India is apparently finding it tough to convince old ally Russia of including a provision for a nuclear plant operators right of recourse in a contract it may sign with it.         
	Internationally, only three countries  the US, South Korea and Hungary  provide operators with right of recourse against the suppliers in the event of gross negligence, irrespective of whether the contract provides for it or not.        
	When the committee meetings were on, more than once privileged government sources expressed concern that making suppliers legally culpable might adversely impact nuclear commerce.        
	Today, however, the government stressed that the bill was pro-victim in every sense.         
	Prithviraj Chavan, the science and technology minister who will pilot the proposed legislation in Parliament, said the operators will be empowered to pursue a suppliers liability, regardless of what was contained in the contract between the two. But the operator could exercise his right of recourse only after he had paid full compensation to the victims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Air force unfurls umbrella over Games 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Air force unfurls umbrella over Games 
          SUJAN DUTTA                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: Missile defence batteries, mobile air and ground observation posts, helicopter gunships, pilotless and combat aircraft are taking over the capitals skies with the Indian Air Force (IAF) this week being detailed to pull a dome over Fortress Delhi for the Commonwealth Games.        
	Delhis airspace will be completely shutdown during the opening and closing ceremonies on October 3 and October 14.        
	Through the Games, no unscheduled flight will be allowed within a radius of 300km (a 100km more than the distance from Delhi to Jaipur) unless it is flying above 20,000 feet. An aircraft violating the norm is likely to be shot down.        
	The idea is to check, intercept and force down or chase away any unauthorised flying object within a radius of 60km from Vijay Chowk, one source said.         
	Vijay Chowk is arguably the countrys most important crossing, just at the bottom of Raisina Hill in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan, North and South Blocks.        
	The IAFs largest AD (air defence) cover for Delhi  that easily has the best military defences for any Indian city  is being mounted in the fortnight the force will celebrate its 78th anniversary.        
	The Indian Army has also put two brigades near the capital on standby (but not for deployment) while special teams from the force will supplement the IAFs AD (air defence) cover and the police to de-contaminate venues with equipment to detect signs of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) presence.        
	Indias military is being roped-in for the CWG on almost the scale that South Africa did for the FIFA World Cup.         
	The South African Air Force flew its newly-acquired Swedish-made Gripen fighter aircraft from two bases for two hours before, during and after each of the 64 World Cup matches (from June 26 to July 6)  mounting a total of 347 combat air patrols after the South African government signed an agreement with the world soccer controlling body guaranteeing military-level security for the championships.        
	But India has paramilitary forces that are deployed in Delhi in tens of thousands. Since 9/11 in New York and 26/11 in Mumbai, however, the standard of security demanded of international meets has been elevated to such levels that even Indias huge military has to show a demonstrable presence to satisfy international participants.         
	The idea is the same, said a senior air headquarters source, when asked if the AD cover being mounted was modelled on what South Africa did for the World Cup. But we have so many platforms (unlike the SAAF) that we do not have to fly combat aircraft over Delhi at all times, he added.        
	Delhis Air Defence Commander, Air Vice-Marshal S.S. Soman of the Western Air Command, is the executive in charge of the task that air headquarters detailed to western air commander, Air Marshal N.A.K. Browne and senior air staff officer Air Marshal Arup Raha.        
	The Air Force System Metric and Reporting Tool (SMART), network-centric operations platform acquired by the IAF recently, will connect batteries of Pechora launcher-mounted surface-to-air missiles, Igla shoulder-fired SAMs and OSA-AK vehicle-mounted SAMs.        
	The missile shield cover can theoretically bring down targets up to 12km but to be fully effective we use it at ranges of up to 3.5km, one officer explained.         
	At least two Sukhoi 30 and MiG 21 Bison fighter aircraft will be on an operational readiness platforms (ORP) hot standing in five IAF bases  Bhatinda, Ambala, Sirsa, and Adampur and Srinagar in Kashmir. Operational readiness platform means the aircraft should be mission-ready in 10 minutes.         
	Two pilotless Israeli-made Searcher Mark II unmanned aerial vehicles with cameras that can pick out a fire hydrant from 6000 feet in the air will fly continuous sorties over the games venues from Palam and Hindon. Mi-17IV multi-utility helicopters with medium machine guns and Mi-25/35 helicopter gunships would also fly Combat Air Patrols (CAPs). The Mi-17s are also detailed for casualty evacuation.         
	Teams from the Delhi police have been trained to act in consort with the air force in the event of an interception. The air force will also have its own mobile observation posts on the roads in the outskirts of the city.        
	The army has been detailed for four tasks: air defence with its own batteries, CBRN neutralisation, medical evacuation and long-range night surveillance. Its bomb disposal and dog squads have also been alerted.        
	The armys involvement in the games  apart from the 43 soldiers who are members of the Indian contingent for different events  is largely ceremonial. Its bands would be playing at the venues, soldiers would be supervising the flag-hoisting ceremonies (there are three flags: the national tricolour, the Commonwealth flag and the flag of Scotland that will host the next Games).        
	The army is claiming a great deal of credit already, having put up in 72 hours a 260-feet walkway bridge that collapsed near the main venue of the Games (Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium) last week.

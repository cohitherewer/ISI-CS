          ASHUTOSH MISHRA                              
	Jagatsinghpur, Sept. 18: Braving intermittent rain, the crowd at Biju Janata Dals Odisha Banchao rally here clapped and cheered lustily as the ruling party today sought to raise the pitch of its anti-Centre campaign.        
	Striking a chord for the first time after two indifferent shows at Lanjigarh and Malkangiri, the ruling party leaders trained their guns at the UPA government and Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi.        
	Rahul Gandhi claims to be the sipahi (soldier) of tribals. The Congress leader, however, has no sympathy for the Koya tribals of Malkangiri who are facing a major threat from the Polavaram project in Andhra Pradesh, higher education minister Debi Mishra said.        
	The lively crowd, consisting mostly of young men and women sporting green headbands emblazoned with anti-Centre slogans, broke into spontaneous applause each time the speakers criticised the Centre for trying to stall the Rs 52,000-crore Posco project, the biggest foreign direct investment in the country.        
	The project will generate a huge amount of revenue for the state and the Centre besides providing jobs to a large number of people, said industries minister Raghunath Mohanty.        
	Finance minister Prafulla Ghadei accused the Centre of deliberately targeting our industrialisation drive at a time when we are peaking.         
	We are today counted as the second most industrialised state of the country after Gujarat. The Congress cant tolerate this, he said.        
	Arriving at the collectorate grounds in colourful processions complete with drummers, the crowd used chairs to shield themselves from the rain. Some took shelter in the verandah of the collectorate building where work came to a virtual halt because of the noise.        
	I came because I want the Posco project to come up in this district. We want jobs for us and our children, said Silu Nayak from Majhipada in Naugaon block.        
	Dhirendra Kumar Sahu, a businessman, said people were behind the Naveen Patnaik government in its fight for Posco. For the people of Orissa, it is a prestige issue. If Posco goes, the process of industrialisation in the state may come to a standstill, he said.

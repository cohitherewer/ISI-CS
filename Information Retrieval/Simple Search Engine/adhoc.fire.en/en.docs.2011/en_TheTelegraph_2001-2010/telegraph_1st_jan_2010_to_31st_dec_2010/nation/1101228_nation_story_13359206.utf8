          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 27: Congress MPs from Telangana today began a fast demanding the withdrawal of cases lodged against students during the statehood agitation, ignoring appeals from the party-led government not to launch protests.        
	Chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy sent cabinet colleagues K. Jana Reddy and B. Saraiah to the protest venue in front of the Assembly but the nine MPs, joined by some 20 party MLAs, refused to budge till their demands were met.         
	The agitation comes four days before the release of the Srikrishna Committee report on the statehood on December 31.         
	Over 8,000 students were held in 1,667 cases between December 2009 and September 2010. On December 16 this year, 565 cases slapped against 2,436 students were withdrawn. Of this, 440 cases were filed against 1,011 persons from Telangana. But that hasnt satisfied the leaders, who have even threatened to quit their posts.        
	The Kiran Kumar Reddy cabinet held an emergency meeting this evening and announced the withdrawal of 135 more cases involving 900 persons, most of them against Osmania University students. Telangana Joint Action Committee convener, rights activist M. Kondandaram, visited the MPs. But the protest was on till tonight despite state home minister Savitha Indra Reddy speaking to the MPs.        
	Senior AICC leader and parliamentarian K. Keshava Rao, who was at the forefront of the protesters, argued that the fast was not meant to undermine the partys government but to build pressure. This is not a protest against our own government. This is only an expression of our anguish at the action against the students. The students are not hardcore criminals. This (fast) is to bring moral pressure on the government.        
	Rao expressed dissatisfaction at the cases withdrawn so far, saying they added up to only 600 and were related to minor offences. He also demanded the withdrawal of central forces from Telangana.         
	Asked if their fast had the blessings of Sonia Gandhi, Sarve Satyanarayana, another of the agitating MPs, evaded a direct answer. We have the blessings of Sonia Gandhi for every good thing, he said.        
	On the quit threat, Rao said they were firm in their resolve and would tender their resignations to Sonia to press for the introduction of a bill in Parliament clearing the way for the formation of a separate Telangana.        
	With rising tension ahead of the Srikrishna reports release on Friday, the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) has asked TV channels to be sensitive while covering the release of the statehood dossier. The self-regulatory body said it was necessary to ensure the telecast was not sensational, inflammatory or provocative.        
	The basic guideline to be adhered to is that all news relating to this subject should conform strictly to sub-serving public interest of maintaining parochial and communal harmony, of eschewing any divisive or fissiparous tendencies and of preserving the secular ethos of our plural society, an NBA note sent to channels said.        
	Reminding the channels that information disseminated by them influenced public opinion, the NBA said the telecast of the report must adhere to the code of ethics and the specific guidelines.        
	For instance, it suggested that the channels stick to the contents of the report and not broadcast footage on violence, agitation, self-immolation and other forms of protests, or even celebrations by those who feel the report had gone their way. The broadcasters have been asked to preserve recordings of all programmes on the report.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Illegal gun unit busted
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Illegal gun unit busted
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Garhwa SP Richard Lakra                                   
	Ranchi, May 29: A mini arms manufacturing unit was unearthed today by the police in Majhgaon village of Garhwa district, about 250km from the state capital. The police arrested two persons in this connection, apart from seizing arms and ammunition.         
	The factory was reportedly run by Brajmohan Vishwakarma and Dhirendra Vishwakarma, the arrested duo.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Garhwa superintendent of police Richard Lakra said the police recovered three country-made pistols and more than a dozen cartridges from the spot. They also seized parts which could be assembled to make firearms, apart from other equipment, including a pressure oven.         
	The arms making unit had been operating secretly for quite some time. The police came to know about it from one Kaushar Iqbal, a resident of Garhwa who was arrested with a country-made gun a couple of days ago.         
	On quizzing Iqbal, who did not seem to have a criminal background, we came to know about the factory. I secretly sent a police team to Majhgaon, asking them to take a different route through Rampur forest so that the illegal gun-makers were not alerted about the crackdown, said Lakra.         
	Among the two arrested, Brajmohan had been arrested earlier in 1997 for possessing illegal arms. The Garhwa police are yet to interrogate the two.         
	Garhwa is a Maoist stronghold on the Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh border. Its forests and hills make it a safe haven for the rebels.         
	Though the police are yet to find out the connection, if any, of the two arrested with the rebels, it is not ruling out such a possibility. The police suspect that Vishwakarmas probably supplied country-made arms to the rebels at a low price. They are also not ruling out the possibility of the presence of more such mini-factories in the district.         
	More facts will come out only after we interrogate the two, Lakra said.         
	Though presence of illegal guns among criminals and the rebels in Jharkhand is rampant, most of these guns reportedly come from outside Jharkhand, especially Bihar.

  - iPhone study proves what yoga knew: dont let your mind wander        G.S. MUDUR                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Keeping thoughts focused on tasks at hand may be a key to happiness.         
	A unique experiment that used the iPhone to investigate happiness levels of people engaged in routine activities has suggested that wandering minds become unhappy minds.         
	Harvard University researchers have found that mind wandering is far more prevalent than previously believed and almost always decreases happiness. Their findings support the long-standing ideas from yoga that concentration bolsters contentment.         
	The researchers have developed a web application for Apples iPhone that allows them to receive and track in real-time thoughts, feelings and actions of people across the world who volunteer to join the experiment.         
	The responses from 2,250 adults in the US have shown that people spend 46.9 per cent of their time thinking about something other than what theyre doing. The findings will appear in the journal Science tomorrow.         
	It was surprising to learn that peoples minds wander so often  and that mind wandering almost never increases (contentment) and almost always decreases happiness, said Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard University and the studys co-author.         
	Although previous research has indicated that negative moods can cause peoples thoughts to wander, the Harvard scientists said a time lag analysis on their data suggests that mind wandering was the cause and not the consequence of unhappiness.         
	The researchers queried people about their emotional states and their thoughts while they were engaged in routine daily activities  exercising, talking, praying, shopping, grooming, reading, resting, watching television, among other things.         
	Mind wandering produced unhappiness in every activity we measured, including the least enjoyable activities, Matthew Killingsworth, a doctoral student and the lead author of the study told The Telegraph.         
	The findings suggest mind wandering itself is a predictor of happiness  the more focused the thoughts on tasks at hand, the higher the happiness levels.         
	People are virtually never happier than when they are engaged in the present, Gilbert said.         
	The researchers said the study was aimed at exploring the emotional consequences of the human brains ability to drive thoughts away from the present to events that occurred in the past, or might happen in the future, or might never happen at all.         
	They said this evolutionary achievement  not observed in other animals  allows people to anticipate, learn and plan for the future. But it is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost, the researchers wrote in their paper.         
	The iPhone application the Harvard team developed has helped generate a database at www.trackyourhappiness.org that now has nearly 250,000 samples from about 5,000 people from 83 countries in the ages of 18-88 years, representing 86 occupations.         
	The researchers point out that certain philosophical and religious traditions have promoted the idea that happiness is achieved by living in the present.         
	We are not testing yoga or meditation directly in any way, however, our findings seem consistent with teachings from these traditions, Killingsworth said.         
	The study found that people were happiest when making love, exercising or when they were engaged in a conversation. They were least happy when resting or working. A wandering mind appeared to influence their state of happiness more than the activity they were engaged in.

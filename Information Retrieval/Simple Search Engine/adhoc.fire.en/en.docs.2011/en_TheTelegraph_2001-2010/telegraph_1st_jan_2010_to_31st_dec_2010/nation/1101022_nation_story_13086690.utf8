The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Throw And Miss: Shoe Missile At Azaadi Seminar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Throw And Miss: Shoe Missile At Azaadi Seminar
                                              
	A Kashmiri Pandit on Thursday threw a shoe at Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani when he was on a seminar dais with author-activist Arundhati Roy in New Delhi (picture aside).        
	The shoe missed Geelani who was sitting beside Roy. The seminar, titled Azaadi  The Only Way, was attended by several sympathisers of Naxalites and Kashmiri separatists.         
	Waving the Indian Tricolour, the protesters (picture on left) shouted slogans against Geelani. A scuffle broke out between them and the Hurriyat hawks supporters, who raised cries for Kashmirs independence from India.         
	Policemen surrounded the dais and took the Kashmiri Pandits away in a jeep. The protesters also wanted to know why Roy never raised the plight of Kashmiri Pandits at forums.        
	There were nearly 20 people and they were taken to a nearby police station. They were released after half an hour, said a police officer.

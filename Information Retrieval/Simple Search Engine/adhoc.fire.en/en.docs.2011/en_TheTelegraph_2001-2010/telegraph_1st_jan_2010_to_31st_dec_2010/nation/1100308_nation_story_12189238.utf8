The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quota theory in poll year
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Quota theory in poll year
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 7: In 2006, Nitish Kumar became the actual champion of the quota within quota system by reserving 50 per cent seats for women belonging to extremely backward classes (EBCs), other backward classes (OBCs), SCs and STs under the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act.        
	Today, however, contrary to his partys national president Sharad Yadav, the chief minister has adopted a soft line on the womens bill, which is free from quota within quota formula. It will have been ideal had the Centre introduced quota within quota formula in womens bill. But we will not block the bill even in its current form, he said.        
	Yadav, on the other hand, has been strongly opposing the bill in its current form and is advocating for quota within quota system.        
	Nitish has given a politically correct statement given the fact that the state was set for Assembly polls this year. He is sure that by introducing quota within quota in his state, he has strengthened his EBC and OBC constituency. And by being soft on the womens bill, he might mollify the upper castes nursing grudge against him for promoting the EBCs and OBCs and their women at the grassroots level power structure.        
	But Lalu Prasad cried foul on Nitishs stand. The chief minister changes colour like chameleon. Politics is dearer to him than the concern for the backward classes, the RJD boss said.        
	Lalu added: Irrespective of the number that we have in the Lok Sabha we will oppose the bill in its current form by tooth and nail. We are not opposed to womens bill. We only want that there should be a quota within quota for the backward class women.        
	A cautious analysis shows that Lalu is speaking what Nitish has actually done in the state. But Nitish is apparently shying away from emphasising on what he did in the state in 2006, keeping an eye on the upper caste votes. Lalu pointed out that the womens bill in its current form has exposed the true colour of the Congress and the BJP in the context of backward classes.

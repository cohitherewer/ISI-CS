The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Biggest bird to fly in, airlines shiver
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Biggest bird to fly in, airlines shiver
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          An Airbus 380                                  
	New Delhi, July 13: The biggest bird in the aviation skies, the Airbus 380, will land in Delhi on July 15 but dont expect to board it before next year.        
	The Indian government has politely told Emirates, whose Super Jumbo from Dubai will do the one-off commercial flight, to wait till next year for regular touchdowns of the 550-seater because it fears such a big plane will take away almost all passengers of Indian carriers. Germanys Lufthansa, which was keen to try the Super Jumbo on the Frankfurt-Delhi route, has also been told to wait.        
	In just one flight, an A380 can accommodate more than twice the number of passengers in a smaller Airbus, say an A320 or 340, or a Boeing jet. An A380 if configured to hold only economy-class seats can accommodate 800 people.        
	Indias four international carriers  Air India, Kingfisher, Jet and Jetlite  can accommodate between 200 and 300 travellers per flight.         
	Imagine an 800-seater flight to Dubai. It would take away business from some three competing flights to the Gulf city. Are we ready for this? asked a top civil aviation ministry official.        
	Foreign airlines have been beating Indian carriers hollow anyway, mainly because of superior connectivity. Indian airlines fly about 1.7 lakh passengers weekly to 25 countries. In comparison, foreign carriers fly some 3.26 lakh people from India to 72 countries.        
	Airlines such as Emirates, Sri Lankan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Gulf Air, Lufthansa and British Airways take away passengers travelling not only to the countries whose flag they sport but also passengers flying to the US, Canada and Europe.         
	The Gulf and Southeast Asian carriers take passengers to airline hubs in their home countries which have excellent connecting service to almost all European and North American destinations. Our Indian carriers just cant compete with the connectivity these airlines provide, said Debasish Chatterjee, director of CTI Travels.         
	Robin Pathak, a former director of Indian Airlines, cited another problem. Ever since we started giving foreign carriers connectivity to hinterland cities like Hyderabad, Lucknow, Kochi and Ahmedabad, the advantage that Air India or Jet enjoyed of connecting international gateways such as Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta to smaller cities is gone.         
	The popularity of aviation hubs in Southeast Asia and the Gulf  Dubai, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and even Colombo  with Indian fliers means that most foreign airlines starting operations in India see new routes springing up within 12-18 months of their arrival here.        
	While foreign airlines fly more passengers out of India now, Air India has discontinued several flights to international destinations last year.         
	Indias largest airline, Jet Airways, has put several long-haul overseas route expansions on hold, focusing instead on short-haul international destinations.         
	SpiceJet, which is expected to start international operations from next year, too, has plans drawn up mostly for short and medium routes.

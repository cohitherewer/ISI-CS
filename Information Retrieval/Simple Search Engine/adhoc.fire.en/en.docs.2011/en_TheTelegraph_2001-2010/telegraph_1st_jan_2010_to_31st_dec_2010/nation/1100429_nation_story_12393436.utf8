          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 28: One worked for a liquor baron, another endangered the life of the jawans he was meant to protect. Both are home ministry officers.        
	The first, Gujarat-cadre IAS officer . Ravi who is joint secretary (disaster management), was arrested today by the CBI for allegedly accepting Rs 25 lakh from a distillery in Daman and Diu.         
	He was part of a larger racket to influence his colleagues in the ministry to transfer the administrator of the Union territory.        
	The administrator had apparently acted against the distiller over excise duty violations, sources said.         
	Ashok Khemani, the owner of Royal Distillers, has also been arrested from a ritzy Delhi hotel.         
	In Daman, three excise officials have been held for causing a loss of Rs 340 crore to the exchequer by under-reporting production at the distillery and allowing unauthorised sales in Goa, Gujarat and Maharashtra.        
	In the other case, Radheshyam Sharma, director of modernisation and provisioning in the ministry, is accused of showing undue favours in return for bribes to private firms supplying armoured panels, bullet-proof jackets, helmets and shields to central forces.               
	Sharmas houses and offices were searched. Officials said there could be others in the ministry hand-in-glove with the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Climate mail leak relief for scientists 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Climate mail leak relief for scientists 
                            
	London, July 7 (AP): An independent British report into the leak of hundreds of e-mails from one of the worlds leading climate research centres has largely vindicated the scientists involved, something many in the field hope will help calm the global uproar dubbed Climategate.        
	The inquiry by former UK civil servant Muir Russell into the scandal at the University of East Anglias Climatic Research Unit found there was no evidence of dishonesty or corruption in the more than 1,000 e-mails that were posted to the Internet late last year.        
	But he did chide the scientists involved for failing to share their data with critics.        
	We find that their rigor and honesty as scientists are not in doubt, Russell said. But we do find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness.        
	Russells inquiry into the scandal is the third major investigation into the theft and dissemination of the e-mails, which caused a sensation when they were published online in November, right before the UN climate change conference at Copenhagen.        
	The messages captured researchers speaking in scathing terms about their critics, discussing ways to stonewall sceptics of man-made climate change, and talking about how to freeze opponents out of peer-reviewed journals.        
	The ensuing scandal energised sceptics and destabilised the international climate change talks in Copenhagen. The research centres director, Phil Jones, stepped down and Russell, a former civil servant unaffiliated with the university, to investigate.         
	Many who study climate science or work in policy-related fields say the furore has put them in a difficult position.        
	This has cast doubt over the whole community, Bob Ward, the policy director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said ahead of the reports publication.        
	Ward said the scandal put scientists on notice that they were operating in a highly politicised environment - one in which personal conduct could come under as much scrutiny as the science itself.        
	Russells report examined whether there was any evidence that scientists at the Climatic Research Unit doctored or suppressed data, perverted the peer review process, or improperly blocked Freedom of Information requests - something Britains data-protection watchdog has already scolded the university for doing.        
	The report follows a British parliamentary inquiry that largely backed the scientists involved and another independent investigation that gave a clean bill of health to the science itself.        
	The reports have been criticised by sceptics who alleged they were incomplete or biased.        
	It has been difficult to gauge the impact of the scandal, which played widely in the British and US media.               
	In Britain, there is some evidence that public concern over global warming has been diluted, although not by much.        
	An Ipsos MORI poll published last month suggested that 78 per cent of Britons believed that the worlds climate was changing, compared with 91 per cent five years earlier. Seventy-one per cent of respondents expressed concern about global warming, versus 82 per cent in 2005. The pollster surveyed 1,822 people aged 15 and over in interviews between January and March 2010.        
	Some scientists have said the scandal has made it impossible for researchers to hide data from their critics and pushed those who do believe in the dangers of man-made global warming to be more vocal about their doubts.        
	The release of the e-mails was a turning point, a game-changer, Mike Hulme, a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia, said.

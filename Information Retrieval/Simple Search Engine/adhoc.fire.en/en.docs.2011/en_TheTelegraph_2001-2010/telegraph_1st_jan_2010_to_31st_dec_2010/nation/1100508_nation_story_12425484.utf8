The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM panel to weed out corruption
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM panel to weed out corruption
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 7: The CPM central committee today constituted a four-member disciplinary panel to weed out corruption within the party ranks.        
	The panel will oversee all aspects of the ongoing rectification drive aimed at re-establishing the partys ideological moorings. The decision was taken at the three-day meeting of the central committee that ended here today.        
	But the panel, to be headed by politburo member S. Ramchandran Pillai, has already raised some eyebrows.        
	One of its members is U. Vasuki, who had allegedly complained against W.R. Varadarajan. The CPM veteran was stripped of all party posts and the disciplinary action allegedly drove him to suicide in February. Vasuki is on the central committee and a senior leader of the All India Democratic Womens Association, the CPMs women wing.        
	A statement was released this evening after the central committee deliberations outlined the points discussed. The central committee conducted a mid-term review of the implementation of the organisational tasks decided at the 19th congress of the party. An in-depth examination of the work for implementing the tasks was undertaken and the immediate tasks for the future were worked out, the statement added.         
	The decision to launch the rectification campaign was taken at the congress in April last year.        
	Party leaders decided to undertake political campaigns on restructuring Centre-state relations, scrapping the Civil Nuclear Liability Bill (introduced in the Lok Sabha today), oppose setting up of foreign educational institutions in the country, press for bringing the womens reservation bill to the Lok Sabha and raise other issues.        
	The senior leaders decided to hold an extended central committee meeting from August 7 to 10 at Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: Nooriya Haveliwala, the beautician accused of drunken driving that killed two persons in Mumbai, has tested positive for morphine and cannabis, and will be charged for the offence separately.        
	We had sent her urine and blood samples to the forensic lab and the reports are positive. They do not indicate the quantity of drugs but simply say she has tested positive for morphine and cannabis, additional commissioner of police R.K. Padmanabhan said.        
	Already charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable with a maximum of life imprisonment, the new disclosure could dash Haveliwalas hopes of getting bail at the next hearing of the case slated for February 16.        
	Mumbai police will seek custody of the 27-year-old, now in judicial remand, for the January 30 accident at Marine Drive. One of the two run over by her Toyota SUV was a sub-inspector. The other was a biker.         
	Lawyer Ayaz Khan said: Consumption of narcotic drugs like heroin and morphine is punishable with up to a years imprisonment, while consumption of other drugs could be punishable with up to six months imprisonment.

  - Women panel does not have power to order tests        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Supreme Court has ruled that DNA tests in paternity cases should be ordered only if they were eminently needed as such modern means of establishing parentage could bastardise an innocent child.        
	The court said the Orissa womens commission did not have the power to order such tests.        
	The August 3 judgment came on an appeal by an Orissa policeman, who had been ordered to submit blood samples after a woman moved the state womens commission claiming he had made her pregnant and then dumped her.        
	A two-judge bench said the order was outside the jurisdiction, power or competence of the state commission, rejecting the argument of the panel that it had the power to order DNA tests to ensure justice to women who approach it.        
	The bench said DNA tests in a matter relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by courts as a matter of course or in a routine manner whenever such a request is made.        
	It ruled that DNA tests should be ordered only if they were eminently needed as such modern means of establishing paternity could sometimes bastardise an innocent child even though his mother and spouse were living together at the time of conception.        
	The judgment is a blow to the commission, which is akin to a civil court and has ordered DNA tests in at least 17 other cases, including a paternity case involving BJD legislator Arabinda Dhali.         
	The womens commission had on May 11, 2009, ordered Bhabani Prasad Jena to take the DNA test after the woman claimed the police sergeant had dumped her after making her pregnant.        
	On August 7, Orissa High Court upheld the commissions order. It directed Jena to submit his blood samples to SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack to see if his DNA matched with the child, now nearly a year old, the woman claims he fathered.        
	But the apex court said courts should not routinely order DNA tests as privacy issues were involved. In this case, the high court ignored the fact that the woman and Jena were fighting a matrimonial case. That court could pass an order directing a DNA test, if needed.         
	The woman says Jena married her on May 15, 2007. But in less than three months, Jena filed a petition in a matrimonial court seeking to have the marriage annulled. He claimed the marriage had never been consummated.        
	The woman contested the claim but, while the case was still pending, she moved the womens commission. The commission asked Jena to pay her maintenance  50 per cent of his gross salary  and ordered the DNA test.

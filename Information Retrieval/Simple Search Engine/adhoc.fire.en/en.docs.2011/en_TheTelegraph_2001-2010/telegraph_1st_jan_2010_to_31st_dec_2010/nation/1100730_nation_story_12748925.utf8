                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Horses amp; sheep drag Maneka from House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Maneka Gandhi                                  
	Lucknow, July 29: Maneka Gandhi took a break from Parliament, where her party is attacking the government on price rise, to campaign for the rights of buffaloes, goats and sheep in Pauri Garhwal.         
	The BJP MP today arrived in the Uttarakhand district, a two-hour drive from Nainital, where animal rights activists were manhandled by devotees on June 2 for opposing animal sacrifice at the annual Khairling fair. Over 45 buffaloes, goats and sheep were slaughtered at the fair, from which the activists were kept out.         
	I am here to take up the cause of animals that you butcher in the name of god. I urge you to give up traditions that encourage killing animals in the name of god, Maneka told a public meeting, as her supporters held up posters saying: Stop killing animals.         
	Times have changed. You should learn to love animals. Let me tell you, by killing animals you will not be cured of any illness, she said at Kaljikhal village where the fair is held.         
	Pauri, 450km from Lucknow, is home to several Shiva and Durga temples where animal sacrifice is rampant. During four religious fairs in June-July, devotees slaughter hundreds of animals.         
	On her way here from Delhi yesterday, Maneka stopped at Bijnor when she saw an injured horse lying by the roadside. She got a vet to see the horse before continuing her journey.         
	Maneka met the district administration and peoples representatives, went around temples and spoke to the priests. Tomorrow, she is expected to hold a meeting at the Government Inter College, Chaurikhal. She will meet panchayat representatives the day after.         
	For more than two decades, the district administration and animal rights groups have been trying to motivate people against animal sacrifice. But this year, too, an estimated 200 animals have been killed since June.         
	Sanjeev Negi, a development officer in Pauri who Maneka met, said: We have been fighting rituals like Jagri, Garudi and Dhami under which the sacrifices are made as devotees believe these would ease afflictions caused by ghosts.         
	We are glad the MP has come here but she needs to spread her network of activists. We have offered all help, he added.         
	Maneka, who runs the group People for Animals, urged the district administration to help the anti-slaughter crusaders. These are men and women who are risking their lives to bring about change and need your support, she said.         
	The local animal rights activists say they are fighting a losing battle. Sarita Negi, who runs the group Bijal, said people believe animal sacrifice can cure disease and prevent calamities.         
	The Bajrang Dal, an ally of the ruling BJP, has been opposing the crusaders, she said. Its activists claim that under Section 28 of the Prevention of Cruelty against Animals Act, 1960, there is no bar on killing animals other than those that are protected under law.         
	 We are not against animal rights but we cannot let police loose on religious fairs and harass devotees, said Mohan Joshi, a Bajrang Dal activist.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Jan. 11: First abusive language, then the language of protest.         
	As protests by Karnatakas ruling BJP  incensed by H.D. Deve Gowdas abusive comments about chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa  flared up across the state, the former Prime Ministers party decided that attack was the best form of defence.        
	Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) now wants Yeddyurappa to apologise to the states farmers for not protecting their land.        
	Gowda used an invective against Yeddyurappa yesterday while answering questions from reporters about the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor  a project that has run into controversy over acquisition of land around the state capital. Gowda has been running a campaign against it for several years.        
	He has said he regretted his comments on Yeddyurappa. He used one word and he has repented for it, said Y.S.V. Datta, JD(S) spokesperson. But Yeddyurappa also should apologise (to farmers), he said, adding that the party would launch protests from tomorrow.        
	Through the day, BJP workers and legislators staged protests against Gowdas comments in Bangalore and also in districts such as Mysore and Bidar. The BJP has threatened to sue Gowda.        
	But Gowdas son H.D. Kumaraswamy warned that the JD(S), too, would launch protests if the BJP did not stop its tirade.

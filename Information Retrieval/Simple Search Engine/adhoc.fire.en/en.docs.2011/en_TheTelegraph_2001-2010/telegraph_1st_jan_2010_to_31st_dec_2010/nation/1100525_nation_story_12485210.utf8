	Mangalore, May 24: Sabrina Nasrin Huq, the Bangladeshi doctor who is the only woman and foreigner to survive Saturdays Air India crash, cant wait to get out of hospital.        
	The 23-year-old wants to resume her internship in Manipal and go to the US for further studies.        
	Her mother, Rokeya Khatun, flew into the same risky tabletop Mangalore runway from Dubai, to be on 24-hour vigil in a room near the ICU.         
	The young doctor has had an operation on her leg.        
	Sabrina does not want visitors, a doctor said.         
	She is stable and recovering fast. Her only complaint is the VIP visits because she knows that cross-infection from strangers can upset her steady recovery and prolong her hospital stay. Her only request, therefore, is that she be left alone so she can resume her internship at Kasturba (hospital) at the earliest, said Dr Dinesh Kadam.        
	Asked about the crash, Rokeya said: This is an accident like any other. If my daughter were to be injured in a road accident, she would probably have a leg in plaster and multiple sutures. Im sure shell emerge stronger.        
	Sabrina is a house surgeon at Kasturba Gandhi Medical College in Manipal, Karnatakas medical hub.         
	Her father, Dr Mohamed Mahboob-ul-Huq, who runs a clinic in the UAE, stayed back because Sabrinas younger sister Ismat Jerin Huq, a higher secondary student, has exams.        
	Rokeya said she was surprised that her daughter had survived the crash and was almost fine.         
	My husband told me shes all right. But when I saw the plane all ablaze on TV, I thought how on earth could my daughter have survived. And even if she had survived, she must be really bad. But when I spoke to her, I realised she was okay, she said.        
	Sabrinas seat was in the seventh row of the plane. She was asleep when the plane touched down and overshot the Bajpe airport runway. Dr Kadam said she tried to take off her seat belt but her left leg wouldnt come out as it was sandwiched between two seats. But she pulled it out and slid down to a bush (outside through a hole when the plane broke in two parts).

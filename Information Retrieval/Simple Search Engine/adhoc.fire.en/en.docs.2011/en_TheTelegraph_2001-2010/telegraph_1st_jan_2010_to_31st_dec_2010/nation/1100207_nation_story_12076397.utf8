          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata , Sonia                                 
	Lucknow, Feb. 6: Mamata Banerjee and Sonia Gandhi will share a dais in Kanpur tomorrow and jointly flag off 12 new trains, railway and Congress sources have said.        
	The two of them did not meet in Calcutta last month when Sonia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came to pay their last respects to Jyoti Basu while the Trinamul Congress chief stayed away.        
	Railway sources said the ministry recently sent Sonia an invite to the Kanpur event and the Congress president accepted it. Sonia would anyway have been in Uttar Pradesh tomorrow.        
	Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee will jointly flag off 12 new trains, including the Kanpur-Delhi Shatabdi Express, tomorrow from Kanpur Central station, state Congress spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh confirmed.        
	Earlier, Mamata had sent a junior railway minister to Lalganj in Rae Bareli, Sonias parliamentary constituency, to announce a deadline for a much-awaited railway coach factory there.        
	The Sonia-Mamata meeting will come four weeks after the railway minister had attacked the central government, of which she is a part, on price rise and the Maoist threat in Bengal. That move, however, apparently stemmed from her political compulsions in Bengal, where she is hoping to become chief minister next year.        
	Mamata had announced the new trains in last years railway budget and wants to launch them before unveiling a fresh budget on February 24 to deny the Opposition a chance to criticise her in Parliament.        
	The new trains to be launched tomorrow are: the Kanpur-Delhi Shatabdi Express, Lucknow-New Delhi Duranto Express, Allahabad-New Delhi Duranto Express, Agra-Lucknow Inter-city, Mathura-Kasganj Passenger, Bhopal-Pratapgarh Express, Gorakhpur-Lokmanya Tilak Express, Varanasi-Jammu Tawi Superfast Express, Lucknow-Yashwantpur Express, Gorakhpur-Nautnava Express, Gorakhpur-Nautnava Passenger and the Chapra-Mathura Express.        
	Railway sources said Mamata might also announce route extensions for several other trains passing through Uttar Pradesh.

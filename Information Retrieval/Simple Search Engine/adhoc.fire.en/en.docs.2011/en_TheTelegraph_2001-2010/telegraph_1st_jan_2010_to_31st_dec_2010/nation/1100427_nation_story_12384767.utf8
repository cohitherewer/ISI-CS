The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Transfer of shares abroad faces hurdles
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Transfer of shares abroad faces hurdles
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Shilpa Shetty, a co-owner of the Rajasthan Royals                                  
	New Delhi, April 26: Shilpa Shetty, her husband Raj Kundra and a coven of investors in Jaipur IPL Pvt Ltd  the franchise that holds the rights to the Rajasthan Royals  could find themselves out in the cold as the government prepares to tighten foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations.        
	The Jaipur franchise is the one of several proposals that will be badly affected by the governments move to disallow proposals that involve transfer of shareholding to entities abroad for either minimal or no cash inflows.        
	The Kundras and the other investors who include Lachlan Murdoch, scion of the media baron Rupert Murdoch, have been lobbying hard for clearance of their proposal that was made over a year ago.        
	The original proposal was rejected in October last year. It was put up again this year and a decision on it was deferred at the latest meeting of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) on April 9.        
	The government has been worried about the source of funds flowing into Indian entities from tax havens like the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands where regulatory scrutiny is lax.        
	Jaipur India Pvt Ltd was incorporated in March 2008 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mauritius-based EM Sports Holding Ltd.        
	The Indian entity had sought permission to issue shares to EM Sports Holding in exchange for a payment of $773,480 that the Mauritius entity had paid to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as franchise fee.        
	EM Sports Holdings is in turn held by four investors: UK-based Emerging Media IPL Ltd which is owned by London-based NRI Manoj Badale; Tresco International Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Island and controlled by Suresh Chellaram (who is related to IPL commissioner Lalit Modi through marriage); Blue Water Estate Ltd, an Australian entity controlled by Lachlan Murdoch; and the Bahamas-based Kuki Investments owned by Raj Kundra.        
	Separately, Jaipur India Pvt Ltd had wanted to transfer shares to Badales Emerging Media in exchange for the $5.04 million that he had paid BCCI as a performance deposit after winning the bid for the IPL franchise in January 2008.        
	Essentially, the stake sale is being sought at a valuation of about Rs 26 crore  a paltry amount in the context of the sums that the franchises are raking in terms of sponsorship income, franchise income from a centralised pool of funds and other events-related revenue stream.        
	The government reckons that the valuations of Jaipur IPL Pvt Ltd have risen dramatically since 2008 and a stake transfer against the piffling amounts paid out two years ago would neither be fair nor free from suspicions of taint.        
	We have here (in the Rajasthan Royals application) a situation where what is being transferred is solely the Indian assets whose valuation has gone up many times since the company was originally formed, a source said.        
	The Indian authorities now want to tweak the laws in an effort to ensure that the sources of funds flowing into the country are known and proper regulatory mechanisms exist in the tax havens where these companies are registered to certify the legitimacy of those transactions.         
	The Jaipur proposal has now been sent to the investigation arm of the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT). The suspicion is that the stake sale at such low valuations are designed to deny the government its legitimate tax claims.        
	Officials said sports companies and clubs also fall in a grey area since they have not been specifically categorised under the services sector in the FDI regulations.        
	This lacuna will be plugged with clearly enunciated rules specific to the area of sports which is now showing potential for growth. However, these rules will be framed with prospective effect, officials said.

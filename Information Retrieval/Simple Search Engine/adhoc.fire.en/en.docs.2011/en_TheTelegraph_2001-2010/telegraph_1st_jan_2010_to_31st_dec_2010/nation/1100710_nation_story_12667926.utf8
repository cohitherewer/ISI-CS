The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omen II: Jumbo tryst for film crew
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Omen II: Jumbo tryst for film crew
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                            
	Chennai, July 8: Raavan had a brush with them and lay bloodied at the box office despite trumpeting the Mani Ratnam film. Now, M. Sivasankar may be wary of a jumbo dud.        
	The director watched the crew of his upcoming Tamil film chased away in the forests of Keralas Munnar by an elephant herd, apparently irritated by the blaring music during the shooting of a dance sequence.        
	Four large elephants charged at us from behind the trees, trumpeting loudly. Almost all the 30 members of our unit ran to higher ground for safety. Once the elephants retreated, we tried to shoot again by shifting to a different location but we kept the volume the same. This time too, the elephants came after us. They appeared to be quite annoyed by the loud music, said choreographer D. Kesavan.        
	The crew from Chennai were filming a duet last week for Nellu (paddy) during the two-day shoot in the scenic Kerala spot.        
	Kesavan had initially rehearsed the sequence with the dancers and the lead pair. The music was then playing softly as only small sections of the group were being tutored in close quarters. But when it came to the final take, half a dozen loudspeakers, placed behind trees around a large clearing, started blaring out the music. The reason for turning up the volume was that entire cast had to listen to the music and match their steps.         
	When the decibel devil triggered the repeated jumbo interruption, it was left to Sivasankar to work out a solution. He repositioned the speakers in small pits and had the sound devices covered with leaves and bushes.         
	The idea was that while the dancers could hear the music even at a lower volume, the audio equipment would not be visible in the movie. The trick worked: the four-hour dance was completed without annoying the pachyderms.         
	Filmmakers should keep in mind that we are the intruders and should, therefore, respect the sensibilities of the real occupants of the area (the animals), Sivasankar said.        
	While shooting for Raavan, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya, too, had a close shave with elephants at the Athirpaally Falls in Keralas Trichur. They came out unscathed, but not the film which was trampled at the box office. Sivasankar may like to pray that there is no repeat.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           K Lekshmana leaves the special CBI court in Kochi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Kochi, Oct. 27: A retired police officer was today found guilty of the murder of a Naxalite leader, shot dead in Keralas Waynad forest in 1970, in a case that was reopened after the cop who pulled the trigger turned whistle-blower 28 years after the incident and exposed the fake encounter.         
	Inspector-general K. Lekshmana, now 74, was present with his family when the CBI special court handed its verdict in the A. Varghese killing case. The sentence will be announced tomorrow.         
	It is proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt that Varghese, who was caught hold of alive, was brutally killed by the first accused who was a stooge at the hands of Lekshmana, judge S. Vijay Kumar said.         
	The first accused, CRPF constable P. Ramachandran Nair, had confessed in 1998 that he had shot Varghese, 40, point blank on the orders of Lekshmana, then the Kozhikode deputy superintendent of police, and P. Vijayan, the superintendent of police.         
	Lekshmana was part of then home minister K. Karunakarans anti-Naxalite crack team.         
	In 1999, Kerala High court asked the CBI to investigate the case.         
	The offence of custodial murder, be it of an extremist, terrorist or Naxalite, does not get wiped off merely by efflux of time, the court said.         
	The judge acquitted Vijayan, who is now 83 and had retired as director-general of police, giving him the benefit of doubt.

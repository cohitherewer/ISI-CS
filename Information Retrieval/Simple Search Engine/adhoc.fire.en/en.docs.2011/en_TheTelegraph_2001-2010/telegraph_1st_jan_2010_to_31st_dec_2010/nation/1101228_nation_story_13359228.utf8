	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Murli Manohar Joshi appears to have taken the sting out of his partys clamour for a joint parliamentary committee on spectrum allocation.        
	The BJP leader today said the public accounts committee, which he heads, could go beyond the comptroller and auditor-general report and conduct its own probe into the 2G scam.         
	It could even go back to the time of the NDA regime and look into the spectrum issue from 2001.        
	If needed, then we can go back to 2001. Peeche bhi jaa sakte hain, he replied, asked if such a thing could be done as directed by the Supreme Court.        
	The BJP, which has been adamant on a JPC probe, has been claiming that the PAC mandate is limited to examining figures given in the CAG report.        
	It is a misconception that the PAC restricts itself to figures. It can go beyond and look into policy implementation, and even ask for a further probe if needed, Joshi said.        
	Asked if he was hinting there was no need for a JPC, Joshi smiled. I am not going to comment about what the Opposition wants. It is for the government to decide.        
	He then cast a doubt on the BJP claim that the scam amounted to Rs 1.76 lakh crore. Pointing out that the CAG had arrived at three presumptive figures, he said: The lowest is Rs 57,666 crore and the highest is Rs 1.76 lakh crore. Anything could be correct.        
	BJP leaders said their worst fears had come true. The party had asked Joshi to go slow on the probe as it would weaken its JPC demand, but he seemed to have pushed aside the plea.        
	Joshi, however, denied he was pursuing the 2G probe over-enthusiastically. He said Gopinath Munde, the BJP leader he had succeeded, had first proposed such a probe.        
	I took over as PAC chairperson from Munde in May this year. Members told me that Munde had proposed that the 2G and 3G issues need to be looked into. On June 30, the first meeting of the PAC was held on the issue. So, the PAC had taken up the matter even before the CAG report, Joshi said.        
	He denied the PAC was focussing only on spectrum and overlooking a host of other pending issues. He said the PAC under him had held 27-28 meetings, of which only eight were related to spectrum. We are taking up all the issues before us, he said.        
	Joshi refused to confirm if the PAC report would be out before Parliaments budget session, as the BJP feared. We are moving according to schedule. Cant predict when our report would be ready.        
	Joshis move to puncture his partys attack on the UPA is said to be the result of a leadership tussle. Once regarded as third in the party line-up after A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, he now finds himself sidelined, with second-generation leaders like Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley calling the shots.        
	He seems to be on the path of becoming the Somnath Chatterjee of UPA II, a BJP leader said. The reference was to Chatterjee defying the CPM directive to step down as Lok Sabha Speaker after his party withdrew support to UPA I over the nuclear deal.

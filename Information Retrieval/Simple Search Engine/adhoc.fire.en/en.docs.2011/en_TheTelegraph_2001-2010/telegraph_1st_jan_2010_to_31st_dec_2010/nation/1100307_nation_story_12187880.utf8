	New Delhi, March 6: The last citadel of overt opposition to the womens reservation bill is cracking.        
	Serious differences have surfaced within the Janata Dal (United), with Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar rooting for the bills passage and party president Sharad Yadav opposing it.        
	The Dal (U) was part of the formidable backward caste political trio opposed to the bill, aimed at reserving 33 per cent seats for women in Parliament and state legislatures, with the RJD and the Samajwadi Party being the other two.        
	Along with Mayavatis BSP, which doesnt want to be outpaced by the Samajwadis on Uttar Pradeshs backward caste terrain, these entities had hoped to thwart forward movement when the bill is brought for consideration and passage in the Rajya Sabha on Monday.        
	Today, addressing a gender leadership summit in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh repeated that the government was moving towards providing one-third reservation for women.        
	That Nitish is a backward caste leader has blunted the edge of the trios contention that the bill is a ploy to pack legislatures with elite women and disable the disadvantaged OBC and minority women from participating in political structures.        
	It is learnt that the BSP may join the growing chorus of aye sayers in Parliament. Mayavati has convened a meeting of her MPs on Sunday to take a final call and then issue a whip.                        Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the summit in Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)      
	Satish C. Misra, who heads the parliamentary party in the Upper House, has counselled Mayavati to back the bill.        
	Nitish is of the view that the bill is an idea whose time has come.        
	A source close to him said that having gained a decisive lead over his opponents in Bihar by legislating a 50 per cent quota for women in panchayats, he could not afford to regress on another major step in empowering women.        
	For the last six months, he has spoken on the need for womens reservation in Parliament and Assemblies. His own experience with the panchayats was humbling. He has seen women who refused to uncover their faces and speak in public morph into fiery orators over the years, the aide said.        
	A source said Nitish told Sharad that the demand for a separate sub-quota for OBC and minority women did not wash.        
	The source said Nitish told Sharad that not only was it unconstitutional, but that in a backward caste-dominated constituency reserved for women, parties would have no choice but to field an OBC woman. So how can they be discriminated against?        
	If the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha pass the bill, it will be the turn of state Assemblies to do it.        
	Nitish is keen to be the pioneer and have it in place in Bihar before the Assembly elections, due in October.        
	Sharad iterated that the bill was a bulldozing ploy against 80 per cent of the countrys population by some NGOs and Delhi-based women.        
	However, Sharad was silent when asked if the Dal (U) would issue a whip to its MPs to vote against it. We will take a decision on Monday, he said.        
	Sources said five of the partys seven Rajya Sabha MPs  N.K. Singh, Shivanand Tiwari, Ali Ansari, Mahendra Prasad and Anil Sahani  were firmly with Nitish. A sixth, George Fernandes, is too ill to show up. This is why Sharadji may not be in a position to issue a whip, a source said.        
	The Samajwadi and the RJD are handicapped by the lack of enough feisty elements in their midst. The Samajwadis Ram Gopal Yadav and Brij Bhushan Tiwari are too soft-spoken to tear into the treasury benches. The RJDs Rajniti Prasad is a socialist whose eventful years are behind him. Only the BSP has MPs who could create trouble if told to.

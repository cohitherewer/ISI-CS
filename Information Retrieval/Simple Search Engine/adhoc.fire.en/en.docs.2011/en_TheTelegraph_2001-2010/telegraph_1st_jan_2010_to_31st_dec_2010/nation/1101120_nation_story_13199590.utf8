The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tiger census data soon 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tiger census data soon 
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 19 (PTI): The Centre will declare its first preliminary data on the tiger census ahead of a global meet on the endangered species in Russia next week.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh, on the sidelines of an event, said: By the next few days we will declare the first tentative results of the tiger census. Hopefully, by early next year we will be able to make the full report public.         
	The year-long tiger census was started early this year in 17 states using camera trappings instead of pugmarks as they had failed to give conclusive data.        
	The latest estimated count of tigers in the countrys protected forests is around 1,411. The figure is less by half of the 3,642 count during the last census of 2001-2002. Ramesh has expressed hope the count will be higher this time.         
	So far, over 31 tigers have died because of various reasons, including territorial fights and poaching besides man-animal conflict. The latest tiger death was reported from Sariska in Rajasthan.

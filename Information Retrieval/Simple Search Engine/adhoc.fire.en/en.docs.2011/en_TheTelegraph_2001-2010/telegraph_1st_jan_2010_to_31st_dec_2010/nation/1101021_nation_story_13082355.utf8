          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Workers at the Commonwealth Games Village. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Centre today moved to freeze the Rs 183-crore bank guarantee the Commonwealth Games Village developer Emaar-MGF had submitted after a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) report accused the builder of irregularities and deficiencies in the construction of the complex.        
	The urban development ministry had instructed the DDA to submit a report on the structural defects in the Village, built at a cost of Rs 828 crore.         
	In a letter to the DDA vice-chairman, the urban development ministry today asked the civic authority to invoke the bank guarantee and to initiate legal action against the project developer and also take such other steps as are deemed necessary for protecting the interests of the authority.        
	Complaints against the developer range from poor water and power supply to the flats in the Village, plumbing problems, water seepage, malfunctioning lifts and flooding of basements.        
	Such defects pertain to basement, lift pits, non-installation of required number of hydro-pneumatic pumps, water proofing of terrace, fixtures for balconies, inadequate power connection, choking of pipes and incomplete landscaping, the report said.         
	The DDA report added that the developer failed to meet deadlines and make payments to water and power supply agencies.        
	In a statement, Emaar-MGF dismissed the charges. The bank guarantee was extended till December 31, 2010, at the behest of the DDA. We have not received any notice for encashment of the bank guarantee as well, the company said.        
	It said the Games Village was built to the highest standard of quality and design and that the village received rave reviews from all participants who stayed there. All deficiencies pointed out by the DDA or any other agency were duly rectified by us.        
	The company also denied that there were any outstanding dues to the Delhi Jal Board or the power suppliers and all the project milestones were achieved as per our scope of work.        
	It said the DDA and the Games organising committee should have rectified any problems that may have arisen after the Village was handed over.        
	Glare on bailout        
	The controversy has also brought under the glare the DDAs role in giving a bailout package of over Rs 700 crore in 2009 to the company.        
	The builder had complained of a financial crunch because of global recession and the DDA had stepped in to buy 300 flats in the Games Village from Emaar-MGF. A government panel had then said the DDA paid Rs 90 crore too much, but the authority, which is under the urban development ministry, had said parking and other charges had to be factored in.         
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit had also blamed the DDA for the problems at the Village in the run-up to the Games when some foreign contingents had described the Village as unliveable and filthy.        
	The Comptroller and Auditor General today seized files on constructions projects carried out by the Central Public Works Department and the DDA. The agencies are also under the Central Vigilance Commission scanner.        
	Sources in the Enforcement Directorate said the ED would soon question the Games organising committee officials over allegations of violation of foreign exchange regulations during the organisation of the Queens Baton Relay in London in 2009.        
	The income tax department is said to be preparing a family tree of all senior officials, individuals and their relatives who bagged Commonwealth Games contracts.

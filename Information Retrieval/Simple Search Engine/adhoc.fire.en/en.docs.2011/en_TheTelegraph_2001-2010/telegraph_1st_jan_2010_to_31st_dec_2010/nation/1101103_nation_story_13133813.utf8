                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP mocks silence on scams
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The BJP questioned the Congresss silence on the three big-time corruption scams  2G, Commonwealth Games and Adarsh housing  and said it was treating the matter as a question of party discipline.        
	Shortly after the All India Congress Committee session concluded, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said: The session took place under the most trying and difficult circumstances, at a time when the Congress is facing a string of scandals. But what was the impact of this on the three eminent speakers? The answer is silence.        
	Pointing out that the cases involved tens of thousands of crores, Sitharaman asked if the Congress had become indifferent towards corruption and it treated the matters as though party discipline had been breached.        
	A probe (into the Adarsh housing scandal) is on by two senior party leaders. The (Maharashtra) chief minister offered his resignation that has not yet been accepted, she said.        
	She added that instead of tackling corruption, the Congress resorted to diversionary tactics by speaking of the RSSs terror links. They should know that a former (Congress) minister and a former corporator (both from Gujarat) were not only linked to terror cases but were tried and convicted, she said.        
	In Bihar, Lok Sabha Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj demanded that the Congress should instantly accept Ashok Chavans resignation. Things are now out in the open. The country wants a decision, Sushma said.        
	She said that the BJP would raise the scams in the House in the winter session of Parliament starting next week. I was speaking to our national president (Nitin Gadkari) and he said more such scams in Mumbai will come out in the open in the days to come, Sushma said.        
	A BJP source said Sushma and the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley would speak to the leaders of the Left and the other Opposition parties to forge a common strategy against the Congresss corruption.        
	Given the anti-Congress feeling among the RJD and Lok Janshakti Party MPs after a bitterly fought Bihar election, NDA sources said the Congress may have few or no friends to turn to outside the UPA.        
	The BJP also proposes to corner the government on its Kashmir policy and seek an explanation for the various statements put out by the interlocutors it recently appointed, particularly one who said Pakistan must be on board in the reconciliation process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP   cries for minister scalp 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP   cries for minister scalp 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 13: The BJP today urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to sack Shashi Tharoor from his cabinet and order a CBI probe into Sunanda Puskhars transactions with the Kochi IPL franchise, led by Rendezvous.        
	For us, it is not important how the BCCI conducts the (IPL) auctions. We are interested in the conduct of a minister who has a history of conduct unbecoming of a Union minister, chief BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.        
	He is the governments enfant terrible. While his earlier statements demonstrated political immaturity, his present conduct smells of corruption.        
	To the BJP, the core issue is that Tharoor has abused his powers and authority as junior foreign minister to extract pecuniary gains for a friend, alleged Prasad. Party sources said they would demand a statement from the government in Parliament on Tharoors role and ask if the Prime Minister would retain him in his team.        
	Prasad debunked Tharoors defence  that he was only helping the Kochi franchise to bring cricket to Kerala. But Sunanda, in turn, has rendered no service to cricket or to Kerala or to the Kochi franchise that may independently entitle her to a free equity in the company. It is obvious that the quid pro quo for this equity is the service rendered by Tharoor to the Kochi franchise.        
	Tharoors conduct is a criminal offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, Prasad, a lawyer, claimed.

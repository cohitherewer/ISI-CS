          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 2: The state vigilance bureau is yet to trace 1996-batch IAS officer and former Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner K. Senthil Kumar, who gave the police a slip on February 24.        
	The vigilance bureau has lodged a case against the missing IAS officer in connection with certain irregularities, including clearance of maps of some under construction buildings and purchase of trucks.        
	The vigilance has issued notice to Kumar to appear in person and give clarifications regarding the irregularities, additional director-general (vigilance) Anil Kumar Sinha said.        
	The vigilance sleuths reached his office on February 24, asking him to give the documents pertaining to the clearance of maps and purchase of trucks among others in question.         
	Vigilance sources said the IAS officer had asked the police to sit in another room pleading that he was going to bring the documents. However, Kumar sneaked out from the office from backdoor and disappeared in a private car. The police became suspicious after Kumar failed to return and went around in the office looking for him. We are looking for Kumar ever since. But he so far has been missing, a senior vigilance official said.        
	The government has removed Kumar as PMC commissioner.

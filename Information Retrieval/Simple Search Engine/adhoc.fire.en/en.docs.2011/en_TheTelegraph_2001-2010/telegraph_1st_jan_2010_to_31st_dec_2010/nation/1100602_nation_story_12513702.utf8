          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and railway minister Mamata Banerjee in New Delhi on Tuesday. Telegraph Picture                           
	New Delhi, June 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised greater all-round well-being for Indians than could be achieved in UPA IIs recession-ridden first year.        
	Singh emphasised that his government was dedicated to providing effective, purposeful and responsive government for building a nation that was economically strong, socially just, culturally vibrant, regionally balanced, politically participative, fully educated, technologically modern and creative and enterprising.         
	Singh, along with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, was presenting his second terms first report to the people, at a low-key ceremony this evening.         
	Running into more than a hundred pages, the report is an exhaustive and self-congratulatory summary of ministerial performance in UPA IIs first year.         
	During his news conference last week, the Prime Minister shied away from marking his performance saying he would leave that to the people and historians to judge; todays report is more unabashed in tenor, especially about the governments record in the social sector. The Prime Minister earmarked the right to education, the right to food, and the new deal for rural India under a slew of programmes flagshipped by the NREGA, for special mention.         
	Although the report made only cursory mention of the Naxalite challenge  referring to it as Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in a relegated para on security  Singh flagged the issue more pointedly in his speech with a reiteration of Sonia Gandhis two-pronged approach. In dealing with the challenge of Naxalism, we will pursue a policy that genuinely seeks to address developmental concerns at the grass roots, while firmly enforcing the writ of the State, he said.         
	Both the government and the Congress have been keen to allay speculation that the establishment was speaking in contrary voices on what the Prime Minister has called the gravest internal security threat.         
	Even as preparations for the release of the report card got underway today, defence minister A.K. Antony, concluded a meeting with the three service chiefs in which he is learnt to have brought them on board on the possibility of involving the armed forces in anti-Naxalite operations.         
	The Prime Minister dealt at length on the other big challenge of his second term  price rise  and sought to assure the nation that his government was involved in all earnest on controlling the squeeze on the aam aadmis purse.         
	He accepted that price rise was one of the biggest challenges his government faced but patted his government on the back saying it had surmounted the odds to maintain a fair growth rate. In the current financial year, the economy is expected to grow at 8.5 per cent. This is one of the best performances in the world and reflects the strong fundamentals which we have built over several years, he said.         
	On the prices front, the Prime Minister expressed optimism about being able to curb the spiral soon.         
	One of the major problems that we face at present is the pressure on prices. This is to a large extent the aftermath of the drought, but it needs firm action. We have taken a number of steps to contain inflation and to protect the vulnerable sections of our society. I am happy that prices have shown a moderating trend in recent weeks. I am hopeful that this trend will continue, he said, promising additional corrective measures to rein in inflation.         
	The Prime Minister made no specific mention of his pet foreign policy project  peace with Pakistan  either in his speech or in his foreword to the report. But thats in line with the low-key mention he gave the issue in his opening remarks at his press conference last week.         
	The Prime Minister is clearly undeterred in his pursuit of a constructive entente with Pakistan but appears keen not to inflate expectations at this stage.

  - Education bill deferred, funds diversion admitted          OUR BUREAU                            Spot the difference: Rahul Gandhi addresses a rally at Kalahandi in Orissa on Thursday (above) and outside Parliament on Tuesday. (PTI pictures)                                             
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The last day of the monsoon session brought the government embarrassment in the Rajya Sabha, forcing it to defer the education tribunal bill as well as to confess to the Sheila Dikshit government diverting Dalit development funds for the Commonwealth Games.        
	It fell to home minister P. Chidambaram to admit the diversion of the Rs 678.91 crore to the scandal-ridden Games, an issue raised earlier by the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	It will be seen that 17.33 per cent has been contributed out of SCSP (Scheduled Caste Sub Plan) funds to the CWG projects.... According to the guidelines revised in 2006, it (the diversion) appears to be wrong, he said.        
	Chidambaram added that the matter was being addressed by a Planning Commission-appointed task force, formed to work out ways to prevent diversion of Dalit and tribal welfare funds.        
	Earlier, the Opposition cited alleged inadequacies in the education bill that looks to set up tribunals for quick settlement of disputes involving teachers, among others.        
	The Lok Sabha had passed the bill but the Rajya Sabha sought more time. The BJPs Ravi Shankar Prasad said the three-tier appeal structure could make the process even more difficult for poor litigants.        
	Even Congress member K. Keshava Rao made the education ministers job harder by remarking with apparent irony that Kapil Sibals bureaucratic machinery was struggling to keep up with his fast thinking.        
	As Sibal argued his case, he made a gaffe. He questioned the weight in the Oppositions arguments, setting off a furore that forced him to agree to a deferment. The word Sibal used was expunged.        
	The Opposition left happy. The CPMs Brinda Karat later said the Opposition had registered victory by putting the government in a tight corner on many issues and forcing it to postpone several bills.        
	The Left had walked out, as it had done in the Lok Sabha, when parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal moved the bill on MPs pay, protesting the Centres failure to keep its four-year-old promise of forming an independent body to decide the salaries.        
	Even Bansal and leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley admitted that MPs were facing criticism over the salary hike.        
	Ruckus rued        
	The session ended with the customary regret from both Houses presiding officers over the disruptions.        
	Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar warned of unforeseen consequences if the trend continued, and Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari reminded MPs of the growing public criticism of their unruly behaviour.        
	Kumar disapproved of the mock Parliament held by some members, saying: Let informed debates take place inside the chamber at all times instead of slogans and mock discussions.        
	Ansari said: The practice of frequent disruptions tramples on the rights of individual members, detracts from the dignity of Parliament, and has invited public criticism.        
	While the Lok Sabha lost 45 hours to interruptions and forced adjournments, the Rajya Sabha failed to transact any business on five days.         
	In the light of the repeated defiance of the Chairs authority in both Houses, the way the BJP had forced Bansal to apologise for standing with his back to the Speakers chair left many Congress MPs bemused.        
	More so because the BJPs Navjot Sidhu, who has been seen in the House just a couple of days, today got away without an apology after shouting and gesticulating at junior parliamentary affairs minister Narayanswami.        
	The sessions highlights include the passage of the nuclear liability bill  and the BJPs cooperation over it the bitter debate on the Bhopal tragedy, the MPs salary hike and the differences among ministers over the aborted enemy property bill.        
	Pranab Mukherjees management and political skills were evident yet again while the Yadav troika  Sharad, Mulayam and Lalu Prasad  dominated the Opposition space despite Sushma Swarajs best efforts to stamp her authority.

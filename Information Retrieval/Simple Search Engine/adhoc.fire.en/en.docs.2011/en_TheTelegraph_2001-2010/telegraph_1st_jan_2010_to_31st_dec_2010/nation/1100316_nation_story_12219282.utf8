          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, March 15: Opposition members today trooped into the Well of the Assembly demanding revision of their own salary and allowances.         
	The ruling BJD members also supported their demand by standing on their seats.        
	The Opposition members returned to their seats after the state parliamentary affairs minister promised he would consider their demand.        
	Raising the demand during the Zero hour, senior Congress member Anup Kumar Sai said it was high time that the salaries and allowances of legislators be revised in view of inflation and increased prices.        
	Supporting him, S.S. Saluja (Congress) said the government should enhance the salary and allowances of the MLAs after it had put into effect a salary hike of government employees on the recommendation of the Sixth Pay Commission.        
	His party colleague from Jharsuguda, Nabakishore Das, pointed out that the salary of MLAs had remained a meagre Rs 5,000 per month and needed revision.        
	Independent MLA Pratap Chandra Sarangi said their allowances were also meagre, compared to other states and demanded introduction of rail coupons as in Bengal.         
	Ruling BJD member Nrusingha Charan Sahu urged the state to revise the constituency allowance from Rs 4,000 per month to Rs 20,000 and provide a personal assistant.        
	Senior BJD member and former government chief whip Pradeep Maharathy urged the Speaker to direct the parliamentary affairs minister to take necessary steps in consultation with the chief minister and finance minister.        
	Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat directed parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty to take note of it.        
	Mohanty said the amenities committees of the state Assembly would submit a proposal and the government would then consider it.

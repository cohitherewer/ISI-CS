          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, June 21: Two men who had secretly sold off their widowed mothers property axed her to death today in an Andhra Pradesh town when she came to a court seeking justice.        
	Venkateswaramma, an elderly widow from Ganganammathota village near Tenali town, 370km from Hyderabad, had filed a case against her sons.        
	The two sons and their accomplices attacked her with sticks and axes near the court hall as the 58-year-old got off an auto. The sons then fled in a car, leaving their mother bleeding from serious head and body injuries. Venkateswaramma died before she could be taken to hospital.        
	Venkateswaramma owned a house in Tenali and three acres of wetlands but her sons, Prabhu and Prakash, had sold off most of her property and driven her out of her home.        
	The grieving widow had moved in with her daughter and, with the help of her son-in-law, filed a petition in a local court against her sons. Prabhu and Prakash, both small-time businessmen, tried their best to make her withdraw the case but failed.        
	Police have registered a case on the basis of a complaint filed by Venkateswarammas daughter and launched a hunt for the sons.

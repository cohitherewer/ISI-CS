          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, March 22: Narendra Modi today dubbed a lie the reports that the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) had fixed March 21 for questioning him in connection with the 2002 riots.        
	Breaking his silence on the notice, the Gujarat chief minister asserted that the SIT had not called him on March 21 even as he declared that he would respond to the team in keeping with the dignity of the agency.         
	SIT had not fixed March 21, 2010, for my appearance. To say I was summoned on March 21 is completely false, Modi said in an open letter, apparently drafted in consultation with his BJP colleague and legal eagle Arun Jaitley.        
	Jaitley said the nation had been misled on the basis of a lie. The fact is that there has been no direct or indirect request made by the SIT to appear on March 21. The Gujarat government and CM Modi has said they have been, and will, cooperate with the legal process of the country as well as fully cooperate with the SIT.         
	Modi described reports about him being called specifically on March 21 as part of a campaign of disinformation. It is a matter of grave concern and needs investigation as to why and who started spreading lies that SIT summons Narendra Modi on March 21, 2010, the chief minister said in the open letter.        
	The date of 21st March, 2010 was invented by some vested interests and as part of their effort to interfere in the due process of law. They wanted to paint me as a person who refused to respond to the SIT, the letter states.        
	Sources had told The Telegraph earlier that Modi had been called during the week beginning March 21.        
	SIT chief R.K. Raghavan did not delve into the date controversy today, and merely said there has been no response from Modi or his office till now. SIT sources said, however, that they would wait for Modis response.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 19: A last-minute change to a proposed law against sexual harassment at the workplace leaves millions of domestic workers, one of the most exploited sections of Indias workforce, unprotected from sexual predators.         
	The women and child development ministry (WCD) has withdrawn protection from sexual harassment to domestic workers under a controversial change to a long-pending proposed legislation that may be placed before the cabinet soon.         
	Domestic workers have been left out of the ambit of the legislation after the law ministry argued that implementing the law inside peoples homes may prove too hard, top government sources said.        
	India has over 15 million domestic workers and over 80 per cent  or about 12 million  of these workers are women, the WCD ministry estimates show. Many of these workers are children (girls) and several are victims of trafficking.         
	Several reports and independent research have repeatedly found domestic workers among the most vulnerable sections of the countrys workforce, frequently exploited sexually by employers.         
	The prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace bill, first mooted by former WCD minister Renuka Chowdhury in 2007, has till now covered all institutions that serve as workplaces.         
	I am very surprised. If the government does exclude domestic workers from the ambit of this law, it would make the exploitation of women domestic workers  adults and children  even easier than it is today, said Shireen Miller, head of advocacy for UK-based NGO, Save the Children.         
	A recent study by the NGO in Bengal showed that over 70 per cent of girls working as domestic help in the state faced sexual exploitation, Miller added.         
	The bill, which for the first time takes into account the nature of employer-employee relationships in tackling sexual harassment, covers both the organised and the unorganised sector that constitutes over 90 per cent of Indias workforce.         
	Till recently, the bill only protected employees at their workplace. But as was reported first by The Telegraph on February 22, 2010, the WCD ministry proposed  and the law ministry accepted  making the law stricter to cover all those present at the workplace of the accused.         
	This change came in the aftermath of a nationwide outcry over the suicide of a teenage Chandigarh girl after she was molested by a senior police officer heading a tennis club where the girl practised.         
	Sportswomen at training camps, children of employees visiting their parents offices and any other guest visiting an office are protected under the draft law now.

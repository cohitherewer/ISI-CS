The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi sees old friends in new winners
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi sees old friends in new winners
  - Looking forward to working with known allies in Congress: Foreign secretary        ARCHIS MOHAN                           Nirupama Rao                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: India appears to view the election losses of President Barack Obamas Democratic Party as good news because several of New Delhis old friends have made it to the US Congress.         
	We look forward to working with the new members of Congress. Many of them are well-known old friends of India who have been associated with the India caucus in the Congress and many of whom have visited India. They know the India-US relationship well. So we are looking forward to working with them, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said.         
	The Telegraph had reported today that the election results are good for India because key Congress committees will now be headed by friends of New Delhi.         
	Rao qualified her statement saying India-US ties are a subject of bipartisan consensus within the US and would not comment on the internal affairs of the United States when asked if it was a weakened Obama who would land in India this week.         
	However, the import of her statement was unmistakable  India has many more friends in the US Congress now and they are not Democrats.         
	Obama today wished Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak to everyone celebrating the festival and recalled that he had lit a diya last year.         
	To those celebrating Diwali in India, I look forward to visiting you over the next few days. And to all those who will celebrate this joyous occasion on Friday, I wish you, your families and loved ones Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak, he said in a message released by the US embassy here.         
	The foreign secretary had on Tuesday tried to downplay expectations from the US Presidents visit. We are not at a stage in our relationship for dramatic breakthroughs and big bang, she said.         
	Rao continued in that tenor today, saying it would be hasty to conclude India was disappointed at Obamas comments on a permanent UN Security Council seat for the country or his failure to give assurances on issues of concern such as outsourcing, increase in visa fee and withdrawal of the US ban on export of dual-use technology.         
	The issues (of a permanent Security Council seat) are by nature very complex. They are the subject of ongoing and continuing discussions with the US and we have used the opportunity of official discussions and briefings to talk about these issues in a very candid and very open and transparent way, she said.         
	The focus of Obamas visit would be economic, the foreign secretary said, adding that New Delhi would convey to the visiting delegation how thousands of jobs have been created in the US because of new investments and acquisitions by Indian companies.        
	Rao stressed that India was the fastest-growing source of foreign direct investment in the US. They are creating, saving or supporting tens of thousands of jobs in the US.

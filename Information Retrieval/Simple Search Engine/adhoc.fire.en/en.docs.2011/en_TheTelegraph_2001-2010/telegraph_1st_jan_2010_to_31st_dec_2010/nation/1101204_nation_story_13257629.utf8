The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre talks tough to airlines
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre talks tough to airlines
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Praful Patel today took a tough line against airlines trying to jack up fares ahead of the winter holiday season, warning that action would be taken if the proposed last-minute ticket prices were not brought down.        
	Asserting the Centre could not remain a mute spectator to such developments, the civil aviation minister said there was no justification for airlines to hike air fares in an arbitrary manner.        
	The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) would crack down on such arbitrary hikes, he said, although it was not in the business of regulating fares on a daily basis.        
	Yesterday, airlines had proposed raising peak fares over four distance bands that would raise the price of a Calcutta-Delhi ticket to Rs 40,000 unless bought at least two days in advance.        
	The DGCA rejected the proposal today, citing technical reasons. It said norms did not provide for distance-based slabs and airlines had not specified for which months fares would be raised.        
	Top airline executives have been called for a meeting tomorrow to explain the reason for the hike. The government and the DGCA have viewed these developments very seriously. We feel corrective action needs to be taken, Patel said.        
	While airline officials contended that the DGCAs powers did not extend to monitoring fares, Patel said the sector regulator had a wide range of powers that could be used to ensure transparency in fixing airfares.        
	The DGCA could exercise its powers under Rule 135 of Aircraft Rules, 1937, to take action against airlines if they raised fares substantially without reason, he said. But for now, we want to see how the airlines respond to the situation.        
	The minister said airlines could and did raise fares closer to the date of travel, so a flier who books later pays more. But there was need for a fair balance between pricing policies and consumer rights, he said.        
	The government would also establish a civil aviation economic advisory council to advise the DGCA on all economic and financial issues relating to airlines. This would safeguard consumer interests, Patel said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 22: Christian and Muslim leaders have threatened to abandon the Congress if their demand for Scheduled Caste status for Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims is not met.         
	The leaders believe that this is the best time to put pressure on the government as elections are round the corner in several states.        
	The demand was made today at a rally organised by the National Council of Dalit Christians in collaboration with the Catholic Bishops Conference of India, the National Council of Churches in India, All India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz and the All India Jamiatul Hawareen.         
	The Muslim and Christian leaders asked the government to repeal a 1950 order that bequeathed SC status to only Dalit Hindus.         
	Muslims and Christians were not allowed to seek the status as the religions rejected caste system.         
	The Congress should not take our support for granted, said Father Roby Kolenchery from the Punjab diocese.

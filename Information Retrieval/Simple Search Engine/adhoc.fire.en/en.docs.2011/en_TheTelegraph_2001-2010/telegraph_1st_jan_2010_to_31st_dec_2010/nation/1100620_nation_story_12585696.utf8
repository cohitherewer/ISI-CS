          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, June 19: Mani Shankar Aiyar has demanded to know why the Commonwealth Games is being held in Delhi and not Dantewada, combining in a single jibe his long-time opposition to the Centres Maoist and allegedly pro-rich economic policies.        
	Aiyar has criticised what he sees as the wasteful expenditure on the October Games several times in the past, beginning with his formal protest as sports minister in UPA I. Now, in an article in a Hindi daily, he has wondered why the event is being held in one of the countrys most developed and prosperous cities.        
	Britain tried to inject a fresh lease of life into the most neglected area of eastern Manchester, inhabited mostly by the jobless poor, by organising the Commonwealth Games there, he wrote. The area now has the biggest Wallmart store where 18,000 boys and girls have been employed.        
	Aiyar cited that Britain was developing the 10 most backward areas of the Lee Valley on the outskirts of London for the 2012 Olympics and asked: Why are the (Commonwealth) Games not being held in Bawana (a Jat village in northwest Delhi) as originally planned? Why not in Dantewada of Chhattisgarh where the investment of Rs 20,000 crore that is being spent on the Games would have changed the whole area, robbing the Maoists of their most fertile recruiting ground?        
	He answered the question himself, saying Indias party-hopping elite had no concern for those who survive in wretched poverty.        
	Aiyar, picked by Sonia Gandhi for presidential nomination to the Rajya Sabha, recently said the governments one-eyed policy on Maoists was helping the mining mafia rather than address the root causes of tribal discontent.        
	He wrote scathingly: Beggars have been chased out of Delhi as they would leave a negative impression on foreigners. What impression will the foreigners have when pimps offer desi girls at dirt-cheap rates just outside the sporting venues?        
	Aiyar is convener of the panel supervising the partys 125-year celebrations. His article comes days after the Congress media cell asked party functionaries not to comment publicly on subjects outside their brief. Some party leaders feel he should be punished or at least firmly asked to avoid shooting his mouth off.

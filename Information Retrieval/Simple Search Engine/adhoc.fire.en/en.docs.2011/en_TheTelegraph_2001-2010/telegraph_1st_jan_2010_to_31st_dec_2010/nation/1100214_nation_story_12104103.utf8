	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Indian foreign ministry is proceeding with caution but the security establishment feels that the Pune attack bears the signature of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the usual suspect based in Pakistan.        
	If the initial suspicion of a Lashkar hand is confirmed by investigations and corroborated by proof, the Pune attack would not only have shattered the nearly 15-month-old calm after 26/11 but also the fresh peace initiative with Pakistan.        
	Such an outcome of the investigation  the suspicion is still based on preliminary inputs from Pune and by no means conclusive  is expected to bring the Manmohan Singh government under intense pressure to shelve the plan for talks between the foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India in Delhi on February 25. The BJP has already suggested that the talks should not be held.        
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai did not go so far as to suggest a Lashkar role but his reference to David Coleman Headley having stayed in that particular area in Pune served to underscore the possibility of the militant outfits hand. Headley, now being tried in the US, is an alleged operative of the Lashkar, which has been blamed for 26/11.        
	Sources in the home ministry said the choice of the Pune location frequented by westerners and the material used in the improvised device bear the signatures of Lashkar.        
	The external affairs ministry did not comment on the Pune incident till late tonight, suggesting that the government wanted to be doubly sure before blaming anyone.        
	The talks with Pakistan may be the closest big-ticket event but the Pune attack has come in the run-up to several other high-profile events such as the Indian Premier League next month and the Commonwealth Games in October.         
	Both have foreign presence and the Pune blast is being seen as part of attempts to project India as unsafe before the rest of the world.        
	This is also the first such terrorist attack under the watch of home minister P. Chidambaram and national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon. Blasts with higher casualty had struck the Northeast soon after Chidambaram took over as home minister but local militant groups were blamed for the attacks with objectives limited to demands confined to the region.        
	Chidambaram has cut short his programmes in southern India and will reach Pune tomorrow morning. The home ministry has sent a forensic team and National Investigation Agency officials to Pune to assist local police.        
	Menon, considered an architect of the peace initiative, had just returned from Munich this evening when the Pune bomb went off. He was abroad for a UN conference.        
	The Centre said there was no specific intelligence regarding the blast in Pune. No, we did not have any specific intelligence regarding the bomb or any incident in Pune or near about, the home ministrys special secretary, U.K. Bansal, said.

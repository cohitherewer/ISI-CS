          FARID HOSSAIN                              
	Dhaka, Jan. 17: Hundreds of Hindus and Muslims gathered at Jyoti Basus ancestral home in Barudi village today, praying for the soul of a great man of the subcontinent who would speak to them like a commoner.        
	A crowd of mourners chanted verses from the Quran in front of the two-storey house, nestled among trees in Barudi, about two hours drive from Dhaka.        
	Hindus from Barudi and neighbouring villages trooped to the local Loknath Brahmachari Ashram where a banner read: Mahamanaber Mahaprayane Mahaprarthana Samabesh (Prayer gathering for a departed great man).        
	We consider him neither a Hindu nor a Muslim, said Mohammad Shadidullah, the houses caretaker who is in his late 60s. He was a great human being and a great secular leader.        
	Mohammad Rafiq, a 60-year-old farmer, was one of many who recalled Basus visit to Barudi in 1987 and 1997 when he was chief minister of Bengal.        
	He spoke to ordinary villagers like us and asked about our welfare as though we were very close to him, Rafiq said. He behaved as if he was a commoner like us; thats how sincere he was.        
	Hasina visit        
	Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed will travel to Calcutta tomorrow to pay homage to Basu.

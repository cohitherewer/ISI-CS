          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 4: Orissa has done well by managing to realise almost a third of the massive investments promised to it despite a global slowdown shaking investors confidence, reports show.        
	Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) today found that out of Rs 9.4 lakh investment proposals lined up till September 2009, 32.6 per cent proposals  worth Rs 3.06 lakh crore  have already been implemented. Though more than 65 per cent investment proposals for Orissa, declared recently are at the announcement stage due to global economic slump in 2008 and 2009, the rate of implementation (32.6 per cent) is better than other states, said Assocham president Swati Piramal.        
	At the end of September 2009, there were 486 live investment projects worth Rs. 9.4 lakh crores in Orissa. This is 27 per cent higher than the live investment reported in September 2008, said Piramal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VHP asks for entire disputed land
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      VHP asks for entire disputed land
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 20: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad today said the entire 67 acres at the disputed Ayodhya site were required to build a grand Ram temple and a third part allotted to Ram Lalla Virajman would not suffice.        
	The high court order to trifurcate the land is like dividing the country in the same way as the Partition had done, a VHP release said after a meeting of its Sant Uchadhikar Samiti and select invitees in Ayodhya.        
	We dont accept this. We want the entire land.        
	Although there were dissenting voices among Hindu groups about the decision, the VHPs stand appears to have driven the final nail in the negotiations being held by moderates to settle the matter.        
	At a news conference in Ayodhya, VHP international president Ashok Singhal said only non-division of land could resolve the impasse and the Centre should enact a law to hand it over to the Hindus.        
	He then took matters a step further, saying Sant Uchadhikar Samiti representatives would meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on October 23 or 24 and request him to enact such a law.        
	Singhal said the VHP had also decided not to allow any mosque to be built in the town that was sacred to Hindus. Ayodhya is a religious city for the Hindus. There is no place for a mosque there.        
	As the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas had failed at least four times to thrash out an out-of-court settlement, he said now there is no question of further talks.        
	He reminded the Muslims that they had promised to give up claim on the disputed land if the court found Babri Masjid had been built after demolishing a temple. Now they should stick to their promise and hand over the entire land for the temple.        
	On Singhals stand that the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas should be empowered to build a grand temple, a representative of Ram Lalla Virajman said: We will react to this later. We are not happy with the position taken.        
	The Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabhas Swami Chakrapani said he still favoured a negotiated settlement.

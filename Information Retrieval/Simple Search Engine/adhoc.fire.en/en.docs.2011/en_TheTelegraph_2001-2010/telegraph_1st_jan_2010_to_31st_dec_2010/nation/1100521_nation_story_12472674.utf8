          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 20: The Orissa government today decided to ask Posco to cut its land requirement by 300 acres, which would keep out of its project all the private land from protest-epicentre Dhinkia.        
	Of the 4,004 acres on which the South Korean steel major plans to build its factory, private plots make up just 437 acres but have triggered massive resistance from villagers.        
	After slashing the 300 acres, the remaining private land within the project area in Jagatsinghpur district would all be from outside Dhinkia panchayat, revenue divisional commissioner (central) Pradipta Mohapatra said.        
	Although there are no reports of a deal being struck with the protesters, chief minister Naveen Patnaik hinted that the dialogue process with them would be complete by the end of this month.        
	The decision to make the request to Posco was taken at a meeting chaired by Patnaik and attended by the Jagatsinghpur MP and all the four MLAs from the district.        
	Patnaik told reporters: All co-operation would be extended to the Posco project. The Jagastsinghpur collector has been asked to negotiate with the local people to sort out all contentious issues relating to rehabilitation.        
	He said revenue divisional commissioner Mohapatra had been asked to initiate the dialogue.        
	Mohapatra said: If all the issues are not resolved at my level and require the chief ministers intervention, another meeting would be held at the highest level.        
	He made it clear that there was no question of shifting the site of the Posco project.

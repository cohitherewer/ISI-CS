The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ads on Sharma leave Cong squirming
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ads on Sharma leave Cong squirming
          SANJAY K JHA                               
	New Delhi, June 7: The Congress today appeared shocked at a string of newspaper ads placed by Rajasthan traders hailing commerce minister Anand Sharmas re-nomination to the Rajya Sabha from the state.        
	While the nomination is being viewed as a signal of Sonia Gandhis extraordinary support for the minister who couldnt have returned to the Rajya Sabha from his home state of Himachal Pradesh, party leaders felt the vulgar display of support from the traders may have caused his image irreparable damage.        
	One senior leader said the ads were in bad taste and a bad advertisement of ministerial propriety. The leaders were not sure if Sharma knew of the ads but said the minister should now publicly disapprove of the act to distance himself from the traders.        
	One senior leader reacted angrily saying: Ask the minister. Have you ever seen such ads featuring any other central leaders nomination to the Rajya Sabha? Small-time Congress leaders often place newspaper ads on the birthdays of their mentors, but the scale of the blitz for Anand stunned many.        
	The ads by 10 firms, including marble traders, jewellers, exporters and builders, expressed heartfelt gratitude to Sonia, Manmohan Singh, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Union rural development minister C.P. Joshi, who is from the state.        
	The ads were managed by Crayons, a media agency that often works for political parties. Crayons owner Kunal Lalani hails from Rajasthan and is said to be close to Gehlot, who was initially not keen on Sharmas candidature from the state.

	New Delhi, Aug. 13: A Congress core committee meeting today took no decision on the fate of Suresh Kalmadi but sources said the party might ask the government to take some symbolic measures after talks with the sports ministry.        
	One option is forming a committee of bureaucrats, headed by the cabinet secretary, to oversee the management of the Games. The panel may not act as an apex body an option apparently ruled out by the pact with the Games federation  but is likely to oversee the expenses.

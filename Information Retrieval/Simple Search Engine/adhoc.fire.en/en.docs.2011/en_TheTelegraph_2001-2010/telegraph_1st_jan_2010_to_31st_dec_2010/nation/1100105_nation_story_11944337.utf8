          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 4: The ruling National Conference today demanded autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir, calling for a rollback of all the central laws that were applied to the state after 1953.        
	On a day Omar Abdullah completed one year as chief minister, firebrand party general secretary Sheikh Nazir Ahmad said: All the laws enforced in Jammu and Kashmir post-1953 should be rolled back.        
	Nazir, Omars uncle and the party No. 2 after its president Farooq Abdullah, added: This will put an end to the practice of imposing puppet regimes in the state.        
	The obvious reference was to Article 356, which has led to the dismissal of several governments since 1953.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bill to overhaul university system   Registry for VCs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bill to overhaul university system   Registry for VCs
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: All universities and deemed universities will have to pick vice-chancellors from a central registry of select, renowned academics under a new higher education architecture that aims to cleanse a tainted system of corruption and stagnation.        
	The overhaul plan shields higher education regulators from conflicts of interests for the first time, and legally ensures that the regulators performance will be reviewed periodically by experts and Parliament.        
	The new structure, endorsed by the Prime Minister, has been finalised by a human resource development (HRD) ministry-appointed experts panel under the bill to create a National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), a new overarching regulator.        
	The NCHER bill has been accepted by the HRD ministry, which will now hold regional consultations on a request from the Prime Minister. The first meeting is on February 15.        
	A collegium of experts will create and update the national registry of potential vice-chancellors (VCs). The NCHER will recommend five names from the registry to a central institution each time it has a vacancy for the post of VC. The institution can pick from the list of five.        
	State government universities can seek the NCHERs advice or independently select VCs  but they, and even private universities and deemed universities, must pick from the names in the registry.        
	The NCHER bill, of which The Telegraph has a copy, seeks to repeal laws governing the current regulators: the University Grants Commission, All India Council for Technical Education and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE). They will cease to exist with their powers, assets and employees absorbed by the NCHER.        
	The bill takes away from the Bar Council of India and the Council of Architecture their regulatory powers over legal and architecture education while allowing them to remain in charge of professional standards.        
	All higher educational institutions, including those created under acts of Parliament such as the central universities or the IITs, will need NCHER approval before starting a course. Institutions set up under acts of Parliament are currently free to start their own courses except in select cases.        
	The government also wants to de-link the creation of a university from its powers to award degrees, since new institutions take time to build facilities to offer quality education. An institution now earns the right to award degrees the moment it becomes a university or a deemed university.         
	But, as reported in this newspaper on January 13, the government is now drafting a new law (different from the NCHER bill) that will allow all new universities to be created through that single legislation without automatically granting degree-awarding powers.        
	Although education is a concurrent subject managed jointly by the state and the Centre, the powers to regulate quality in higher education rest with the Centre. This is why, for instance, Calcutta High Court had declared several teacher-training institutions in Bengal illegal  they did not meet NCTE requirements though they did meet state government standards.        
	The collegium of experts will be made up by core members  National Research Professors, recipients of the Nobel Prize or Fields Medal (in mathematics), or members of professional bodies like the Indian National Science Academies  and co-opted members.        
	The second group will consist of one representative picked from each state. A state government will recommend five names and the core members will pick one.        
	The NCHER will have a chairman, three whole-time (and salaried) members and three other nominated members. All seven will be appointed by a selection committee made up by the Prime Minister, leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition, Lok Sabha Speaker, HRD minister and the health minister. Each member will be chosen from a panel of three proposed by the collegium.        
	Members of the collegium and the NCHER will have to declare at the time of joining any direct or indirect interest they hold in any higher educational institution in the country.        
	NCHER members cannot join any institution associated with higher education for five years after leaving the commission.        
	The move  the first time the idea of a conflict of interests has been legally recognised in Indian higher education  follows a spate of instances of regulatory bosses seeking jobs as VCs.        
	In the most recent case, current UGC secretary R.K. Chauhan is said to have lobbied for the post of VC at the recently started central university in Himachal Pradesh.        
	The NCHER, under the bill, will regularly review the status of higher education nationally and in each state.        
	The bill also mandates an external review (by experts) of the NCHERs own functioning every five years, to be ordered by the President. Every 10 years, Parliament will review the NCHER Act. The provision of a mandatory parliamentary review is unprecedented in India.        
	These measures are aimed at preventing stagnation of the Indian higher education system and its architecture.

	New Delhi, April 28: A relaxation in Leave Travel Concession (LTC) rules allowing central employees to travel to the Northeast by air has been extended by two years from May 1 this year.        
	The move follows a rise in tourist arrivals since 2008, when the relaxation was first given.        
	The scheme was the brainchild of Mani Shankar Aiyar, former minister of development for the north-eastern region (Doner). His successor and incumbent, Bijoy Krishna Handique, has expanded the programme.        
	Handique had appealed to the minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pension, Prithviraj Chauhan, in February to extend the relaxation in view of the tremendous enthusiasm generated among the central government employees. He had said it would give the regions economy a fillip by boosting tourism.        
	Handiques request came against the backdrop of a growth of 21 per cent in domestic tourist arrivals to the eight north-eastern states in the past two years. The arrivals in 2009 went up 11 per cent over the previous year.        
	This growth is chiefly attributed to the huge increase in LTC tourists since the introduction of the scheme in May, 2008. There was a total inflow of 5.7 million domestic tourists in 2009, a ministry release said on Tuesday.

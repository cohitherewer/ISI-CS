          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 9: Kapil Sibal plans to ask state governments to share with the Centre the financial burden of starting a new agency that will offer soft loans to fledgling education institutions and students.        
	The human resource development ministers move may trigger cries of anguish from the states that have already complained about inadequate funds to implement the historic right to education law, demanding additional funds from the Centre.        
	But such cries of helplessness will only help the minister reinforce the Centre as the lone warrior for education reforms in the country, a role that forms the subtext of several Sibal policies.         
	Sibal will ask state education ministers to financially support the proposed National Education Finance Corporation (NEFC) at a meeting with them here on June 18, top government sources said.         
	It is a win-win situation for the Centre. If states help in funding the NEFC, it reduces our financial bill. If not, it strengthens our position at a time when we face opposition from them on other education reforms, a source said.        
	Several state governments, including Bengal and Tamil Nadu, have raised concerns over the powers of a proposed new overarching higher education regulator. Their concerns are scheduled to be discussed by the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE)  which includes all state education secretaries and the HRD ministry  on June 19, a day after the NEFC is discussed.        
	The CABE will also discuss the fund-sharing arrangement between the Centre and states for the right to education law, the other area of contention.         
	The NEFC, promised in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12), is envisaged along the lines of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), which assists self-help groups by offering small loans.        
	Under the HRD ministrys blueprint, the NEFC will be funded through three sources  budgeted funds, a higher education cess already in place but unused, and bonds gift-wrapped in tax concessions. If the states agree to contribute financially, the Centre can reduce its budgetary allocation for the NEFC.         
	The proposed lending agency will offer student loans at low interest. The arrangement will run parallel to an existing scheme that subsidises education loans.         
	The NEFC will also lend funds to fledgling government and private higher educational institutions.         
	Since state government-run institutions will also benefit from NEFC loans, they must try and contribute financially, Sibal will argue, the sources said.

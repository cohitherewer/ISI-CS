The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twin strikes by CPM Two
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Twin strikes by CPM Two
          J.P. YADAV                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The CPM today put on display a not-too-familiar division of labour, Sitaram Yechury targeting the Prime Minister and Prakash Karat confining himself to attacking the BJP.        
	In a joint news conference at the end of the CPM central committee meeting, politburo member Yechury took 2G spectrum potshots at Manmohan Singh while Karat gunned for the Karnataka chief ministers head over illegal mining and land deals.        
	We are not questioning the Prime Ministers integrity, but his infallibility. Everybody can make a mistake. Please come out and own it, Yechury declared as Karat quietly sat beside him.        
	Releasing documents the BJP had done a day earlier, the CPM underlined how the UPA government itself, not the Opposition, was dragging Prime Minister Singhs name into the spectrum controversy.        
	It also released an earlier affidavit filed by the telecom ministry, then under A. Raja, to establish that Singh was updated about everything.        
	Thus, not only was there no difference of opinion with the Honble Prime Minister, his office was also fully kept informed of all decisions, Yechury read from the affidavit.        
	He then urged the Prime Minister to come out clean by making a statement in Parliament and ordering a joint parliamentary committee probe.        
	Since it is the government that is dragging his name in, it becomes imperative for the Prime Minister to speak and clear his name, Yechury said. His name should be cleared in the interest of the country and the interest of his government.        
	He said the CPM would not budge from the demand for a JPC probe, as party leaders believed it was the only way to get to the bottom of things.        
	Once Yechury was done, Karat took over. Putting the BJP in the firing line, possibly to pre-empt the charge that the CPM could be co-ordinating with it on the spectrum scam, Karat said: The mining mafia is part of the Karnataka government. The chief minister has to go. He cannot continue in office.        
	He added that the BJP was no different from the Congress when it came to indulging in cronyism.        
	Karat finished with a swipe at Bengal rival Mamata Banerjee. The Trinamul Congress is openly colluding with the Maoists and we condemn their joint attack on CPM cadres.

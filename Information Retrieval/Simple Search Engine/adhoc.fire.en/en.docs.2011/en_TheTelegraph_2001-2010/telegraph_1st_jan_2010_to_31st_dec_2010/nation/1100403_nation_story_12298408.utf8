	Srinagar, April 2: A four-day-old encounter described as the deadliest in Jammu in recent years left four more militants and a soldier dead today, while the rebels opened a new front in the Valley by targeting railway tracks.        
	Sixteen militants and six soldiers have been killed in gun battles that began in the woods of Rajouri and Reasi districts of Jammu on Monday as the rebels made their biggest infiltration bid this year.        
	In Pulwama in south Kashmir, militants blew up tracks last night in their first attack on the railway network since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh launched train services in the Valley in October 2008.        
	Since then, trains have emerged as one of the most popular modes of transport, especially after the 119km Baramulla-Qazigund line connecting north and south Kashmir was completed last year.        
	In Jammu, sources said, the militants broke open the security cordon several times, surfacing at different places only to be cordoned off again.        
	This has been going on for four days. Thousands of army and police personnel are involved in the operation, spread across the districts Rajouri and Reasi of Jammu. Troops from 48RR (Rashtriya Rifles), 54RR, 68RR and 8 Mahar are participating in these encounters, a police officer said.        
	Four militants were eliminated today. We lost one soldier, Sipahi Sailesh Kumar, from 63RR, defence spokesperson Lt Col Biplab Nath said.        
	The encounter has reinforced fears of an escalation in violence this year, with army intelligence suggesting 2,500 militants are ready to infiltrate.        
	Militants have made dozens of sneak-in bids in recent months in Jammu. With the snow melting on Kashmirs borders, they are now turning their attention to the Valley. Eight rebels were killed when the first entry bid in Kashmir was foiled last week in Kupwara district.        
	In Pulwamas Galbug village, 40km from Srinagar, the rebels left a 2ft-deep crater in the tracks. There were no casualties, and railway officials said they repaired the tracks and made them operational by 11.30am today.        
	Officials said the rail network had been on the militants radar even before the service was opened in Kashmir. In 2007, the army had recovered diaries from some slain militants in Tangmarg that contained plans to blow up tracks and bridges.        
	The train service is used by ordinary Kashmiris and not the security forces, and this is one possible reason why it was not targeted in the past, a police officer said.        
	Once work is complete on the 171km of tracks from Udhampur in Jammu to Qazigund in Kashmir, it will connect Kashmir with the rest of the country.

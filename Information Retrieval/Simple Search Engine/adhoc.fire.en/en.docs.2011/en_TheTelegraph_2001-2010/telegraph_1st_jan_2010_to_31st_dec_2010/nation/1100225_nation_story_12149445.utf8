The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vanakkam reply to Bengal, Bengal 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Vanakkam reply to Bengal, Bengal 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                          Sachin Tendulkar and Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta. File picture    
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Until Sachin Tendulkars singular Mach-2 hurricane blew her off the days cynosure pedestal early evening, Mamata Banerjee could have afforded herself a pat on the back for establishing an easy suzerainty on centre stage.        
	Shed quickly, and fairly, divined the pulse of the House and, for the better part of her presentation, let the Opposition do the job for her. She couldnt have used the railway ministers lectern to make an overt case for favouring Bengal even if she wished, but she did well to rely on her opponents.         
	They spared no opportunity to rain the charge of a Bengal-bias on Mamatas budget. Mamata cleverly made an opportunity of each charge. Bengal, Bengal, Bengal they cried through her two-hour discourse. Each time Mamata offered a pause to let the charge resonate under the Lok Sabha domes. To them favouring Bengal made an allegation, to Mamata it rang like an accolade. She was barely likely to protest being handed such a gift horse. The way the Opposition went about foregrounding her favouritism for Bengal, the surprise was she didnt actually thank her adversaries across the well for the favour.        
	But that would probably have given the wicked little plot away. So she rattled on regardless, littering her home state with prospects of future bounty, never once agreeing she was guilty of playing partisan. Sabko diya, sabko diya, she remonstrated to one particularly irate BJP member from Gujarat who kept springing up like jack-on-the-box to voice his protest. Tumko bhi diya, dhyan se suno, jyada bolega to kaat dega. (Ive given to everyone, everyone, I have given to you too, listen carefully, if you talk to much I will cancel it out). Uproar erupted and sank the disgruntled member deep into his seat.         
	Such impatient admonishing was de rigueur today, because Mamatas speech was more interrupted than made, especially towards the latter half when the minister began to run through her new projects and trains. In the reckoning of the Opposition benches, Bengal had been worked into just too many of them. But for every protest that the mention of a Bengali location provoked, Mamata had a riposte from another part of Indias geography.         
	Chhapra? Kahan Hai, Bihar, Lalooji ka ghar. Bhubaneswar? Kahan hai, Orissa. Guwahati? Kahan hai? Assam. Udaipur? Kahan hai? Rajasthan. Dhanushkodi? Kahan hai? Having mentioned it, she realised she did not actually know. Tamil Nadu, someone from the back offered helpfully. Haan, Tamil Nadu, Bengal to nahin hai, ki hai?         
	She actually did not know too much about too many destinations she promised to expand her network to, but typically of Mamata, she played unabashedly honest. Please dont mind, she pleaded after a particularly bad stutter on place names. Please dont mind my pronunciation, I am doing my best. And then, realising she was doing a specially bad job of southern names, she invented an on-the-spur apology: Vanakkam!         
	The jury is still out on how vanakkam went down in the southern quarter of the Lok Sabha as an expression of regret, but it amused Sonia Gandhi enough to indulge in a grin so wide she had to hide it with her palm. The UPA chairperson would later offer Mamata a close hug, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh an extended left hand in blessing. Shed carried the day. Alas, for her, it wasnt over yet. As she stood in the pit of the Lok Sabha gathering laurels in the swirl of her pale shawl, Tendulkar was stepping out to the crease in Gwalior. By the time he was done, Tendulkar had made history and Mamata was probably feeling like a piece of it.

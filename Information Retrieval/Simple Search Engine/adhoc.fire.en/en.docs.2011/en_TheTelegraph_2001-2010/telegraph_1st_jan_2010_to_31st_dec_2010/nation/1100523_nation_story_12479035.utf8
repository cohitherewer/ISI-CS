The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Grouses on expat pilots pour out
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Grouses on expat pilots pour out

	New Delhi, May 23: From the debris of todays crash, a tiny statistic has rocked back into focus  of the 5,500 pilots airlines in India have on their rolls, some 560  10 per cent  are foreign nationals.        
	The two-digit figure, hardly of significance at other times, may not have come under the glare had the pilot of the ill-fated Air India Express been an Indian.        
	Capt. Z. Glusica was a British national of Serbian origin.        
	With over 10,000 flying hours behind him, the 53-year-old had a fair amount of experience of the Mangalore terrain, civil aviation secretary Madhavan Nambiar said, but other aviation sources talked about the rush to hire foreigners to meet the shortage of trained Indian pilots.        
	According to these sources, expat pilots from the US, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Bolivia, Indonesia, Philippines and Nigeria have flown in to join what is being seen as a boom in Indias aviation market. This year, passenger bookings have increased by 25 per cent.        
	The rush to hire foreign pilots is such that sometime back, a Bolivian pilot working with a private airline was allegedly issued a passenger boarding pass to put him on an aircraft. His work permit hadnt come on time.        
	But the problem with the words expat pilot is that it has grown to mean different things for different people.         
	For air traffic controllers, they are a headache who cant follow English accents of Indians and have to be told everything slowly, the sources said.        
	To make matters worse, these pilots often come from nations unused to heavy air traffic conditions and the accompanying air chatter.        
	There have been many incidents in the air because these guys dont understand us  nothing fatal as yet but things like route changes. They have claimed they didnt understand our instructions and hence remained on routes we asked them to vacate. These incidents are sometimes scary, said a senior air traffic controller in Delhi.        
	Language problem has been found to be the biggest problem in conversations pilots have with the ATC (air traffic control), agreed former civil aviation minister Sharad Yadav.         
	It might have led to the crash in Mangalore, PTI quoted him as saying in Bihar, though the Janata Dal (United) chief didnt offer any proof that language was an issue in todays tragedy.        
	The chatter in Indian skies is something some of these pilots are unable to cope with, said U.K. Bose, former CEO, Sahara Airlines. Some of them come from countries which have few flights unlike ours, that too is sometimes a problem.        
	For Indian pilots, the expats are professional rivals who take away jobs and get higher pay. While an Indian commander of a Boeing or airbus gets between Rs 2.5-3.25 lakh a month as pay besides perks, an expat gets about 25 per cent more.         
	The foreign pilots are, however, on contract and so are not entitled to long-term benefits such as lifelong medical care or provident fund.        
	Former minister Yadav, too, voiced his opposition to appointing foreign pilots. It is unfortunate that though there is no dearth of domestic hands to operate aircraft, foreign pilots are being preferred, he said.        
	But for airlines grappling with shortage of experienced pilots, expats are the answer. They are a necessity, said Robin Pathak, former director with Air India. We need about six commanders per Boeing, and sometimes you cant get Indian commanders for the plane type you are bringing in.        
	But the rush to hire pilots has sometimes meant employing people with dubious backgrounds. Logbooks often have overwriting, background checks have sometimes revealed drink problems or concealed medical problems, said an official with the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. We also found that some airlines would let pilots fly with outdated work permits or while waiting for them.

          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Mangalore, May 23: Jayawardene Akshayalingam, lack of sleep showing around his eyes, is back to the routine business of being at hand to welcome a state minister who has arrived from Bangalore.        
	Twenty-four hours ago, the Mangalore airports terminal manager had no time for such niceties.        
	We were so busy making arrangements for the crash victims relatives that I nearly failed to receive the Union civil aviation minister. Today promises to be a normal day, though, he said.        
	But it isnt easy to shake off the still-fresh memories of yesterdays painful and dramatic events.        
	After the air traffic controller had informed him that the Air India Express flight had disappeared over the end of the runway, Akshayalingam had rung his superiors with the bad news.        
	He had then brooded for about half an hour before entering the arrival hall, crammed with over 150 people who had minutes ago been waiting eagerly to welcome their loved ones on the plane.        
	But the TV news flash and mobile phone calls from their relatives had already prepared them for the worst. All I did was nod my head in the affirmative when someone asked if the plane had met with an accident, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said.        
	Although things are back to normal, there is no way I can fully expel the tragedy from my system, Akshayalingam said as he signed passes for the relief teams to approach the crash spot.        
	With 12 to 14 flights to be handled a day, there is little time to brood, said D. Ganesan, a senior AAI official who personally answered over a thousand calls from the victims anxious friends and relatives from across the globe yesterday.        
	He said that once the news spread, the local hospitals and the few public sector units in the area voluntarily rushed their ambulances and fire engines to the airport.

	Calcutta, Feb. 27: Mamata Banerjee today said she would take up the petroleum price hike with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chief Sonia Gandhi but insisted she had no quarrel with the ruling coalition.        
	At a time common people are already reeling from spiralling prices of essentials, a hike in the price of petroleum products will further add to their woes. I shall appeal to the Prime Minister and Soniaji for a rollback, the Trinamul Congress chief said at her Kalighat home this afternoon before leaving for Raj Bhavan for a meeting with governor M.K. Narayanan.        
	Mamata, who had not commented on the hike yesterday and left it to party leaders to make the Trinamul stand clear, said she had no quarrel with the UPA. Kono jhagra nei (I have no quarrel). As railway minister, I did not raise fares when there was an increase in petro-product prices. I am aware of occasional hikes in the prices of international crude. One has to digest it. But a rollback of the Centres decision is necessary since the hike in petroleum prices would hit the common people, she said.        
	On Trinamuls behalf, she added, party chief whip in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandopadhyay will raise the issue in Parliament.        
	Mamata said the Bengal government should also reduce the cess on petrol and diesel as it could not shirk responsibility in tackling the rise in prices of essential commodities.        
	Her public demand to roll back the hike followed a call from M. Karunanidhi. The DMK chief called me to say he had already written to the Prime Minister and the UPA chairperson demanding a rollback of the Centres decision to hike petroleum prices, Mamata said.        
	Earlier, on Mamatas directive, Bandopadhyay and leader of the Opposition in the Bengal Assembly Partha Chatterjee led a procession of about 500 party workers from the Moulali crossing to the Metro channel at Esplanade to protest the hike.        
	Trinamul workers marched the 2km stretch raising slogans like petrol diesel-er mulya briddhi manchhi naa, manbo naa (We are not accepting the petrol-diesel price hike. We wont accept the hike).         
	They also demanded that the decision be rolled back without delay. We want the Centre to immediately roll back its decision. Today, we hit the streets as part of our statewide agitation, Chatterjee said at Esplanade.         
	Asked if the protest by Trinamul, the Congresss biggest ally in the UPA, would embarrass the Centre, Bandopadhyay said: In a parliamentary democracy, a political party has to raise its voice when the government takes a decision that affects common people.         
	Some party leaders also spoke against the petroleum price hike at todays core committee meeting at Trinamul Bhavan. Mamata did not attend the meeting.         
	Trinamul ally SUCI held a separate demonstration at Esplanade. The state BJP also took out a procession from its central Calcutta party office to Esplanade.        
	At Raj Bhavan, Mamata told governor Narayanan the railways would give jobs to family members of policemen killed by Maoists in the past few years if the state government did not.        
	I told the governor to impress upon the state government to ensure jobs for the family members of the policemen who died in Maoist attacks. If they cant, we shall arrange jobs for them in the Railway Protection Force, she told reporters after the meeting.        
	Mamata also urged the governor to ensure that illegal arms were seized. The railway minister said she told Narayanan the CPM, which has amassed illegal arms, has unleashed terror in Bengal and that CPM cadres were taking advantage of the presence of joint forces to expand their base in remote areas of Maoist-hit Jungle Mahal.        
	I requested the governor to look into these problems, she said.

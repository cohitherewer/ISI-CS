                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IAF to buy micro vehicle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           The micro air vehicle    
	New Delhi, July 8: The Indian Air Force is in the market to buy an unspecified number of micro air vehicles (MAV)  football-size remotely operated aircraft  for use in counter-insurgency.         
	The request for information that the air force has sent to potential vendors stipulates that each of the MAVs should not weigh more than 2kg.         
	State and central security forces were given a demonstration of an MAV  a Honeywell RQ-16 T-Hawk  at the Counterterrorism and Jungle Warfare College in Kanker, Chhattisgarh, in May.         
	The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is also fine-tuning the Netra, an MAV that was featured in the Aamir Khan-starrer 3 Idiots as a product designed by an engineering college student.         
	The IAF wants to buy crafts that are capable of vertical take-off and landing and can carry cameras without night vision devices. The MUVs are designed for use by security forces in patrols, to scout the lay of the land, before pushing ahead.         
	Though the IAF has not specified a number it is understood to have projected the need for several hundred MUVs. The home ministry is also likely to place a separate order for MUVs for the central paramilitary forces.

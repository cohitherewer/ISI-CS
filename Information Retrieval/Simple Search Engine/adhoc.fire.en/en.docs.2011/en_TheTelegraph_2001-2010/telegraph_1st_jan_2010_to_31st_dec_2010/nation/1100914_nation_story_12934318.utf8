The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | America backlash adds fuel to Valley fire   14 dead on bloodiest day
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      America backlash adds fuel to Valley fire
14 dead on bloodiest day          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 13: Fourteen persons lost their lives in the deadliest day yet of azaadi protests in the Valley, the anger and violence being fanned by an Iranian channel that aired footage of the alleged desecration of the Quran in the US.        
	As protesters vented fury on symbols of government for the third successive day since Id-ul-Fitr, thousands in western Kashmir, nettled by the US reports, defied curfew and took out rallies, triggering clashes with security forces in several places. A missionary school was set ablaze.        
	The Omar Abdullah government said the Iranian Press TV footage had set off a chain reaction, after which it had been pulled. But the backlash against the desecration, articulated in the demonstrations, quickly turned into separatist protests against the central government. Demonstrations on unrelated issues  such as the desecration  can often balloon into wider anti-government sentiment in the Valley.        
	The 14 deaths took the total toll in the three-month-long unrest to 84. Among the victims were Jammu amp; Kashmir Liberation Front leader Showkat Mir and police constable Devinder Singh, the first policeman to die since the protests erupted on June 11.        
	In Tanmarg area of north Kashmir, three protesters were killed and some 52 injured after security forces opened fire on a mob that set fire to the prestigious Tyandale Biscoe School run by missionaries.        
	Some elements in the mob then torched government infrastructure, including the block development and social welfare offices, two huts of the tourism department and a tehsildars home and official vehicle, an official said.        
	There were five deaths in Budgam district, some 8km from Srinagar, which has been relatively peaceful so far. Three of them were in Humhama, again in firing by security forces. A police officer claimed constable Singh succumbed to injuries suffered in mob violence there, but sources said he was overrun by a vehicle caught in the clash. In Charar-e-Sharief, also in Budgam, a student was killed.        
	Two youths were killed at Ajas Bandipora and in Anantnag. Police sources said a mob pelted a security force convoy with stones, forcing the personnel to open fire.        
	Two more died in similar firing in Pampore, but police confirmed only one death. One person is confirmed dead and two are injured, said Shafaqat Watali, DIG, south Kashmir range.        
	The police said stray troublemakers pelted security forces with stones at Sabzi Mandi-Soura, Srinagar, but were chased away. A violent mob stoned security forces deployed in Machow as well as a camp in Gogo-Humhama.        
	On Sunday night, protesters set ablaze the office of Muzaffar Dev, the brother-in-law of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad in Humhama.        
	Hospitals in Srinagar had a tough time with blood banks running out of stock. Hospital authorities appealed to people to donate blood, but strict curfew prevented many volunteers from venturing out, sources said.         
	Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary S.S. Kapur appealed for calm. Something happened in New York and we are in no way in a position to deal with it. We condemn the desecration and appeal to people to not take law into their hands and co-operate with us, he said.        
	Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani urged the people to exercise restraint. Kashmiri Muslims have been hurt by the desecration of Quran. But at the same time, we have to control our emotions and not create a situation which could give vested interests a chance to defame Islam and our movement, he said.        
	Moderate Hurriyat voices too called for calm. A Hurriyat spokesperson claimed troops had fired on a peaceful demonstration without provocation. This is sheer state terrorism.

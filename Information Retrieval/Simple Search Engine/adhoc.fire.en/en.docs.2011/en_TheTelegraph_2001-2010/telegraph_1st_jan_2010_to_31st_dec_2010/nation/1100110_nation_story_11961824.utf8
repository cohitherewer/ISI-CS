The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Telangana free run for Andhra babus
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Telangana free run for Andhra babus
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          CPM activists in Hyderabad protest the hike in bus fare. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 9: Bureaucrats in Andhra Pradesh are exercising their independence with their political bosses caught up in the turmoil over Telangana.         
	Senior IPS officer S.S.P. Yadav, who was shunted out as director-general of police after the helicopter crash death of then chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy in September and made vice-chairman and managing director of the state-owned road transport corporation, is the latest to cross swords with his masters by deciding to hike bus fares without sanction of the government.        
	On Wednesday, Yadav announced an almost 21 per cent increase in fares effective from the midnight of January 6 without giving the government any whiff of the proposed hike during the day.         
	Yadavs boss, transport minister Shatrucherla Vijayaramaraju, said he was shocked. Yadav did not consult either me or the chief minister, not even the transport secretary, before announcing the hike, Vijayaramaraju said.        
	The minister said he was stunned by the steep hike slapped on the common man. Such an act by a bureaucrat is unheard of, he said.        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah, who has been riding a storm ever since YSRs death, and Vijayaramaraju have gone into an overdrive on how to cushion the blow. We may announce a slash in the hike to ease the blow on the common man, the minister said.         
	Yadav defended his decision, saying it was necessary to tide over the losses incurred because of the Telangana strife. The (corporation) board is competent to take a decision. We need not ask the government. We felt the need for more revenues after the recent losses suffered as a result of the bandhs, he said.         
	The board was informed that the corporation has suffered losses worth of Rs 240 crore owing to the bandhs and attacks on buses during the statehood movement.        
	Sources in the state secretariat said Yadav had sent the proposal to the chief ministers office on Wednesday evening after getting the approval from the corporation board. Since Rosaiah was away in Rajahmundry, the matter was kept pending. Sources said no one anticipated the IPS officer to jump the gun and implement the decision without the governments nod.        
	Rosaiah could not be reached for comment, but his aides said the chief minister was miffed.        
	How can he (Yadav) damage the governments image like this? It was YSRs decision not to raise bus fares and he kept it pending for over six years, an aide of Rosaiah quoted the chief minister as saying.         
	Yadav has had a controversial stint. He was replaced as DGP in the run-up to the polls last year by the Election Commission, but YSR reinstated the officer within hours of returning to power.         
	Yadav is not the only bureaucrat enjoying a free run. Several administrative heads of key departments such as power, municipal administration, revenue, water supply and education have taken decisions of their own and begun executing them even before getting cabinet approval.         
	For example, the power department has initiated the process of regulation of free electricity though the cabinet is yet to give its nod. Usually, the execution of work begins after a cabinet decision.        
	Similarly in the irrigation sector, the chief ministers office has been overlooked and contractors bills to the tune of Rs 1,640 crore has been released. This, despite Rosaiahs instructions that the payments be kept on hold.        
	The boldness of the bureaucrats has left the ministers fuming. What if now every head of department takes decisions on their own? What are we here for? sources quoted an enraged minister as asking Rosaiah.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP submits to the supreme court of Hindus
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP submits to the supreme court of Hindus
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                          Minister Sartaj Singh with Shankaracharya Swaroopananda Picture by Saeed Faruqui    
	Bhopal, May 5: When the supreme court of Hindus demands, the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh cannot refuse.        
	The state government has succumbed to pressure from Swami Swaroopananda Saraswati to lease forest land to a trust run by the Dwarka-Shardapeeth shankaracharya, the go-ahead coming after the Narsingpur district conservator of forests had demolished part of a wall around a cave.        
	Under the law of the land, no permanent structure can be built in a reserved forest area.        
	The nod came days after the 84-year-old seer, an influential figure whose support base cuts across party lines, had clashed with forest minister Sartaj Singh over permission for building a gate and the wall around Sankal Ghat cave.        
	According to Swaroopananda, who describes himself as the supreme court of Hindus, the cave is sacred because Adi Guru Shankaracharya is said to have lived and meditated there.        
	In the last week of April, however, forest officials filed a case against an Australia-based NRI, Manjula Rao, one of those responsible for building the wall.         
	District conservator of forests Mohanlal Meena later demolished a part of the wall on the ground that it had been built in a reserved forest area.        
	Swaroopananda claimed his disciples had built the wall to save the ancient cave from rain. From when has preserving a sacred and ancient place of worship become a crime? the seer had asked.        
	Sartaj, a BJP veteran, at first showed scant regard for Swaroopananda and kept insisting that the area around the cave was a reserved area and he couldnt lease the land to the trust.         
	Swaroopananda then camped in Bhopal for a week and accused the Shivraj Singh Chauhan regime of being anti-Hindu.        
	He also claimed that under BJP rule, cows were being illegally slaughtered and buffalo meat from the state was being exported in large quantities.        
	Many of Sartajs colleagues, who turned out to be devotees of the seer, also mounted pressure on the minister to soften his stand.        
	Sartaj finally went to see Swaroopananda and expressed his departments inability to grant forestland in view of stringent Supreme Court guidelines.        
	Reportedly incensed at the reference to the apex court, Swaroopananda then asked Sartaj if he had any regard for the institution of the shankaracharya, the supreme court of Hindus.        
	Sartaj said he had the highest regard for religious leaders and promised to do the needful.         
	The minister is also said to have assured the seer that in case central agencies or the apex court objected, his department would defend the grant of lease to Swaroopanandas trust.        
	In Madhya Pradesh, Swaroopananda is known as Congress swami, though his support base cuts across party lines. He is said to be the patron of leaders like Digvijay Singh, Suresh Pachauri and former BJP chief minister Babulal Gaur.         
	When he arrived in Bhopal a week ago, the first caller was governor Rameshwar Thakur, a former Union minister. Thakur was photographed prostrating before the seer. Next in the queue was Gaur.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Unpopular? Not our MLAs, says CPM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Unpopular? Not our MLAs, says CPM
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, June 3: The CPM has come up with an innovative logic to justify clinging to power in Bengal till the Assemblys term ends next year: defeat of MPs and councillors doesnt mean Left MLAs have become unpopular.        
	The editorial in the latest edition of CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy rejects the argument that the Left Front has lost the mandate. The editorial seeks refuge behind the politically conscious electorate in Bengal without mentioning that the same electorate has been rejecting the Left in one election after another since 2008.        
	The politically conscious electorate in Bengal is discerning in the sense that it treats every election on the basis of its objective. The Lok Sabha elections were to determine the government at the Centre. The elections to the state Assembly are to determine the government in the state. Likewise, the municipal and panchayat elections have their own objectives. Each election is, therefore, a different ballgame, the editorial says.         
	The write-up, On West Bengal Municipal Elections, pats the partys own back saying the CPM-led Left Front had kept to the finest traditions of democratic practice and accepted the peoples verdict. But the party preferred not to read the import of the verdict. The Left Front shall make a proper assessment and review these results to draw correct lessons for the future, the editorial says.        
	The politburo, the partys highest decision-making body that otherwise reacts to almost every issue, has so far not issued a statement on the civic poll outcome. Sources said even the editorial in Peoples Democracy, a weekly, was incorporated at the last moment after initial disinterest from the top leadership.        
	The write-up slams the Trinamul Congress for mounting a shrill campaign for early elections and demanding the dismissal of the duly elected state government.         
	This is not only patently undemocratic but completely irrational, the editorial says. It repeats the claim, used as a cover for the Lefts debacle, made by some CPM leaders yesterday that only 16-17 per cent of the electorate had participated in the May 30 polls.        
	In another attempt to paper over the decline of its support base, the party pinned hopes on the 29 hung municipalities. In whose favour these would be resolved will only be known in the future, the editorial says.        
	Only at the end of the editorial does the party briefly admit that the defeat was a serious matter and that it cannot be wished away by the leadership. This is a serious matter that needs to be properly reviewed in order to draw the correct lessons and apply the needed correctives. The CPI (M) and the Left Front are committed to undertake this task in right earnest, the last two sentences of the write-up say.

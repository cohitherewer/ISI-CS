          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: The state has urged the Centre to accord it special category status or provide a special package of assistance.        
	The demand was put forth by finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei at a meeting convened by Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi for pre-budget discussions.        
	The government has demanded special category state status in view of the poverty and under-development. Orissa has the highest percentage of population living below the poverty line and lags behind other states in terms of other socio-economic indicators, said the memorandum submitted by the state government.        
	Stating that the its economy has been affected by the global slowdown and the state exchequer has borne extra burden on salary and pension revision on basis of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, the memorandum sought a special package of central assistance.        
	The government has also demanded loan waiver benefit for the current year taking its consistent fiscal performance into account.         
	The state has been receiving the benefit of loan waiver at the rate of Rs 381.90 crore since 2005-06 for restricting the fiscal deficit within 3 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product.        
	Ghadei has also laid stress on announcement of new criteria for fixation of poverty line and modification of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.        
	The Centre has also been urged to effect immediate revision of royalty for major minerals on ad valorem basis and pay compensation for the delay in royalty revision.         
	The state government has also demanded allotment of more Indira Awas houses for Orissa as it has the highest percentage of BPL population and revise the cost of each dwelling unit from Rs 35,000 to Rs 60,000.        
	Other demands included release of funds for widening of highways, reduction of interest rate on crop loan from 7 per cent to 5 per cent.

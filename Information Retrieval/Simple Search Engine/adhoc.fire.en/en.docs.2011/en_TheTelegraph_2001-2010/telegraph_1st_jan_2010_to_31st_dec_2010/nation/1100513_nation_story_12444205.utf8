The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan to speed up terror trials
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plan to speed up terror trials
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                        Ajmal Kasab    
	New Delhi, May 12: The government plans to fast-track terror trials even in the high courts and the Supreme Court, which sometimes take a decade to decide on appeals in such cases, official sources said today.        
	The sources cited Ajmal Kasabs 18-month trial for the Mumbai attack, the fastest in a terrorism offence in India, and said even his case would get priority hearing under the plan, if he appeals to the higher courts.        
	Under the current system, fast-track courts exist only at the lowest rung of the judiciary. Subsequent appeals often get held up in the high courts and the Supreme Court, which are groaning under the weight of pending cases.        
	The government plans to address this anomaly to dispose of cases spawned by new-age terrorism, the sources said.        
	Several other terror appeals, such as the Mumbai serial train blasts case and the American Center attack in Calcutta, are pending in different courts, some of them in the higher courts. An accused gets at least two appeals to the superior courts as a matter of right. These take between three and 10 years to be decided. But even if the government speeds up the hearing of such appeals, it would take at least two to three years.        
	Honour killings        
	The law ministry plans to try those involved in honour killings under murder charges to check the rising number of such cases. In the existing scheme of things, there is no special law dealing with such crimes, the sources said.        
	The definition of murder will be widened to include honour killings, the move prompted by the growing public anger against such violence, the sources said. Changes will be made in the definition of culpable homicide or murder in Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to include honour killings, the sources said. A new clause will be introduced into the existing Section 300 to treat and punish such crimes like murder.        
	The proposed clause says that culpable homicide will be murder if it is done by any person or persons acting in concert with/or at the behest of a member of the family or a member of a body or group/caste/clan or community or caste panchayat in the belief that such action has brought dishonour or perceived to have brought dishonour upon the family/caste/clan/community or caste panchayat.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	Indore, Feb. 18: Nitin Gadkari would never admit it, but Rahul Gandhi has got under his skin. And the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs prying eyes are refusing to leave him.        
	The BJPs new chief today emphasised the contrast between him and the young Gandhi in words that could become his partys tag line even as he tried to steer the political course to suit the RSSs ammended outlook  moderation with the ideological underpinnings intact.        
	As he addressed some 5,000 delegates at the BJP national council here after being ratified as party president, he stressed on his organisations status as a non-dynastic outfit  one of only six among thousands in the country.        
	Then he launched into Rahul.        
	I was born to a farmer. My father was not a Prime Minister, my great grandfather was not one, nor was my grandmother. I am an ordinary party worker. But the BJP is a party with a difference precisely because an ordinary worker can rise up the ladder to head the party, Gadkari said to thundering applause.        
	To emphasise the extraordinariness of being ordinary, the Nagpur-based businessman said that for years, the only job he did as a BJP party worker was paint walls and stick posters. My handwriting was so bad that I would only paint the walls in white and leave it to the others to write the slogans, he said.        
	A political aide to Gadkari said the dynasty-versus-democratic route to leadership was being emphasised to recapture sections of the upper and middle classes. Rahul might appeal to them as a youth icon but youths are perceptive enough to realise that the Congress has a place for only those with family connections and not the commonplace worker. See all the baba logs surrounding Rahul. Each of them is someones son.         
	Gadkari said the BJP was a party of karyakartas (workers). A Prime Minister can be an ex-PM. A chief minister can be an ex-CM, an MP can be an ex-MP. But a worker can never become an ex-worker.        
	Gadkari indicated he was more than willing to nuance the hard-line on Hindutva issues if it suited him electorally, a line prompted by the Sanghs eagle eye. However, he neither mentioned Article 370 while speaking on Kashmir, nor a common civil code.         
	On a Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said while the BJP was committed to building one, he would rather have Muslims on board before doing it. Today, I appeal to the Muslim community to be generous towards the sentiments and feelings of Hindus and facilitate the construction of a grand Ram temple. This would herald a new amity and reinforce the bond for a resurgent India, Gadkari said.        
	A BJP functionary explained that the idea was to neutralise Muslim anger. We want to leave the Varun Gandhi chapter behind. We dont wish to say and do anything that will polarise Muslims behind the Congress, the functionary said.        
	Gadkari also spoke out against faith-based reservations  an issue the BJP thinks has the potential to divide Hindus.

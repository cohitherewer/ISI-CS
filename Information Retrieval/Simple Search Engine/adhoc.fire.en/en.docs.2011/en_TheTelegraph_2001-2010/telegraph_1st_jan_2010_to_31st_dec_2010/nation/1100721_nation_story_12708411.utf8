The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fatal mix: beaten tracks, new trains

	New Delhi, July 20: One reason behind the railways failure to reduce accidents could be their tardiness in replacing old tracks while increasing the pressure on them by introducing one new train after another, veteran officials said.        
	Repeated use of tracks results in wear and tear, increasing the chances of accidents. Many of the bridges and signalling systems on our network too are old and need to be constantly attended, an official said.        
	About 30 per cent of the tracks have been in use beyond their stipulated life span of 20 years, railway board officials said. But they admitted that the railways were often 5-8 years late in replacing old tracks.        
	A high load of passenger and goods traffic passing over a given stretch may shorten the iron tracks life span even below 20 years, said S.B. Ghosh Dastidar, former railway board member (traffic).        
	He and other officials, however, added that its the increased freight traffic, and not the populist measure of introducing scores of new passenger trains, that cause the most damage. Tracks take more pressure from goods trains, Ghosh Dastidar said.        
	Freight is the railways bread and butter, and Lalu Prasads famous turnaround strategy had focused on increasing freight traffic by running more goods trains and getting each to carry at least a 20 per cent higher load. The railways daily freight traffic is about 2 million tonnes now, up from a little more than 1 million tonnes a decade ago.        
	Most of the tracks in the golden quadrilateral of Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai are saturated and are taking the full load of passenger and goods traffic. Additional passenger traffic should not be brought in unless you reduce freight traffic, Ghosh Dastidar said.        
	But successive railway budgets have shown where the ministers priorities lie. Mamata Banerjee has in her two budgets proposed some 111 new passenger trains, adding to the 191 that her predecessor had introduced between 2006 and 2009. In these five years, the railways have barely added 1,100km of tracks.        
	Till 2006, the railways had about 110,000km of tracks and ran about 11,000 passenger and goods trains.        
	The new trains are not a huge addition to these numbers but they are an added burden on a tracks system that has been ageing and has not been replaced in the last two to three decades, a railway board official said.        
	Ghosh Dastidar said: Normally, 50 to 60 trains can run on a double-track system. However, this could increase with automatic signalling and other measures.        
	The railways now run fewer than this on any given track length. Usually, it is about 35-50, an official said. But these ideal numbers make no sense when you take into account the ageing tracks and increasing freight pressure.

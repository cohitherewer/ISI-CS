The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | AC kiosks for Madurai cops
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AC kiosks for Madurai cops
  - Temple town force gets gift from NGO; capital counterparts lose firearm to thief          G.C. SHEKHAR                                                  
	Chennai, March 19: Madurais traffic constables will soon be the envy of many of their hapless counterparts sweating it out under the sun.         
	An NGO, which prefers to remain anonymous, has designed air-conditioned kiosks for the temple citys traffic guardians, probably a first in the country.        
	Ten such traffic units on wheels  to ensure the booths can be moved around  are being supplied to Madurai police by the NGO, which is footing the bill along with a few local textile traders.         
	The NGO is even making arrangements for the power supply from corporation-approved outputs and will pay for the power bills and also the maintenance of the ACs, said J. Rajendran, Madurai citys deputy commissioner, traffic.         
	The constable will be able to control the traffic lights from the kiosk using a remote, seated on a swivel chair that will allow him a 360 degree view through the glass windows shaped like miniature temple chariots.         
	His higher officers can issue instructions from their cell phones, which will be patched on to the public address system in the booth.        
	Traffic constables have one of the most trying jobs. They stand for hours exposed to the heat, noise and pollution, which cause respiratory diseases and other ailments. Many ask for transfers to less taxing postings. So this new facility should give them a healthier working environment, said Madurai police commissioner M. Balasubramaniam.         
	Police bosses acknowledged they should not rely on NGOs to provide such amenities to their personnel but said they were tied up by budgetary restrictions. Such facilities are not provided for in the police budget  which is meant for other necessities like vehicles, communication equipment, computers, etc.        
	The police normally get business houses or NGOs to sponsor such facilities. The corporate houses also get visibility and publicity when their names are displayed on traffic umbrellas, barricades and signage.        
	For constables in Madurai, where the summer temperatures can touch 42 degrees Celsius, the gift has come as a huge relief. This really is a boon as traffic duty during summer is hellish. We hope that more such booths are provided all over Tamil Nadu, so other traffic constables can also benefit, said constable M. Sivakumar.        
	Calcuttas traffic constables, who face conditions similar to that endured by their Madurai counterparts, said they could do with such cool kiosks.         
	Our job involves standing for a long duration. The kiosk becomes stuffy in the scorching heat and it becomes unbearable inside. Several colleagues of mine fall ill and suffer from dehydration during summer every year, said a constable posted at the headquarters traffic guard in Calcutta.        
	Each traffic kiosk in Madurai will cost around Rs 70,000 and will be equipped with a 0.75-tonne AC unit, lights, public address system and a swivel chair. Since the unit can be wheeled around, the police can move the booth depending on the traffic congestion.         
	For example, during the Chittirai festival at Madurai in April, most of the units will be positioned around the Meenakshi temple because of the heavy rush expected at that time.        
	The real challenge will be to maintain these facilities and also protect them from vandalism, though the police plan to park them at the nearest police station at night.         
	A few traffic umbrellas in Chennai were equipped with solar-powered fans and tube lights but cannot be found any longer after the fans were stolen. Another exercise that went into limbo was storing first aid kits at major intersections in special boxes attached to traffic signals. The company supposed to replenish the supplies stopped doing its job. The empty boxes also vanished in due course.        
	The Chennai traffic police said that though there was no immediate plan for AC booths here, they would not mind if anyone came forward to sponsor them. Ultimately, anything that makes life comfortable for our men on the road is welcome, said M. Ravi, additional commissioner (traffic).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Admission test cry
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Admission test cry
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Navodaya schools, which aim to provide quality education to talented children, have asked the government for permission to continue holding entrance tests even though the Right to Education Act bans any screening of students for admission.        
	The Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, the body managing the specialised residential schools, has written to the HRD ministry highlighting the crucial role played by the schools in identifying talent from rural and backward areas through the admission tests.        
	The tests cannot be done away with, it has said in the letter, HRD ministry sources revealed. Without them, it would be difficult to identify talent and the purpose of the Navodaya schools would be defeated, the samiti has said. The Right to Education Act says no school will hold tests to screen children or parents for admission.        
	But the Navodaya schools have said their test is more a talent search than a screening. It is inclusive and not discriminatory, they hold. Talent cannot be identified through lottery, they have argued.        
	The 594 Navodaya schools, which mainly target the rural poor, are regarded as islands of excellence. About 97 per cent students of these schools pass the board exam every year. About 74 per cent students are from families with an annual income less than Rs 48,000. Nearly 11 per cent students in these schools are first generation learners.        
	The Navodaya samiti has argued that about four to five per cent children in every community are gifted students who need to be identified and provided with quality education. The United States has enacted the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act to protect the rights of gifted and talented students. The Right to Education Act, on the contrary, seeks to homogenise education, it said.        
	The government should issue a clarification under Section 35 of the law to allow the Navodaya schools to continue with the admission tests, the samiti has said.        
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal held a meeting last Saturday to discuss the challenges in the implementation of the Right to Education Act. But no decision could be taken whether residential schools such as the Navodaya Vidyalayas should be allowed to continue holding admission tests. A separate meeting will be held for the purpose.

	Bhubaneswar, May 16: Maoists today gunned down a police constable while he was patrolling at a haat at Padia under the Kalimela police station area in Malkangiri district this afternoon.        
	According to sources, Ramachandra Rao, posted at the Padia police outpost, was killed by three rebels in plainclothes on the spot. Local villagers, present at the haat, ran helter-skelter at the sound of gunfire.         
	Malkangiri superintendent of police Anirudh Singh said security persons had left for the spot. They are on their way on foot to avoid any landmine or ambush, he said.         
	On Thursday, the Malkangiri police arrested an ultra during an anti-Naxalite operation in the district. The Maoist, Adma Madkam, was arrested during a joint combing operation by BSF, CRPF and the Special Operations Group at Teakguda forest in Kalimela area of Malkangiri.                     
	He was allegedly involved in a major attack on a police team in 2003 besides incidents of booth capturing and violence during the last general elections in the state.

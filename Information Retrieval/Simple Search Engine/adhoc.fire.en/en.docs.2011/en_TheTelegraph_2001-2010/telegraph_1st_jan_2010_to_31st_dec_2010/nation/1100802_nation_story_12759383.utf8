          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 1: The Hurriyat moderates are finding themselves marginalised as never before, with the hardliners ruling the streets in Kashmir.        
	The protests raging for seven weeks now has been almost entirely run by hardliners. They have turned moderate stalwarts such as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik into spectators, unlike the 2008 Amarnath land row when both moderates and hardliners had called the shots.        
	We have decided to start from where they (the hardliners) stop, said a senior leader of Maliks Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), appearing reconciled to the fact that they have no role in the present agitation.         
	Days before the current protests began, the JKLF had started a jail bharo campaign to protest rights violations, but the programme was called off after the present unrest showed no signs of abating.        
	At the beginning of the agitation, which began on June 11, the Omar Abdullah government had sensed the trouble the hardliners could pose. It arrested the top leaders, including hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani and his confidant Ashraf Sahrai.        
	Even the high court bar association chief Mian Abdul Qayoom, considered close to Geelani, was arrested. All of them were booked under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA), which allows detention without trial for up to two years.        
	Unlike the hardliners who were put in jail, the government preferred to keep the moderates such as the Mirwaiz, Bilal Lone and Agha Syed Hassan under house arrest. The JKLFs Malik was arrested but spared the PSA rod.         
	In absence of leaders such as Geelani, the second-rung leadership of hardliners, including Masarat Alam and Asiya Andrabi, have taken charge. It is they who issue the weekly protest schedules of non-stop shutdowns and marches.        
	But a moderate leader blamed the Centre for their irrelevance. We hold Delhi responsible. They invited us for talks which were never meaningful. They were mere photo opportunities, a leader of the moderate faction said, referring to three rounds of talks between the Hurriyat and the NDA and UPA governments.        
	The talks were stopped in 2005 and when the Centre revived a quiet dialogue last year, the militants nearly killed moderate leader Fazal Haq Qureshi, giving a quiet burial to the process.        
	Unlike hardliners who want Delhi to accept Kashmir as a disputed territory and offer major concessions before they join the talks, the moderates have been receptive to the idea of negotiations without conditions. But of late, they too have hardened their stance.         
	Sources in the moderate camp now appear to be banking on the failings of the hardliners protest to bounce back into the spotlight. Daily shutdowns have caused immense hardship to people and there is lot of resentment. But the people are not coming forward to say so. But how long will this continue. There will be a space for us again, a moderate Hurriyat leader said.

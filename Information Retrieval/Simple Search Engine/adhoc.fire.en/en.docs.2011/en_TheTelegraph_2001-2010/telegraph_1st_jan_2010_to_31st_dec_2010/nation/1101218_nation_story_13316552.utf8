                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AMU council meet stalled
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Centre today stalled a controversial move by Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis to hold a meeting of the supreme governing body on Sunday to elect its chancellor, pro-chancellor and executive council members.        
	On directions from President Pratibha Patil, the Visitor of the university, the HRD ministry asked AMU to put the meeting on hold as it had been scheduled without giving members the required 35-day notice and asked it to reply within 15 days why the notice had not been given. The Visitor has directed that until the universitys reply to the showcause notice is received and the decision of the Visitor in this regard is communicated, the university shall keep the decision to hold the meeting of the (AMU) court in abeyance, the order said.        
	Some MPs and members of the AMU court, the governing body, met Patil last Sunday and demanded postponement of the meeting as the 35-day notice had not been given. The delegation alleged Azis was in a hurry to hold the meeting as he wanted people of his choice elected to the executive council. The AMU Teachers Association president, Mukhtar Ahmad, echoed the claim.        
	The delegation also submitted a memorandum saying many AMU court members would not be able to attend the meeting as they would be at the Congress plenary from December 18-20.         
	A two-judge panel will probe the allegations against Azis.        
	We have communicated the direction of the government (to AMU court members) that the holding of meeting has been kept in abeyance. I do not know whether the requisite 35-day notice period was fulfilled, Azis said.

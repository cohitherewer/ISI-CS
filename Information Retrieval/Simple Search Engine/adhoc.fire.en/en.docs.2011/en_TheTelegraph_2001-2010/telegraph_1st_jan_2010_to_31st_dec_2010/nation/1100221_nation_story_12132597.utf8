The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Osmania student sets himself on fire
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Osmania student sets himself on fire
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                            
	Hyderabad, Feb. 20: An Osmania University student today doused himself in kerosene, set himself on fire and ran around the campus to galvanise his colleagues before being admitted to hospital, his desperate attempt igniting the movement which, according to the 19-year-old, is increasingly getting trapped in political shenanigans.         
	Siripuram Yadagiri, who police said was a Plus-Two student at a city college, had come to the Osmania campus to show solidarity with the students, whose attempts to take out a rally to the Assembly earlier in the day had been foiled by police.         
	Around 3pm, just after chief minister K. Rosaiah had presented the state budget, Yadagiri set himself ablaze close to a Caf Coffee Day outlet near the NCC gate on the western side of the university in the heart of Hyderabad.         
	Yadagiri, the flames licking his body, then started running around the campus, the sight resembling a moving human ball of fire. The policemen present caught hold of him and sent him to a nearby hospital where he is admitted with around 80 per cent burns. His face, however, remains unscathed.        
	Yadagiri, also known as Yadaiah, was carrying a bag in which the police found his certificates, photographs with several politicians and a suicide note purportedly written by him. In the handwritten note, Yadagiri says he was an orphan and had resided at Victoria Memorial Home in Saroornagar till Class X.         
	The note says the government was unresponsive to the aspirations of the people and that a separate state of Telangana should be formed immediately.         
	In his note, Yadagiri has also blamed the political parties, primarily the Congress and the Telugu Desam, for their opportunism at the cost of livelihood of thousands of Telangana workers and the future of lakhs of students of the region.         
	Yadagiri said since he had no possibility of getting a job, he was doing his bit for the cause of a separate Telangana by sacrificing himself.        
	The students, increasingly despondent by the political divide over the issue of statehood and hampered by the fortress-like security, were galvanised by the immolation attempt.         
	Over 2,000 students tried to rush out of the university but were stalled by the police who had thrown a heavy security cordon around the campus. Stone throwing between students and the police continued for an hour.        
	The protest spilled over to some colonies adjacent to the university  Jamia Nizamia, Habsiguda and Tarnaka  where residents torched three government buses, attacked some shops and also clashed with the police.         
	At Kakatiya University in Warangal, students took out a rally and attacked the district Congress office.         
	Police said Yadagiri, an undergraduate student at Noble Junior College in Hyderabad, had suffered 80 per cent burns. He is responding to treatment but is very critical, said PSR Anjaneyulu, joint commissioner of police.        
	Yadagiri also worked as a cashier in a bar-cum-restaurant on the citys outskirts.

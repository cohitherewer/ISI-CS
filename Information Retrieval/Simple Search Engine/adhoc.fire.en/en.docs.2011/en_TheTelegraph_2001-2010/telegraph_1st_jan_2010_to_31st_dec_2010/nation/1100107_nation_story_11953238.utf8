          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Supreme Court has proposed a cess on petrol and diesel to fund a road accident corpus as part of a slew of steps to help victims in a country where compensation often comes after a congested trial.        
	It also asked states and the Centre to consider whether a lifetime insurance premium could be collected on every vehicle sold.        
	Although this could effectively hike the price of all vehicles, the court said it would take care of a major grievance of insurance firms.        
	This will address a major grievance of insurance companies that their outgoings by way of compensation in motor accident claims is four times the amount received as motor insurance premia, a three-judge bench said.        
	The court also suggested insurance companies pay up voluntarily after making their own inquiries. There is no reason why insurance companies in India shouldnt adopt such a procedure, the bench said.        
	The suggestions are part of a draft proposal circulated last month and a formal directive could be in place as early as tomorrow when an insurance claim comes up for hearing.        
	The court said there were several problems in addressing claims under the outdated Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and outlined possible remedies.        
	It suggested police forward accident information reports to the claims tribunal within 30 days of an accident FIR and the tribunals should register the reports as claims for compensation.        
	Owners and drivers of uninsured vehicles should be prosecuted, and the owners made to pay for releasing their vehicles after every accident. If the owners dont pay up within three months, their vehicles should be sold off and the proceeds held in deposit until the claim case is disposed of.         
	It also asked the executive and the legislature to rationalise the compensation amount, fixed way back in 1988.

	Washington, Jan. 6 (PTI): Dawood Ibrahims D-company, a criminal syndicate that has 5,000 members and a strategic alliance with the ISI, Lashkar-e-Toiba and al Qaida, is an example of a criminal-terrorism fusion model and poses a threat to US security interests in South Asia, a Congressional report has said.        
	Dawood Ibrahims D-Company, a 5,000-member criminal syndicate operating mostly in Pakistan, India and the United Arab Emirates, provides an example of the criminal-terrorism fusion model, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has said in its latest report.        
	A research wing of the US Congress, the CRS prepares reports on various issues for American lawmakers.        
	The report, International Terrorism and Transnational Crime: Security Threats, US Policy, and Considerations for Congress, was released by the CRS yesterday.        
	The US treasury department had said in October 2003 that Dawood was a specially designated global terrorist.        
	In June 2006, then US President George W. Bush had designated Dawood, as well as his Karachi-headquartered D-Company, as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.        
	Noting that the D-Company was reportedly involved in several criminal activities, including extortion, smuggling, narcotics trafficking and contract killing, the CRS said it had also infiltrated the Indian filmmaking industry, extorting producers, assassinating directors and pirating films.        
	The CRS said D-Companys evolution into a criminal-terrorist group began in response to the destruction of the Babri mosque in December 1992 and the subsequent riots. Following the attacks, Dawood moved his networks headquarters to Karachi.

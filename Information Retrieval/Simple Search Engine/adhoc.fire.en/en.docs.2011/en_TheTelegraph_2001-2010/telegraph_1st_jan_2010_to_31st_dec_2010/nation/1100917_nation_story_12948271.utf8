The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish warns ally on Ayodhya
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish warns ally on Ayodhya
          J.P. YADAV                                              Nitish Kumar       
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Nitish Kumar has warned ally BJP against whipping up communal passions over next weeks Ayodhya judgment, fearing any such trouble could hurt his prospects in the Bihar polls from October 20.        
	The chief minister also made it clear, like he has done in the past, that his Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi shouldnt campaign in the state and urged the BJP to restrain its leaders from re-igniting the settled issue.         
	BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had recently declared that Modi would address rallies in Bihar.        
	Nitish said his party, the Janata Dal (United), had always been in favour of settling the Ayodhya issue through talks or court. Our stand is clear. We have communicated our stand, he told reporters today in Delhi, where he had come for talks with BJP leaders ahead of Allahabad High Courts September 24 verdict.        
	Behind Nitishs warning are fears that the Sangh parivar might foment trouble, which could shift the focus away from development, his main poll plank, to emotive issues. The other fear is that rivals Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan might reap political mileage out of the verdict.        
	Nitish fears the verdict could affect Muslim votes, crucial to his poll calculations.

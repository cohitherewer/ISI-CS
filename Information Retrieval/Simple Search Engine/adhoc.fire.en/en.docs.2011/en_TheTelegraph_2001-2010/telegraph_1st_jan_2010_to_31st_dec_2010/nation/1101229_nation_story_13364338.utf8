          SUMIR KARMAKAR                              
	Guwahati, Dec. 28: The four-year-old HIV-positive girl who was abandoned by her family after her parents died will be shifted to Snehneer, a care home for HIV-positive children in Calcutta, next month.         
	The NGO Bhoruka Public Welfare Trust that runs Snehneer is now taking care of the girl at its community centre at Beharbari here.         
	The Assam State AIDS Control Society had agreed to send the girl to the care centre so that she could receive proper care and treatment according to the guidelines of the National AIDS Control Organisation.        
	The girls health has improved a lot and she will be shifted to our 25-bed home in Calcutta by the end of January, as we do not have space there at present. We had sought permission from the Assam State AIDS Control Society and they have agreed, said Ratul Kalita, the project co-ordinator of the NGO here.        
	The girl was brought to the centre on December 11 by a local NGO, which had found her in Nalbari.

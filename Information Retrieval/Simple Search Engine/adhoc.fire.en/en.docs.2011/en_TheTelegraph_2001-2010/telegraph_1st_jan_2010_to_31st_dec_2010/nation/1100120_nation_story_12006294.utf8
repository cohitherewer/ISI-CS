   You mean its over?
          KINSUK BASU                          The Last Post being played. (Pabitra Das)                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: As Left Front chairman Biman Bose got up from his seat at Citizens Park to hand over a laminated certificate of consent signed by Jyoti Basu and sealed with son Chandans signature to SSKM officials, a visitor asked: You mean its over?        
	Till the sonorous strains of The Last Post being played by the army band began wafting in the winter air, there had been nothing to suggest that this wasnt a conventional state funeral.         
	The gun carriage bearing Basus body stood in the middle with four pall-bearers. Basus family sat under a shamiana with top CPM leaders.        
	Hundreds stood all around the park, many with tears in their eyes. A red hoarding bearing a picture of a smiling Basu and Rabindranath Tagores words  Mor naam ei boley khyato hok/Aami tomader-i lok (Let me be remembered/As one of you)  towered above everyone.        
	Fire, shouted subedar Williams of Calcutta armed police and three cracks each from a dozen raised rifles rent the air.        
	A senior officer explained that it was a three-volley rifle salute rather than a 21-gun one because a cannon wasnt available. A 21-gun salute, in which a cannon fires the shots, is the highest honour at a military funeral and is also given to a head of state.         
	Salute over, subedar Williams marched a few steps towards Ranjit Panchnanda, the special additional commissioner overseeing the police ceremony at Basus last stopover before the journey to SSKM.         
	Baye mur (turn left), Williams ordered seconds later, prompting the 12 riflemen to march out in a single file. The clock showed 4.35pm.         
	Bose was the first to stand up. He made his way through the throng of VIPs, carrying the document Basu had signed pledging his body to the cause of medical science. Son Chandan had handed the certificate to the front chairman moments earlier, so that Basus last rites could be completed in the manner he had wished.         
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and former MP Mohammad Salim joined Bose as a team of doctors from SSKM received the document.        
	The front chief then took the microphone. In keeping with Jyotibabus last wish, the body is being handed over to the IPGMER (Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research). They have received it and have given us a receipt in exchange. We are thankful for the tremendous love that you have showered on Jyoti Basu. We apologise to those who couldnt pay homage to him. The salute cant take place after sunset; so we had to time it this way.        
	As the party anthem played and clenched fists were raised in salute, the gun carriage trundled ahead, a green army truck leading the way.

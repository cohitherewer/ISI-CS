                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Child shot at in sibling play
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, June 28: A six-year-old girl was critically injured when her brother shot her at point-blank range while playing with their fathers licensed pistol at their home in Guwahati yesterday morning.        
	Ananya Malla Baruah was hit in the head by the bullet. She was rushed to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital by her panic-stricken parents and is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit, a close relative, Jayanta Malla Baruah, said.        
	He said the girls father, Sudhir Malla Baruah, a contractor, had kept his .32 bore pistol in a cupboard at their home in the citys Birkuchi locality.        
	They (the brother and sister) somehow managed to get their hands on it unnoticed by anybody, probably out of curiosity. They were playing with it when Ananyas 11-year-old brother, Ankit, accidentally pulled the trigger, Jayanta said.        
	Father Sudhir and Ankit were too shocked to speak to the media.        
	Hospital superintendent Ramen Talukdar said Ananya had undergone surgery but remained critical and was under observation.        
	Sangeeta Dutta, a Guwahati-based psychiatrist, said glamorisation of firearms, particularly in films, was responsible for children and adolescents being attracted to weapons.        
	Curiosity about the unknown is innate among children. When they see their favourite film stars using firearms, they too get attracted to such weapons. After all, films are a powerful medium for influencing young minds, she said.        
	Dutta said violent and aggressive video games were equally responsible for the trend.        
	The real danger is that children cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality, she said.        
	Nowadays, children are exposed to weapons all the time. In movies, as well as in real life, they see so many people using arms. So they tend to think that these (the weapons) are not a bad thing since so many people are using it.        
	Till late yesterday afternoon, police appeared unaware of the incident.        
	No such incident was reported to the police, an officer said at Noonmati police station.

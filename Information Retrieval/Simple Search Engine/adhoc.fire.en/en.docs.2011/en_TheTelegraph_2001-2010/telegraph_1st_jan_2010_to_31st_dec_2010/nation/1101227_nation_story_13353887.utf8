	Mumbai, Dec. 26: Bandra, queen of Mumbais suburbs and home to the Big 3 Bollywood Khans, has been a fortress since a day before Christmas, apparently because of intelligence that a daring terror strike may be attempted on a celebrity home or nightclub.        
	The siege by 5,000 police personnel will be on till the last merrymaker is out of the high-end nightclubs and resto-bars  the prime destination for Mumbais hip brigade till the New Year bash. At least officially, though many of the personnel seemed to have taken this Sunday off.        
	Acting on what joint commissioner (crime) Himangshu Roy called a specific intelligence input, the polices quick-response team did a flag march on Pali Hill on Friday  the first since the 1992-93 riots.        
	The 1km stretch of road across the top of the hill is home to several big guns of filmdom and state politics.        
	Apart from former chief ministers Sushil Kumar Shinde and Narayan Rane and Congress leader Priya Dutt, they include the Khans, Sanjay Dutt, Karan Johar, John Abraham, Rishi and Ranbir Kapoor, Urmila Matondkar, Deepika Padukone, Gulzar, Waheeda Rahman, Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu.        
	We are specially focusing on areas where David Headley carried out his reconnaissance trips in Bandra  and he lived on Pali Hill too, said a source in the polices anti-terrorism squad.        
	There is information about a church in central Mumbai and a hangout joint in the western suburbs. At this stage, we cannot be more specific than that, joint commissioner Roy said.        
	There is unprecedented police presence in Bandra because Christmas and New Year are celebrated by more people than any religious festival. Bandra, being a Catholic hub, is in focus.        
	Although the police presence was thinner today, residents groups seemed to be on heightened alertness.        
	The residents have come together in a big way and all local area management committees are working together to ensure security, said Anandini Thakoor, a local area committee chief from the suburb.        
	Unlike other years, when the whole of Bandra seems to be out partying on Christmas Day and after, the streets were nearly empty today.        
	Normally, Sundays are party time in Bandra and roads are chock-a-block with traffic and people. Today the place seems dead, especially given that it is a Sunday and the day after Christmas, said Allwyn Lobo, a resident.        
	Security was tight outside celeb homes on Pali Hill and elsewhere in the suburb. Police instructions to residents:        
	Repairs and construction to stop for the next six days        
	No auto-rickshaw or taxi to park in the lanes         
	Housing society gates to be locked 24x7, and to open only for residents and those with I-cards        
	Registration numbers of vehicles owned by residents and parked on the road are to be submitted to Khar police station every day for the next six days.        
	Landlords must re-check and ensure registration of their tenants with the local police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gorkha political talks debut this month
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gorkha political talks debut this month
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Ajay Maken                                  
	New Delhi, March 2: The first round of political talks with those seeking Gorkhaland will be held on March 18, Union home minister P. Chidambaram announced today.        
	The talks, the venue of which is yet to be decided, will be held between the Centre-constituted political committee and representatives of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the outfit spearheading the Gorkhaland movement in the Darjeeling hills.         
	Chidambaram did not elaborate on the names of the committee members. Sources at the home ministry, however, said minister of state for home affairs Ajay Maken would head the four-member political committee.        
	Other members of the panel include Trinamul Congress MP and minister of state for health Dinesh Trivedi and two ministers of the Bengal government. One of the Bengal ministers is Siliguri MLA Asok Bhattacharya of the CPM and another is from the RSP whose name has not been disclosed.         
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai will also attend the meeting. Names of Morcha representatives were not announced.        
	Four rounds of discussions have been held so far but the state as well Union governments were represented by bureaucrats. At the last round in Darjeeling in December, the Morcha had insisted on political talks. On February 22, the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) asked the Union home ministry to constitute the political committee to take forward the talks.        
	 A separate state of Gorkhaland is not an alternative that we are even looking at. All that can be conceded is more executive powers to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, or to a new body that replaces it, said a home ministry source.         
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri has welcomed the announcement of the next round of talks. The hill outfit had been demanding that the political-level talks be held at the highest level, suggesting that the Union home minister and the Bengal chief minister interact directly with them.         
	In Calcutta, Subesh Das, principal secretary to the chief minister, said: We will definitely take part in the tripartite talks. But since it will be at the political level, we are yet to decide who will lead it.        
	At the CCPA meeting, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had vehemently opposed a separate Gorkhaland state. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has also consistently expressed his views against a separate state.

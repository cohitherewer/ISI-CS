	Hyderabad, March 29: Clashes between two communities in the old city area of Hyderabad spiralled out of control today with incidents of stabbing claiming one life.        
	The clashes began on Saturday in the Musarambagh area of the old city over putting up religious flags.        
	The trouble  mostly incidents of stone-throwing  continued yesterday but intensified today, prompting the administration to clamp a curfew in all of the old city.        
	Police, who threw stun bombs, fired tear-gas shells and used their batons, were caught in a hide-and-seek situation as their attackers kept vanishing into the labyrinthine lanes after throwing stones. In Madina Square and Shansher Gunj, the police were also attacked with petrol bombs.         
	An alarmed state home minister, P. Sabitha Indra Reddy, toured the troubled area and assured the residents that peace would be restored.         
	Contingents of the CRPF and the Rapid Action Force have been deployed and 1,000 more paramilitary personnel are expected to arrive.        
	In the evening, there were reports of four incidents of stabbing. One man succumbed to injuries in hospital. The police said a pistol and some cash were found on him.         
	Over 70 people were injured in the clashes, several of them policemen.         
	Reddy said in the last two days 86 people had been arrested.

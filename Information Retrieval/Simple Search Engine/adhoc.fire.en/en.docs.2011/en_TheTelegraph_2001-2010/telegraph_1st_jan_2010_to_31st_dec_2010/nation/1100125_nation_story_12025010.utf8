  - Police put up criminal profiles on website, only 11 held          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Cuttack, Jan. 24: Eleven most wanted criminals of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar have been held since the police went online seeking public help to hunt them down a year ago. But at least 38 others are still to be tracked, making the plan not much of a success.        
	All of them  accused in more than 100 cases of murder, rape, robbery, dacoity and cheating  have eluded arrest and subsequent trial for more than six months, some of them since 1999.        
	A senior police officer said: The effort by way of putting the list on our website (www.bhubaneswarcuttackpolice.gov.in) for information about them has been as successful as people have allowed it to be. We need more citizens to help us put these criminals behind the bar.        
	Officers said they had left it to the public, hoping they can help us nab them.        
	But their efforts to arrest the criminals, who operate in areas under different police stations in Cuttack-Bhubaneswar urban districts, had achieved not much success because of what they believe was lack of information on their movement and hiding places.        
	Of the 11 tracked in 2009, five were in Cuttack and six in Bhubaneswar. The last one, Sushil Dhal Samant (36), was among the most wanted fugitives of Cuttack along with his brother Sushant Dhal Samant (39).        
	The duo  allegedly key accused in the Bidanasi murder case, which had created a sensation in October 2006  had continued to be elusive. Both had gained notoriety since 1993-94 and are accused in two other murder cases in Bidanasi and another in Lalbag and cases of attempt to murder, dacoity and robbery. Sushil was arrested at Bhubaneswar airfield area on December 31, 2009.        
	Meanwhile, Sushils father, Saroj, has sought judicial intervention for proper medical attention to the bullet injuries his son had sustained before his arrest. Acting on the petition, the high court has sought a report on condition of Sushil, currently lodged at a Bhubaneswar jail by January 22.        
	One of the men the police are still trying to locate is Biban Biswal, one of the three accused in the Anjana gang rape case, which had hogged the limelight in 1999. The police managed to arrest the two other accused  convicted and sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment in 2002  but have failed to trace Biban.

  - Posters lead to missing pug          G.C. SHEKHAR                           The poster of Spark on a wall in Chennai                                        
	Chennai, May 17: Residents of Mylapore in south Chennai were surprised on Saturday morning to be greeted by a cute pug staring back at them from several wall posters.        
	Under the dogs photo, bold letters proclaimed: Lost male dog, since May 9. For those giving information leading to its recovery, due reward would be given.        
	Soon enough, the two phone numbers printed in the posters were flooded with calls, one leading to the dogs recovery from a nearby slum.        
	Two-year-old Spark belongs to Tamil film comedian Chinni Jayanth, who decided to take the poster route after police complaints, phone calls to friends and relatives, and a weeks frantic search failed to yield results.         
	He got his driver Ashok to print 500 posters and had them pasted in and around Mylapore in the belief that only a local resident would have taken the dog. Jayanth hired professional poster boys with expertise in pasting posters of political parties, films and commercial houses to ensure they would not peel easily and that the geographical spread would be adequate.        
	No point pasting more than two posters in one street, observed Ashok, whose mobile number was printed on the poster along with that of Jayanths brother.        
	Dozens of calls arrived on Saturday morning. Since most pugs look alike, Ashok and his team ended up at the homes of several genuine pug owners. When we explained it was a case of mistaken identity, they didnt get angry, Ashok said.        
	The correct clue came from another dog lover who said he had spotted Spark near the Mylapore Kapali Temple. That led the search team to Lala Thottam, a slum near the temple, on Saturday evening. A woman there confirmed she had seen the dog with a boy.        
	Since Jayanth did not want any trouble, he directed his maid Radha to go to the area with a police team. When Spark was spotted in a house, it pounced on Radha with happy familiarity and was taken back home.        
	Police inquiries found that an 11-year-old slum boy had been sheltering it for five days after taking it from a friend living in a nearby slum. Although the police summoned the two boys for enquiries, Jayanth requested officers not to proceed against them.         
	Jayanth refused to reveal the reward he had paid, only saying: Spark is invaluable to me and my family.

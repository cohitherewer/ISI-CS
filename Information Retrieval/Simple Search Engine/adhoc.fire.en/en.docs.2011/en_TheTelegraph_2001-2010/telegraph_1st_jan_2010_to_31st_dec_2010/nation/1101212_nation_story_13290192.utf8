          OUR BUREAU                           Digvijay Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Congress leader Digvijay Singh has succeeded in diverting media attention from the 2G spectrum issue by raking up the forgotten controversy over Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad chief Hemant Karkares death.         
	In comments that almost went unnoticed, Digvijay said at a book release this week that he had spoken to Karkare hours before the terrorists struck on 26/11, and the IPS officer had told him he was receiving death threats from Hindu right-wing groups.        
	The BJP was up in arms after a section of the media highlighted the statement today, but the Congress is not worried because it believes its irrepressible general secretary has not taken much of a risk in triggering this row.         
	That a conversation between the two took place on the day of the anti-terror squad chiefs death was not known, but Digvijay has been saying all along that Karkare was harassed by the Sangh parivar because he was investigating the Malegaon blasts in which some extremist Hindu outfits were suspects.         
	I do not want to politicise this. I havent said that the RSS is behind 26/11. I have absolutely no doubt that Karkare was killed by a Pakistani terrorist but BJP leaders, including Rajnathji, had questioned the integrity of Karkare. The fact remains that Karkare was harassed by BJP leaders, Digvijay repeated today, his comments making headlines on all news channels and the BJP demanding an explanation from the Prime Minister.        
	Congress media department chairperson Janardan Dwivedi said: Digvijay is not saying the RSS was behind Karkares death. There is no doubt in anyones mind about who killed him.         
	The Congress thinks Digvijay has played safe by not pointing fingers at any organisation for the officers death.         
	Digvijay said Karkare was known to him because of some Madhya Pradesh link. They used to talk and Karkare phoned on that day but he could not take the call. He returned the call and they talked. This was a personal conversation and the party has nothing to do with it, Dwivedi added.        
	The general secretary had expressed similar views in December 2008, when former Union minister A.R. Antulay demanded a probe into the circumstances surrounding Karkares death. In his support, Digvijay had then said the Sangh parivar had questioned Karkares integrity and it was natural to ask questions.         
	He repeated this line today saying Karkare was a little depressed that some people were questioning his integrity. Among them there were top leaders from the BJP, including Rajnath Singh, he said.        
	Digvijay, who has just been given charge of election-bound Assam, has been trying to shift the focus to communalism. Around 30 per cent of Assams voters are Muslims and the presence of Badruddin Ahmeds Muslim front makes the Congresss task difficult in the state.         
	The BJPs sharp retort to his comments on Karkare has pleased Digvijay, source said. He would like to drag the party deeper into this fight and debate this rather than the spectrum and Commonwealth Games scams in the Assam election.         
	In Madhya Pradesh, where Digvijay had in the past tried to shift the discourse from development to Hindutva, the BJP saw through his plans and won by keeping the focus on development.         
	 In Delhi today, the BJP said Digvijays statement was an attempt to divert attention from scams but could not resist taking him on.         
	Terrorists from across the border and their patrons are going to lap up Digvijay Singhs statement. They will now question the entire 26/11 attacks. The countrys security and fight against terror and investigations into the 26/11 attacks have suffered a serious blow, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said and demanded a clarification from the Prime Minister and the Congress president.

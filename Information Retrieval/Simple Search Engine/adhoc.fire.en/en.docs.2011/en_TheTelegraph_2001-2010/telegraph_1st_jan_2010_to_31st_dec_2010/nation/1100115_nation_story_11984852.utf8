	Patna, Jan. 14: An urgent need to save the Ganga was chief minister Nitish Kumars main agenda as he conducted a cabinet meeting in the restaurant of MV Ganga Bihar, a steamer, here today.        
	The cabinet today resolved to work out a plan to save the rivers aquatic life, including dolphins, and the social and cultural life, that has been associated with the holy river for centuries, Nitish said.        
	His arch rival Lalu Prasad described the venture as the sign of the chief ministers loss of power. People go to Ganga for cremating the dead. You can understand why Nitish has been visiting the Ganga in the last year of his rule, the RJD boss said.        
	But Nitish Kumar dismissed Lalus remark. Bade bhaiya (elder brother) has repeatedly been predicting the fall of my government ever since I became chief minister. But tell him that my days are not over. I am very much in the saddle and he stands no chance of a comeback, he said.        
	Nitish also announced that in keeping with the Centres decision, his government would not impose vat and other taxes on the import of sugar, which was already expensive. Bringing down the prices of essential commodities is the Centres responsibility. But my government will extend all co-operation to it, he said.        
	The chief minister also explained the reasons behind holding a cabinet meeting in a remote village, Barbighi in Begusarai district, during his vikas yatra last March, another at the Rajgir hills in December and this one midstream.        
	The cabinet meeting at Barbighi was aimed at giving a clear message to the people that they were the actual masters. The government they had voted to power was at their doorstep, Nitish said.         
	The mountains at Rajgir are the symbol of Bihars glorious past. We organised a cabinet meeting there as part of our efforts to revive the glory of the state, he added.        
	And saving the Ganga, he pointed out, which has failed to maintain its water level in Bihar, was a part of the bigger mission to save the earth.         
	The cabinet meeting today coincided with Makar Sankranti and the beginning of Kumbh Mela at Haridwar  two religious occasions on which Hindu devotees take a dip in the river.         
	Nitish held the upper riparian states responsible for the failure of the Ganga in maintaining its level in Bihar. The upper riparian states, primarily Uttar Pradesh, have been making excessive use of the Ganga. As a result, only 400 cusecs water is left in the river when it enters Buxar in Bihar. Still we will try our best to keep the river clean and save its life, he said.        
	Kumar is the states third chief minister to hold cabinet meetings out of Patna.         
	Srikrishna Sinha and later Kedar Pandey had also organised their cabinet meetings away from the state secretariat.

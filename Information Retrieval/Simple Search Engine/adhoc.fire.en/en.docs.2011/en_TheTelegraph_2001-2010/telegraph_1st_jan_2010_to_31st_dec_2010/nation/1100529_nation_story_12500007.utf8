          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 28: The BJP today called for an end to the debate of the misleading limited mandate versus unlimited role and demanded a firmer, appropriate and prompt response to Maoism after the Jhargram tragedy.        
	Reacting to todays incident, spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was indeed painful that despite the casualties, the top central and Bengal leaders were speaking in different voices.         
	At least now, it is incumbent on the Prime Minister to clearly articulate what is the Centres line (on the Maoist menace), Prasad said.        
	Prasad asked why no precautions were taken even though Jhargram was a Maoist-infested area and the rebels had declared in advance they would observe a black week.

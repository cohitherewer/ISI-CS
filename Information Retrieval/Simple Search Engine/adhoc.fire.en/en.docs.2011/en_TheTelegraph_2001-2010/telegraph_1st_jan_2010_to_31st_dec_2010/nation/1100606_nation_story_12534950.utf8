The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong double blow to Pawar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong double blow to Pawar
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, June 5: The Congress today cornered Sharad Pawar on his home turf by backing an Independent in the Maharashtra Rajya Sabha elections, while leaving him to fend for himself in the IPL-bid controversy involving his family.        
	Maharashtra Congress spokesman Kanhaiyalal Gidwani announced he had filed his papers as an Independent and claimed the party high commands go-ahead for the move which could spoil the chances of one of the NCPs two candidates.        
	I have met the (Congress) in-charge for Maharashtra, A.K. Antony, who has given me the go-ahead after chief minister Ashok Chavan and (state Congress) chief Manikrao Thakre gave the nod, Gidwani said.        
	Gidwanis candidature could be the Congresss way of paying Pawar back for joining hands with the Sena-BJP in 2006 to get industrialist Rahul Bajaj through as an Independent at the cost of Congress nominee Avinash Pande.         
	With the Congress and the NCP fielding two candidates each, and the BJP and the Shiv Sena one apiece, Gidwanis entry means each needs 42 first-preference votes to be sure of a win in the 288-member House. The Congress has 82 MLAs and the NCP has 62.        
	The NCPs second nominee, therefore, needs 22 votes from outside the party. If Pawar was expecting support from the 53 members not associated with the major parties, Gidwani said he was eyeing their votes too.        
	He said he planned to meet Pawar to seek support and would also request Raj Thackerays party, which has 11 MLAs, to back him.        
	The Congress also refused to come to Pawars aid over allegations that he had concealed his familys links with an IPL franchise bid.        
	The issue involves (cricket board) BCCI, Pawar and the inquiry going into the IPL. If there are any facts, give it to it (the inquiry). The Congress has nothing to comment. You should ask these questions to Pawar, party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said.        
	It has emerged that Pawar, his wife and his daughter Supriya Sule, an MP, control about 16 per cent shares in City Corporation, which had unsuccessfully bid for the Pune team. BCCI chief Shashank Manohar has said the IPL governing council did not know that City Corporations managing director, Aniruddha Deshpande, had bid in his individual capacity  the version given by Pawar and Sule to clear themselves.

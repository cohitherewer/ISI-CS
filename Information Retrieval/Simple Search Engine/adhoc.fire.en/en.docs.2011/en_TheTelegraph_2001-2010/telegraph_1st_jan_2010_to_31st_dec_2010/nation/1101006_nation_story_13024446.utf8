The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh dangles Varanasi gesture
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh dangles Varanasi gesture
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The RSS and the BJP have told the more impulsive members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Hindu clergy to give up their claim to the Gyan Vapi and the Shahi Idgah mosques in Varanasi and Mathura if they wished to see a Ram temple come up in Ayodhya.         
	On Monday, L.K. Advani ruled out the re-emergence of these two controversies despite Allahabad High Courts verdict sanctifying the centrality of faith over law. The BJP leader told PTI: No, no. There is a sea of difference between the two (Ayodhya and Varanasi-Mathura).         
	Advani recalled that when the NDA government was negotiating the Ayodhya dispute with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in 2003, the Muslim representatives were assured that if they voluntarily agreed to a solution for building a Ram temple, Varanasi and Mathura would not be raked up. We had talked about it then, he said.         
	Although, legally, there is no way the Ayodhya judgment will serve as a precedent for the two places, the VHP and its swamis and sadhus have often used the mosque rows to arm-twist Muslims into accepting an Ayodhya formula on their terms. A crude bargaining chip was how a member of the Muslim law board had termed it.         
	A 1991 central law called the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act had stated that all places of worship existing as on August 15, 1947, would continue to be what they were on that day. Only the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri issue was excluded from its scope because the government of the day acknowledged the impossibility of turning the clock back on events related to it.         
	It would have meant that the Ram Lalla idols, surreptitiously placed inside the Babri mosque in 1949, would have to be removed.         
	However, the law did not deter the VHP from periodically agitating in Mathura and Varanasi, although their protests did not find local backers.         
	In the guise of making the VHP see reason, some observers feel, the BJP and the RSS are doing exactly what the VHP has been asking for: they hope a promise of dropping the Varanasi and Mathura issues will bring Muslims around to giving up their claim on the one-third land allotted to the Sunni Central Wakf Board in the Ayodhya complex.         
	Asked if Advanis proposal would be acceptable, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, who heads the Sri Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, said: We will not mention Varanasi and Mathura before a Ram temple comes up. We are focussed on Ram, like Arjuna was on the eye of the bird. We have not taken on the task of liberating every mosque in this country.

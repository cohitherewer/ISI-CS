The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP to review ties today
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP to review ties today
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 20: The BJP brass meets tomorrow to review the partys relationship with the Janata Dal (United) but senior leaders have ruled out any response that could precipitate a crisis.        
	The BJP is anguished by Nitish Kumars provocative move of returning the flood aid sent by the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat. But party leaders argue that a break-up now would rob us of our most valuable ally and that the Congress will get a political bonanza.        
	We have few options whereas Nitish has many. We must express our firm disapproval of such violations of the coalition dharma but must not snap ties, a senior BJP leader said.        
	The BJP leadership understands how important the Dal (United) has become to the partys plans after the parting with Naveen Patnaik. Coalition-making is the need of the hour. The NDA will lose its significance if the Dal (U) walks out. Although Nitish cannot form the government on his own... he will try to stay afloat by winning over new partners. And if he fails, the Congress will be the ultimate winner, another leader said.

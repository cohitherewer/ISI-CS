The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Defence go-slow after China snub
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Defence go-slow after China snub
  - Beijing refuses visa to general        OUR BUREAU                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: India has signalled a slow-down in friendly military exchanges with China after Beijing last month rejected an Indian generals application for a visa.         
	The Northern Army Commander, Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal, whose area of responsibility includes Jammu and Kashmir  and the frontiers with both Pakistan and China  was nominated to lead an official delegation to China. But China refused his visa application ostensibly because it wants to maintain an ambivalent stand on Kashmir.        
	While we value our exchanges with China, there must be sensitivity to each others concerns, said the spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs, Vishnu Prakash.        
	The Indian and Chinese armies began a bilateral joint training exercise  Exercise Hand-in-Hand in 2007 in Kunming in Chinas Yunnan province. It was also held in Belgaum, Karnataka, in 2008.         
	But there was none last year and none so far this year but a planning conference for a 2011 edition is scheduled. There is now a question mark on whether the joint drill will be continued.        
	Jammu and Kashmir is as important to us as Tibet is to China, a senior government source said here, expressing indignation with China that has not been apparent on most occasions when disputes have arisen.        
	Ironically, the Eastern Army Commander, (even General V.K. Singh who has held the post) whose area of responsibility includes Arunachal Pradesh  that China claims  has visited China and even Tibet. In turn, the Chengdu military region general, whose area of responsibility covers the Tibetan Autonomous Region, has also been hosted in India.        
	The military interaction between India and China has also included port visits by the warships of the two navies and exchange of junior and middle-ranked officers for courses in armed forces institutes.        
	But the fragile defence relations with China are not being frozen. Border personnel meetings on the Line of Actual Control, established as a confidence-building measure, will continue.         
	It is not the question of breaking ties, defence minister A.K. Antony said in Hyderabad. There are occasional problems but that will not affect our broader approach, he said.        
	After China refused the visa to Lt Gen. Jaswal, India also rejected permits to two captains and a senior colonel of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army.         
	The captains were slated to attend the Indian Armys language training institute in Panchmarhi and the senior colonel was invited as a guest to give a lecture at the National Defence College in Delhi.        
	The official statement from the foreign ministry said India and China had an important, multi-faceted and complex relationship. Our interaction has been growing in a number of areas, including defence. In recent years, we have had useful defence exchanges at various levels.         
	Strangely, Lt Gen. Jaswal visited China on its invitation to witness its military exercises in 2008. At that time, he was the general-officer-commanding the Tezpur-headquartered 4 Corps. Troops of the 4 Corps are deployed in Arunachal opposite Chinese lines.

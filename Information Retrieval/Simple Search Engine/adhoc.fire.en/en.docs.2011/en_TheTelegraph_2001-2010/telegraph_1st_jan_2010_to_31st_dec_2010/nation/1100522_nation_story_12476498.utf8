                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Patil claims miners link with Maoists
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           RR Patil                                  
	Mumbai, May 21: Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil today said links between the mining industry and Maoists groups were an open secret and called for a probe, the first such claim by a person holding public office.        
	The industry, apparently stunned by the statement, was quick to deny the allegation and demanded a meeting with the minister and top state police officers to find out the basis on which Patil had made the claim.        
	Patils statement comes a week after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged industry leaders in Delhi to join the Centre in bringing development to the rebel zones that had remained poor despite being rich in minerals.        
	NCP leader Patil, who oversees the states Naxalite-affected Gadchiroli area in the Congress-led state cabinet, wanted the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, under the Union finance ministry, to probe the alleged links.        
	But the minister didnt explain whether he was referring specifically to the mining industry in Maharashtra or making a general observation in the context of mining activities in all rebel-infested states several of which are rich in minerals.        
	Allegations have been made in the past about firms in rebel pockets having to cough up protection money  amounting to extortion  but Patil didnt specify if he meant these payments or other financial dealings.        
	Patil, who was given charge of Gadchiroli after the October 2009 Maoist strike in which 17 policemen died and who has visited the area several times in recent months, suggested the guerrillas had enough money to get modern weapons, appearing to suggest that the cash trail needed to be examined.         
	Earlier, they (the rebels) had country-made weapons. Now, they have the latest, and in some instances, imported weapons, he added.        
	Vijay Kalantri, president of the All India Association of Industries, said: The industry would not indulge in such an act. However, if the home minister is saying something, it could be on the basis of some specific information. In that case, he should have discussed the issue with us. He should convene a meeting of the industry association to discuss the issue.         
	Patil also pointed out the drastic changes in the strategy deployed by the Maoists. Earlier, they operated in small teams or dalams (squads) that would carry out strikes on security forces, but the recent attacks indicate that they deploy 100 to 300 heavily armed cadres who not only carry out ambushes with landmines, but cordon off security personnel and open fire.         
	 Earlier, we (the police) went there in companies now Naxalites move about in companies. They have their own salary structure also, the minister said.        
	In Octobers attack, over 100 to 200 Maoists had encircled the group of policemen and killed them in a gun battle.         
	A couple of months before that, the guerrillas had ambushed and killed 31 police personnel in the same area.        
	Few politicians had then dared to visit the tribal-dominated zone, which has seen little development despite its large wealth of mineral resources. Police personnel were also known to be reluctant to take up postings there.        
	The state government, led by chief minister Ashok Chavan (from the Congress), recently cleared a special development package for the states rebel-hit areas. The projects under the scheme would be implemented over three years.

          SUBHASH CHAKRAVARTI                              
	It has been a privilege for me to watch Jyoti Basu in public life. I remember him in the Bengal Assembly, as one of its two CPI members in the late 40s, when it was extremely difficult for a communist member to articulate his point. The House in undivided Bengal was dominated by conservative members led by very competent legislators. On the Muslim League side, it was H.S. Suhrawardy and on the Congress side, Kiran Shankar Ray. In that House, Basu would attract attention not out of curiosity but for his skilled and disciplined presentation of his views in excellent English.        
	Then there was a period of confusion when Basu was obliged to speak, under the partys directive, only in Bengali. One got the distinct impression that he was not particularly at home in the language.        
	In later years, I remember he was conspicuous for driving to the Assembly in a battered fiat. The car probably belonged to the party but Basu was always at the wheel and other communist MLAs, particularly Harekrishna Konar, were in the passenger seats.        
	I also saw him as a mass leader on the streets, as courageous and determined as any other leader, some of whom would make insinuations about Basus class origins and western upbringing. He was so modest that he would be happy being entertained to ordinary middle-class fare. Only, one had to remember that though a quintessential Bengali, he did not eat prawns. There was no such stipulation against sweets.        
	Many private enterprises in Bengal, particularly old-time newspapers, faced financial problems, if not closure. Basu would ask me to look out for any opportunity for him to help. It had nothing to do with his political affiliation, only with his concern for the staff and journalists.        
	Basu was candid about his friendships across political divides. He always maintained that Indira Gandhi, whom he knew from their student days in London, was a good friend.        
	He was urbane in his reading habits and loved good English fiction. He would visit old libraries and bookshops in London, especially those near his alma mater. He was never guilty of hypocrisy. If someone was entertaining him after sunset, he would enjoy a glass of whisky without turning shy, unlike many other politicians.        
	Considering his academic attainments, eclectic upbringing and long life of dedication to an ideal, he should perhaps be counted as the last of an illustrious list of Bengalis who did their people proud.              
	(As told to Manini Chatterjee)
  Journalist Subhash Chakravarti knew Basu closely for over 60 years

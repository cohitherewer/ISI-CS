The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Reunion at mourning
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Reunion at mourning
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Mulayam Singh Yadav arrived half an hour before time for Jyoti Basus condolence meeting in the capital yesterday and left after the last person had gone.        
	Sitaram Yechury reciprocated today by attending a similar programme Mulayams Samajwadi Party was holding in memory of veteran Janeshwar Mishra, who had passed away days after Basu.        
	The gestures werent just about form. For Mulayam, trying to discard the anti-Socialist baggage of the Amar Singh era  that is what his colleagues claimed  the meeting was a second show of strength after the first post-Amar protest he had staged in Lucknow against price rise on the day of Basus last journey.        
	Mulayam is using every forum to banish Amars ghost. For the first time in years, I see his (Samajwadi) workers come alive, said a former colleague of Mulayam now with the Janata Dal (United). A Samajwadi leader later said the partys parliamentary board could meet soon to recommend Amars expulsion.         
	But the Samajwadis seemingly new-found fervour did not seem to enthuse leaders of the Left and other socialist parties. For instance, Yechury spoke about the Left-leaning Socialists and communists coming together, but not necessarily in a political alliance.        
	The Samajwadis and the communist parties have been allies in the post-Babri demolition period but for a breach when Mulayam and Amar bailed out the UPA government on the nuclear deal.         
	Although the outlines of a third front regrouping were faintly visible at todays meeting, most of the leaders revisited the time spent together and wondered why they had split into so many formations.         
	Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav said: Earlier we fought, parted ways but came together. This time people say we have remained separate for a long time. Yadavs party has had an alliance with the BJP  the allies rule Bihar since 1995 and is apparently in no hurry to end it.

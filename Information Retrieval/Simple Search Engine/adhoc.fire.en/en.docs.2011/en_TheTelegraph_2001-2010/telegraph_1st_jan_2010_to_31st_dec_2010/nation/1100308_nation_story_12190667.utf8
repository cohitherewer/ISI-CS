	Imphal, March 7: The Manipur advocate-general was shot and injured in a car yesterday not by militants but by one of the two ministers travelling with him, chief minister Ibobi Singh said today.        
	One of the ministers accidentally fired from his licensed gun, he said but refused to reveal whether it was PWD minister K. Ranjit or tribal development minister D.D. Thaisii.        
	Suspicion had fallen on militants after N. Koteshore Singh was shot at in Imphal, a bullet piercing his right arm and entering his rib cage. The two ministers accompanied Ibobi to hospital today to see the official who, doctors said, was serious but stable.        
	As reporters questioned him, Ibobi walked away angrily, saying there was no need for further inquiries since it was an accidental shot from a licensed gun. Reporters who had travelled in Koteshores convoy yesterday said they heard several shots.        
	No case has been registered, the Imphal East police chief has confirmed, saying there was no complaint.

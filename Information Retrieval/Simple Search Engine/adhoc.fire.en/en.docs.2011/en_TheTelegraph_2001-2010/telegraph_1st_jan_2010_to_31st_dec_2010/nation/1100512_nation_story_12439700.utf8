The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fresh innings but CM yet to play ball 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fresh innings but CM yet to play ball 
          JOHN MARY                          Shashi Tharoor                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, May 11: Shashi Tharoor has begun his second innings as mentor of the Kochi IPL team, landing a meeting with a Congress satrap but unsure about an appointment with the communist chief minister.        
	Tharoor led the Rendezvous consortium, which owns the Kochi franchise, to a meeting with Kerala Opposition leader Oommen Chandy here today, reaffirming that cricket remained his first love.        
	The meeting with Chandy, the chairman of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), was significant as the majority of leaders in the Kerala unit of the party are at daggers drawn with Tharoor, MP from Thiruvananthapuram, who is seen as an alien in the organisation.        
	Tharoor, a former United Nations bureaucrat, had to resign as junior foreign minister last month following disclosure that his close friend Sunanda Pushkar had been given free equity by Rendezvous, a consortium formed by a bunch of businessmen from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Kerala.        
	Tharoor had then defended himself saying he was only the mentor but his explanation failed to cut ice with the Congress, which forced him to resign.        
	Tharoor today led a five-member Rendezvous team, headed by chief executive T. Kesav, to Chandy, who is tipped to be the next chief minister if the UDF wins the 2011 election. But the ruling CPM, whose boss Prakash Karat has made it clear that Keralas priority is not an IPL team, has continued to keep a distance from the Kochi consortium.        
	Tharoor had sought an appointment for his team with state sports minister M. Vijayakumar, but he had shied away saying he was preoccupied with official business and party affairs.         
	At the meeting with Chandy, Tharoor got him to speak to chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan to try and fix an appointment with the Rendezvous team tonight.        
	Achuthanandan, who doesnt see eye to eye with Karat, is said to have agreed at first, but as the evening wore on, he too appeared to have developed cold feet.        
	The chief ministers office first fixed an appointment for 8.30 this evening and later moved it back by an hour, saying Achuthanandan was stuck at a party conclave. But around 10pm, officials told the Rendezvous members, who were waiting at the chief ministers residence, that Achuthanandan would meet them at 12.30pm tomorrow.         
	The Kochi officials are scheduled to fly out tomorrow morning.         
	Earlier in the day, Tharoor made a brief appearance at the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) meeting with Rendezvous.         
	Tharoor, who as minister often got into trouble with his colourful Twitter postings, appeared more circumspect today.         
	Let us put sports above politics and all controversies. I am the happiest person around, said Tharoor after his brief meeting with KCA officials. It (the Kochi IPL team) will definitely help spot young talent and also strengthen the states economy, he said.

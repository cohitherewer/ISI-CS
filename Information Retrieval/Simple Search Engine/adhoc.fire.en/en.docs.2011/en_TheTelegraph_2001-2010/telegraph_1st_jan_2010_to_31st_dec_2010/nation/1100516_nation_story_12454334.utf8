The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JMM puts up a united front 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      JMM puts up a united front 
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                          Shibu Soren                                  
	Ranchi, May 15: The JMM core committee today authorised party president Shibu Soren to decide in the next two-three days the partys future course of action amid indications that the BJP was sending Arjun Munda to set the terms for forming a government to be led by him.        
	At the meeting, the JMM discussed the changed political scenario at length. While differences within the MLAs on handing over the mantle to the BJP remained, senior leaders were convinced their opposition would only lead them to dead end.         
	Shibu Sorens decision will always be ultimate for every party member. If we have collectively decided to authorise our party president to take the final decision, all will have to honour it, senior JMM leader and HRD minister Hemlal Murmu told The Telegraph after the meeting.        
	JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren, however, said so far the BJP hadnt form ally communicated anything on the power sharing issue. As and when the JMM receives a proposal, we will be ready for further talks, he said.         
	All JMM MLAs except three attended todays meeting. Those who stayed away were Sorens daughter-in-law and Jama MLA Sita Soren, incarcerated Torpa MLA Paulus Surin and Pakur MLA Aquil Akhtar.        
	Earlier in the day, Hemant held a closed door meeting with Assembly speaker C.P. Singh. But, both of them refused to divulge details. All things need not be made public, Singh said.        
	Senior JMM leader Simon Marandi, a know opponent of Hemants formula of allowing the BJP to lead a government, continued to voice his feelings on the issue.        
	The party is free to dismiss me, but I will never accept BJP as leaders, he said. Hemant Soren may have become our legislature party leader, but he is still a kid. His father, Shibu Soren, is our real leader, he said.        
	It is learnt that over half a dozen JMM legislators have communicated to the Congress that that they were not willing to support a BJP led government. Sources close to Congress leader Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu claimed at least 10 JMM MLAs were ready to cross over.        
	But, the Congress is being cautious. We are opposed to Presidents rule and fresh elections at this juncture. We are in constant touch with JMM members. If the BJP and JMM formally part ways, we would be taking appropriate decisions in the larger interest of the state, Balmuchu told The Telegraph.

	New Delhi, Jan. 12: From Russia to jail via bottle.        
	A Russian womans late-night binge has taken her from the five-star comforts of a hotel to the cold confines of Tihar after a peg too many brought in the cops who found out she had been living illegally in India.        
	The revelation has left police red-faced as they didnt have a clue about Anoor Gayalkamedovas stay in Delhi, though her visa had expired in December 2008.        
	That, too, despite the high alert with Republic Day round the corner and the scan on foreigners since intelligence agencies realised that alleged 26/11 plotter David Coleman Headley had been in and out of India several times.        
	Cases like Anoors show there has to be much more effort to identify foreigners who stay on, said a police source.        
	The police went on Anoors trail early on January 10 after a call from a south Delhi five-star hotel. Desperate hotel staff hadnt been able to control the tall and bulky Russian who kept on abusing them.        
	Get me another get me another, you ******, get me another, was all she was saying when we arrived, laughed a cop who tried to control her.        
	The police searched her bags and found a copy of her passport. Her address was that of a colony in Dwarka, south Delhi. The cops took her to the area, but she couldnt recall the name of her apartment.        
	We wanted to take her to her apartment but gave up when she couldnt remember anything, said a police source.        
	The police then got in touch with the Russian embassy. It turned out that Anoor had come to the capital on June 14, 2008, on a tourist visa. Since then she hadnt contacted the embassy even once.        
	Booked under the foreigners act, Anoor has been sent to judicial custody in Tihar for 14 days.

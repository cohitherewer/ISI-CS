The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From Behala, caught in Kyrgyz riot with fire nearby
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      From Behala, caught in Kyrgyz riot with fire nearby
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, June 15: When the building next to his went up in flames, Amrit Das was almost certain he wouldnt see his parents back home in Behala again.        
	If the armed gang of rioters didnt get him, hunger would.        
	Food had run out and there was no water. Even the gas and power supply had been cut off. But venturing out would be madness.        
	Stranded in Osh, racked by ethnic violence since Friday that has left at least 170 dead in this southern Kyrgyzstan city, the Calcutta boy and some 100 other Indian students had shut themselves inside their homes as groups of rioters butchered the minority Uzbeks outside.        
	There was nobody to turn to for help; even the cops were siding with the dominant Kyrgyz community, helping the rioters as they picked out their targets.        
	We werent sure if we would survive. The worst was when the rioters set fire to the building next to where I live, said Amrit over the phone from Bishkek.        
	Just when it seemed all over, help came.        
	The Indian embassy in Bishkek got its act together and last night evacuated Amrit and 104 other Indians, mostly students, to the Kyrgyz capital, up north and far away from riot-ravaged Osh.        
	As many as 900 foreign nationals  Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Turks and many from Africa were evacuated from Osh yesterday.        
	But the crack of gunshots kept coming back. After four nightmare days, it isnt easy to shut out the savagery they had been through.        
	For much of the four days, Amrit said, he and the others could hear only gunshots. It was unsafe going out. There were reports of students having been kidnapped. All we could do was lock ourselves indoors, the fifth-year medical student recalled.        
	The only saving grace was the phone lines still worked, and he could talk to his parents back home in Behala.        
	Functioning phone lines also meant students from the subcontinent could keep in touch with each other. Of the 2,500 medical students at the Osh State Universitys Medical Institute, as many as 600 are foreign students, a substantial number of them from the subcontinent.        
	Some of the stranded foreigners, among them students and businessmen, had planned to make a run for the airport. But the plan was dropped when they realised that shoot-at-sight orders had been issued.        
	Before they could think of something less desperate, help came.        
	On their way to the airport, the students were stunned by the savagery that has marked the riots  the worst since 1990 in violence-torn Kyrgyzstan. Along the road stood rows of burnt houses. Rotting bodies lay strewn.         
	Amrit and his fellow students plan to take the next available flight to India. An official with the external affairs ministry said at least three private chartered flights would take off from Bishkek for India this week.         
	But most students The Telegraph spoke to didnt have good words for the embassy staff, who, they said, were insensitive.        
	Some students, who did not want to be named, said embassy phones remained unattended over the weekend.         
	True, they eventually organised our evacuation. But they werent of much help for the first three-four days, said a student.        
	When the students landed in Bishkek, they found the mission had forgotten to make arrangements for their accommodation. The students were later put up in a dormitory of Bishkek university.         
	A senior foreign ministry official in New Delhi contested the allegations. Hostel accommodation and meals, as possible under the circumstances, were arranged for the students at Bishkek by the embassy. Some students have lost their passports. Our mission will issue new passports and other travel documents, the official said.        
	Our mission is making efforts to ensure that the students can travel to India over the next few days, the official added.         
	Amrit, who plans to fly out of Kyrgyzstan soon, wants to return. I am in my fifth year. I need to complete my studies, he said.

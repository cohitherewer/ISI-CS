          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 25: An Uttar Pradesh court has summoned Sanjay Dutt after he repeatedly failed to appear before it in an obscenity case slapped against him because he offered Mayavati a jhappi in Munnabhai-style.        
	Last year, the Uttar Pradesh government slapped the case against him after the actor told a Samajwadi Party election rally he would give a jaadu ki jhappi to Mayavati.         
	Dutt has repeatedly not responded to the Barabanki court summons since then. Today, the court directed the Mumbai police commissioner to send the summons to the actor. The date for the next hearing has been fixed at July 29.        
	We have been informed that a UP court has sent a directive to summon Sanjay Dutt. We will do the needful when the papers come, said a police spokesperson.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat today said the Sanghs response to the court verdict on the Ayodhya title suit would be democratic and within the constitutional and legal framework.        
	But he restated the cornerstones of the parivars beliefs that Hindus wanted a Ram temple on the site of the Babri mosque. So it was incumbent on Muslims to repair and restore their relationship with Hindus because Ram was a cultural icon, not just an object of veneration, and, therefore, certain cherished values were hurt when a temple was demolished on that spot.        
	Bhagwat didnt give an assurance on whether the parivar would abandon demands for a temple on the site of the Gyan Vapi and Shahi Idgah mosques in Varanasi and Mathura, respectively, if the Ayodhya problem was resolved amicably. Its for the sants to take a call, he said.         
	Bhagwat recognised the need to maintain peace and order and claimed that there will no trouble from our side, but he refused to issue a categorical peace appeal to the VHP and other militant Hindu outfits.        
	In an informal interaction with journalists, Bhagwat said: Let the verdict come and there will be another legal opportunity to examine it in the high court and then the Supreme Court. Our response will be democratic but we do want a grand Ram temple.

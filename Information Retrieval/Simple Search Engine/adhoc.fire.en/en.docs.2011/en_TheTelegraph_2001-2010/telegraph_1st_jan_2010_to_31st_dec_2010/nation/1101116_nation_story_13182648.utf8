          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Nov. 15: A Pakistani Hizb-ul Mujahideen militant, whom Jammu and Kashmir police have dubbed a killing machine, was arrested today from Delhi where he had been allegedly planning to set up sleeper cells.        
	Mohammad Abdullah alias Abdullah Inqillabi, a self-styled divisional commander of the outfit in Jammus Rajouri, was referred to as Mr Surrender as he often contacted police officers with proposals to surrender while continuing his terror activities.        
	He had recently fled to Delhi where he was planning to set up sleeper cells to carry out terror attacks in other parts of the country, Jammu and Kashmir police said.         
	Jammu police chief Ashok Gupta called him a killing machine responsible for murdering 25 people, many of them minorities and civilians. He was also involved in killing three special police officers (non-permanent cops) in 2006. He was so ruthless that he killed an associate last year on suspicion that the man had illicit relations with his wife.        
	A resident of Pakistan-occupied Kashmirs Muzaffarabad, Inqillabi had been active in Shopian, Kulgam and Rajouri for the past 10 years. Gupta said he had escaped to Delhi from an encounter site on October 25  when two of his associates were killed  and was planning to take his network beyond Kashmir.         
	Inqillabi was caught by Delhi polices special cell, the forces anti-terror division, from Deer Park, near IIT Delhi.         
	He got panicky and fired two rounds. We also had to open two-three rounds of fire before he was arrested. A preliminary probe has revealed that he reached the capital five days ago, an officer said.        
	Inqillabi was remanded in police custody for two weeks by a Delhi court. A Kashmir officer said the militant would be brought to the state for questioning.

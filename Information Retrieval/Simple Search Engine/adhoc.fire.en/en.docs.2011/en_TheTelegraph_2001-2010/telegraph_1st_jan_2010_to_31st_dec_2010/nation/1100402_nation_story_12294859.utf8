	London, April 1 (PTI): Britain will hike its student visa fee by 54 (Rs 3,673) and introduce a dependent relative visa as part of efforts to attract migrants and visitors who can make a valued contribution.        
	The student visa fee has been raised from 145 (Rs 9,864) to 199 (Rs 13,534). The dependent relative visa fee will be 1,680 (Rs 1.14 lakh). The new charges, including the cost of processing visa applications, come into effect from April 6.        
	The new visa category of dependent relative will allow grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles and siblings over the age of 18 to join family members settled in the UK or be admitted for the purpose of settlement, an official release said.         
	The fee for short-term visit visas has been marginally increased from 67 to 68.         
	The Tier 1 General, Investor, Entrepreneur visa fee has been increased from 675 to 690, while the charges for Tier 2 visa for skilled workers will go up to 270 from 265.         
	The five-year multiple entry visa fee has been hiked from 400 to 429, while the charges for 10-year visa have been increased from 500 to 610.        
	The Tier 4 student visa fee has been raised from 145 to 199. The settlement visa fee will go up from 585 to 644.        
	In setting the visa fees, the UK government aims to strike the correct balance between maintaining secure and effective borders and improving the service to customers, and ensuring that the fee structure supports the UKs ability to attract migrants and visitors who make a valued contribution, the release said.              
	In most visa categories, the maximum fee increase is 2.5 per cent, the release said, adding some fees continue to be set at a level lower than the actual processing cost because it is considered in the interest of the UK.         
	The subsidised visa categories include tourist visas and also the Tier 4 student visa, which reflects the contribution made by international students to the UK economy and education, the release said.

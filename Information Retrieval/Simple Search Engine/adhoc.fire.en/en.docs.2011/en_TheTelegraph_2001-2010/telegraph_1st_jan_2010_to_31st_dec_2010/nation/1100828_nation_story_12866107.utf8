The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Games official scapegoat: rain
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Games official scapegoat: rain
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government has finally made official what almost everybody associated with the Commonwealth Games knew: the incessant rains in Delhi have delayed the preparations.        
	The Games-related work will miss its August 31 deadline, the third such time limit to have not been met.        
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has set September 10 as the new deadline. The deadline had to be extended because of the incessant rains as the agencies could not complete their work. We have asked the agencies to remove the debris (at construction sites) and if they dont do that, we will remove it ourselves, Dikshit said.        
	Despite the tardy pace, the chief minister promised that all the work would be completed before October 3  the day of the opening ceremony. Probably, the rain god is unhappy with us.        
	The previous deadlines were July 31 and August 10. September 10 was fixed as the next date after the agencies conveyed to Dikshit that they would not be able to complete their work within the next four days.         
	The Centres group of ministers (GoM) on the Games, headed by S. Jaipal Reddy, had met yesterday and was told that the agencies would not be able to wrap up the constructions because of the excessive rains.        
	This August has been Delhis wettest in a decade. And it is not over yet: the Met office has forecast more rains over the next few days.         
	Worse, a weather phenomenon called La Nina is likely to cause excess rainfall in northern India from the second half of September  just when the delayed preparations could be peaking. Athletes and officials will start arriving from September 15.        
	Reddy, the Union urban development minister, brought in another factor: the Mumbai oil spill.         
	He said it had delayed the containers from abroad packed with equipment. The schedule (for the preparations) is not being met. It is being delayed by a few days because of the rain and delays in the delivery of containers, Reddy said, probably forgetting that Delhi, like the rest of India, is expected to receive rains during monsoon.        
	Reddy, however, was still optimistic, saying the delays would be a couple of days and not more than that.         
	But the progress so far has sparked fears the September 10 deadline may also be missed. Several venues need to be spruced up. At the S.P. Mukherjee Swimming complex, basics like tiles and cables are still missing.         
	The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held, also needs another 10 days of prepping.

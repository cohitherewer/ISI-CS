          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, April 3: The mother of a Territorial Army soldier committed suicide after coming to know that her only son had been arrested for allegedly abducting a schoolgirl from Poonch in Jammu.        
	Police sources said Shakti Sharma, 25, who was on leave  he was posted in Sopore  abducted Azra Bano, a student of Class XII in Mendhar village, on Thursday. Sharma is from the same village.        
	He took the girl to his friends in Dharati village, left her there, but returned home on Thursday night, lest villagers become suspicious. But Azras family realised she was missing and lodged a police complaint, an officer said.         
	The police launched a manhunt and yesterday arrested Sharma, who has nine sisters. When his mother, Virti Devi, learnt about the incident and the arrest of her son, she consumed some poisonous substance. She was taken to a hospital where doctors declared her dead on arrival, the police officer said.         
	Shakti was her only son. Her husband died some years ago and her son was the only earner in the family. We have found the girl whom Sharma had taken to the village close to the Line of Control. She was handed over to the family after necessary formalities, Poonch police chief Manmohan Singh said. Virti Devis funeral took place yesterday and we allowed her son to participate in it. We have booked him (Sharma) for the abduction of the girl.         
	Police sources said the alleged abduction sparked communal tension in the area because the girl is a Muslim and the soldier a Hindu. But swift action during which we arrested the soldier and found the girl calmed the situation. Top police officers and civil officials rushed to the area and held meetings with members of both communities to assuage their concerns, a police source said.         
	Sources said the soldier had planned to take the girl to Srinagar. The police have also arrested the vehicle driver who had helped the soldier take the girl to Dharati, near the LoC.

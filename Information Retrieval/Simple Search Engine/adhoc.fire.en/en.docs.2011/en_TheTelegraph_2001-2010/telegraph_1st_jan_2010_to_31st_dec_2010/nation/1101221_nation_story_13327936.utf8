          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Every candidate for next years Bengal elections will have to open a bank account for campaign-related transactions under new norms announced by the Election Commission today.        
	A similar measure was introduced for the just-concluded Bihar elections to keep tabs on campaign expenditure.        
	The account should preferably be a joint one with an election agent, the norms said. The poll panel will also maintain a register of a candidates expenditure with data drawn from the bank account.        
	Candidates will be monitored by a separate shadow expenditure register and will have to open an exclusive election bank account, a commission official said.        
	The poll panel will field surveillance teams in every police station area in the constituencies. These teams will have the power to search and seize money that appears illegal or suspicious. The sleuths in the teams, drawn from tax and revenue departments, will keep vigil on a candidates expenditure beginning from the filing of nomination till the declaration of results, said the official.        
	After an all-party meeting called by Bengal chief electoral officer Sunil Gupta, the commission today said representatives of political parties would be allowed to attend the checking process of electronic voting machines. Representatives of political parties will be allowed to witness the EVM checking that will begin from December 27. They will be issued identity cards for access to the checking area by the district administrations, Gupta said.        
	The commission will use 93,000 EVMs for the elections, which have to be held by June 11 next year.

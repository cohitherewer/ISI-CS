The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen no to NDA rally
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Naveen no to NDA rally
  - BJD not on BJP dais           ASHUTOSH MISHRA                          Naveen Patnaik                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 15: Naveen Patnaik today ruled out Biju Janata Dals participation in the proposed NDA rally in Delhi later this month.        
	The BJD will not attend the NDA rally, said the Orissa chief minister, who is also the party president.         
	The BJD had contested the last Assembly and Lok Sabha elections on its own following the collapse of its 10-year-old alliance with the BJP.        
	For the past few days, there was speculation on whether Naveen would attend the rally after the party was invited for the December 22 event by NDA convener Sharad Yadav about a week ago.         
	Naveen himself kept everyone on tenterhooks by stating that the party was examining Yadavs proposal.        
	Naveen had parted ways with the BJP last year on a bitter note after the two parties failed to arrive at an agreement over seat-sharing for the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.         
	Had Naveen accepted Yadavs invitation, it would have been the first occasion since March 7, 2009, the day BJD-BJP alliance collapsed in the state, that he would have shared a common platform with his old ally.         
	Sources in the BJD said the chief minister had taken a mature decision as joining the NDA rally would have been construed as a move to mend fences with the BJP at a time when his government is under attack from the latter.        
	We were elected by the people on our own strength. The mandate was to maintain equidistance from both the BJP and the Congress. We would have lost face had we been seen as aligning with the BJP again, said a senior leader who did not wish to be named.        
	State BJP president Jual Oram, however, said Naveen developed cold feet as he knew that NDA ultimately would not have accepted a scam-tainted leader like him.         
	He got scared. The NDA, in any case, would not have accepted him. The invitation from Sharad Yadav was at best an attempt to ensure floor coordination in Parliament where the Opposition was demanding a joint parliamentary committee on the 2G spectrum scam, said Oram.        
	Senior BJP leader Suresh Pujari said Naveen, who was facing trouble over illegal mining, would have been a cause of embarrassment for his party leaders in Delhi had he accepted the invitation.         
	Its a relief that he is not going. Since the rally in Delhi is supposed to focus on corruption, the presence of a chief minister who is himself in the dock would have diluted its impact, said Pujari.

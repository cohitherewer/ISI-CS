	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Left leaders are upbeat that the Congress-led UPA government finds itself in a state of siege over corruption and price rise but remain unsure whether it will benefit them in any way in the Bengal polls.        
	CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who sent a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over skyrocketing onion prices today, was sure that it would harm the Congress in forthcoming polls in several states.         
	Asked whether it would help the Left in Bengal, Dasgupta said: Bengals case is different. The Left in Bengal is paying for the wrongs it has committed.         
	The trade union leader asked the Prime Minister to show courage and arrest blackmarketers and hoarders responsible for jacking up onion prices and added that recent events had exposed the Congress government.        
	If you (the Prime Minister) have any tears left, please shed it and match it with action, Dasgupta wrote.         
	Other Left leaders were not as forthright but shared his views to an extent. Corruption and price rise will not help us but a break-up of alliance between the Congress and Trinamul Congress will, said a CPM leader. The leader appeared enthused by Trinamuls veiled threat to go it alone in Bengal.         
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, too, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister today to keep fasting southern partner Chandrababu Naidu happy. He raised the farmers issue and urged the Prime Minister to intervene.         
	The Centre has announced a Rs 400-crore relief package for rain-hit Andhra farmers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong sends council signal to govt

          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, April 1: The return of the Sonia Gandhi-headed National Advisory Council (NAC) may be the Congresss way to ensure the Manmohan Singh government doesnt take the party for granted, party insiders say.        
	The revival of the council, which acted as an interface between the government and civil society after the Congress returned to power in 2004, has alarmed those in the government, but delighted key party leaders.        
	While the idea of having an institutionalised mechanism to guide the government on the partys priorities and programmes was appreciated by most leaders, the majority of them had felt Sonia would herself not have liked to head it after the embarrassing experience caused by the office-of-profit controversy.         
	They now attach great significance to her decision to return as the NAC chief and believe there is more to it than the necessity to give some teeth to the advisory body by lending her name. Many leaders view her move as a response to the inadequate sensitivity shown by the government towards the partys demands.         
	One senior leader told The Telegraph on condition of anonymity: There is no denying the fact that the government was beginning to function more independently and many specific suggestions, both at the policy and operational levels, had been ignored. The Prime Minister and a few senior ministers had found ways to politely decline the partys demands. We felt the need for a mechanism to mount greater pressure on the government without generating political controversies.        
	The leaders supporting the rebirth of the NAC vehemently deny that its role will be confrontational, or that Sonia is plotting to rein in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Despite conceding that the party understands the need for a more effective influence on the government, they say Sonia wants a constructive engagement, and that the NACs role is to facilitate that without misunderstanding and confusion.         
	This move is not anti-PM or anti-government but it is certainly going to be a major factor in policy-making, one Congress functionary said.        
	Asked about the councils revival under Sonia, Singh said on Wednesday that it would bring a new dimension to his governments working by providing very important inputs impacting civil society and people.        
	There is a feeling in the party that the views of the civil society, expressed through the NAC, had played a positive role in generating new ideas for the government. Some path-breaking legislation, such as the RTI (information act) and NREGA (rural job scheme), are perceived as manifestations of that process.        
	Some leaders feel the Congress Working Committee or other party forums at times fail to make meaningful contributions on new challenges and complex non-political issues. The party will like to guide the government on the contours of some new legislation, such as the bills on food safety, green tribunal, judges accountability and allowing foreign universities.         
	The scope and the reach of the NAC is going to be wider this time. Apart from social sector concerns, issues related to foreign affairs, domestic politics and economy will be taken up.

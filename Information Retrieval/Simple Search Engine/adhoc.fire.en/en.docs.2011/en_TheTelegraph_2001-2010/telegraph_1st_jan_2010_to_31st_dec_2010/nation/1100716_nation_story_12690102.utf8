The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mulayam sorry for Kalyan tie
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mulayam sorry for Kalyan tie
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Mulayam Singh Yadav    
	Lucknow, July 15: Mulayam Singh Yadav today apologised to Muslims for joining hands with one-time Ayodhya hardliner Kalyan Singh during the 2009 general election, vowing not to repeat the mistake in the future.        
	In a signed statement, the Samajwadi Party chief said he had associated himself with some wrong political elements to stop communal forces from coming to power at the Centre, hurting the sentiments of Muslims and causing confusion about his secular credentials.        
	I tender my apology to all, specially to my Muslim brothers. I want to assure them that I will not make any mistake like this in future and re-dedicate myself to protect their honour and work for their welfare, Mulayam said.        
	Without referring to Kalyan by name, he iterated: Looking back, I now think it was my own mistake. I am not going to repeat this mistake.        
	Muslim clerics, however, refused to buy his apology, saying mere words were not enough. Zafaryab Jilani, the Babri Masjid Action Committee convener, said: Muslims will be convinced only if Mulayam acts on what he has promised.        
	This is the first time Mulayam has apologised to the minorities, who were outraged by his decision to align with Kalyan in January 2009 to pocket the Lodh votes in western Uttar Pradesh. He won two seats there, but lost several Muslim-dominated ones in the bargain, including Ferozabad that has an over 40 per cent minority population.        
	Muslims account for 17 per cent of the votes in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Sources said the immediate trigger for the apology was his son and state Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadavs suggestion that minorities had lost faith in the party and they needed to be wooed back ahead of the 2012 Uttar Pradesh elections.        
	Akhilesh had recently travelled to various parts of the state and addressed rallies. Sources said he grew uneasy after finding that the minorities by and large avoided his rallies.        
	A subsidiary reason was Mulayams former aide Amar Singhs statements at various rallies that the 2009 compromise with Kalyan was entirely the Samajwadi chiefs decision. The two fell out this February.        
	Mulayam himself recently met Muslim leaders who told him they feared he had lost minority support. Although Mulayam snapped ties with Kalyan late in 2009, the minorities have not forgotten his link-up with Kalyan, popularly known as the Ayodhya face of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Attempting to make amends, Mulayam said in the statement: My life is an open book on the struggle for secular values. As chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1990, I ensured that no harm was caused to Babri mosque. But on December 6, 1992, when the BJP government was in power, the mosque was demolished.        
	Kalyan, now the chief of the Jan Kranti Party, said Mulayams apology was a desperate attempt to make necessary repairs to his fake ideology.        
	He claimed Mulayam owed an apology to the backward classes because he had betrayed them as well. Mulayam also had the habit of ditching people he tied up with, the latest casualty being Amar Singh, he added.        
	There is a long history of Mulayam back-stabbing others. How many apologies can you make in your career? Kalyan said from Aligarh.

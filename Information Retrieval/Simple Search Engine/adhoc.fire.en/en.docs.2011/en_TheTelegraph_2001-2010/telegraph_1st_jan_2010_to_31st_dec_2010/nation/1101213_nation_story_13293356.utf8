	Islamabad, Dec. 12 (PTI): A Pakistani news agency has sacked an editor for fabricating a fake story after publishing a report based on fake US diplomatic cables with anti-India rhetoric.         
	Siddique Sajid, an editor at Online news agency, was fired after an internal inquiry found that he had solely misused his authority in the absence of the news agencys editor-in-chief by fabricating a false story on a highly sensitive subject such as the WikiLeaks disclosure, said the agencys website.         
	The Express Tribune, a partner of the International Herald Tribune, and The News published apologies after carrying the report, based on cables it said had been released from the US embassy in New Delhi.

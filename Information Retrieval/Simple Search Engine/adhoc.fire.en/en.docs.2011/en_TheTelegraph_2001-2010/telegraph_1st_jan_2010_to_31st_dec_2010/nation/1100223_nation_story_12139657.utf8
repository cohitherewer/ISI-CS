	Patna, Feb. 22: The row over Assembly Speaker Udainarayan Choudhary attending the maha-Dalit ekta rally yesterday gained steam with the Opposition demanding his resignation and chief minister Nitish Kumar countering the attack today.        
	The Leader of Opposition, Rabri Devi, on the first day of the budget session today, called on the Speaker in the latters chamber and said: You should feel ashamed of your action and step down from the Speakers post.        
	Choudhary had yesterday addressed the maha-Dalit ekta rally and raised slogans in favour of Nitish.        
	However, Nitish clarified that there was nothing wrong with the Speaker attending the rally. It was not a political partys rally. The maha-Dalits had organised it to show their unity, in which the Speaker, others from their community holding respectable positions and I were invited, Nitish said, adding: We were fortunate that we had been invited by the maha-Dalits.        
	He described the hue and cry raised by the Opposition as their jealousy over the maha-Dalits uniting and benefiting.        
	Earlier, as Governor D. Konwar began reading his speech to the joint session of the states bicameral legislature, the Opposition members, too, rose from their seats reading their parallel speeches, creating a ruckus. Sensing that the disorder in the House would not end, the governor left it within five minutes without completing his speech.        
	Earlier, RJD chief Lalu Prasad, too, lashed out at the Speaker, demanding his immediate sacking.        
	Can a Speaker address a political gathering and shout chief minister jindabad? Lalu asked, adding: The Speaker has made a mockery of parliamentary decorum.        
	Lalu said: The dignity of democracy has suffered. Choudhary has brought a bad name to the state by shouting slogans in favour of the chief minister in an open forum.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nisha after her arrest in Delhi                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: A young Calcutta woman accused of being a close confidante of Aftab Ansari, the mastermind of the attack outside the American Center in 2002 that killed six policemen, has been arrested for allegedly peddling fake herbal products.        
	Nisha, 28, an Indian Mujahideen operative, had been peddling the fake make-up material with a group of Nigerians in Delhi for the last one year.        
	Nisha had been arrested under the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act in 2001 and had spent seven years in jail.        
	A student of Loreto Convent, Entally, Nisha claimed she was not in touch with Ansari, whose death sentence had been upheld by Calcutta High Court earlier this month.         
	Delhi police sources said Nisha could be interrogated for her possible links with Indian Mujahideen modules suspected to have played a role in last weeks blast at Punes German Bakery.        
	Nisha had been putting up with her Nigerian companions in Delhi after being released from jail in 2008. She had been allegedly involved in various fraudulent activities, using fictitious names like Mrs Khanna and Mrs Nisha.         
	The police said Nisha had worked with some advocates in the Patiala house courts in the capital after her release and could have come in contact with the Nigerians during her stint there.        
	The police said the accused had been using Okbono, a substance used in Africa to make soups, to prepare the fake herbal products. Okbono is available in Delhi markets for Rs 100 a packet.        
	The Indian Mujahideen is known for recruiting convent-educated people like Nisha from metros.         
	The outfits founder, Amir Reza Khan, is from Calcutta.         
	However, it is not clear if Nisha still had ties with any Indian Mujahideen module.        
	Home ministry sources had earlier said the Pune attack could be in retaliation of Ansaris death sentence, pronounced two days before the attack.

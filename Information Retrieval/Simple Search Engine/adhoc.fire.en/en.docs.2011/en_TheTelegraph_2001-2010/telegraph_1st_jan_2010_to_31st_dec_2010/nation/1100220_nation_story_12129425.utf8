	Chandigarh, Feb. 19: Angry shopkeepers in Amritsar tonight burnt over two dozen two-wheelers belonging to protesters who they said had looted their outlets while demonstrating against the publication of an objectionable picture of Jesus Christ in a daily.        
	The picture was the same as printed in a school textbook prescribed for primary classes in Shillong.        
	The protesters fled when they were outnumbered by locals. Their motorcycles which they had left behind were then set ablaze.

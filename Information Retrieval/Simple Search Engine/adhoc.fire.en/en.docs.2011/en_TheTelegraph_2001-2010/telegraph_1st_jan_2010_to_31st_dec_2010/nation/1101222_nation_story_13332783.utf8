	Cuttack, Dec. 21: Siblings Radha Das, 20, and Ajay Das, 23, were arrested and produced before a court here yesterday for circulating a picture of Radhas friend bathing via multimedia messages.         
	The 22-year-old had been shocked to find the picture, taken some time ago by Radha with her consent, appear on cellphones around Cuttack.        
	On a complaint filed by her father, the brother and sister were charged under Sections 294 (obscene acts and songs) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Police said the accused had threatened the girls family.         
	Radha was released on a personal bond while Ajay, accused of circulating the picture, was sent to jail.         
	Sources said the victim, a second-year student, and her friend live in the same neighbourhood which comes under Puri Ghat police. The siblings discontinued their studies because of financial problems.         
	It is suspected that Ajay had got hold of Radhas phone and downloaded the picture on to his own.        
	The city has seen a spurt in cases of obscene multimedia messages and pornographic CDs featuring local girls.         
	Last month, four persons were arrested for circulating an obscene multimedia message. Umakant Pani alias Tulu, a 30-year-old autorickshaw driver, recorded his encounters with a woman and circulated them. He and his three associates were booked under the Indecent Representation of Woman (Prohibition) Act, 1986.         
	Earlier, a mass communication student committed suicide in the Khannagar area after a pornographic CD featuring her hit the market in August 2008. An engineering student identified as Astaranga Sahoo was arrested.        
	A pornographic filmmaking racket was busted in April following the arrest of one person in the Bidanasi area.         
	In Bhubaneswar, 24 minor girls were rescued from an orphanage in the Chandrasekharpur area last September and one person was arrested and some computers and cameras seized.

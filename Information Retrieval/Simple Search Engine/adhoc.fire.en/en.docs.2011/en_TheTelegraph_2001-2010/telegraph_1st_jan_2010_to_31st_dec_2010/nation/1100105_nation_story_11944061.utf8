          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    Gill (top), Rathore                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Awarded police officers indicted for moral turpitude will be stripped of their medals, and the list may include former Punjab super cop K.P.S. Gill.        
	The Union home ministry today decided to take away the Presidents medal of former Haryana director-general of police S.P.S. Rathore.        
	Other officers convicted of moral turpitude or sacked from state or central police forces too will lose their medals. Moral turpitude will include corruption, molestation, rape, murder or any other criminal offence.        
	Gill was convicted of outraging the modesty of IAS officer Rupan Deol Bajaj in July 1988 but the former Punjab police chief still carries his several medals. The Supreme Court had convicted him and ordered him to pay Rs 2 lakh to Bajaj as damages and Rs 50,000 as costs. The Rathore case  he has been found guilty of molesting teenager Ruchika Girhotra who later committed suicide  has brought the glare back on Gill.        
	The home ministry will be authorised to move for withdrawal of any police medal, home secretary G.K. Pillai said. He added that the authorisation would cover any case where it had been established that an officer had brought the force into disrepute.        
	In a departure from convention, the central police medals awards committee has authorised the home secretary to decide on recommending the withdrawal of medals conferred on tainted policemen. Till now, the committee used to recommend the grant as well as withdrawal of medals.        
	Sources said the medals awarded to Gill were under the scanner, but the final decision had not been taken.        
	Police medals are handed over on Independence Day and Republic Day by the President. Pillai will make the recommendations to the President, after which Rashtrapati Bhavan is expected to withdraw the medals awarded to the tainted personnel.        
	Home ministry sources said the medals given to Haryana officer R.K. Sharma, the murderer of journalist Shivani Bhatnagar, would also be withdrawn. Sharma used to be Rathores neighbour in Panchkula.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 6: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said he took immediate steps after learning about the attack on journalists in West Midnapore, making the first such statement in public three days after the assault by CPM activists.        
	 As soon as I came to know about the attack on journalists, I immediately took steps. Police have already taken action, the chief minister said at Writers Buildings.        
	Over three hours after the attack on Friday, the chief minister had said he did not know (jani na).        
	On Saturday, the police arrested three CPM activists in connection with the attack but were unable to find the two local party leaders named in the FIR: Pirakata local committee secretary Madhusudan Mahato and local committee member Jagannath Mahato.        
	Police sources said the duo were hiding in camps the CPM had set up after recapturing the area from Maoists.        
	According to information available with us, Madhusudan is staying at the CPM camp at Kalshibhanga and Jagannath is staying at the camp in Pathri. We went to the two villages searching for them more than once, an officer said. But CPM supporters are guarding these villages. They alert their leaders before our raids and they go into hiding.        
	We are trying to arrest Madhusudan and Jagannath, West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said. We have also got some more names and are conducting raids in search of them. The case is being supervised by an officer of deputy superintendent rank.        
	The seven journalists, who were attacked with iron rods and sticks, included The Telegraphs principal correspondent Pronab Mondal and the newspapers photographer Amit Datta.

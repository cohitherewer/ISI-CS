          CITHARA PAUL                          A physically challenged beggar in his wheelchair in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 10: Fast forward to a not too distant future when you might look and look but not spot a single beggar on the streets of India.        
	No, the poor and the homeless arent going to be swept off the streets in a Mao-type clean-up in early communist China or rounded up and dumped along the borders as in the Poland of the nineties. The Centre has come up with a more benign, albeit a more ambitious, plan than that.        
	The Centre is drawing up a massive scheme to rehabilitate beggars and is in the process of creating a national database. The social justice ministry, which is handling the project, has asked all states to create individual databases.        
	We are considering a rehabilitation package for beggars and have asked all states to furnish details on beggars. We have also sought states suggestions on the legal and administrative framework needed to tackle the problem, a ministry official said.        
	The rehabilitation package would include vocational training and housing schemes for the beggars. The Centre will draft a model legislation that states can adapt to their needs, he said.        
	Asked what the definition of a beggar was, the official said anyone who stretches his hand before others for a living would be counted as one.        
	The Centre plans to involve institutions at various levels in the project. The states, urban and rural local bodies and panchayati raj institutions will be made part of the project. NGOs also will have a role, he said.         
	The official said the government was aware of organised begging rackets and planned to handle it as part of the project. We are aware of the complexities involved. We will have to take a multi-pronged approach, he said.        
	To begin with, the government would provide community shelters to the urban homeless, the official said. Another proposal is to channel the donations made to temples and other religious places through NGOs. According to unofficial records, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore have the highest number of beggars, but large numbers among them belong to Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.

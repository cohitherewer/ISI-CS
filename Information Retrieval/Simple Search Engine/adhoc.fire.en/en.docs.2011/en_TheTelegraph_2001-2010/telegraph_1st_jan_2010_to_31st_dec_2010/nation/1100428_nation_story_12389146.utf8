The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Untouchable tag sticks to BJP 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Untouchable tag sticks to BJP 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sushma Swaraj                                  
	New Delhi, April 27: The BJPs attempt to discard the untouchability stigma and integrate itself with the non-Congress Opposition ended today.        
	The Left and the broader coalition it led did not vote for the cut motion sponsored by Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj, while the BSP declared it would support the ruling UPA to keep the communal forces out.        
	At a time the BJP is down, especially in Uttar Pradesh where it has trailed the Congress in recent elections, the question was: Why was the secular-communal breach relevant to the non-Congress parties which had seemed set to take on the Centre on food inflation and other issues when the budget session began?        
	For the BJP, the answer lay in the governments alleged propensity to corner vulnerable leaders, dig the dirt on them and ferret out old cases.        
	A BJP leader insisted that communalism and secularism were fig leaves for the vulnerable leaders to cover their sense of helplessness and for the government to buy temporary peace with them by deal-making.        
	For Lalu Prasad, however, the problem was that the BJP was unprepared to go the whole hog to confront the government on price rise and, therefore, not competent to spearhead a movement. They (the BJP) said they will gherao Parliament. But their party president (Nitin Gadkari) fainted (after a rally last week) before they were anywhere close to Parliament. Why should we be seen with such a party? the RJD chief said.        
	But the BJPs Arun Jaitley, Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha, alleged that for the last six years the UPA had used the CBI as a political instrument for its survival by keeping the Damocles sword hanging on the heads of certain vulnerable Opposition leaders, particularly those belonging to the BSP, Samajwadi and the RJD. The heat on a case, Jaitley said, is increased or reduced depending on the pressure required to be exerted on these leaders when a bailout of the government is necessary.        
	The charge was partially corroborated by a Congress minister who admitted that the time-tested tactic was also deployed by the NDA when it was in power against Mayavati and Mulayam Singh Yadav.         
	The BJPs only consolation today was that it managed to keep the 153-member NDA intact, despite the rumours that the Janata Dal (United) was about to split into Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumars loyalists.         
	Sushma claimed she was not surprised by the turn of events, when Mulayam and Lalu Prasad tipped over. The SP, BSP and the RJD never withdrew their letters of support. But they owe an explanation to people on why they backed the government on price rise inside the House and why they agitated outside, she said.

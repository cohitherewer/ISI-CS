                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sleuths to question former minister
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                      A. Raja                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is planning to question former telecom minister A. Raja and some officials of his erstwhile department to verify information thrown up by the quiz of lobbyist Niira Radia.        
	We have found some discrepancies relating to the transaction of Radias companies with some telecom companies. We will soon question A. Raja and some DoT officials who were close to him, an ED official said on Thursday.         
	The directorate has launched an investigation to ascertain if there was any violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in the sale of spectrum in 2008.         
	The ED will also issue summons to telecom companies involved in the case. We are preparing the list of people to be summoned, the official added.         
	Officials said they had recorded the statements of representatives of two telecom companies but wanted to examine all the seven companies alleged to be involved. The two companies submitted over 3,000 pages of documents which are being examined, the official added.         
	The directorate has sought from the CBI the files and other papers the bureau had found during raids last year.        
	ED officials today examined the bank transaction details provided by Radia, who was questioned yesterday. We need more documents from her to find out the mode of payment between her firms and telecom companies, an official said.

  - Flung off centre stage, Geelani tests waters as protesters vow no let-up in violence         SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           A Kashmiri protester shouts slogans atop a burning government vehicle in Srinagar on Wednesday. (AP)                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelanis appeal to end violence in the Valley may be aimed less at peace, more at self-preservation.        
	For long the unchallenged protagonist of Kashmiri separatism, Geelani has found himself flung off centre stage by the current tide sweeping Kashmir; todays appeal could be his way of testing where he stands with street mobs that have heeded no call for restraint.         
	Counselling peaceful protests, Geelani who returned home to Hyderpora on the outskirts of Srinagar today after his formal release two days ago, said: We should be seen as oppressed and not oppressors. I want people to march peacefully and wherever they are stopped, they should sit down and ask them to shoot us by indulging in acts of arson we are harming our own cause.         
	Geelanis call came as Kashmir remained under curfew for the sixth consecutive day and an injured youth, Iqbal Ahmed Khan, succumbed to injuries at a local hospital.         
	Shortly after his appeal, Geelani was face to face with an irate crowd at Iqbals cremation. They were visibly upset over Geelanis stand and shouted slogans like saudebaazi nahin chalegi (you cant indulge in political trading).         
	Geelanis followers threw a ring around him but the separatist spearhead was disallowed his wish to lead Iqbals final prayers.         
	One man, Mohammad Yaqoob, was killed in firing by security forces in Srinagar this evening, taking the toll to 46 in seven weeks of almost uninterrupted violence across the Valley.         
	Perhaps the more significant part of what Geelani said today was not that people should abjure violence; it was that they should continue to strongly heed directives being issued by his underground protg Masarat Alam on the course of the Quit Kashmir Movement.         
	A little-known former militant, Alam has deftly ridden the current wave and positioned himself as arrowhead of the angry agitation. It is he who has been issuing weekly protest calendars  released on CDs and obediently publicised by the local media  from which the Kashmiri street has been taking its cue.        
	Alams efforts have been endorsed and egged on by another underground separatist, Aasiya Andrabi of the Dukhtaran-e-Millat.         
	Alam and Andrabi both remain silent on Geelanis plea for peace and it remains to be seen whether the elder statesman of Kashmiri separatism can prevail upon his more firebrand and aggressive pupils. It is an even longer shot to speculate whether the government can draw solace from what Geelani had to say.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram renewed his entreaty for peace, promising movement on addressing genuine grievances and development needs once the current cycle of violence has ebbed. But nobody in Kashmir is betting he  or Geelani  will be heard in the violent clamour that grips the Valley.         
	Geelanis hopes of being heard and followed may be hinged on two factors: one, the introspective month of Ramazan is approaching and two, there is deep and widespread weariness with the protracted disruption.         
	All public and private institutions have been shut, essential amenities have become a daily scarcity.        
	Life across the Valley lies paralysed, and his appeal for calm, Geelani senses, may just strike a popular chord. But many remain unsure. Hardline sections in the Hurriyat, particularly the younger elements, have been recalling the sudden collapse of the aazaadi surge of 2008 and saying they will not repeat the mistake of taking a Ramazan break and letting the momentum die.        
	We are once again at a now-or-never stage in our struggle and we shall allow no let-up, one of them told The Telegraph on phone from Srinagar. There is deep anger, and it will not go away just because someone is asking us to suddenly become calm. We cannot be calm when we are carrying our dead to graveyards every day.         
	There are those who even doubt Alams ability to control inflamed street sentiment and order mobs off violent methods. They might have played a role in unleashing this tide but it has slipped out of their grasp now, said a senior National Conference leader. The crowds are leading the agenda now, the so-called leaders will have to follow.        
	He recalled how a recent call by Pakistan-based Hizb-ul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin for restraint had been greeted with rage by youths in Sopore and Baramulla in north Kashmir. In both places, effigies of Salahuddin were publicly burnt. by boys shouting slogans to the effect that the Kashmiri people did not have to seek directions from Pakistan on how to conduct their freedom struggle.         
	Even as Geelani spoke today, Kashmir saw sporadic violence, though on a lowered scale. Thousands defied curfew in Pampore and Khrew in south Kashmir, where nine persons have died during the present unrest. Police said a vehicle of the Indian Reserve Polices 9th battalion was damaged in Pampore and another security vehicle was set afire in the Qamarwari neighbourhood of downtown Srinagar.        
	In Shopian, a police spokesperson said, a mob set ablaze two buildings of the Forest Protection Force in addition to a police Gypsy.        
	Shortly after his appeal Geelani was face to face with an irate crowd at the cremation of Iqbal Ahmed Khan in the Chhanpora locality of Srinagar. They were visibly upset over Geelanis stand and shouted slogans like quot;saudebaazi nahin chalegi quot; (you cant indulge in political trading). Geelanis personal followers threw a ring around him and prevented an uglier scene but the separatis spearhead was disallowed his wish to lead Iqbals final prayers.

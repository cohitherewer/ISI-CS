	New Delhi, March 25: Defying western sanctions and a UN resolution, India is preparing to welcome a member of Yangons military junta next weekend and is quietly re-equipping the neighbours navy, sources in the defence ministry told The Telegraph here today.        
	Myanmar conveyed its request to India for inshore and offshore patrol boats during a visit by its navy chief, Vice-Admiral Nyan Tun, in the last week of February.        
	Now Lt Gen Thar Aye, a member of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)  the official name of the military regime in Yangon  is scheduled for a visit to India starting with a briefing at the Eastern Command headquarters in Fort William, Calcutta.        
	Myanmar has asked for an unspecified number  running into tens  of fast inshore boats and interceptors to patrol its rivers and deltas. These boats are of the type used mostly by the Indian Coast Guard.        
	Designed on the British Archer class boats and armed with 12.7mm machine guns, India has leased such a vessel to Mauritius. The boat was made at a shipyard in Goa.        
	Cyclone Nargis took a heavy toll on the Myanmar Navys ageing inventory last year. It lost more than 20 vessels and an unknown number of sailors. Most of the Myanmarese navy vessels are of American and Chinese origin.        
	Indian military supplies to Myanmar rankled the European Union, the US and the UK. The UK, in particular, had objected to the transfer of two British-origin BN 2 Islander surveillance aircraft to Myanmar in 2006 and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown had brought up the subject in talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last year.        
	Despite the objections on Myanmars human rights record  opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi continues to be confined  India has steadily sought to improve relations with Myanmar for three important reasons: first, India is wary of the strategic space that China is winning in Myanmar; second, India wants Myanmar to help in tackling insurgents in its Northeast who operate from across the 1,643km-long border and, third, New Delhi is interested in gas supplies from Myanmar.        
	The visit of the junta member, Lt Gen Thar Aye, who is the commander of the Myanmar armys Bureau of Special Operations, is of immediate interest in the Northeast. Part of the generals responsibility covers the division in Myanmars Sagaing where Naga militant leader S.S. Khaplang, who heads his own National Socialist Council of Nagaland, is suspected to be based. New Delhi is in talks with the rival NSCN led by Isaac Chi Si Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.        
	In January, home secretary G.K. Pillai visited Naypyidaw, the juntas capital. That was preceded by a visit by the army chief, Gen Deepak Kapoor, in October 2009.        
	In Calcutta, Lt Gen Thar Aye is scheduled to meet Lt Gen Bikram Singh, on April 5. Lt Gen Bikram Singh is slated to take over as the eastern army commander on March 31 from Lt Gen V.K. Singh who will take over as the army chief on that day.        
	India has supplied field guns and light artillery to Myanmar, overriding western protests, since 2004. It is training Myanmarese military personnel at INS Garuda in Kochi.

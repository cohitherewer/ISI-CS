          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 25: Workers belonging to a Trinamul Congress-led union went on an indefinite strike at Hindustan Unilevers detergent unit in Haldia today, the first such action by the party in Bengals biggest industrial town where CPM labour arm Citu has long held sway.        
	The workers owing allegiance to the Trinamul union, led by local party MP Subhendu Adhikari, were demanding reinstatement of four colleagues sacked for refusing to obey transfer orders. The protesters alleged the four had been shifted at the behest of the dominant Citu-led union after they weaned many workers away.        
	Trinamul started making inroads into Haldia after the CPMs debacle in the 2008 rural polls.         
	Trinamul formed its union at the Hindustan Unilever plant in April last year and of its 200 permanent workers, 138 joined it. But Citu enjoys a majority as it commands the loyalty of all 150 casual workers and 62 permanent ones.        
	Six permanent workers who had joined the Trinamul-led union at the unit were transferred to Khalilabad in Uttar Pradesh last year.        
	Two of them joined in Khalilabad. But four others refused to go and were sacked. The management transferred (them) pressured by Citu because they had played an important role in getting so many members to the Trinamul union, said Mrinal Pal, the general secretary of the Trinamul-led union.        
	The union has demanded that the four workers be reinstated in Haldia and the two who have been working in Khalilabad be brought back.         
	 In these 30 years, they (Citu unions) have not looked after the interest of the workers. Now the workers want their dignity back and so they are joining Trinamul unions, said Adhikari, the Trinamul unions president and the local MP who defeated Citu strongman Lakshman Seth in the Lok Sabha polls last year.        
	Local Citu leader Nihar Mondal said the decision to transfer the six workers had been taken by the management.        
	The Hindustan Unilever management was said to be holding negotiations with local Trinamul leaders to break the deadlock.        
	 We dont want to comment on the issue, a company spokesperson said.

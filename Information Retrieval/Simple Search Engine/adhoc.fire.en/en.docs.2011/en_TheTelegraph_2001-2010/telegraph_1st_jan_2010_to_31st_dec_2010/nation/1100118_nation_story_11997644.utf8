The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strange bedfellows who could not cohabit
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Strange bedfellows who could not cohabit
                                        Basu with Advani       
	The BJPs relationship with the Left parties did not start on a propitious note. In the early seventies, when the late Jayaprakash Narayan sought to bring all anti-Congress forces on a common platform, he invited the Jana Sangh (the BJPs precursor) to join his movement but only after dispelling the doubts he had about the party and its parent, the RSS, which was implicated in Mahatma Gandhis assassination.        
	BJP leader L.K. Advani wrote in his book, My Country My Life, that what tipped the decision for Narayan was idealism, which he deemed more important than ideology in politics.         
	The CPM and the CPI reacted sharply to Narayans proposal for different reasons, according to Advani. the CPM had some differences with the ruling party as it was pitted against the Congress in both West Bengal and Kerala. But when it, too, criticised Jayaprakashji for including the Jana Sangh in his broad front for political renewal in India, it became obvious that the CPM was more concerned about the Jana Sangh than about the Congress, wrote Advani.        
	Advanis footnotes in the pages that carried these excerpts listed his favourites in the Left: CPM leader A.K. Gopalan, who had developed much admiration for the Jana Sanghs spirited resistance to the Emergency, Hiren Mukherjee of the CPI and Tridib Chaudhury of the RSP. He did not mention Jyoti Basu.        
	The absence encapsulated the dynamics of the BJP-Left equation. They made common cause twice against the Congress without soul or substance.         
	There was no glue that fastened the BJP to the Left  only expediency cloaked as anti-Congressism. They were strange bedfellows who refused to cohabit. If Basu treated the BJP with contempt and suspicion, Advani wondered with naivete what on earth caused him to do it.        
	When the National Front-Left Front coalition came into being in 1989, Advani recalled the late Prime Minister V.P. Singhs dinner diplomacy on Tuesdays with Harkishen Singh Surjeet, Indrajit Gupta (CPI), Atal Bihari Vajpayee and him. Basu was invited when he was in Delhi. The government was supported by the Left and the BJP.         
	Advani remembered Gupta with warmth and the CPM leaders with distaste.        
	He recounted that six months after the government was formed, Basu sent a message asking him and Vajpayee to discuss the dispensations faulty functioning over dinner at Viren Shahs house. Shah, an industrialist, was a BJP office-bearer and an acquaintance of Basu. Under NDA rule, he became Bengal governor with the enthusiastic concurrence of Basu.         
	Advani said that while he and Vajpayee warmed up to the idea, they asked why they should not come down to Calcutta to dine with Basu or why he should not come over to their homes in the capital. But we dont understand why we should meet at some other place, wrote Advani. Basus prompt response apparently was: No one should know about our meeting. Especially, people in my party would not like it.        
	The dinner took place but Advani saw Basus reaction as yet another instance of the hypocritical outlook and conduct of the communists, especially those belonging to the CPM.        
	It was practised in Parliament. The BJP and the Left would agree to a co-ordinated strategy to oppose the Congress but, said Advani, Left MPs would insist on meeting their BJP counterparts in the Parliament lobby and not in their offices.         
	Surendra Mohan, an erstwhile Janata Dal ideologue and strategist, corrected Advanis account and maintained that V.P. Singhs uncanny grasp of the Left-BJP unease caused him to date their leaders separately over dinner. He knew it was an unhappy co-existence. He, too, disliked the BJP but accepted their backing because of realpolitik. The BJP was part of the Haryana and Andhra governments headed by Devi Lal and N.T. Rama Rao and both were crucial to his governments existence, said Mohan.        
	Advanis irritation, verging on helplessness, with Basu came across in another instance. He praised Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for being upfront on the ISIs presence in Bengal when the BJP leader was home minister. Bhattacharjee asked him why he did not mention Bengal when he spoke of the ISIs activities in the other states. I do not mention it publicly because I have generally feared that if I do, you may deny it, he told the chief minister.        
	Bhattacharjee, rather forcefully, said there was no question of denying it. Advani contrasted Bhattacharjees frankness with Basus strong protests against the deportation of illegal Bangladesh immigrants from Maharashtra in 1998 by the BJP-Shiv Sena government.        
	All in all, the Basu governments obstructionist attitude was an eye-opener for me on how difficult, almost impossible, it is for India to deport Bangladeshi infiltrators, according to Advani.        
	So how would Advani have taken Basu as Prime Minister had the CPM not committed its historic blunder in 1996? His verdict: Without going into the merits of the CPMs decision, I must confess that I was impressed by it on two counts  firstly, the party displayed the courage to stick to its own principles even when prime ministership was offered to it on a platter; and, secondly, the discipline that marked the inner working of its highest decision-making body.        
	History testifies how the BJP and Advani failed on both counts.         
	No wonder BJP ideologue K.N. Govindacharya, a mover and shaker in the Janata Dal days, said he would never forget the first and only meeting he had with Basu in 1990 along with Advani. I understood why he was so acceptable even to the non-Marxists. He knew how to perfectly balance pragmatism with idealism, said Govindacharya.

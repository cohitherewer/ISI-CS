The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Radioactive spill from Barc bottle 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Radioactive spill from Barc bottle 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, May 12: A liquid cocktail of radioactive metals flowed out and down the sides of a bottle in a Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) laboratory, exposing one person to radioactive contamination, but atomic energy officials today described the incident as minor.        
	The spill occurred on Tuesday when a person carried a set of bottles containing samples of radioactive solutions from one lab in the Barc complex in northeastern Mumbai to another, said a senior official of the department of atomic energy (DAE).        
	The incident involved minor contamination of the hands of a person who was involved in the transfer of samples in a sealed container from one laboratory to another for analysis, said Swapnesh Malhotra, head of the DAEs public awareness division.        
	He said the liquid on the sides of the bottle was detected by the person, who has not been identified, and other laboratory staff. Under the standard safety protocols, Malhotra said, experts used detergents and other liquids to decontaminate the hands as well as the laboratory where the incident had occurred.        
	The DAE has not identified the radioactive chemicals, but Malhotra said the liquid contained several radioactive meallic ions. The vial-sized bottles large enough to hold about 20ml liquid were being used to transfer samples from a laboratory associated with the spent fuel reprocessing division to the environmental assessment division laboratory.        
	The samples had low radioactivity levels which can be measured only in the laboratory, he said.        
	The laboratory has been adequately decontaminated and cleared for normal work, he said. Two other persons in the laboratory were tested and found to be free of contamination. The contamination has been traced to the sample container. The incident is of a very minor nature with no safety consequences, he said.         
	The incident comes days after some workers in the Mayapuri scrapyard in Delhi were exposed to radiation from scrapped pencils of Cobalt-60. One of the eight workers, 35-year-old Rajendra Yadav, died of multiple organ failure on April 26 after he suffered radiation poisoning.        
	Experts from the Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) then scanned Delhis markets before claiming that all Cobalt-60 pencils had been recovered and declared the markets free of radioactivity.        
	Last November, 45 to 50 employees working in the maintenance unit of the Kaiga nuclear power plant in north Karnataka were treated for possible contamination after they drank water from a cooler in the operating areas. They were treated for increased level of tritium. However, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) officials had claimed it was a mischief, not a case of security breach.        
	On December 8, depleted uranium was recovered from three people in Navi Mumbai which they had reportedly stolen from one of the nuclear establishments. In the same month, two young research scientists, Umang Singh from Mumbai and Pallava Bag from Calcutta, were killed in a fire in a chemistry laboratory in the Modular Laboratory building of Barc.        
	In November, two contractual workers were arrested when they made an attempt to steal computer parts from the Tarapur Atomic Power Station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bid to bury caste row
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bid to bury caste row
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Jan. 15: Even as state Congress leaders are gearing up for Rahul Gandhis visit later this month, the controversy over its executive committee list refuses to die.        
	The AICC general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs, Jagdish Tytler, landed here this afternoon apparently to step up the damage-control exercise caused by the state leaders in releasing the list of over 500 executive committee members which had Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and her caste, Chamar, mentioned against her name.        
	With a Dalit association lodging an FIR against Tytler and state Congress president, Anil Sharma, for hurting the sentiment of the Dalits by referring the caste of their community leaders, the Congress strategists are learnt to be finding out the ways to disassociate the leadership from the list.        
	Sources close to Tytler revealed that the party in the event of inquiry from the investigating agencies would simply disown the controversial list.         
	The sources also said that the party might dismiss the list as not an authoritative one and issue a fresh list of its executive committee members.        
	The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, who has already disassociated herself from the list and who reportedly admonished Tytler and Sharma for the foul play, is learnt to have asked Tytler to prepare the list of BPCC office-bearers afresh befitting to the ethics and constitution of the party.        
	In fact, Tytler, working hard to balance all ends, is understood to have won over some dissident leaders who were so far gunning for his (Tytlers) and Sharmas head.         
	It became evident when a senior dissident leader, Premchand Mishra, sided with Tytler when the latter arrived here today and told The Telegraph: The controversy should be given a rest and concentration should be to ensure the successful visit of Rahul.        
	Mishra said that the Nehru-Gandhi scion was scheduled to visit the state in the last week of the month. The date and time of his arrival here is being worked out, he said.         
	Rahul is said to be visiting Bihar to strengthen the Youth Congress and revive the partys strength in the run-up to the Assembly polls due in later this year.

  -   Sushma amp; chief dont sway flock
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Sushma Swaraj, LK Advani and BJP president Nitin Gadkari at the BJP rsquo;s meeting in Jammu on Thursday. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: On Saturday, when the BJP conducts its yearly ritual of celebrating Atal Bihari Vajpayees birthday  he turns 87  sans his presence, partymen from the second and third rungs of the organisational hierarchy will be swept with a sense of nostalgia and longing.         
	The feeling emanates from remembrances of his six years as Prime Minister and the longing arises from the admission that nobody has been able to take his place in the BJP.        
	The second feeling was reinforced at the NDAs rally in the capital yesterday. The dais was studded with a star cast from the BJP but nobody  not even Sushma Swaraj, whos billed as its most powerful orator after Vajpayee  could sway the crowds on corruption.         
	If this is the haalat (condition) in Delhi, what effect will our rallies have in other places? After all, Delhis the leader in opinion-making, said a party official.        
	The official said Vajpayee alone could have galvanised the crowds by using earthy idioms to drive home the corruption plank instead of tangling the discourse in legislative polemics over JPC or no JPC.         
	I remember when he slammed the Mulayam Singh Yadav government (in 1995) on law and order, he used examples from day-to-day life, of women feeling unsafe on the streets and people not sure of when the Samajwadi goons will forcibly usurp their homes. Once when he spoke out against price rise, his simple message was elect the BJP and you can have kheer made of pure cows milk everyday. People cheered, he recalled.        
	Insiders said the speeches brought home their fears that the BJP brass was increasingly getting disconnected from ground realities.         
	They have forgotten to speak the ordinary persons language. They sounded as though they were addressing a news conference or participating in a TV debate. Vajpayee was not a TV person, may be thats why he retained his connectivity with the aam aadmi, said one person.        
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari gingered his speech with allusions from commonplace problems. Lines such as daal mein kuch kala hai ya daal hi kaala hai? (is there something black in the lentils or are the lentils themselves black?) and the groom who is corrupt may be a Raja (a pun on A. Raja) but the baaratis (processionists) are corrupt Congressmen evoked no response.        
	A source said if Gadkari made no impact it is because despite being the chief, he does not have the aura or authority of Atalji. Everybody knows that he holds his office at the discretion and pleasure of the RSS. Its not as though he has struggled to earn his spurs.         
	Article 370        
	The BJP today renewed its demand for revocation of Article 370, which grants Kashmir special status, putting back on the agenda a pet theme cast aside because of coalition compulsions.

	Bangalore, Dec. 17 (PTI): Karnataka governor H.R. Bharadwaj today said chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa had failed to check illegal mining in the state and had been totally blind to corruption.        
	Illegal mining is still continuing. No action is taken by the government here, Bharadwaj, who had written to Yeddyurappa seeking a report, told reporters.        
	His comments were condemned by the BJP with its state unit president K.S. Eswarappa alleging the governor is behaving like an Opposition leader.

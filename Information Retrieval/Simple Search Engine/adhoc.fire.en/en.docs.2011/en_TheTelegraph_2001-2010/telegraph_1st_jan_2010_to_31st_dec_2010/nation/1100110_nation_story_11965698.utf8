The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | AMU probe awaits sanction
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AMU probe awaits sanction
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: A probe into allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor has stalled with the Presidents secretariat dithering over the reconstitution of an inquiry panel after an earlier team resigned because of internal differences.         
	Two months after the HRD ministry requested approval to constitute a fresh panel to probe the allegations against P.K. Abdul Azis, the Presidents secretariat is yet to grant sanction, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The delay in the probe  which was initiated following violent protests on the AMU campus against the vice-chancellor  has triggered fears of fresh tensions in the traditionally turbulent university.         
	A source in the Presidents secretariat, however, clarified there was no attempt at all to delay the probe.        
	AMU alumni bodies, the students union, and sections of the faculty and the universitys executive and academic councils have accused Azis of violating varsity statutes, a dictatorial style of functioning, corruption and mismanagement.         
	This year, a two-member probe panel was set up. It consisted of a retired high court judge and a former audits and accounts service officer. The probe was formally ordered by the President in her capacity as Visitor to all central universities.         
	But differences cropped up between the two panel members. One of the members indicated  in his approach to the inquiry  that he agreed with the initial arguments of the accused, while the other opposed the contentions.        
	Despite attempts by HRD minister Kapil Sibal to patch up the differences, the panel had to be dissolved in November. It left the government with two options  to end the inquiry or reconstitute the probe panel. We chose the latter because there is nothing that has emerged to suggest that a probe is unwarranted, a source said.         
	The HRD ministry in November asked the Presidents approval for a fresh probe. Her consent is essential for reconstituting a team for a probe sanctioned by the President in the first place. But the Presidents office has not got back to the ministry.

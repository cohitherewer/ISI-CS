The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt puts credible talks onus on Maoists 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt puts credible talks onus on Maoists 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The government has raised the bar for Maoists by asking for a direct and credible response to its offer for talks.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said: We have called upon the CPI (Maoist) to abjure violence and come for talks. I regret to say that there has been no direct and credible response to our offer of talks. He was inaugurating the annual conference of police chiefs here.        
	Sources said the government would rather have the CPI (Maoist) top rung respond than leaders like Kishan, who though among the top 10 is not one of the decision makers.        
	Kishanji would keep talking but it is when leaders like (general secretary) Ganapathi respond that the government may act, a source said.        
	Top Maoist leaders rarely talk, a fact that Chidambaram would know. The buzz about negotiations began when the home minister wrote to social activist Swami Agnivesh earlier this year to facilitate talks with Maoists. A few months down the line, Agnivesh said Chidambarams body language at one of the meetings was not positive. After Maoist spokesperson Azad was killed by police last month, in what the rebels claim was a fake encounter, Agnivesh demanded a judicial probe before talks.        
	Maoist sympathisers and the CPI (Maoist) itself have made veiled offers reflecting their willingness to talk, but subject to conditions. Chidambarams statement today suggests two things: one, that the government wants the Maoist top rung to respond and, two, that it would like a written response because of the trust deficit. The home minister had given a fax number for Maoists to communicate, to which Kishan had made public his cell number.        
	The security establishment does not believe the Maoists are keen on talks, considering the amount of money they collect through extortion. Almost Rs 1,400 crore is involved (annually) and they would not want to lose that, a government official said.        
	Home ministry sources said the government aims to reduce the Maoists bargaining chips by putting them under pressure. Environment minister Jairam Rameshs decision yesterday to veto Vedantas bauxite mining project has left the Maoists with less fodder in Orissa. The Maoists had used opposition to the Vedanta project that endangers the sensitive ecology of the Niyamgiri hills to win over tribals.

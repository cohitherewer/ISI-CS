	Lucknow, Oct. 1: An Indian Institute of Management is set to use the Ayodhya verdict in classrooms to expose budding managers to the art of resolving sensitive conflicts.        
	Some professors of the human resource management (HRM) group at the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIML), want to use the high court verdict for pedagogic purposes.        
	The verdict is an example of constrained optimisation. Students of management must learn this skill to be successful in their lives and I will surely use it in my lectures, said Pankaj Kumar, chairman, management development programme, IIML.         
	According to him, the verdict was a balanced attempt  which students of management are taught in the classrooms during lecture sessions on conflict management  to resolve a sensitive problem related to the emotions of millions of people.        
	Although Kumar admitted that questions were bound to emerge on the legal points, he laid stress on how the attempt at giving something to everybody minimised the chance of potential economic and social disaster.        
	Management text books refer to five approaches  competing or forcing, avoiding, compromising, collaborating or surrendering  to conflict resolution, explained Kumars colleague in the HRM team, Pushpendra Priyadarshi.        
	The verdict is not necessarily a win-win situation for everybody but all the parties involved in the case have got something. I want to use it as a case study in conflict resolution courses and focus on how compromise can be used as a tool, said the young professor who followed the judgment closely because of academic interest. Almost everybody on the sprawling IIML campus in Prabandh Nagar were tracking the developments at Room No. 21 of the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court.        
	People may have different reactions to the judgment, depending on their positions. But for someone involved in teaching management, it was a very intelligent solution to a complex problem, Priyadarshi added.        
	Some students on the campus echoed their professors and hailed the verdict for defusing tension that had cast a shadow on IIMLs annual cultural and sporting meet, Varchasva, which means aiming for superiority.        
	A lot of teams cancelled their participation because of the tense atmosphere in Lucknow. After the verdict, life seems to be normal, said Souvik Pal, a second-year student of postgraduate programme in management.        
	But the result-oriented business brains had some questions in their minds, too.        
	Abhisake Saha, also a second-year student, was eager to know the chances of implementation of the verdict, which ordered division of the disputed site in three equal parts among the Sunni board, the Hindus and the Nirmohi Akhara of Ayodhya.        
	Can this verdict end the conflict? The other question is what will the Supreme Court say, asked the budding manager during a lunch-time chat, at Fauzi Dhaba on the campus, with friend Souvik.        
	These questions were along expected lines, felt Priyadarshi while adding that it was nave to expect an immediate resolution of the conflict.        
	One has to look at the positive side. It seems there is solution and that is not necessarily fully loaded in any one communitys favour, he explained.

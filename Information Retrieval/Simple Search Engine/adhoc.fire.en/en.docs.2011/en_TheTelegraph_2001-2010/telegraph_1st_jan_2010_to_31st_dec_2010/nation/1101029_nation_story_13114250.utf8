	Ahmedabad, Oct. 28 (PTI): A man was today sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs 5,000 for raping his minor daughter.         
	His wife, who was charged with aiding and abetting the crime, has been acquitted for lack of evidence.        
	Bharat Rathods lawyer contended that the victim was of loose character but Judge P.A. Vaghela observed that this did not give anyone the right to rape his daughter. Rathod had raped his 15-year-old daughter last year at his residence in the presence of his wife.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Congress today gave guarded response to a question on the Prime Ministers suggestion that his government was more cohesive than that of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, revealing the partys uneasiness in dealing with issues related to the Nehru-Gandhi family.        
	In response to a question on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs comments to a group of editors on Monday, spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said today: Every Congress government has done its best for public welfare, according the requirements of that time. Making comparison is not correct.        
	Told that there are some suggestions that the Prime Minister had made a comparison, Ahmed said: The context in which the Prime Minister spoke should not be ignored but there is no need to make comparisons.        
	These are all Congress governments. In their time, all these governments worked well. It is not correct to say this government is good or that government is bad. The Prime Minister did not mean to say that any government was bad, Ahmed added.        
	Although Manmohans remark was made in a limited context of inter-ministerial harmony, some mischievous elements and ill-informed leaders have sought to shape the discourse in a manner that suggests the present Prime Minister was projecting himself as better than Nehru and Indira.         
	Following the innuendoes, the party called for the transcript of the interaction between the Prime Minister and the editors and analysed it.        
	Having gone through the transcript, senior leaders have dismissed suggestions of any comparison but some middle-rung leaders have been trying to cite the comments as evidence of rift within the Congress leadership.        
	Ahmed described Manmohan as a very effective and competent Prime Minister, dismissing reports of any differences between him and party chief Sonia Gandhi on environment and development.        
	There is no difference between the two... between what the Prime Minister said and what the Congress president said the party line is striking a balance between environment and development, the spokesperson said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fake notes with Pak stamp
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fake notes with Pak stamp

	New Delhi, Nov. 15: Recent seizures in Bengal of fake Indian notes printed on official Pakistani currency paper have opened up a new front in New Delhis battle to corner Islamabad over terror funding, home ministry sources said.        
	They said the government would approach an international forum, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), this week with this evidence of Islamabads involvement in printing fake Indian notes. Pakistani currency paper is meant only for use by that countrys government to print its own notes.        
	The FATF is an inter-governmental body that develops policies to combat money-laundering and terror financing, and counts India but not Pakistan among its 34 member countries. A ministry official acknowledged that the FATF had no punitive powers but added that India planned to request the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to put pressure on Pakistan.        
	The CBI has arrested seven petty criminals from Bengal and seized Rs 1 crore in fake currency that bears the stamp of Pakistani printing machines, sources said. Each such German-made machine costs Rs 14-21 crore, ruling out the possibility of small-time criminals setting up a facility, an official said.        
	According to the sources, the forensic report on these fake notes says: Use of similar security fibre, printing process and printing pattern indicate the notes are printed on highly sophisticated paper.... This cannot have been done by non-state actors.

	Jaipur, Oct. 25: Singer Katy Perry and actor husband Russell Brand, enamoured of everything Indian after their lavish Rajasthan wedding, today got a taste of Indian mismanagement too.        
	Their helicopter was recalled mid-flight this afternoon because the star couples Indian tour operators had not taken the authorities permission to fly.        
	Sources in Ranthambhore said the couple and some friends had taken off from the Chakchainpura airstrip but were recalled after being airborne for about 15-20 minutes.        
	Brand and Perry had to sit inside the chopper for more than 30 minutes after it landed while their staff frantically sought the required permission, and got it after a lot of pleading and coaxing.        
	By then a large crowd had gathered at the airstrip, located near a highway, curious to see the celebrity groom and bride, who had had a fantasy jungle wedding in Ranthambhore on Saturday at a very private ceremony. But both stayed put inside the chopper.        
	An Associated Press report said the couple later flew to Jaipur, 145km away, and took a chartered flight to the Maldives.        
	Two years ago, a private jet carrying Bill Gates had to take off from the strategic Jodhpur airbase by the light of 200 gooseneck lamps  kerosene lamps with rag-like wicks  because the runway lights had been under repair for seven months.

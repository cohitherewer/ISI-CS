The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | J for BJP jinx with Joshi and Jethmalani
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      J for BJP jinx with Joshi and Jethmalani
          J.P. YADAV                              Murli Manohar Joshi (top), Ram Jethmalani				                                 
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: J for Janata  the BJPs middle name  but J for jinx too.        
	After Murli Manohar Joshi, it was lawyer-MP Ram Jethmalani today who embarrassed the party by declaring he would feel honoured to defend Binayak Sen, the rights activist jailed on sedition charges in BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh.        
	Yesterday, Joshi, chairperson of the parliamentary accounts committee (PAC), had publicly undermined the BJP stand that only a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) could probe the spectrum scandal.        
	A hapless BJP today tried to distance itself from the two Js, aware that it would be impossible to rein the two veterans in.        
	He (Jethmalani) has a profession.... The BJP has nothing to say if he is offering his services, spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said, refusing to comment any further.        
	However, the octogenarian Jethmalani, who recently made it to the Rajya Sabha on a BJP ticket, went beyond offering his professional services.        
	Binayak Sen is not a traitor. I dont think whatever he has done amounts to sedition. My impression is that there is no case against Sen, he said, stressing that the party line did not say that a lawyer should not fight cases.        
	Jethmalanis views are in complete contrast to those of the BJP, which advocates a no-tolerance policy towards Maoists and their sympathisers.        
	The BJP believes that Sen is a Maoist sympathiser, and its government in Raipur had kept him in jail for two years till he got bail in May 2009. Sen received a life term last week.        
	Jethmalani had earlier appeared for Sens bail plea in the Supreme Court but he was not a BJP member of Parliament at that time.        
	The BJP was equally evasive on Joshi, who has said the PAC could go beyond the comptroller and auditor-generals (CAG) report and conduct its own probe into the 2G scandal. His stand contradicts the BJP claim that the PAC has a limited mandate and therefore a JPC is a must.        
	He (Joshi) is the PAC chairman. We dont want to comment on what he has said. The party at the highest level holds that nothing short of a JPC probe is acceptable, Rudy said.        
	In private, BJP leaders acknowledge that Joshi has indeed dented the partys campaign against the Congress.        
	The leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, though, chose to confront Joshi, baring the strains in the party. She again stressed that the PAC had a limited mandate.         
	Under the Lok Sabha rules, the PAC cannot call a minister, much less the Prime Minister. The Prime Ministers offer, therefore, has no meaning, she tweeted.        
	Actually, the rules say the PAC needs the Lok Sabha Speakers permission to summon any minister. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had yesterday put it in writing that he was ready to face the PAC on the spectrum allocation.        
	Sushma continued to sting Joshi, saying the PAC deals with accounts while the JPC (with) accountability.        
	The party, however, has decided that the best strategy is to dissociate itself from Joshi and Jethmalani.        
	At internal party meetings, he (Joshi) had assured us he would not go against the party line. But his deeds dont match his words. We have decided to draw a line and see him just as a PAC chairman, a senior BJP leader said.        
	Before the media, the BJP put up a brave face and said Joshis remarks had not weakened its demand for a JPC probe.        
	We dont want the Prime Minister to break with precedent and appear before the PAC. We want him to follow precedent and institute a JPC probe, Rudy declared.

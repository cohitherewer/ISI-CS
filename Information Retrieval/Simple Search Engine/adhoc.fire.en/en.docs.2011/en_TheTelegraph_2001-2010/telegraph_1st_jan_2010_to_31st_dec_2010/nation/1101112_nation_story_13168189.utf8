The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata amp; many wait as Air India scrambles
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata amp; many wait as Air India scrambles
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                       Mamata                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Mamata Banerjee and P. Chidambaram were stuck for over an hour at Delhi airport, where chaos reigned today as Air India shifted all its domestic flights to Terminal 3 which had opened last week.        
	Flights were delayed by one to six hours, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.        
	The railway minister, travelling to Calcutta with party colleagues on IC 264, had to wait because of shortage of cabin crew. The flight was scheduled at 5pm.        
	However, since the parking bays are remotely located at T3, we had rescheduled the flight at 6pm, an Air India spokesperson said. The flight was delayed further as the cabin crew arrived late. The crew were delayed because of heavy traffic congestion on the approach road to T3, the spokesperson said.         
	The flight took off around 6.30pm and landed in Calcutta at 8.45pm.        
	Dinesh Trivedi, the junior health minister who was travelling with Mamata, said Chidambarams flight was delayed by about two hours. The home minister was travelling to Chennai on the 4.45pm flight and had confirmed with the airline that it was on time before leaving for the airport, Trivedi said.         
	A large number of passengers cancelled their tickets, frustrated by the long delays.         
	How long can one suffer like this, asked Rathin Roy, who had arrived from China this morning and was to take a connecting flight to Pune at 4pm. He cancelled after waiting six hours.         
	There were about 145 passengers to board flight IC 849 for Pune but only 30 were allowed. There were no pilots and crew when we boarded the flight and the cockpit was open. We saw some passengers entering it and clicking photos on their cell phones. We immediately alerted the CISF and they asked everyone to get off, said Roy, who was going to Pune to meet his mother.         
	A passenger headed to Mumbai said: After waiting for over four hours, when we entered the aircraft we found the seats were not confirmed. It was pathetic as they were doing everything manually.         
	An airport official said technical glitches caused delays and the problem was aggravated because Air India failed to employ enough staff.        
	Hours before leaving for Calcutta, Trivedi had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today highlighting the mismanagement in Air India. Pilots are forced to report for duty and fly even when they are unwell, he wrote.         
	Trivedi further wrote that when he was travelling to Delhi with Mamata last week, they were shocked to find that the pilot was not in his uniform but in jeans and T-shirt. On enquiry, it was found that he was on his way to Hyderabad when he was asked to operate the flight at the last minute.

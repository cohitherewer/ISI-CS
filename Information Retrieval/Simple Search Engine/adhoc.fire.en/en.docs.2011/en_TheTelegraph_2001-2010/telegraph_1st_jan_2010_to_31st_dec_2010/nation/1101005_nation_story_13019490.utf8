The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Skills course plan at Kendriya Vidyalayas

	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is planning to throw open its schools to private agencies and NGOs for skill development courses for the unemployed after the days classes are over.        
	The KVS, which runs over 1,000 schools, has drawn up a draft policy that will be discussed at its next board of governors meeting in October. Under the policy, NGOs, private organisations and semi-government agencies having expertise and experience in skill development would be allowed to run courses in the schools in the afternoon and evening.        
	The Kendriya Vidyalayas provides schooling for students from classes I-XII. Classes are generally held from 8am to 3pm on every working day. About 50 KVs that hold classes in two sessions will not be allowed to run the programmes.        
	Our school buildings are unused for nearly 17 hours every day. The Prime Minister recently called on educational institutions to allow use of their infrastructure outside school time for skill development purposes. We have taken a cue from the Prime Ministers call and prepared a draft policy, a senior KVS official said.        
	According to the draft policy, the KVS will charge the private agencies and NGOs a nominal fee. It will scrutinise the courses on offer to ensure they have the requisite government approvals. It will also monitor the fees the agencies and NGOs charge and ensure they are reasonable.        
	Permission granted to these organisations to run the course will be valid for a year. It will be renewed annually after a performance review. According to official statistics, only 5 per cent of labourers in the unorganised sector have some kind of skills training.

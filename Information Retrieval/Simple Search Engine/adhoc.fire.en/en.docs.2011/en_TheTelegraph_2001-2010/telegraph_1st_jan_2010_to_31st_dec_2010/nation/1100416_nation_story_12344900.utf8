The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dantewada tragedy a wake-up call: PC

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 15: P. Chidambaram today asked Parliament not to fall for a romantic version of Left-wing extremism but to treat the Dantewada tragedy as a wake-up call to fight the Maoists with greater resolve.        
	Ignoring the outcry against a military solution to the problem, the Union home minister accepted that development was necessary, but asserted that it wasnt possible to achieve it without containing the rebels.        
	This tragedy must only make us more determined, more resolute, more fearless. It is a grave law-and-order problem and we must fight it fiercely, the minister said in the Lok Sabha, replying to a debate on the killing of 76 security personnel in Chhattisgarhs Dantewada last week. He appeared to have the backing of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi: she was seen thumping her desk repeatedly during the speech.        
	Chidambaram said the home ministry had carried out a detailed study of the ground realities in the Maoist-affected regions, including the health of democratic institutions, development projects and funds, before finalising the offensive.        
	He was repeatedly taunted by Opposition members about the perceived differences among Congress leaders, particularly Digvijay Singhs allegation in an article about Chidambarams intellectual arrogance. The minister sought to play down the perceived rift.        
	India is a robust democracy and differences of opinion are natural. The views of Yashwant Sinha and Mulayam Singh (Yadav) are entirely different. Yet it is the duty of the government to build a plan, build a consensus and carry on with it, Chidambaram said.        
	He said there was a consensus among all affected states  Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra  on the action.        
	Chidambaram said he had offered to resign over the Dantewada attack, but asserted that the responsibility of the states was equal to the Centres. Growing emotional, he said: I didnt lose my nerve, I will have no fear. I dont fear Naxalites. The Prime Minister and the party president have reposed faith in me and I will continue to provide leadership to the forces in fighting Naxalism.        
	He read out portions of Naxalite literature that suggested the rebels planned to capture power.        
	The minister wound up saying: We shall overcome. This will be the triumph of the idea of India, of liberty and freedom, of democracy.        
	Immediately, BJP leader L.K. Advani got up to endorse the view, perhaps anticipating that many in the Congress wouldnt have the stomach to digest the tough line on the Maoists.        
	Advanis gesture is significant as many senior Congress leaders are said to be unhappy with Chidambaram for shifting the blame for the Dantewada bloodbath to the Centre despite the failure of Chhattisgarhs BJP government. The leaders feel the ministers resignation offer had dramatically changed the nature of the debate.        
	Sources said Sonia was also angry at the BJPs attempt to blame the Congress despite the Chhattisgarh governments failure and BJP leaders complicity with the rebels in Jharkhand.        
	Chidambaram tried to make amends somewhat by asking who was responsible for lack of development in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, but avoided making any lethal attack on the BJP as he usually does on other subjects.        
	Most speakers, except those from the BJP, Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Biju Janata Dal, stressed the deprivation of tribals and asked for speedy development in affected areas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Negligence finger at police
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Negligence finger at police
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Gurjar Singh                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Lapses by officers overseeing Mamata Banerjees security allowed Gurjar Singhs lorry to intrude into her convoy while she was returning from her Lalgarh rally, a preliminary probe by the state intelligence branch suggests.        
	Intelligence branch insiders said that for any VVIP trip, police are posted along the route to pre-empt sudden intrusions. They added that after Mamatas unscheduled stop at a dhaba just before the accident on Monday evening, the police had failed to sanitise the stretch.        
	Security experts in the state too claimed that if all the norms were followed, the lorry couldnt have intruded into the convoy.        
	The findings of the intelligence branch also reveal that the police officers in charge of sanitising the route for Mamata, who enjoys Z-plus cover, had a trying time because of the large number of vehicles accompanying her.        
	Intelligence sources said nearly 12 cars had accompanied Mamatas SUV apart from the two escort vehicles and the pilot car.        
	We have submitted a report to the home secretary about the incident where we have explained everything in detail, including how the number of people and vehicles in the VVIP convoy had exceeded the limit the police had suggested, Bengal police chief Bhupinder Singh told The Telegraph.        
	He refused comment on the initial findings.        
	Gurjars truck had hit an intelligence branch jeep, which then hit Mamatas SUV, flinging the Union minister against the dashboard.        
	Arrested on the charge of rash driving and released on bail the next day, Gurjar was re-arrested and sent to 12 days police custody after the Trinamul Congress alleged a conspiracy to kill Mamata.        
	Gurjar has claimed the brakes malfunctioned. A motor vehicles inspector later drove the truck and found that the brakes were not working.        
	While the CID is looking into the charges against Gurjar Singh, including attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, the intelligence branch probe is about whether there was any breach in security arrangements. These are preliminary findings and we have a long way to go, said a police officer.        
	Officers today grilled Gurjar at the CID headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident. A mechanical test of the vehicle is not enough. We have sent the lorry for a forensic test and are waiting for the report, an officer said.

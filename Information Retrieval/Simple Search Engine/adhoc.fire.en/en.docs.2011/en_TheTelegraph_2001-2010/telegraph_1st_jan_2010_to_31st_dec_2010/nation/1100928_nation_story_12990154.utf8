	New Delhi, Sept. 27: The armies of India and Japan are to begin talks tomorrow, a first for the two countries that are equally wary of Chinas military growth.        
	India has army-to-army talks with nine countries.        
	The talks begin in New Delhi even as the chief of air staff and the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, Air Chief Marshall Pradeep Vasant Naik, reached Tokyo today.        
	This is the first visit by the air chief to Japan since Air Chief Marshall (now retired) Shashi Tyagis visit in January 2007. Naik will be hosted by the chief of the Japan Air Self-Defence Force, General Kenichiro Hokazano.        
	In Delhi, the Indian and Japanese army delegations are being led by two officers of the rank of major general.         
	The two sides will draw up a calendar for exercises and exchange of information, army sources said here today.         
	The Japanese delegation is led by Major General Koichiro Bansho, director general (policy and planning).

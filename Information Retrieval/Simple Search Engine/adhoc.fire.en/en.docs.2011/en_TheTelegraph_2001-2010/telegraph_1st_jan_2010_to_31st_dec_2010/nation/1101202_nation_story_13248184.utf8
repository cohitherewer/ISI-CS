          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Carla Bruni-Sarkozy in Paris. (AP)		    
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: India is planning an exhibition of Rabindranath Tagores works in Paris next year as part of his 150th birth anniversary celebrations.         
	India and France are working to deepen their cultural exchanges and will sign agreements to this effect during President Nicolas Sarkozys four-day visit from December 4 to 7.         
	Indian culture enjoys wide interest and a discerning audience in France, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Vishnu Prakash said.         
	Tagore had organised the first public and international exhibition of his paintings in Paris in May 1930 at the Gallerie Pigalle. The exhibition later travelled to other European cities and came to Calcutta only in 1931.         
	India and France hope to sign agreements in film production, space and nuclear energy during Sarkozys visit.         
	As part of the agreement on nuclear energy, France will supply six nuclear reactors to India.         
	Frameworks agreement between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited and (French company) Areva are under negotiations and if they manage to wrap it up over the next couple of days, we will have those signed, said T.P. Seetharam, joint secretary (Europe West).         
	Seetharam said the agreement will be for supply of two European pressure reactors, initially, which will gradually increase to six.         
	The early contract is essential to start implementation of the 10,000MW nuclear project at Jaitapur in Maharashtra. NPCIL will subsequently enter into other technical contracts and start construction by March 2011.         
	While the pact between NPCIL and Areva will be commercial, it will be followed by inter-government agreements on confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). The two sides are unlikely to sign any major defence agreements during the visit.         
	Sarkozy and his wife Carla will land in Bangalore on December 4, where the French President will visit Isro. The highlight of their India visit will be a trip to Agra to see Taj Mahal and Fatehpur Sikri on December 5.         
	This is Sarkozys second visit to India in two years. He was the chief guest at the Republic Day parade in January 2008. Then, too, he had visited Agra to see the Taj but Carla was not within him because of protocol issues as the two were yet to marry then. They wed shortly after his return from India.

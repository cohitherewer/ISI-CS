	New Delhi, June 29: The Indian Air Force has said that three former Prime Ministers and one cabinet minister together owe it close to Rs 6 crore for personal travel in defence aircraft.         
	The detail was revealed today in reply to a Right to Information plea (RTI).        
	The defence ministry, according to the RTI, has resorted to various legal and administrative measures, including filing of civil suits to recover the amount, but the efforts have not borne fruit yet.         
	Former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar alone owes the IAF Rs 5.91 crore for using defence aircraft from January 1991 to June 1991. Chandrashekhar, who has died, was the Prime Minister from November 10, 1990 to June 21, 1991.        
	In its reply to the RTI petition, the air force said it had filed a case in Delhi High Court to recover the crores from Chadrashekhar for non-official air travel. But the case was dismissed on January 24, 2008, after his death.         
	Based on the advice of the ministry of law and justice, an appeal will be filed by the IAF in the high court to recover the amount from his legal heirs and political successors.

	Prime Ministers and cabinet ministers should pay personally for non-official use of IAF aircraft or the political parties that the MP belongs to must foot the bill.

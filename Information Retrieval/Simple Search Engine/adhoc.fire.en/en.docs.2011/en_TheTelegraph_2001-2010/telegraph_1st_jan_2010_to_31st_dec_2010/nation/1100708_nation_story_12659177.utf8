The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Power minister in dark
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Power minister in dark
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nirupam Sen                                  
	Calcutta, July 7: Bengal power minister Nirupam Sen today tried to explain the causes behind the recent spate of power cuts in the state but groped in the dark when it came to offering immediate solutions.        
	In April and May, the peak summer season when the demand for power usually shoots up, Bengal had reeled under severe electricity shortage.         
	The shortfall ranged between 700MW and 800MW during the evening peak hours, leading to prolonged power cuts. On at least one day, the shortfall touched 1,000MW.         
	In April and May, there were major power cuts all over the state because we could not meet the demand (5,500MW), Sen said during discussions on the power budget that was presented in the Assembly.        
	 The coal we received was at least two grades below the required quality. Our old plants are producing less than their installed capacity. We also did not receive the power promised to us by some neighbouring states.         
	The minister said the power department had gone horribly wrong in calculating the increase in electricity demand. The department had estimated around 10 per cent growth in electricity demand in March but it turned out to be 14.35 per cent.         
	This miscalculation burdened our existing infrastructure as a result of which there were frequent and prolonged power cuts, a power department official said.         
	The Trinamul Congress and the Congress stayed away from the budget discussion.         
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee told The Telegraph that Sen was a failure as industry minister and was no better as power minister.        
	Demand for power increases by about 500MW every year but the government has no power plants planned for the next four years. They are blaming poor coal supply for the dwindling generation of power but have failed to explain why they did not build up a buffer stock of coal when the supply was good, Chatterjee said.         
	Sen said the power-generation capacity of the existing plants would be boosted but did not specify when the new units would start generating.         
	We are adding another unit of 500MW to the Bakreswar power plant, two units of 500MW each to the plants in Sagardighi and Katwa. We are also decommissioning the four old units in Santaldih and commissioning two new units in their place, Sen told the House.         
	He, however, did not shed any light on the projected date when the planned units at Bakreswar and Sagardighi would start generation. The units, planned in 2007, would take at least four years to start operations.        
	Sen also claimed his department was facing problems in setting up substations for the want of land. We have been receiving reports from various parts of the state that landowners are not willing to part with their land. We do not require more than 1 to 1.5 acres for setting up substations. I have requested the MLAs of these areas to facilitate land acquisition, Sen said.

  Finance bill passed amid House ruckus          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Veerappa Moily                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government got key financial decisions for 2010-11 passed amid pandemonium in the Lok Sabha today before both Houses adjourned while Parliament deadlock persisted for the 13th day running.        
	The government passed the crucial financial bill by a voice vote even as members of different Opposition parties shouted slogans in the Well of the lower House for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the 2G spectrum scam.         
	Law minister Veerappa Moily introduced the judicial standards and accountability bill, 2010, again in the din. The supplementary demands for 2010-11 were also passed when the Lok Sabha was in disarray.         
	The UPA has issued a whip to its MPs to be present for passing the supplementary grants, which are funds allowed to departments beyond what the budget allocates. The supplementary demands are made for these additional funds.        
	Tomorrow, the government plans to pass the supplementary grants for the railways.        
	There was speculation today that the government might bring the curtains down on the winter session after the Professor Hiren Mukherjee Lecture in the Central Hall of Parliament tomorrow, but Congress sources said no decision had been taken.         
	Economist Jagdish Bhagwati who teaches in Columbia University will speak on reforms in the country at the lecture that will also be addressed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The government wants full attendance of the MPs at the lecture, so any decision to fold up the session early will be taken only after tomorrow.         
	Central ministers, governors, chief ministers, presiding officers of state legislatures, MPs and judges will attend the lecture.         
	After the House was adjourned today, Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha, said: I am not at all happy (with) the way we had to pass the supplementary demands in the din. But time is running out.         
	He said the government wanted a debate on the supplementary demands. I waited for the whole week to have a structured debate, but it could not be done, Mukherjee rued.         
	Mukherjee said Rs 1,000 crore had to be transferred to states for implementing externally-aided projects. If Parliament does not function, such transfers cannot be made without being endorsed by the Houses. Consequently, no money transactions can happen with the states.        
	Mukherjee said the additional outgo would not have an impact on the fiscal deficit which was pegged at 5.5 per cent of the GDP for 2010-11. Additional receipts on account of tax buoyancy and auction of 3G spectrum will make up for the extra expenditure, he said.         
	Sources in the Congress revealed the turn of events had caused deep anguish in the party and all the top leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, were extremely unhappy with the Oppositions obstinacy. They feel the Opposition should have been reasonable as the government had done so many things. Investigations were going on and the telecom minister was sacked, a UPA leader said.         
	The Congress leaderships time-tested ploy of breaking Opposition unity also failed this time though the bogey of the RSS and Karnataka corruption were repeatedly raised to isolate the BJP.         
	Sonias attempt to expose the BJPs hypocrisy on corruption also drew a blank. The Left, which showed signs of unease in the BJPs company and tried certain gimmicks like going to the President with a delegation of smaller parties, nevertheless stuck to the JPC demand.         
	While a section of the Congress believes that the entire crisis could have been managed better, some leaders feel the media got carried away by the Opposition propaganda and failed to see what this government has done to fight corruption.         
	The Supreme Courts running commentary on certain uncomfortable issues has also angered a section of Congress leaders who feel stray observations during court proceedings have hogged too much attention.

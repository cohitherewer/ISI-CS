          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 10: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has admitted honest differences within his Janata Dal (United) on the womens bill, but denied the possibility of a split or his breaking away over the legislation.        
	There are ideological differences between some of my Lok Sabha colleagues and me. We have honest differences on the bill. There is no other trouble in the party, Nitish, a backer of the bill, said today, a day after all five Dal (United) MPs in the Rajya Sabha voted for the bill against party chief Sharad Yadavs wishes.        
	Sharad, who has been sticking to his guns with Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav in opposing the bill, also denied split rumours. It (the differences) is an internal matter and will be sorted out soon, he told PTI in Delhi. Asked about reports that Nitish may form a separate party, he said: It is rubbish.        
	At the same time, Sharad did not soften his stand. We will continue to oppose the bill, he said. Asked about Sharads reservations, Nitish said: I have explained what I had to say on the issue.        
	Dal (United) spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Shivanand Tiwari admitted the views of Sharad and Nitish were divergent but said it wouldnt lead to a split. There could be different opinions in the party on the issue. This happens in any party. But this would not lead to a split. All of us want the party to remain united, Tiwari said.        
	Nitish said: Ejaz Ali (evicted from the House yesterday) stands suspended. George Fernandes could not turn up as he is ill. The remaining five voted in favour of the bill.         
	Sadhu suspended        
	Bihar Congress has suspended Sadhu Yadav, who had crossed over to the Congress from Lalu Prasads RJD last year, for criticising the leadership on the womens bill.

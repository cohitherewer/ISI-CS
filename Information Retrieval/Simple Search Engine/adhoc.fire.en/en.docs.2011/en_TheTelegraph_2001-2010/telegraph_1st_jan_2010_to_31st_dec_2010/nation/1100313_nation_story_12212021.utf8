The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gadkari sends rehab signal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gadkari sends rehab signal
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, March 12: Nitin Gadkari has signalled he is ready to placate the old guard that has felt marginalised after he became BJP chief.        
	The party is expected to recommend Murli Manohar Joshi and Yashwant Sinha  both seen as part of the group  as the heads of two key parliamentary committees, apparently with Gadkaris blessings.         
	The move also indicates that the BJP president will have a say in the affairs of the partys parliamentary wing, unlike the impression given by the RSS after Gadkari took over that he would concentrate only on the organisation.        
	Joshi is tipped to become chairman of Parliaments public accounts committee (PAC), replacing colleague Gopinath Munde, whose term ends in August.         
	The PAC chief vets the accounts of all public undertakings submitted by the CAG.        
	Sinha will take Joshis place as chairman of the standing committee on finance. He has so far been heading the external affairs panel.        
	Joshi and Sinha were part of the 60 and 70-plus age groups who found themselves relegated to the fringes after the RSS decided to give the BJP a youthful look to take on a Congress driven by Rahul Gandhi and his young team.        
	 A leader also said the move presaged Gadkaris new team of office-bearers, likely to be unveiled next week, will have a blend of age and youth.

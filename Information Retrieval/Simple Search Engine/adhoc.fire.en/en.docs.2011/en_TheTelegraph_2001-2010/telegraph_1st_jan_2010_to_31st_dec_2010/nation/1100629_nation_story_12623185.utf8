          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                 CRPF personnel shield themselves from attackers using cricket pads in Srinagar. File picture		    
	New Delhi, June 28: The home ministry today defended the CRPF firing in Kashmir this afternoon, with officials saying the force had not been taught to run away as they blamed the state government for inadequate police deployment.        
	Sources in the Union ministry said despite repeated reminders, the Jammu and Kashmir government was yet to increase the strength of the state police.        
	There is a genuine shortage in the state police and the CRPF is not taught to run away in a situation, a senior home ministry official said.        
	Nearly 70,000 CRPF personnel are now deployed in Kashmir, more than twice the strength of the state armed police.        
	The CRPF today issued a statement saying it was forced to open fire on a mob in Sopore as the protesters, who numbered around 700, had attacked a camp.        
	The paramilitary force said the post outside the camp had minimal strength and the police had deployed some unarmed men at the cordon outside the camp.         
	When the mob attacked these men rushed inside the CRPF camp to take shelter, the statement said. The mob pushed on, attacked the CRPF post and forcibly tried to enter by scaling the compound wall.        
	The statement said the CRPF sentry on duty was forced to open fire.        
	Later, it was learnt that the bullet hit a person in the riotous mob and that he subsequently died in hospital. He has been identified as Tajmul Islam, the statement said.        
	The statement said it was a clear case of attempt to attack the post, which was foiled by (the) timely intervention of the sentry on duty. In fact, the sentry had no option but to fire, to prevent the post being overrun, the statement said.        
	The home ministry has accepted this argument.         
	The ministry officials said the CRPFs job was to assist the state police and act according to the orders of the police and magistrates.

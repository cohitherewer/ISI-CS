The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On Pakistan, Obama pleases Delhi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      On Pakistan, Obama pleases Delhi
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: If getting a message across to the domestic audience is the yardstick with which the Obama visit is being measured, both sides have some reasons to be smug.        
	India has got the US to agree to condemn Pakistans terror factory in the joint statement  something the UPA government can hold aloft before those seething at Barack Obamas silence in Mumbai.        
	 The US President is taking home with him a headline figure of 53,000 jobs  something he could try to sell Americans who are desperate for jobs. He can also use the number to address protectionist lobbies that are targeting outsourcing.         
	The joint statement said Singh and Obama reiterated that success in Afghanistan and regional and global security require elimination of safe havens and infrastructure for terrorism and violent extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	Condemning terrorism in all its forms, the two sides agreed that all terrorist networks, including Lashkar-e-Toiba, must be defeated and called for Pakistan to bring to justice the perpetrators of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, it added.         
	Some South Block officials called the reference a success but it is not clear what India has offered in exchange.        
	The two countries decided to deepen their counter-terrorism dialogue and announced a new homeland security dialogue.         
	Singh said he had always maintained that a strong, peaceful and moderate Pakistan was in the interest of India, South Asia and the world. He added that India was willing to discuss K and all other outstanding issues but not when Pakistan was exporting terror.         
	Obama commended the Prime Ministers sincere and relentless desire, expressed publicly and privately, to pursue peace with Pakistan and hoped the two countries would find mechanisms that will be appropriate to reduce tensions.         
	It took nearly eight hours for the two sides to agree on the joint statement after the delegation-level talks ended around 1pm. The mutual admiration and willingness to accommodate each others concerns that Obama and Singh showed during their news conference characterised the statement as well.         
	Singh welcomed the President as a personal friend and a charismatic leader and talked about the Obamas warmth. Obama is a sincere and valued friend of our country and our discussions have led to a meeting of minds, he said at the news conference.         
	President Obama yesterday characterised the India-US partnership as one of the defining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century. In my discussions with the President, we have decided to accelerate the deepening of our ties and to work as equal partners in a strategic relationship that will positively and decisively influence world peace, stability and progress, the Prime Minister added.         
	Singh also thanked Obama for the co-operation received in counter-terrorism measures post-Mumbai.         
	Obama welcomed Indias preliminary agreement to purchase 10 C-17 Globemaster heavylift cargo planes for its air force, saying it would benefit both countries and create jobs in the US.

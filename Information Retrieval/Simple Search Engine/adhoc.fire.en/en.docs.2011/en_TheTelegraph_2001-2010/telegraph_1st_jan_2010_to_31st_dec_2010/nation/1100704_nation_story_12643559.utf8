          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 3: The UN has said what the Congress had been bragging all the time.        
	The international agency has hailed Indias rural job guarantee scheme, one of the flagship programmes of the UPA government, saying that it has reduced poverty and reversed inequality.        
	The UN Development Programme (UNDP) in a report titled What Will it Take to Achieve Millennium Development Goals? An International Assessment, says the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has improved livelihoods through legal guarantee of up to 100 days of paid work a year for landless labourers and marginal farmers, almost half them women.         
	The scheme has also regenerated the rural sector by improving infrastructure and enhancing agricultural productivity. It covers water conservation, irrigation canals, flood control and road construction.        
	Such robust social protection and employment programmes reduce poverty and reverse inequality, said UNDP administrator Helen Clark, quoting from the report. Evidence suggests that reduction in poverty and hunger occur when economic growth is job-rich and boosts agricultural production, she added.        
	The report will be submitted at a world leaders summit this September in New York for deliberations on finding ways and means of reducing poverty and achieving the millennium development goals.        
	The goals are eight internationally-agreed targets which aim to reduce poverty, hunger, maternal and child deaths, diseases, inadequate shelter, gender inequality and environmental degradation by 2015.        
	Drawing on the evidence of what has worked in 50 countries, the report puts forward an eight-point action agenda to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development over the next five years. Among the areas of focus are plans to support nationally owned facilities and participatory development; pro-poor, job-rich inclusive growth, including the private sector and government investments in health and education.

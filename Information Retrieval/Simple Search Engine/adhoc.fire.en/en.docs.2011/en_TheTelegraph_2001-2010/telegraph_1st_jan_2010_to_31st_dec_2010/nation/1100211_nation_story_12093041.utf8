The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deora sounds Mamata on fuel price hike
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deora sounds Mamata on fuel price hike
          OUR BUREAU                            Mamata Banerjee, Murli Deora                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The petroleum ministry is expected to accept fuel price increases far lower than that suggested by a panel, if the Centre succeeds in turning around recalcitrant allies such as Mamata Banerjee at a cabinet meeting tomorrow.        
	The petroleum ministry is pitching for a market-linked rate for petrol (a hike of over Rs 4.50 a litre) and increases of Re 1 for a litre of diesel, Rs 50 for an LPG cylinder and Rs 3 for a litre of kerosene.        
	Sources said petroleum minister Murli Deora might eventually settle for a Rs 25 hike on cooking gas, Re 1 on diesel and Rs 3 on kerosene.        
	Deora today reached out to UPA allies Trinamul Congress and the DMK, which have criticised the radical recommendations of the Kirit Parikh Committee which suggested the increase, to garner support for the hike when the proposal comes before the cabinet.        
	Petrol is now sold at a loss of Rs 4.72 a litre, diesel at Rs 2.33 per litre, kerosene at Rs 18.06 per litre and domestic LPG at Rs 287.59 a cylinder.        
	Deora met telecom minister A. Raja and spoke over phone to Mamata, explaining the state-owned oil firms precarious condition that will worsen if prices are not raised. Sources said both Raja and Mamata were non-committal.        
	Parikh, a former Planning Commission member, had suggested free-market pricing of petrol and diesel and raising cooking gas prices by Rs 100 per cylinder and kerosene prices by Rs 6 a litre.        
	Similar measures have been suggested by previous expert panels, but no government has had the political will to overhaul the way fuel is priced in India. The decision is not going to be easy for the ruling Congress as there is opposition from within the ruling coalition.        
	The BJP and the Left parties have asked the government to reject the Parikh panel report, especially in view of the surge in food prices.        
	The food inflation, which touched 20 per cent in December, marginally came down but it has again picked up pace for the second consecutive week and rose to 17.56 per cent for the week ended January 23.         
	Officials said that if there was strong opposition to the hike, the government could leave domestic LPG and kerosene prices untouched and allow free-market pricing of petrol and marginally raise the diesel price by Re 1 a litre.        
	The revenue loss for the three oil marketing firms this financial year is likely to be Rs 43,000 crore, of which Rs 31,000 crore is on sale of LPG and kerosene alone.        
	The Congress leadership, grappling with the discontent over the price rise, has asked the government to ensure that the proposed hike in petroleum prices is moderate. The Congress core committee met tonight to discuss ways to minimise the impact on common people.        
	Sources said the core committee, which includes Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee P. Chidambaram, A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel, was of the opinion that the fuel price increase should not be very steep.         
	Chidambaram told reporters that no decision was taken at the core committee meet. The sources said the committee discussed the terms of reference for the Telangana committee. The terms will be announced after the cabinets approval.         
	The Congress is also cautious about the price increase proposal because of the allies opposition.        
	Mamata is said to be extremely unhappy as she does not want to associate herself with such an unpopular step ahead of the civic elections in Bengal.         
	Congress sources said a decision might be kept pending till a consensus emerged. Congress spokesperson Abhisek Singhvi said: As long as there is no domestic or international compulsion, prices should not be increased. Even if a compulsion is there, it should be increased minimum in actual terms.        
	Asked about Parikhs recommendations, Singhvi said: A report has recommendatory value. There are diverse inputs. Parikhs report is one input. All inputs are taken into consideration before a decision is taken.

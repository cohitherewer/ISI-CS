The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VCs stay off Chavan meet
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      VCs stay off Chavan meet
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: If university vice-chancellors were to mark Prithviraj Chavans first day in office as Maharashtra chief minister, his score would be minus 300.        
	Three hundred VCs skipped a conference opened by him on Friday.        
	The university heads were not angry with him. They were upset with the UGCs decision to provide Rs 1 crore to Bharati Vidyapeeth, a private deemed university in Pune, to host the event that also happened to be Chavans first public do after becoming chief minister.        
	UGC sources said a varsity generally gets Rs 10 lakh for such conferences. Vice-chancellors of several central universities, among them JNU, and many state varsities did not show up at the event that began on Friday and ended today. In total, 500 vice-chancellors had been invited.        
	The complaint about the UGC grant to Bharati Vidyapeeth has another dimension to it.         
	The varsity was found deficient in standards by a human resource development ministry panel last year. Bharati Vidyapeeth has been found lacking in standards by the P.N. Tandon committee. I want to keep a distance from such a controversial conference, a vice-chancellor of a central university said.         
	The committee had found 44 deemed universities, including Bharati Vidyapeeth, wanting in governance, research output and quality of teaching and learning.         
	Questions have also been raised on Shivajirao Shripatrao Kadam, the vice-chancellor of Bharati Vidyapeeth, who is among the 10 members of the UGC. Sources said the grant of Rs 1 crore to Bharati Vidyapeeth was illegal because private deemed universities were supposed to be self-financed institutions.         
	The UGC Rules say that those institutions which are recognised under Section 12-B are eligible for grants. This deemed university is not covered under Section 12-B, a source said.         
	Section 12-B of the UGC rules deals with which institution should get grants.        
	UGC chairperson Sukhadeo Thorat claimed the conference was a huge success. Asked why Bharati Vidyapeeth was chosen as the venue, he said: The UGC did not decide Bharati Vidyapeeth as the venue. The Association of Indian Universities decided it should be the venue. We agreed since the AIU is the main organiser.         
	He said the grant of Rs 1 crore was based on expenditure. The upper limit is Rs 1 crore.         
	He admitted that Bharati Vidyapeeth was not covered under Section 12-B, but said certain colleges under it were covered under the section and were eligible for grants.         
	As for Chavan, sources said he attended the conference because he had consented to attend it a month ago when he was minister of state for science and technology at the Centre.         
	On his first day in his new office, Chavan got sucked into a controversy over a flat allotted to him in Mumbai in May 2003 by former chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde.

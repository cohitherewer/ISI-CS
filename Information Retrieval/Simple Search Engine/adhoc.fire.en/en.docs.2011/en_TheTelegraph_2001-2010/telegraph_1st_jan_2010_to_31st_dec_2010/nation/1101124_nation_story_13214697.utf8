The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cart-before-horse finger at Swamy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cart-before-horse finger at Swamy
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Prime Minister doesnt understand the law... Subramanian Swamy said.        
	Shhhh, said the Supreme Court, giving the Janata Party president some light-hearted advice on discreetness.        
	Although Swamys remark was meant not to criticise Manmohan Singh but to praise him as incapable of any questionable legal tactics, he faced a strong government attack.         
	Its Swamy who didnt quite grasp the law, attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati implied, at least not while dragging the Prime Minister to court over the delay in responding to his plea for sanction to prosecute A. Raja.        
	There was no question of considering sanction for prosecution as no court complaint had been filed, Vahanvati said. The petition was premature and misconceived. How can he ask for sanction as he is yet to file a complaint in a court?        
	What, according to you, is the procedure for seeking sanction? one of the two judges, Justice S. Singhvi, asked.        
	Vahanvati replied that a complaint must be filed in a court first with all the relevant documents. Only if the magistrate thought it fit to take cognisance could the petitioner ask for sanction.        
	Swamy protested: I am entitled to go to the court but decided to approach the Prime Minister first only to save time.        
	But he handed an immediate relief to Manmohan Singh, saying: There was no malafide intention on behalf of the Prime Minister to block my complaint.        
	The Prime Minister was misguided by the law ministry, Swamy averred.        
	Justice A.K. Ganguly, the other judge on the bench, frowned on the use of such strong language. Do not use the word malafide. Please say, There was no lack of good intention on (behalf of) the Prime Minister.        
	Swamy added that he had known Singh for a long time. The Prime Minister used to tell me that one thing he cannot understand is law and lawyers, he said.        
	Do not disclose anything further, Justice Ganguly cut in with a smile.        
	The battle continued. A question was asked whether the Prime Minister should have acted within three months of receiving Swamys first letter (sent in November 2008) in keeping with earlier apex court guidelines.        
	Prashant Bhushan, appearing for an NGO to demand court monitoring of the CBI probe into the telecom scandal, requested the bench to set fresh guidelines to help citizens fighting corruption in public life.        
	Justice Singhvi asked Vahanvati what he thought the deadline should be for deciding on sanction for prosecution. Not more than six months, the attorney-general replied.        
	Swamy clarified that no sanction was required now because Raja was no longer a minister.        
	I am planning to file a criminal case against him in the first week of December in the Patiala court in the capital under the Prevention of Corruption Act. I will appeal to the court to allow me to appear as public prosecutor, he later said.        
	The court asked the Centre to furnish details of all the cases where prosecution was pending for want of sanction. Vahanvati sought a week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Adarsh rap on govt in court 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Adarsh rap on govt in court 
  - Glare on delay in action on officials, offer to defence members        SADAF MODAK                           The Adarsh housing society building                                        
	Mumbai, Dec. 21: Bombay High Court today came down heavily on the Maharashtra governments delay in taking action against officials involved in the Adarsh society scam and demanded to know why an FIR had not been registered against bureaucrats nearly two months after the controversy broke.         
	Hearing a petition filed by the Adarsh co-operative society against revocation of its Occupancy Certificate (OC) and disconnection of its water and power supply, the court pointed towards manipulation by the collectorate and the states urban and revenue ministries.         
	The division bench of Justice B.H. Marlapalle and Justice U.D. Salvi observed that while the society was meant only for defence officers, of the 103 flats, not even 50 are allotted to them.         
	Everybody who was supposed to clear a file has been gifted (a flat), the bench said.         
	Senior counsel Rafique Dada, appearing for Adarsh society, told the court the withdrawal of the OC, power and water was an arbitrary action taken by the state authorities MMRDA and BEST on October 31, after newspapers reported the scam.         
	Even a default on payment is given 15 days of notice. Here, the society was told to produce an OC in 24 hours by the BEST, Dada said.         
	The court made an offer to the 45-odd society members who have a defence background. If you are willing to shift to the first 12 floors of the building, the court will direct the supply of water and electricity to be resumed till a final decision is passed, the bench said.        
	Under the Coastal Regulation Zone norms, the 31-storey Adarsh society had permission to build only up to 30 metres  approximately 12 floors.        
	The court observed that while the state government had issued a show-cause notice to the society immediately on October 30, it had taken no action against its own officials even two months on.         
	The state government will have to reply on many issues. Why has there been no FIR registered except the one on the missing files in the case? Dont tell us committees will be formed to conduct inquiries. Committees are formed and dissolved, nothing happens, the bench said.         
	Another blow to the state government came in the form of the letter sent to the Union environment and forests ministry by the state.        
	The letter sent in 1999 states that special consideration should be given to Adarsh society as all its members are defence officials who have served the motherland all their lives, additional solicitor general Darius Khambatta said, appearing for the Union ministry.         
	Some defence officials who will be allotted the flat are fighting at the Kargil warfront, the letter stated.         
	Out of the 71 members, only two have fought at Kargil, Khambatta told the court.         
	The judges read out the names of members, including that of former chief minister Ashok Chavans mother-in-law, former army chief Deepak Kapoor, the son of former principal secretary of the urban development department Ramanand Tiwari and relatives of IAS officers to illustrate how frequent changes were made in the approved members list as it passed from one department to the other.         
	The status of the land, which was in possession of the defence ministry, too was altered in an order by P.V. Deshmukh, deputy secretary in the urban development department in 2004.         
	The lawyers have sought time till December 23 to decide on the courts offer. The next hearing is on December 23.        
	Games probe        
	The CBI will approach the Union sport ministry to seek the removal of Commonwealth Games Organising Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi and secretary-general Lalit Bhanot form their posts, PTI quotes sources in the agency as saying.         
	The posts are a stumbling block in the CBI probe into alleged corruption in the organising of the Games, the sources added.

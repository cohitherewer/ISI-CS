          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       The Parliament. File picture                           
	New Delhi, March 7: Parliament House may be cocooned in an electronic umbrella to protect it from air attacks.        
	Although shielded by four layers of security after the terrorist attack in December 2001, the temple to the largest democracy could be vulnerable to attacks from the sky, officials feel.        
	Sources said a joint parliamentary committee on Parliament security was expected to discuss next week the proposal for the electronic umbrella.        
	Considerable groundwork has already been done on this front. The 10-member panel will discuss the proposal to install on the roof of Parliament House a radar that will be operated by the Indian Air Force. The radar will be part of the system for tackling threats from the sky.        
	The committee, headed by deputy Speaker Karia Munda, periodically reviews the security arrangements and upgrade plans.        
	Members of the committee, set up by the erstwhile NDA government after the Parliament attack, had travelled abroad to shop for latest security technology.        
	The committee had chosen the New Zealand-based Gallagher Group for installing a perimeter protection system around Parliament House.        
	The electronic security system sends active pulses around the fence every 1.2 seconds. The fence is divided into 30 zones, each of which is monitored individually.        
	Intruders coming into contact with the fence suffer a painful jolt and the alarm system gets activated. The site in question is pictured on a central control computer that is monitored round the clock.        
	The system makes an attack from the ground difficult. The committee has now turned its attention to the possibility of threats from the sky.        
	Besides Munda as its chairman, other committee members from the Lok Sabha are Kirti Azad, Mirza Mehboob Beb, P.C. Chacko, Dara Singh Chauhan, Jiyaraj Singh and Sushila Saroj. The members from the Rajya Sabha are S.S. Ahluwalia, D. Raja and Satyavrat Chaturvedi.

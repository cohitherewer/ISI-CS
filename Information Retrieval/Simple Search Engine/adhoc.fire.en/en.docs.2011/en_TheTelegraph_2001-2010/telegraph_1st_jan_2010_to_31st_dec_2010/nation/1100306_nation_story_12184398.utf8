The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 2061: Cometh the comet and Maoists 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      2061: Cometh the comet and Maoists 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 5: The Maoists plan to rule India by 2050 or 2060, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai said here today.        
	If that happens, the rebels will reign over the planets most populous country and its third-largest economy  as India is predicted to be by 2050. If they grab power by 2060, they will have done it just in time to welcome the Halleys Comet as it appears over our skies in 2061 in the course of its 76-year orbit of the solar system.        
	But dont panic just yet. The government believes it can quell the Maoist threat by 2017-18. Pillai said the Indian state would reoccupy the rebel-held areas in the next seven or eight years  by when, according to some forecasts, India will be the worlds eighth wealthiest nation with the highest number of billionaires.        
	The overthrow of the Indian state is not something they are willing to do tomorrow or the day after. Their strategy, according to a booklet they circulated, is that they are looking at 2050  some documents say 2060, Pillai told a seminar on Left-wing extremism situation in India.        
	The home secretary said intelligence inputs suggested the rebels were receiving help from retired army personnel in planning strikes.        
	He said the rebels were well trained, on a par with the armed forces of any country. They are very highly motivated, highly trained. I am quite certain that there are some, may be some ex-army or some people who have been with them.        
	The home secretary said he had based his inference on information that the Maoists planned every operation in great detail. After every attack, they do a post-mortem and analysis. The analysis is as good as (those that the) armed forces of any country do, he said.        
	Pillai added: Now they can bring many sectors of the Indian economy to their knees. But they dont want to do it today. They know that if they do that now, the state will come very hard (at them). They are not fully prepared to face the onslaught. So they would rather go very slowly.        
	He conceded that the anti-Maoist operations had not wrought significant reverses so far, and that the government needed seven to eight years to have full control over the areas lost to the rebels. The operations have not hit even five per cent of hardcore militants. The real armed cadres are yet to come out.        
	Pillai said 908 people had been killed in Maoist violence in 2009  the highest since 1971. It is quite likely the violence will go up in 2010 or 2011 before the tide begins to turn.

          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The telecom watchdog is planning to give mobile and landline users the option to choose the kind of marketing calls and SMSes they want to receive.         
	The plan, if implemented, could put an end to unwanted telemarketing calls and mobile phone messages.        
	A consumer can choose from a list of sector-specific marketing options such as lifestyle, real estate, holiday offers and bank loans. If the consumer opts for neither, his becomes a do-not-call number.        
	Efforts by Telecom regulator Trai to curb unwanted marketing calls by setting up a do-not-call registry have had little success.         
	The issue on unwanted telemarketing calls caught telecom minister A. Rajas attention after Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee complazined he had got such a call in the middle of a meeting.        
	India has a Rs 11,000-crore-a-year telemarketing industry and a smaller Rs 200-crore-a-year SMS marketing industry. There are over 30,000 telemarketing firms in India that would be affected if the plan becomes a law.        
	Trai is toying with another proposal  a blanket ban on all marketing calls and messages.         
	Only consumers who register to receive commercial communication will get telemarketing calls and SMSes.        
	Industry voices have spoken against the proposal. Few customers would register to receive commercial calls and therefore the do-call option would become a virtual ban on all telemarketing calls, a Reliance Communication source said.

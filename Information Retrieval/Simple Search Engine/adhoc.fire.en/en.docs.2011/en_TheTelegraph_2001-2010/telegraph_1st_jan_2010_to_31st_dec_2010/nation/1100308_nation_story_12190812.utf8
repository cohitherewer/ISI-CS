                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Social worker alleges harassment at office
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 7: On the eve of International Womens Day, an award-winning social worker alleged that she had been harassed during pregnancy and also denied maternity leave by the National Institute of Social Work and Social Sciences, one of the best-known NGOs in Orissa.        
	I was denied resuming my duties after delivery. One month after the delivery, when I went to the office, the authorities did not accept my resumption of duties letter, saying that I was no more in the job. They even refused to intimate me anything in writing, said Mamta Mishra, who worked with National Institute of Social Work and Social Sciences as a project officer.        
	In 2008, she received the Rajiv Gandhi Award for her outstanding contribution in the social sector.        
	She said when she had asked for the reason and an official communication, the NISWASS authorities replied that a verbal communication was sufficient.         
	They said they had already appointed someone else on the job. They also threatened that if I continue going to the office, I would be humiliated, she said.        
	While I was still at the office, I was asked to vacate it and it was locked by a peon, Mishra complained.        
	Mishra joined National Institute of Social Work and Social Sciences as the project officer in July last year and applied for maternity leave from November 15.         
	I was not intimated about the status of the leave when I enquired. My queries were evaded and finally when I arrived to resume my duties, I was harassed. I intimated all persons concerned regarding the incident but nothing happened, she said.        
	On February 4, Mishra was summoned by the organisation for a discussion with its director K.M. Tanti and working president B.K. Pattanaik.         
	They too compelled me to resign from the job without giving any showcause notice. It has been a trauma for me, she said.        
	Mishra has already lodged a complaint before the National Human Rights Commission and the state womens commission.         
	I want justice. I wish to know that when the country talks of uplift and employment of women, what the position of a working woman in the society? And whether they should prefer a child or a job first for their uplift? This is a matter of regret, Mamta said.        
	National Institute of Social Work and Social Sciences officials were not available for comments.

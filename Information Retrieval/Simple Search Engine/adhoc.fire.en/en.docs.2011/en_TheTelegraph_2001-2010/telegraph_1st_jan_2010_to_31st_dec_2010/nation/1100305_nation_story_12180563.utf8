The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court martial for lady major
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court martial for lady major
                            
	Chandigarh, March 4 (PTI): A retired woman army major has been sentenced to a years rigorous imprisonment for accepting a bribe, the first time that a lady officer has been court-martialled.         
	Retired Major Dimple Singla, 37, who has also been cashiered from service, was convicted of accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000 from a defence counsel to influence a court martial.         
	Cashiering is an elaborate punishment intended to humiliate the guilty and deny privileges of rank and benefit.        
	Singla was facing trial for demanding and accepting the bribe from an accused armyman, Havildar Chandran, to influence court martial proceedings in his favour at Dehra Dun in 2006.        
	Terming Singlas act as being prejudicial to good order and military discipline, a general court martial (GCM) last night held her guilty under Section 52 of the army act for wrongful gains.        
	The GCM was presided over by Col Sanjeev Jose of the armys Western Command. Singla had been accused of suggesting the name of a defence lawyer to Chandran.         
	She had asked Captain Kamud Maini, a defence officer in Chandrans case, not to divulge any information about the accused havildars court martial proceedings to the media.        
	The court martial against Singla had begun in 2007 and had witnessed a series of lengthy adjournments as the matter had reached the Supreme Court.        
	Singla, who had retired from the army on completion of 10 years service in 2007, had been arrested on February 1 by army authorities for skipping GCM proceedings. She had been released later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Safer site ignored for tabletop runway
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Safer site ignored for tabletop runway
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 23: The Mangalore runway that IX 812 overshot yesterday could have been built at a suggested alternative site that provided a lot more space, people who had campaigned against the runways construction said today.        
	The tabletop runways limited length of 8,300ft, and the absence of enough buffer area between its end and the gorge beyond, leaves pilots no margin for error, as shown by yesterdays tragedy.        
	The alternative site, parallel to and north of the existing runway, would have allowed a longer and wider runway but was never considered  possibly because influential people owned land there, environmental activist Leo Saldanha said.        
	The land on which the current runway came up had been occupied by a community of Dalits, about 200 to 250 families, who were removed. I guess it was easier to dislocate the downtrodden, said Saldanha who, with four others, had move court alleging the tabletop runway would not conform to civil aviation guidelines.        
	The decade-long opposition by Saldanha, farmer Arthur Pereira, two members of the local community and a Church leader had spawned two public interest litigations in Karnataka High Court, in 1996 and 2002, and numerous appeals to political leaders and civil aviation officials.        
	Pereira said he had met MPs Oscar Fernandes and Veerappa Moily several times to plead with them to consider the alternative runway site. They promised me they would take this up, but the aviation people went ahead with the project, he said.        
	Its hard to pinpoint blame, Pereira added. We knocked on the doors of our politicians (MLAs); we knocked on the doors of the courts; and we met members of Parliament. No one listened to us. Some said they would look into the matter, but nothing happened.        
	Saldanha said that at some point in 2004-05, he and the others shifted focus from challenging the runway to seeking appropriate rehabilitation for the displaced Dalit families. Besides, they had run out of funds.        
	We had spent about Rs 2.5 lakh on the court cases. Some of us had taken personal loans to pursue this. It was a lot of money, Pereira said. We had to give up.        
	The runway was commissioned in mid-2006.        
	Saldanha said the demand for an international airport had emerged in the mid- 1980s when the business community realised that passenger traffic between the Gulf and Mangalore was growing.        
	The proposal for a new runway to replace an older airstrip, which was fit only for small aircraft, was first made by members of the Mangalore Chambers of Commerce and Industry in 1987. It was challenged by local communities who formed an alliance, the Vimana Nildhana Visthrana Virodhi Samiti. Pereira, a farmer from Malavoor village, was a Samiti spokesperson.        
	The alliance had in its PILs said the site would not meet the International Civil Aviation Organisations specifications, under which the Mangalore runway ought to be at least 300m wide. The site chosen for the runway allowed a width of about 200m.        
	The civil aviation ministry itself issued a notification on January 5, 1988, saying that there should be a uniform strip of 150 metres on either side of the centreline of the runway. This rule, too, would require a width of 300m.        
	A senior Airports Authority of India official, D.C. Mehta, said this evening he did not have the relevant documents to be able to respond to these concerns. He said Mangalore airport had a licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.        
	If these concerns are valid, how did the DGCA grant the licence? Mehta said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Aug. 3: Trinamul Congress supporters today hurled stones and slippers at former CPM MP from Haldia Lakshman Seth and tried to drag him out of his car before police intervened.        
	The assault, a kilometre from the East Midnapore district magistrates office in Tamluk, came after two Trinamul activists were beaten up by CPM workers.        
	Trinamul supporters tried to kill me today. They hurled stones at me through the open window of the car and hurled abuses, Seth said.        
	CPM zonal committee secretary of Tamluk, Bijon Mitra, was beaten with sticks and had to be hospitalised. The party has called a 12-hour bandh in Tamluk on Thursday.        
	The trouble started after CPM supporters, present at a demonstration of Left student and teacher bodies, spotted the two Trinamul workers.         
	The demonstration was against alleged Trinamul attempts to prevent recruitment of primary teachers. The CPM men severely beat up the two Trinamul supporters.         
	Nearly 600 Trinamul supporters then blocked the Haldia Mecheda highway, leading to a clash with the police. Trinamul leader Mahmud Hossain said: Lakshman Seth was attacked by those not getting jobs as primary teachers.

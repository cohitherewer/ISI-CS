The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Puff of tobacco warning delay
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Puff of tobacco warning delay
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: A Group of Ministers held a meeting here this evening that was widely expected to defer a decision to make pictorial warnings on tobacco products sold in India a lot more gory than they are now.         
	Health ministry sources said the official outcome of the GoM meeting would be available only tomorrow, but the Press Trust of India reported that the GoM is understood to have deferred by six months the plan to change the pictorial warnings.         
	Under Indias tobacco control laws, the health ministry has to rotate pictorial warnings, and a set of pictures showing a mouth ravaged by cancer were to replace the existing two images of lungs and a scorpion from June 1 this year. The health ministry had issued a notification in May this year deferring the new harsher pictures to December 1.         
	The meeting of the GoM itself was a signal that this may be deferred again, a source who requested anonymity told The Telegraph . The notification makes it clear the new warnings will come into effect from December 1. What was the need for the meeting? the source said.         
	The earlier decision to defer the introduction of new warnings had been justified as time for the industry to prepare for the new set of warnings, the source said. This time there will be no excuse to defer the warnings.         
	The GoM, headed by Pranab Mukherjee, includes urban development minister Jaipal Reddy, civil aviation minister Praful Patel, and health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.         
	Anti-tobacco activists have long suspected that the tobacco lobby  manufacturers as well as cultivators and distributors  have succeeded in reaching out to sections of the government to stall tobacco control efforts by the health ministry.         
	Tobacco control organisations have been apprehensive that the constitution of the Group of Ministers may have been advocated by quot;vested interests to stall the implementation of these pictorial health warings and cause further delay.         
	Public health specialists have also decried previous moves by the GoM to dilute the pictorial warnings on tobacco products. In December 2008 the GoM had replaced a set of pictures with smaller and less effective warnings.         
	The new pictures that show a lip affected by cancer are expected to be more effective in influencing people away from smoking or chewing tobacco. Even Pakistan now has warnings against oral cancer  India doesnt, a health ministry source said.         
	A tobacco survey released last month showed that one in five women and nearly one in two men in India use tobacco.         
	An alliance of tobacco control organisations has written to the Prime Minister, the chairperson of the United Progressive Aliance, and cabinet ministers, including the health minister to implement the new harsher warnings from December 1.

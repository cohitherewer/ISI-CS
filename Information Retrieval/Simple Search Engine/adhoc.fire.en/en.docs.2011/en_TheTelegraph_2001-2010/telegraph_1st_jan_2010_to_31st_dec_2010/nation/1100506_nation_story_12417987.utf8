          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, May 5: A group of trapped militants killed a major and a soldier in a forest in north Kashmir before breaking an army cordon and escaping.         
	The army said Major Yogendra Rajbar and rifleman Uttam Singh were part of the search party that had gone to Chati Bandi village, located in a forest area in Bandipore district, last evening to track down the militants, who had taken refuge in a house.         
	The militants fired at the troops as they closed in on the hideout, injuring an officer and a jawan. Both of them succumbed to their injuries in hospital, army spokesperson Lt Colonel J.S. Brar said.         
	Brar said Major Rajbar was a resident of Dehra Dun and had been posted in Bandipore for the last two years. He was instrumental in maintaining peace in the area, a hub of militancy because of its mountainous terrain, Brar said.         
	He said the operation was still continuing.         
	A cordon had been thrown around the area but before we could encircle the house, the militants came out and fired at the security forces. It was dark as there was no electricity in the area. It was also raining heavily, a police officer said.         
	The militants took advantage of the darkness and escaped by breaking the cordon, the officer added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nursery age advice from Sibal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nursery age advice from Sibal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Children should be admitted to pre-primary school only after the age of four, and into primary classes after six, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said today, treading on a subject principally regulated by state governments.        
	Sibal told reporters he planned to write to Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit requesting her to raise the minimum age for pre-primary classes in the capital from three at present to four. Students under the age of six should not be admitted into primary classes, the minister said.         
	The age between three and five is a phase where children should be completely free to explore... there should be no burden of schooling on them, Sibal said.        
	Sibals statement is unlikely to directly lead to any change in admission age of students in most parts of the country. The Centre has no regulatory powers over pre-primary education, which is monitored by state governments.

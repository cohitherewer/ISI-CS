The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM advances US trip to iron out wrinkles
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PM advances US trip to iron out wrinkles
          K.P. NAYAR                               Singh, Obama				                                 
	Washington, April 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President Barack Obama will have a hastily arranged meeting on Sunday to allay misapprehensions in both countries about the Obama administrations perceived neglect of India and to iron out wrinkles in their bilateral relationship over issues such as access to terrorist enabler David Headley and differing views on Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	The Prime Minister yesterday decided to prepone his arrival here by about 36 hours after Obama invited him for a rare Sunday meeting on the eve of the Global Nuclear Security Summit which will take place in Washington on Monday and Tuesday.         
	The Prime Minister was to have originally arrived here on Monday after an overnight halt in Frankfurt, which has now been cancelled. Instead, he will reach Washington on Saturday and stay here until Wednesday, an unusually long halt in one city for a Prime Minister who dislikes overseas travel.         
	The Obama-Singh meeting was originally planned as a brief pull aside chat on the margins of the nuclear security summit, but was upgraded yesterday into a structured meeting after perceptions of a rapid deterioration in bilateral bonhomie in recent weeks raised concerns in both New Delhi and Washington.         
	To buttress the idea that all is well in Indo-US relations, the dates of Obamas state visit to India well before winter this year are expected to be finalised although there will be no announcement of dates in view of concerns about his security.         
	Sundays meeting between the Prime Minister and the US President is seen here as a special gesture by Obama to underline his interest in India.         
	At the time of writing, his only other structured bilateral meeting on the cards is with Chinas President Hu Jintao, who announced his intention to go to Washington only last week.         
	Obama is going out of his way to meet separately with the Chinese President because Beijing was expected to send only a low-level delegation to the nuclear summit in protest over US arms sale to Taiwan and Obamas recent meeting with the Dalai Lama.         
	The nuclear security summit itself is expected to go well for India, which is seen by some of the 44 countries attending the meeting as a recalcitrant participant in the global non-proliferation regime because of its refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, who is arriving here tonight to prepare for the Prime Ministers meeting with Obama and to steer the pre-summit negotiations on behalf of India, has seen to it that New Delhi is not pilloried on account of CTBT or NPT.         
	Rao was asked by Singh to be the Indian sherpa at the first preparatory meeting for the summit in Tokyo and a second one in The Hague although Shyam Saran was then the Prime Ministers special envoy on this subject.         
	A final meeting of sherpas from 44 countries plus the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be held here before the summit.         
	At the meetings in Tokyo and The Hague, the foreign secretary firmly resisted attempts to smuggle issues related to NPT and CTBT into the summit agenda.        
	Consequently, the format of the Washington summit that is now on the table favours India. The summiteers will begin their work at a working dinner hosted by Obama on Monday.         
	The next days plenary now allows only for two working sessions: one at which participating heads of state and government will discuss national action plans to ensure the security of nuclear material and another at which they will discuss international actions needed for global nuclear security.         
	India will aspire for a high moral ground commensurate with its squeaky clean record of securing nuclear material by proposing the setting up of an International Nuclear Safety Centre in India.         
	This initiative which has been informally discussed with some countries ahead of the summit is expected to be welcomed by participating heads of state and government.         
	The idea is expected to silence even stray murmurs about Indias refusal to sign the NPT and the CTBT and focus attention on the core issues over which Obama called the summit.

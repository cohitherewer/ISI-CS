The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | What to learn to buy Blackburn
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      What to learn to buy Blackburn
          AMIT ROY                          The Blackburn Rovers stadium                                  
	London, Oct. 26: What does a boy in Blackburn do if he likes a girl?        
	He takes her to his local football club  which is what Jack Straw did in 2006 when Condoleezza Rice came to see the UK foreign secretary in his Lancashire constituency.        
	Straw had a Blackburn Rovers shirt, printed with Rice and 10, gifted to the visiting US secretary of state.        
	Condi is gone and Straw is no longer foreign secretary but he remains MP for Blackburn, which he has represented since 1979. Straw, an honorary vice-president of Blackburn Rovers, is a season-ticket holder and regularly attends matches with his family.        
	For him, the high point was when Blackburn won the Premier League in 1995. Sadly, the club was relegated in 1999 but clawed its way back in 2001 and won the Carling Cup in 2002, Straw recalled.        
	With such a bumpy ride, it is very character-forming to be a supporter, he laughed.        
	He welcomed the possible takeover of Blackburn by an Indian company: Indian companies have been good for the UK; it has been a two-way process.        
	Maybe he will give Anuradha Desai a tour of Blackburn if the Venkateshwara Hatcheries chairperson is confirmed as the new owner of the club. As for Anuradha, she will have to undertake a crash course in the distinctive language of English football:        
	The boys done good (if they win);        
	We woz robbed (if her side is beaten fair and square);        
	I was gutted (if one of her boys misses a penalty)        
	Its a game of two halves (if Blackburn is trailing at half-time).        
	Although the club is not doing well at the moment, it has a rich history and, with the right investment, the glory days may be back again.        
	Many big names have pulled on the white-and-blue Blackburn shirt. They include Ronnie Clayton, now 76, who made 581 appearances for the club between 1950 and 1969 in the days when footballers played for the love of the beautiful game, did not earn todays astronomical fees and certainly did not assault Page 3 girls in dark nightclubs. Clayton was capped 35 times by England, including five as captain.        
	Another legend, Bryan Douglas, also 76, made 438 appearances between 1952 and 1969. He earned 36 caps and scored 11 goals for England.        
	Alan Shearer played for Blackburn 138 times between 1992 and 1996, scoring 112 goals. He played 63 matches for England.        
	Blackburn newspaper Lancashire Telegraph has reported that most former players have welcomed the news of a possible Indian purchase.        
	Ex-Rovers stars (Kevin) Gallacher, Simon Garner and Bryan Douglas have all been encouraged by the news, which could potentially give boss Sam Allardyce money to spend in the transfer market after a period in which the club has struggled to compete financially with rival Premier League sides, the paper said.        
	Gallacher thinks a November deal would give Allardyce time to... enquire about possible targets before the transfer window opens on January 1.        
	Season-ticket holder Dan Clough, of the fanzine (fan magazine) 4000 Holes, was cautious: Its hard to judge what this means until we know more details.        
	The club was established in 1875. In 1888, it became a founding member of the Football League, the worlds first professional soccer league that remained Englands top football competition till 1992 when the Premier League was born. Blackburn is one of only three clubs to have been a founder member of both the Football League and the Premier League (the others being Aston Villa and Everton).        
	The Indians need to appreciate they are not buying just a business but something that is dear and integral to the British way of life.

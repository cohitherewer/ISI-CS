The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul PCPA visit gives CPM proof
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamul PCPA visit gives CPM proof
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Mukul Roy consoles slain People rsquo;s Committee leader Biswanath Mahato rsquo;s family on Monday. (Samir Mondal)                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 25: The CPM today claimed proof of Mamata Banerjees alleged Maoist links after Trinamul Congress minister Mukul Roy visited the homes of two slain members of the rebel-backed Peoples Committee in West Midnapore.        
	The junior shipping minister visited the families of Biswanath Mahato, 40, and Pradip Mahato, 35, who were killed on Friday night at Nandarampur village, about 5km from Jhargram town, allegedly by CPM activists.        
	Mukul Roys visit is proof of Mamata hobnobbing with Maoists, CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said in Calcutta.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities was behind the Jnaneswari Express sabotage that killed more than 150 people. (Union home minister) Chidambaram has said it is a Maoist outfit, but the Trinamul chief is trying to shield them.        
	Roy later told reporters: Biswanath and Pradip were killed by CPM goons because they were resisting the terror unleashed by the ruling communists. I came to condole with their families at Mamatadis behest.        
	When told that the two slain men were Peoples Committee members and that his visit could be construed as evidence of a Trinamul-Maoist link, Roy left without answering any more questions.        
	Salim asked why Trinamul had been silent on the abduction of intelligence branch inspector Partha Biswas by suspected Maoists in Purulia, and why the party was not demanding his release.         
	It is now clear that from West Midnapore to Bankura and Purulia, Mamata Banerjee and her party are bent on advocating the cause of the Maoists, who are on a killing spree across Jungle Mahal. The Trinamul leader wants unhindered Maoist movement in these areas, Salim alleged.        
	The controversy comes at a time Mamata is expected to hold rallies in Purulia and Bankura, on October 30 and 31 respectively, to press for withdrawal of the joint forces from Jungle Mahal.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee too is to address a rally in Bankura on October 30.

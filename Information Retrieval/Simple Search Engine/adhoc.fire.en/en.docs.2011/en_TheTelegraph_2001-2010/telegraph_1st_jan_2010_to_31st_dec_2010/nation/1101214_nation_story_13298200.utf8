The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Toothless govt rehashes BPO safety list
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Toothless govt rehashes BPO safety list
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The Centre has reacted to the recent gangrape of a Mizo call centre employee by deciding to rehash a set of safety guidelines to BPOs that the companies have largely ignored for the past five years.        
	Officials of the women and child development (WCD) ministry, which will re-issue the guidelines jointly with the home ministry, claim that this time, senior executives will be threatened with a six-month jail term for failure to comply.        
	However, they admit that this will require new legislation and say they have no timetable for its passage through Parliament.        
	The government had issued the guidelines for the safety of women BPO employees in late 2005 after a rape-cum-murder by the driver of a pick-up car in Bangalore, but employees say most of the companies have been taking short cuts. (See chart)        
	My office had assured me during the job interview that I would not have to worry about how I would reach home. But once I joined, the drops became very irregular, said a woman who works for a Gurgaon BPO.        
	Sometimes I have to wait for hours to be dropped home. There are different drivers on most days and this adds to our feelings of insecurity. My parents worry a lot.        
	Some BPO owners claimed they were not even aware of the five-year-old guidelines. We were doing it (looking after women employees security) by ourselves. But if the government issues guidelines, we would welcome it, said Omprakash Verma, owner of Techsupport.        
	He agreed with a general allegation by women employees that the BPOs do provide a car but many do not bother to check the drivers credentials or ensure the women are dropped at their doorstep after night shift.         
	For instance, the Mizo woman had been dropped about 200 metres from her home in Delhi late at night, allowing criminals to waylay her.        
	There have also been many instances of women being harassed by a driver working as a temporary replacement, a WCD ministry official said.        
	He admitted that the guidelines had not worked so far because of an absence of monitoring, but claimed both the WCD and home ministries would now jointly watch over compliance.        
	Every police station will be told to see whether the directives are being enforced. We hope the home ministrys involvement will make it work this time, the official said.        
	He added that states that did not maintain a register of security agencies would be told to start one at the earliest. The home ministry will be writing to all the states about this.        
	Some women BPO employees, however, fear the guidelines could work against women.         
	I feel these directives will make the BPOs think twice before recruiting women. There is an increasing feeling among the managements that hiring women is a headache. These directives will only make it more difficult for women to get BPO jobs, said a local BPO employee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cradle of crime, now embarrassed to carry guns
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cradle of crime, now embarrassed to carry guns
  - In Champaran, where armed men once accompanied rich farmers to toilets, people today walk without fear                        Secure as never before: Munna Sheikh with his dogs at his farmhouse on the Nepal border.   Picture by Sankarshan Thakur                          
	Beyond the bedlam of Champarans townships  Motihari, Bettiah, Chanpatia, Narkatiaganj, each a leprous scar defying repair  lies cockle-warming country.         
	On a clear day, its distant backdrop is nothing less than a surreal spectacle: shimmered Himalayan snowpeaks arranged west to east, like a canvas dropped from the firmament. By night, its like the moon had spilled onto earth.         
	You run north, escaping semi-urban clamour, and suddenly it is like coming up for air, release from a tinder-box into an infinity of rolling land and open sky. Winter is beginning to notify its arrival, drenching the earth in dew, dispatching gusts to whisper in the woods. Wherever the gaze travels on these flats, natures busy manicuring.         
	Aqua streams and canals, rinsed of monsoonal mud, fuzzy banks of bulrush nodding in the wind, water lilies sprung in duckponds, the fields voluptuous with ripened cane and paddy, a landscape swelled with such fragrant intoxications you almost forget the road has vanished and a dirt track has arrived underneath and there are no power lines overhead.         
	Its where they can still shoot a rural Bollywood classic without any requirement for sets, Mera Gaon Mera Desh territory. (For the uninitiated, Mera Gaon Mera Desh was a typically seventies good-over-evil classic peppered with lilting semi-risque numbers and just enough violence for it to have earned a U certificate from the censors.)        
	But not everything about rural Champaran is sylvan sweet, just like it wasnt in Mera Gaon, Mera Desh. If you can picture Dharmendra chasing Asha Parekh and attendant village belles across ranch and rivulet, you must also account for Vinod Khanna lurking somewhere, bandit eyes fixed on wanton felony.         
	Crime belt? asks Munna Sheikh, theatrically aghast on the offered description of what Champaran once was, Crime belt is too mild, this was the university of lawlessness, this is where everything started, dacoity and political murder, smuggling, kidnapping for ransom, name an offence and Champaran was its champion. We lived in terror and we did not live here at all.        
	Sheikh is a landed farmer with enough property strewn around to have felt under siege.                   
	I had six gunmen, my own private army, protecting me even when I went to the toilet. I built a little turret with gun-holes on top of my farmhouse for them to keep watch by night.         
	It was not like now, you and I could not be sitting here and having this conversation without a care in the world, we would have been inside, guarded by my men, and I would probably have told you I have nothing to say, have a cup of tea please, and be off. But now things are so good, I am embarrassed to have guns around me, they are there, but there is no need to make a show of them. People will look and wonder why, theyd probably think me I am some criminal.        
	We are in Sonaula, a little hamlet verged on the border with Nepal. Theres no road that reaches here from any direction and for miles before we finally reached it, lurching along a winding path, there was no signpost of state or government other than forsaken hovels with panchayat markings and crumbling British-era culverts over waterways. From where Sheikh sits, under a wooden gazebo, we can see Tharu tribals stir about their village across the unmarked fence; and beyond the village loom the Himalayas, painted layer after faint layer.         
	To possess a thing of worth here is to forever live in dread of losing it to all manner of brigands. To the west stretch the dense forests of the Valmiki National Reserve, to the north the freedoms of Nepali jurisdiction, and to the south and east governments that were not able to, or interested in, invoking the law or establishing order.         
	Champaran is where most cases of kidnapping from across Bihar culminated during the Lalu-Rabri years.         
	It was easy as a whistle, says Abhay Mohan Jha, a Bettiah-based journalist who has accompanied us on the ride. You just had to commit a crime and come to Champaran, this was a protected sanctuary. Thick jungles, interested politicians, and if that was not sufficient, you could always run across to Nepal.        
	The Sheikh of Sonaula has been nodding. Right, absolutely right. It was only by day that I went out of my house, if at all, and as I said I had my guards. This is a huge credit Nitish Kumar has done to us, not just relatively prosperous people like me, but everybody. We feel safe and we can laugh and smile, its a great gift, nothing you can ever measure. You have to know what it was like to understand the depth of the debt we owe the chief minister.        
	He gestures to his SUV parked in the drive and says, I would never bring it here those days for fear it would be snatched, I kept it in Patna. I would travel by train and then by motorcycle, and I always ensured I reached well before sundown.        
	Sheikh feels secure enough with his three German Shepherds now  Dholu, Dhanno and Chhamiya  and spends more and more time overseeing his farmlands. It used to fill me with fear, but its actually fun now, often when friends gather we dont think twice about picnicking by moonlight on the riverside, come sometime.        
	Its getting to dusk, that nowhere period between glare and gloom, but Sheikhs in no hurry to see us off, his dire descriptions of past perils notwithstanding.         
	Nothing to fear now, arrive at midnight, depart at midnight, that is the sense of security this government has given us. Sheikh says theres much he could still complain about in Sonaula  no roads, no power, no healthcare, verily no agency of government  but hes grateful to be purged of dread. I would not have kept you back if I were afraid myself.        
	We leave when the sky has already sprung stars and moonlights dripped on the darkness in streams of dew, a gossamer veil on rural Champarans spread-eagled seductions. Its nice to know the road is as safe by night as it was beauteous by day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Andhra HC chides Naidu
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Andhra HC chides Naidu
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            Chandrababu Naidu and Ashok Chavan                          
	Hyderabad, July 22: Andhra Pradesh High Court has censured N. Chandrababu Naidu for breaking the law in his agitation against the Babhli project and said water disputes cant be resolved by muscle power.        
	Who asked them (Naidu and his team) to go there and cause trouble? If water disputes were to be resolved by show of muscle power, there would not have been any Narmada project today, a bench of Justices A. Gopal Reddy and K. Chandrabanu said, dismissing a PIL by a supporter of Naidus Telugu Desam Party.        
	The PIL was filed before Naidu was released by Maharashtra police on Tuesday after his arrest last week for trying to visit the Babhli barrage over which the state and Andhra Pradesh have a long-running dispute.        
	The petitioner had sought action against the Maharashtra officers who had arrested Naidu. The court also rejected the petitioners claim that the Maharashtra government should be made to pay for the treatment of the Desam leaders. They were given better facilities than those that exist in Chanchalaguda jail in Hyderabad. Besides as a political prisoner, he did not deserve anything better, the court said.         
	In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena carped that the Ashok Chavan government had pampered Naidu like a son-in-law who feasted on biryani in AC guesthouses. Ashok Chavan must explain if Naidu is his son-in-law or a business partner, Bal Thackeray wrote in party mouthpiece Saamna yesterday.

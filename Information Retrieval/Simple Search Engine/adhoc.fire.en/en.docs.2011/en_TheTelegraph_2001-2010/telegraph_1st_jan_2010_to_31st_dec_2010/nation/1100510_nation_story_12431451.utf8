	Chandigarh, May 9: Punjab  famous for its agriculture, textiles and bicycles  is now aiming for the sky.        
	A private firm will supply unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the eyes in the sky to be used to track Maoists in inhospitable terrain, besides the familiar job of watching enemy movements across the border. Ludhianas Bhogal Hobby Tech  a group better known for its cycles  will supply UAVs to the Indian Air Force (IAF).        
	Bhogal claims its UAV is similar to the Israeli version that Indian security forces use for training purposes. Each Israeli machine costs around Rs 16 lakh, while the Indian version will come for half the price.         
	The IAF has ordered five UAVs and we expect the navy and the army to do the same, company managing partner Manjeev Bhogal said. The air force placed the orders after conducting comprehensive all-weather trials.        
	An IAF officer at the Chandigarh air base said the locally-built UAVs would initially be used for training. They can also be used for reconnaissance. They are as good, if not better, than the Israeli version. We will also be looking for India-made larger versions, he said.        
	Powered by an 86cc petrol engine, Bhogals UAV has a wing-span of 14 feet. A handler has to fly the model for 25 hours before qualifying as a pilot  operating the device from the ground rather than in the air.        
	Manjeev promised better versions. We can produce more powerful versions for the security forces. The company, he said, can also design and manufacture UAVs that can carry loads  unlike the conventional ones that are not designed to fly with anything.        
	Defence officials believe UAVs can be used to protect sensitive installations, such as nuclear units.

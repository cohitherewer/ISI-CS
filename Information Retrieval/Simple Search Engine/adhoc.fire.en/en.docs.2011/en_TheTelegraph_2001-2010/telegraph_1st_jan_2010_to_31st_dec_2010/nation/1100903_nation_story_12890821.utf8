The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Grain for poor, but not free
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Grain for poor, but not free
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The Centre today decided to release an additional 2.5 million tonnes of foodgrain to be sold as ration to the poor following Tuesdays Supreme Court rap, but deferred a decision on the courts order to give it free.        
	Food and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar announced the decision after a meeting of the group of ministers and also declared that the public distribution system (PDS) would be overhauled to bring more families under the below poverty line (BPL) category who are given rations at rates lower than others.        
	As an interim ad-hoc measure, pending a final decision on the issue, the government is releasing an additional quantity of 2.5 million tonnes of wheat and rice to the states at a BPL price for the next six months, Pawar said.         
	The government said a final decision would be taken later on the free-grain order, which had come in the wake of reports that stocks were rotting in godowns even as millions were going hungry. There are 6.52 crore families registered under the BPL category, each eligible for 35kg of grains every month. Rice is distributed at Rs 5.65 a kg, and wheat at Rs 4.15 per kg.        
	Pawar, the apparent target of the courts rebuke for a statement attributed to him that the apex court had suggested and not ordered free grain, promised more relief from the planned PDS revamp. After the overhaul, the number of BPL families is expected to increase to 8.1 crore.        
	But Y.K. Alagh, a former Union minister and an economist with Ahmedabads Sardar Patel Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: The court had clearly stated who should get the foodgrain. The data (on such poor) is available with the government.

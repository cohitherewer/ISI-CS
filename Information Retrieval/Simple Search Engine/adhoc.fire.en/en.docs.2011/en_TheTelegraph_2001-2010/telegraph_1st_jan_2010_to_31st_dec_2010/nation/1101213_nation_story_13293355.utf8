          AMIT ROY                                                    (Top)The suite at the Bentley where Warne and Hurley allegedly spent over 11 hours,(below)The purported kiss published by News of the World,      
	London, Dec. 12: Liz Hurley, wife of the Indian businessman, Arun Nayar, has been caught in a steamy affair behind her husbands back with cricket legend Shane Warne, according to a front page world exclusive today in the News of the World.        
	This is the paper which broke the story on cheating Pakistani cricketers earlier this summer which means its claim that Hurley and Warne were seen kissing and cuddling passionately and that the couple were ensconced in the Australians suite at the Indian-owned Bentley Hotel in South Kensington in London for more than 11 hours at one stage will not be dismissed out of hand.        
	Warne is in London to film and promote his new TV show, Warnie, which is due to be launched in his native Australia.  
	The deluxe Bentley is owned by the Indian hotelier Joginder Sangar who is proud to have had both Pratibha Patil and Manmohan Singh stay with him during their official visits to London. But the Indian President and the Prime Minister would no doubt be mortified if they were ever to discover that Hurley and Warne romped  a popular tabloid expression  in the same bed.        
	This is one reason why the Indian tycoon Srichand Hinduja never stays in a hotel  you never know who has been there before.  
	The evidence for the prosecution is that Hurley, whose London residence is a few minutes drive away, was photographed and apparently also videoed enjoying intimate moments with Warne.                               Hurley at a promotional in Hong Kong in November, Nayar at Mumbai airport in 2007, days before he and Hurley got married, Warne at Heathrow airport on December 8      
	The paper, in a report headlined, Hurley Cheats With Shane: Caught by the bails, provided a detailed account of her arrivals and departures from the hotel, including the times she was seen heading for what was though to be Warnes suite.        
	But the defence might argue this was all a bit too obvious. Was it a set up to draw attention to Warnes TV programme? In Londons PR world, anything is possible.        
	The prosecution would argue that Warne is known to have an eye for the ladies though his usual preference is for barmaids. In any case, he scarcely needs to attract additional publicity.        
	After Australias humiliating innings defeat in the second of the Ashes Tests in Adelaide, some Australians have urged Warne to come out of retirement and help the nation in its hour of need. Warnes response has been to say he was flattered.        
	Hurley, who is 45, married Nayar in a high profile wedding in Jodhpur in 2007. The exclusive pictures were sold to Hello! magazine for a reported 2million. She still keeps getting invited to charity dinners hosted by Gaj Singh, the erstwhile Maharaja of Jodhpur.        
	Though more of a model, she once acted in a number of films whose names few can now remember. She was the girlfriend of the actor Hugh Grant for many years and had a son, Damian, now eight, by an American, Steve Bing, who initially disputed paternity before acknowledging he was the father. By that time, Hurley announced she did not want any of his money for maintenance.        
	Has she now tired of Nayar and wants to move on to fresh pastures? Warne is certainly not the marrying kind and at Hurleys stage of life it is unlikely any rich man will want to take her on and keep a girl from a lower middle class background in the style to which she has become accustomed. On the credit side, she has certainly tried to make her own way in life and used her quintessential English looks to keep the paparazzi interested.        
	The long relationship with Grant had a touch of class because of his role in such movies as Four Weddings and a Funeral. Many would say that by contrast the furtive comings and goings at even a top class hotel tend more towards the sleazy.        
	Hurley and Warne have met before  that much is known. Whether it has gone any further is a matter of intense speculation. Warnes attempt to patch up his marriage failed. A witness to the Hurley and Warne encounter told the News of the World: They were so passionate they looked like honeymooners. It was electric.        
	Only the paper would know the identity of the witness and if he or she really exists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia power nod to Andhra a snub to Orissa
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia power nod to Andhra a snub to Orissa
          Our correspondent                      Sonia Gandhi                                
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 28: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has assured her party in Andhra Pradesh that her office would take up the request to accord national project status to the proposed Polavaram multi-purpose power plant.         
	In a letter to Andhra chief minister K. Rosaiah yesterday, Sonia said her office would follow up on the request made by him.         
	I have received your letter. I am happy to learn that necessary clearances that the state government had sought from the Union of environment and forests have been granted for the Indira Sagar Polavaram Project (ISPP). You have also requested that the declaration of ISPP as a national project be expedited. I have asked my office to follow up on the matter, says the letter to Rosaiah.         
	The assurance comes despite Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik lodging a strong protest against the project with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on August 23.         
	Naveen had explained to the Prime Minister how the project would adversely affect Orissa.         
	Sonias assurance on Polavaram in West Godavari district comes after the Centres rejection of environment clearance to the Vedanta bauxite-mining project and Rahul Gandhis visit to the area on August 26.         
	This (Sonias assurance) is like adding insult to injury, said a Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader.        
	In the past, the BJD had accused the ministry of environment and forests of not following the Forest Rights Act (FRA) while granting forest clearance to the Polavaram project that would inundate 11 villages and several areas of Malkangiri district in Orissa.         
	The Centre had stopped work at the Posco steel project by citing provisions of the FRA.         
	We will not allow our land to be submerged by the Polavaram project. We have been opposing the project since its inception because vast forest areas and tribal-dominated villages will be affected by the project, Naveen had said.        
	If the project is accorded national status, it will be eligible for 90 per cent central funding.        
	A livid BJD general secretary and agriculture minister Damodar Rout today said: The Centre is adopting a step-motherly attitude towards the BJD government. Sonia is helping Andhra Pradesh because the reservoir will be named after Indira Gandhi.        
	He added: When two states have a dispute, the central government acts as an arbitrator. But in this case, it has become a party (to the dispute). The manner in which environment minister Jairam Ramesh accorded clearance to the Polavaram project within weeks proves their (the Congresss) partisan attitude. Had Vedanta been named after Rajiv Gandhi, they would have cleared the project in no time.        
	Industries minister Raghu Mohanty said: We will hit the streets to oppose the step-motherly treatment of the Congress-led government at the Centre.         
	Mohanty said consent of the project-affected people had not been taken as the mandatory public hearing in Orissa villages was yet to be held.         
	The minister said that in the cases of Posco and Vedanta, the N.C. Saxena committee had raised issues of mandatory sanctions. He wanted the Centre to do the same for Polavaram.        
	An Orissa government official said: The Andhra Pradesh government had asked the district administration of Malkangiri to bring the affected villagers for a public hearing on the project in West Godavari district. This is not the way forest clearances are given.         
	Senior Congress leader and leader of Opposition in the Assembly Bhupinder Singh said: The national project status to the Polavaram project and our problem (submergence of forest and tribal areas) are two different things.        
	The project, which proposes to irrigate 3,14,718 hectares and generate 960mw of power, has been challenged by the Orissa government in the Supreme Court that has asked the Centre and the Andhra government to reply.                    WITH INPUTS FROM G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN HYDERABAD

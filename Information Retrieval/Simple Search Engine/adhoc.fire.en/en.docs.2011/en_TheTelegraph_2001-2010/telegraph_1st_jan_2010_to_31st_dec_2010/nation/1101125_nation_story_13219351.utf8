                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Letter to judges
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Justice G.S. Singhvi and Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly made a startling observation in the Supreme Court today, revealing that a letter alleging that they have been managed in the 2G spectrum case was sent to the judges.        
	This was possibly intended to force the judges to recuse themselves, CPIL lawyer Prashant Bhushan said.         
	Justice Singhvi clarified that that (the thought of recusing) was his first, initial reaction. Justice Ganguly added: We are hurt and wounded. We can recuse ourselves. We are not keen on hearing the case. Our reputations have been tarnished.        
	But the judges indicated that they would continue to hear the case. The letter was written by a Chennai resident.

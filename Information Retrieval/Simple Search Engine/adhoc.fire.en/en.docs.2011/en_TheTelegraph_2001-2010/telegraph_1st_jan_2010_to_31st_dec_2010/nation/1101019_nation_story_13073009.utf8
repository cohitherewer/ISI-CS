          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Mumbai, Oct. 18: Mumbai police today lodged a case against the Shiv Sena, a day after Bal Thackeray thundered at his partys Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park and mocked the Bombay High Court order to keep noise levels below 50 decibels.        
	A case was registered against Shiv Sena activist Diwakar Border who had filed the application seeking permission for the rally. We had earlier rejected the application following Bombay High Court guidelines declaring Shivaji Park a silence zone. The Shiv Sena was allowed to organise the rally after the court directed them to keep noise levels below 50 decibels, said an officer from Shivaji Park police station.         
	Anti-noise pollution activist Sumaira Abudulali, who recorded the noise levels at the rally, said they were in the range of 65 to 93 decibels. Thackerays speech made noise up to 93 decibels. You cannot expect the Sena roar to be fit into 50 decibel restriction, he crowed.         
	When party workers burst firecrackers to welcome his grandson Aditya, the noise levels shot up to 93.2 decibels.         
	Abdulali said: I have demanded that action be taken against senior party leaders who violated the decibel levels.         
	If found guilty, the accused would be fined Rs 1 lakh and face a five-year jail term under the Environment Protection Act and the Noise Pollution Rules.

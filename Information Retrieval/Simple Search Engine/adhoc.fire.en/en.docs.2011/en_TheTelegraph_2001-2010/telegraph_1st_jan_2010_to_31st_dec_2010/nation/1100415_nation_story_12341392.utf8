The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IPL chief offered us $50m: Rendezvous
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IPL chief offered us $50m: Rendezvous
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi/Mumbai, April 14: Rendezvous Sports, which is part of the consortium that successfully bid for the Kochi IPL franchise, today alleged that IPL commissioner Lalit Modi had offered them $50 million to withdraw from the race, prompting the cricket boss to threaten legal action.        
	We were offered $50 million by Modi to withdraw from the Kochi team, said Shailendra Gaikwad, CEO of the franchise.        
	The allegation came hours after Modi told reporters in Mumbai that there was a question mark over the Kochi team, secured by a bid of $333.33 million (Rs 1,533 crore) at the auction on March 21.         
	Modi rebutted Gaikwads charges as rubbish. Are they mad? Who will offer them what they say is Rs 200 crore. I will take legal recourse.        
	Asked when he would initiate legal action, Modi added: I am awaiting the clippings (in which Shailendras cousin Satyajit Gaikwad aired a similar allegation). Once I have that, I will serve them a legal notice... possibly tomorrow.        
	IPL insiders said the offer, if made by Modi, cannot be construed as a bribe.        
	The $50 million offer was applicable to both Pune and Kochi franchisees in case they wanted to back out of their bid as once taken, a teams valuation goes up and IPL feels it is fair to compensate them, said an IPL official close to Modi.        
	Earlier in the day, Modi, at a news meet in Mumbai on the IPL awards, had initially refused to answer questions on the controversy surrounding the free equity given by the Kochi franchise to Union minister Shashi Tharoors close friend Sunanda Pushkar.        
	But peppered by queries, the IPL chief said there were doubts over the ownership of the Kochi franchise.         
	Modi said he would call a meeting of the IPL governing council after April 25 (when the final will be played) and discuss the issue.        
	As regards all earlier franchisees we know who the owners are. They come, they attend conferences and meetings, but as far as Kochi IPL is concerned we had a question mark. Even those who presented the bid documents do not know who they (owners) are, he said.        
	Rendezvous CEO Gaikwad hit back at Modi, saying they were being deliberately made to go through a tough time.        
	We went through the process in the right manner and won the bid. But within 10 days of winning the bid, Modi offered us $50 million to give away the rights of the IPL franchise, Gaikwad said.        
	He alleged that the franchise was being targeted because it outbid some big business houses which Modi wanted to bring in for subsequent editions of the IPL. Among those which lost out at the Chennai auction was Videocon and the Adani group, said to be close to a powerful Union minister.        
	We are being put through an unnecessary process and the reasons are obvious. If we did not have all the papers in place how could we win the bid? It is unfair now to make us go through these problems, Gaikwad said.        
	Modi defended his decision to reveal the Kochi stakeholders names on the public forum Twitter. The only reason we gave it out this time is because we did not know who the owners are.         
	Even the shareholders did not know who they are. In case of the other eight franchisees, I can tell right now that everybody knows who they are, he said.        
	Calling it a small issue, nevertheless an issue, Modi said: We will deal with it.        
	Everything else is speculation, forget about it. The agreement has been signed and will be taken in time, Modi said.

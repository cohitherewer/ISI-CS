The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Two stones in Mayas vote for Congress   Blunt rival and Delhi thorn
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Two stones in Mayas vote for Congress     Blunt rival and Delhi thorn
          J.P. YADAV                             Sonia Gandhi in the Lok Sabha and (above) Mayavati in Lucknow on Tuesday. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi, April 27: Mayavatis support to the UPA is being widely attributed to a breather from the CBI but far shrewder political calculations also could have prompted her to deal the surprise hand in Lucknow today.        
	The CBI was breathing down her neck in the disproportionate assets and Taj corridor cases, and Mayavati had two options before her to help out the UPA when the cut motions came up in the Lok Sabha: to abstain or vote in favour of the government.        
	The Uttar Pradesh chief minister chose the latter and left the first one for her arch opponent in the state, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	Legal matters may eventually take their own course in the courts but the BSP leader hopes to reap many political benefits by supporting the UPA over the cut motions moved mainly by the Left and the BJP.         
	At a time the Congress led by Nehru-Gandhi scion Rahul Gandhi is desperately striving to upstage the Mayavati-led BSP government in Uttar Pradesh and regain power in the Hindi heartland, she clearly has left the grand old party squirming, by offering her all-out support.        
	She chose to hit two birds with one stone: blunt the Congresss revival in Uttar Pradesh and the Centres hostility against her government.         
	Politically, we have nothing to lose by our proximity with the Congress. Whatever loss will be suffered by the Congress which is going all out in Uttar Pradesh to attack our government and bounce back, said a BSP member of Parliament. The Congress could now find itself in an uncomfortable position to explain its deal with the Dalit party it is aspiring to replace.         
	Also, Mayavati tried to push another contender, Mulayam Singh, towards a Left in decline and to the communal BJP. Mulayams discomfiture in the House was reflected when he, along with RJD chief Lalu Prasad, walked out to escape the communal charge that could annoy the substantial Muslim votebank in Uttar Pradesh which is going to the polls in 2012.         
	In the caste and community-ridden political spectrum of Uttar Pradesh, Mayavatis decision will also help her assuage Brahmins and ward off a perceived Muslim fear that she may align with the BJP.         
	Mayavati today harped on the secular theme. We are supporting the government since the Day I to keep the communal forces at bay. At the time of the formation of the UPA government, we gave unconditional outside support and that is there, she said in Lucknow.        
	On the Brahmin front, Mayavati had been accused of giving a short shrift to the upper caste. She had removed her key aide and Brahmin face of the party, Satish Chandra Mishra, from an important party post. The Brahmins were also said to be drifting towards the Congress, drawn by the Rahul factor.         
	Her votes for the Congress today came in sharp contrast to the robust support she lent Prakash Karat during the trial of strength in the last Lok Sabha over the nuclear deal.        
	 Why annoy the Centre when you are sure that there is no chance of toppling it? Moreover, Mayavati is not going to become the Prime Minister by toppling the UPA, a BSP functionary said, underscoring that his leader makes compromises but not for petty political benefits.        
	Motion against PM        
	The BJP today filed a breach of privilege motion against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for speaking outside Parliament on the Oppositions demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe on allegations of phone tapping against the government.         
	The motion notice was signed by BJP Lok Sabha leaders Gopinath Munde, Ananth Kumar and Yashwant Sinha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Suicide by Malda farmer
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Suicide by Malda farmer
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Malda, Sept. 3: The body of a farmer who had been missing for the past 10 days was found in a well near his home in Malda today, sparking speculation that he may have committed suicide after his crops failed because of the drought.        
	Sushil Soren, 22, resident of Marali in Habibpur, was neck-deep in debt, a neighbour said. Soren had been missing since August 24.        
	A neighbour, Gokul Roy, said Sushil, who had a two-bigha plot, had borrowed Rs 6,000 from a local moneylender to sow paddy. But his crops dried up because of the lack of rain. He was worried about repaying his debt. I think he killed himself by jumping into the well, Gokul said.        
	Malda police superintendent Bhuban Mondol said: Today, the villagers complained of a stench from the well. A police team fished out the body.        
	He said the post-mortem would reveal whether Sushil had been murdered or committed suicide.        
	Sushils mother Subina has been slipping in and out of consciousness. Sushil has two brothers: Rabi, 16, who works as a labourer in Delhi, and Kabiraj, 6. Their father died 10 years ago.        
	If it is confirmed that Sushil killed himself, it would be the fourth farmer suicide in the state this year, all triggered by the drought. The other three suicides took place in Ausgram, Burdwan.        
	The BJP gram panchayat pradhan, Dipali Mondol, said the entire area was in the grip of drought. Hundreds of farmers are burdened with debt, she said.        
	North Malda Congress MP Musam Noor, who visited Sushils home today, accused the state government of failing to stand by the stricken farmers even after declaring a drought in 11 districts, including Malda.        
	On August 23, finance minister Asim Dasgupta visited Malda and announced a Rs 10-crore package for the farmers but not a single paisa has been distributed, she said.        
	The chief agricultural officer of the district, Satinath Palit, said: So far this year, Malda has received 25 per cent less rainfall than normal. We had expected about 45 to 50 lakh tonnes of paddy yield this time. But it will come down to only 10 lakh tonnes.

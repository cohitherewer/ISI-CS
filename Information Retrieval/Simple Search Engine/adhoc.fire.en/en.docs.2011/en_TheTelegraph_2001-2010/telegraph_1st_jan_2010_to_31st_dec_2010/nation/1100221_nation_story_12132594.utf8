          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Peoples Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR), long accused of being a group made of Maoist sympathisers that fails to condemn extremist violence, has said it is outraged by the Jamui massacre in Bihar.        
	The PUDR said in a statement that the murder of 12 villagers was reported to be in retaliation of the killing of eight Maoist cadres by police on February 1.         
	Even if this is true, what causes concern to us is a party which claims to represent and fight for the emancipation of the poorest of the poor shows such callous disregard for the lives of the very same people, and considers them to be a fair target for acts of revenge, said the PUDR, which has in the past worked for protection of human rights.         
	A day after the Shilda police massacre in Bengal, Union home minister P. Chidambaram had said he would like to hear voices of condemnation of those who have erroneously extended intellectual and material support to the CPI(Maoist).        
	Today, the PUDR said: They (the Maoists) have no one but themselves to blame if all that public will recall of them will be their wanton acts of violence rather than hard and selfless labour of their members.              
	The PUDR statement demanded that the CPI (Maoist) leadership give exemplary punishment to those who carried out the Jamui massacre.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist states asked to guard tracks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: The Centre has asked all Maoist-affected states to deploy as much manpower possible to protect railway tracks, including taking help of village defence committees.         
	The warning came hours after the Bhubaneswar-New Delhi Rajdhani derailed in Gaya after the Maoists blew a hole in the tracks late on Monday.        
	The advisory, sent to Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar, also mentioned intelligence inputs that suggested more such strikes were possible on railway properties.        
	A senior home ministry official said protecting the railways was a manpower intensive exercise because of which all the affected states have been asked to take help of village defence committees, home guards and civil defence committees. An advisory similar to the one issued last week had been sent to the same four states late last week.        
	The Centre, in a statement, condemned the mindless acts of violence and terrorism by the Maoists.         
	It is clear that the CPI(Maoist) are not serious about their pronouncement of stopping violence and having a meaningful dialogue with the Government of India on various issues. Such acts of violence which target innocent people, disturb normal life and damage public property expose the true character of the CPI(Maoist). The Government of India strongly condemns such mindless acts of violence and terrorism and hopes that all right-thinking people will condemn such violence, the statement said.        
	The Union home ministry also mentioned details of the Maoist attacks during the 48-hour bandh call in seven states on Monday. In West Bengal, Maoists blasted a railway track (at Gidhni) in West Midnapore district. In Orissa, the CPI(Maoist) cadres caused two blasts along the Howrah-Mumbai trunk route, causing derailment of a goods train and exploded a bomb near a railway level crossing, both in Sundergarh district.        
	The letter mentioned the Rajdhani accident. In Bihar, Maoists exploded can bombs between Kastha and Paraiya railway stations, district Gaya, causing damage to 2-3 feet of railway track leading to derailment of nine bogies of the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express in which seven passengers sustained minor injuries in the intervening night of March 22-23.

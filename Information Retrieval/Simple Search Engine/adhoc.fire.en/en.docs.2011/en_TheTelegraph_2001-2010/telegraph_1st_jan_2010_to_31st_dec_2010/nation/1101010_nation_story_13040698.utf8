	 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Indias top agency regulating medicine today debarred the scam-tainted doctor and former president of the Medical Council of India Ketan Desai from practising or representing doctors at medical events.           
	Desai had been arrested earlier this year by the CBI on allegations of seeking a bribe from a private medical college. He was released earlier this week to attend the World Medical Association (WMA) conference in Canada where he was to take over as its president.           
	The MCIs board of governors wrote to Desai today that on recommendations of its ethics committee, the MCI has decided to suspend his right to practise medicine.           
	The MCI had on Thursday written to the WMA informing them that Desai was no longer head of the MCI and thus was not eligible to represent Indian doctors at the global association.                  
	 Jammu (PTI): Two Lashkar-e-Toiba militants have been arrested after an encounter broke out between security forces and the rebels in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir, police said. The two have been identified as Abdul Rashid and Mohammad Iqbal.                   
	 Meerut (PTI): The Uttar Pradesh government has shelved plans to construct the proposed Dr B.R. Ambedkar airport near here. The advisory expenditure committee had cited difficulties in acquisition of land and opposed the project.

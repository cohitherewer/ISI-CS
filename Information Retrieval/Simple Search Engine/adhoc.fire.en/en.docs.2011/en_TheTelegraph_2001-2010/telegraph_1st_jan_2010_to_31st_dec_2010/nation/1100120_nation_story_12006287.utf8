	Calcutta, Jan. 19: What started as a trickle in the morning outside a private mortuary swelled through the day at several seats of power with finally a million people hitting the streets of Calcutta to bid farewell to the longest-serving chief minister of an elected communist government.         
	By the time the procession with Jyoti Basus body, which set out from the Peace Haven mortuary for the party office on Alimuddin Street and then went to Writers Buildings, had reached the Assembly, all roads led to Bengals seat of democracy.         
	Slogans  Jyoti Basu lal salaam, Jyoti Basu amar rahe  wafted through the air as people from all walks of life started converging at the Assembly, where Basus body reached around 10.45am. At least 50,000 people had already assembled there by then.         
	Our rough estimates suggest that there were around 6 lakh people in and around the Assembly and only a third of them, around 2 lakh, could enter the premises to have a glimpse of the leader, said a senior police officer in charge of managing the crowd at the Assembly.         
	When the procession left the Assembly at 3.25pm for Citizens Park, a sea of people gathered along the two sides of Red Road, Casuarina Avenue, Queensway and Cathedral Road. The area around SSKM Hospital and Citizens Park was also crowded with thousands of people waiting for a glimpse of Basu before the gun carriage arrived. After that, the road in front of the park was barricaded.         
	If we take into account the first and the last legs of the journey and the turnout at the Assembly, the crowd count must have been over 10 lakh, said a veteran Calcutta police officer.         
	As the crowd count heading towards the Assembly went up with each passing hour, the police had to restrict the traffic flow in that direction.         
	The participation of ordinary people in todays procession reminded several Calcuttans of the last journeys of Mother Teresa and Satyajit Ray, which had also drawn lakhs of people.         
	I have never seen so many people at a funeral. Jyotibabu has made history even in his final journey, said Amrita Singharoy, 59, a homemaker from Birati, who waited three hours at Lenin Sarani for a glimpse of the body.         
	The procession started sharp at 7.30am, with around 500 people, from Peace Haven on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and went towards Alimuddin Street. Nearly 2,000 people joined the procession at Park Street.         
	By 8am, the procession reached the CPM headquarters, where only members of the partys politburo, central committee and state committee paid homage to their leader. By the time the procession left Alimuddin Street for Writers, the count had gone up to almost 25,000 people.         
	In the morning, primarily people from Calcutta had joined the procession. But as the day wore on, people from the districts started arriving and the count went up, said a CPM state committee member.

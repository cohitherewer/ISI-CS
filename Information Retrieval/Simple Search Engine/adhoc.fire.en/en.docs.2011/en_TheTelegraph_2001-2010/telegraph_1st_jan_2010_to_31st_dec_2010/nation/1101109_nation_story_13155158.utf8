The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Headley warnings that went unheeded 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Headley warnings that went unheeded 
                            
	Washington, Nov. 8: American authorities sent David Coleman-Headley, a small-time drug dealer and sometime informant, to work for them in Pakistan months after the 9/11 attacks, despite a warning that he sympathised with radical Islamic groups, according to court records and interviews.         
	Not long after Headley arrived there, he began training with terrorists, eventually playing a key role in the 26/11 attacks that left 164 people dead in Mumbai.        
	The October 2001 warning was dismissed, the authorities said, as the ire of a jilted girlfriend and for lack of proof. Less than a month later, those concerns did not come up when a federal court in New York granted Headley an early release from probation so that he could be sent to work for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Pakistan. It is unclear what Headley was supposed to do in Pakistan for the Americans.        
	Yesterday, while President Obama was visiting India, he briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the status of his administrations investigation of Headley, including the failure to act on repeated warnings that he might be a terrorist.         
	The director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr, began an investigation into Headleys government connections after reports last month that two of the former drug dealers former wives had gone to American authorities between 2005 and 2008, before the Mumbai attacks, to say they feared he was plotting with terrorists.         
	An examination of Headleys story shows that his government ties ran far deeper and longer than previously known. One senior American official knowledgeable about the case said he believed that Headley was a DEA informant until at least 2003, meaning that he was talking to American agencies even as he was learning to deal with explosives and small arms in terrorist training camps.        
	Fuller details of how the government handled the matter were provided to The Times by officials who did not want to be quoted discussing a continuing inquiry.         
	They disclosed that the FBI actually talked to Headley about the girlfriend, and he told them she was unreliable. They said that while he seemed to have a philosophical affinity for some groups, there was no evidence that he was plotting against the US. Also influencing the handling of the case, they said, was that he had been a long-time informant.        
	The Indian government has been outspoken in its concerns that the US overlooked repeated warnings about Headleys terrorist activities. Bruce . Riedel, a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution and a former CIA officer, said the Indians were right to ask: Why werent alarms screaming?         
	American authorities have not disclosed what happened after Headley resumed his role as an informant. But in December 2001, the same month that Headley departed for Pakistan, the US designated the Pakistani group Lashkar-e-Toiba as a terrorist organisation. Less than two months later  in February 2002  Headley began training with the group on the merits of waging jihad.

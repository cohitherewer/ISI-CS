The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | House committee concern over canal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      House committee concern over canal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Pollution on rise                                  
	Cuttack, March 2: A House Committees visit has triggered fresh concern over health threats for the people in the region due to contamination of Taladanda, the states longest canal that starts at Jobra (Cuttack) and links the Mahanadi river with the Bay of Bengal at Paradip, 83km away.        
	Though Orissa High Court constituted a high-level committee in March last year for a field study on alleged contamination of the waterway by untreated sewage along with biomedical waste generated in Cuttack, nothing tangible had followed.        
	In a PIL, city-based socio-cultural organisation Maitree Sansad had pressed for implementation of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment and Forests. The committee had surveyed the pollution problem in the Taladanda canal and submitted a report in 2005. The Orissa State Pollution Control Board had in a report indicated that there were at least 17 inlets through which untreated water and sewage from the city were finding their way into the canal, which meanders through Cuttack and Jagatsinghpur districts before reaching the Bay of Bengal.        
	A Legislative Committee on Environment headed by Amar Satpathy appraised the Taladanda pollution problem on Friday last week and found that the flow of untreated water and sewage into it had been checked in five inlets but the inflow through the rest 12 inlets  mostly from slum pockets  continues unchecked, increasing the pollution load in the canal.        
	There is a need for urgent measures to effectively address the pollution problems, observed a member of the House Committee.        
	The administration had since stepped up measures to check bio-medical wastes from finding their way into the canal. Stringent measures are being initiated to ensure proper disposal of biomedical wastes generated by the 100-odd private nursing homes in the city, Cuttack collector Kishore Kumar Mohanty said.

	Behrampore, Oct. 20: The Goddess has left but not the trail of trash dumped in the Bhagirathi in her name.        
	The river in Murshidabads Behrampore is clogged with idols immersed in violation of rules framed by the civic body, forcing the authorities to announce that they would conduct the ritual for a fee from next year.        
	We will engage our own people to carry out the immersions. We have learnt a lesson this year, said Nilratan Adhya, the chairperson of the Behrampore Municipality, which will now have to mount the clean-up operation.        
	He accused nearly 50 puja organisers of Behrampore town of not having kept their word.         
	We had entered into a written agreement with the 200-odd puja organisers that the idols would have to be dragged out of the water after immersion. Also, it was agreed that the flowers, garlands and other material used in the puja would not be dumped in the water. But nearly 50 of the organisers did not listen to us, said Adhya.        
	The immersion rules were framed by the civic body based on guidelines from the state pollution control board.        
	A search is on for the culprits but since no official was posted on the Bhagirathis banks during the past three days of immersion, catching them is proving difficult.         
	It was like searching for a needle in a haystack. There was no one posted at the immersion points on the riverbank. No Puja organiser admitted having left their idol behind. So it was not possible for us pinpoint the culprits, said an official of the civic body.        
	The fee move has not gone down well with some of the Puja organisers who claim to have followed the rules. Why should we take a hit next year and pay a fee to get our idols immersed? We will suffer because of the fault of organisers who have not followed the rules, said Ashis Bagchi, secretary of Tarun Sangha Puja Committee in Behrampore.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the state pollution control boards chief law officer, said he would inquire when told about the mess in the Bhagirathi.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: For years the houses of justice had stood proudly above the political fad for name games, bearing their old identities that appeared to lend them a touch of timelessness.        
	Now it seems that the Calcutta, Madras, Gauhati and Bombay High Courts may have to follow their cities of location in going native, changing their names to Kolkata, Chennai, Guwahati and Mumbai High Court.        
	The government is mulling over just such a proposal, the law and justice ministry has said in its reply to an RTI application from activist Subhas Agrawal.        
	The proposal has been pending for sometime, with the government yet to get around to changing the two British-era laws that created these four high courts.        
	The High Courts Act, 1861, set up Bombay High Court, Calcutta High Court and Madras High Court. Gauhati High Court was set up by the Government of India Act, 1935. These laws can only be changed through an act of Parliament, which would require a political consensus to push a bill through in both Houses.        
	Way back in 2005, the parliamentary standing committee on law and justice had recommended renaming these high courts. The panel, headed by Congress member E.M. Sudershan Natchiappan, had said the move would eliminate confusion among the public. It had added that clinging to the old names was anachronistic.        
	The government told Agrawal: The proposal to change the names of Bombay High Court as Mumbai High Court, Calcutta High Court as Kolkata High Court, Gauhati High Court as Guwahati High Court and Madras High Court as Chennai High Court is under consideration of the government.        
	It added that there was no move to rename any other high court.

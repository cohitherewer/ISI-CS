          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, July 25: Even if his Bengal comrades had not forced his hand, Prakash Karat may well have needed a separate poll strategy for Kerala, it seems.        
	The Catholic Church in the southern state has issued a pastoral letter asking its flock to shun atheist parties and vote only for God-fearing candidates.        
	The letter, which does not name Keralas ruling CPM, also asks people not to be misled when the atheist parties field God-fearing popular persons as Independent candidates to garner Christians votes.        
	The circular, issued by the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council, was read out in parishes across the state on July 18, Sunday.        
	In a state where Christians make up 20-25 per cent of the population, CPM leaders have been quick to criticise the letter as a politically prejudiced move, aimed at helping the Lefts opponents and securing the narrow interests of the Church establishment.        
	After panchayat elections in October, Kerala will hold Assembly polls next year for which the CPM will have a strategy distinct from its Bengal units, Karat announced on Friday.        
	Kerala finance minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the Church letter was an attempt by the bishops to reduce elections to a referendum on faith at the cost of real issues. We are not against religion but we will resist this move by religious leaders to interfere in politics, he added.        
	The bishops defended the pastoral letter. The Church has every right to make its faithful conscious about the threats and dangers to the faith. When we see a trap, its the duty of Church leaders to warn people about that, said Fr Thelakkat of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council.        
	Of late, the Left has been putting up Independent minority candidates in minority-dominated areas, and the ploy has often been successful. However, its overall efforts to cosy up to the minorities have met with limited success, especially among Christians.

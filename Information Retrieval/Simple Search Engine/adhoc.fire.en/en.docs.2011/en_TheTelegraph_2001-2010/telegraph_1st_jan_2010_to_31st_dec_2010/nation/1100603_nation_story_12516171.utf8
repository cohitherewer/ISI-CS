The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen names two RS nominees
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Naveen names two RS nominees
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Naveen                                   
	Bhubaneswar, June 2: Ending all speculations, BJD chief Naveen Patnaik today announced the names of two more party candidates for the June 17 Rajya Sabha elections.        
	Former legislator and Dalit leader Shashi Bhusan Behera was given a party ticket for the second seat, while party general secretary Baisnab Parida was nominated as the nominee for the third seat.        
	Earlier, sitting Rajya Sabha member Pyari Mohan Mohapatra had been renominated as the party candidate for the first seat.        
	Three seats from Orissa are falling vacant following expiry of term of Mohapatra, R.K. Nayak (Congress) and Bhagirathi Majhi (BJP).         
	Political observers believe that Behera was rewarded for his sacrifice during the 2009 elections. He had been denied renomination from Jaydev (SC) constituency to accommodate former minister and BJP leader Arabinda Dhali.        
	On the other hand, Parida, a new entrant to the party, got nominated for the Upper House because of his loyalty to Mohapatra, considered as the principal adviser to chief minister Naveen.         
	Parida, who had started his political career from the CPI, had crossed over several parties, including the Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, before finally joining the BJD a couple of years ago.         
	As the arithmetic stands, the BJD is short of eight seats to win the third seat on its own strength. It requires 111 single preference votes to win the three RS seats. However, it has 103 members in the 147-member Assembly. But NCP, which has four members in the House, CPI (1) and two of six Independents support BJD.         
	The Congress, which has 27 MLAs, is yet to decide its candidate. Congress legislature party leader Bhupinder Singh today met Rahul Gandhi along with legislators to discuss about RS nomination, insiders said. The BJP, which has only seven MLAs, is likely to abstain from voting.

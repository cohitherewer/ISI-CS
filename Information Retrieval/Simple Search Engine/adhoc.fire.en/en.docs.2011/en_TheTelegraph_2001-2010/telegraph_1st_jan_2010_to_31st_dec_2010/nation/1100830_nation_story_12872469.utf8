The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSF suffers first Maoist hit in Chhattisgarh
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BSF suffers first Maoist hit in Chhattisgarh
          SHEENA K                              
	Raipur, Aug. 29: The BSF suffered its first casualties at the hands of Maoists in Chhattisgarh today, losing three jawans in an ambush apparently laid for a state ministers convoy.        
	The overall toll was five, with a state police constable and a special police officer (SPO) too killed in the morning attack by about 200 rebels near Durg Kondal, about 250km from state capital Raipur, in Kanker district.        
	Officers were, however, quick to highlight the minimum casualties, saying the team of 68 BSF jawans, state policemen and SPOs fought back for over five hours and forced the rebels to retreat before reinforcements arrived.        
	Intelligence officials said the ambush was probably laid for Chhattisgarh forest minister Vikram Usendi, who was to pass through the same area around the time the security forces were attacked.        
	The minister was scheduled to visit Pakhanjore, about 50km from Durg Kondal, this morning to attend a convention organised by a journalists body, an official said. The visit was cancelled last night but only the police brass knew about it.        
	When the minister failed to turn up, the rebels ambushed the security personnel who had left Durg Kondal on a search operation around 5am.        
	One reason the casualties were low, the official said, could be that the ambush was probably laid for a convoy the ministers  while the jawans were travelling on foot.        
	Kanker superintendent of police Ajay Yadav said the forces had hardly travelled 8km when they were attacked near Bhuski village. The thickly forested area provided cover for the rebels.        
	Still, the jawans gave a fitting reply and stopped the Maoists from inflicting maximum casualties, Yadav said. Other than the five killed, only one jawan suffered injuries, he added.        
	Five BSF battalions, made up of about 5,000 personnel, have been deployed in Chhattisgarhs Maoist zones. The lack of casualties among them before today reflected the good work they were doing, the intelligence official said.        
	Bihar encounter        
	Five policemen were reportedly killed in an encounter with CPI(Maoist) rebels in Lakhisarai district of Bihar on Sunday.         
	The injured jawans of Special Auxiliary Police have been admitted to a local hospital.        
	Bihar director-general of police Neel Mani said that acting on a tip-off that a group of Maoists had assembled in the hilly areas under Kajra police station, a team led by Lakhisarai police superintendent A.K. Singh went to the forest.        
	On seeing the police, the Maoists started firing. The police retaliated, leading to a gunbattle.         
	The encounter is still on, the police said this evening.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       A child at one of the blast sites in Kabul (AFP)                          
	New Delhi, March 2: The Centre is considering plans to deploy more Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel in Afghanistan, a move that may see embassy officials, aid agencies and private-sector employees there get personal security.        
	Security agencies believe that with Pakistans unease at Indian presence in Afghanistan, terror strikes on Indian establishments may continue. New Delhi hasnt, however, accused Pakistan of engineering Fridays strike in Kabul in which six Indians were killed.        
	Senior home ministry officials are waiting for the report of the Indian investigators who are now in Kabul to probe last weeks attack before chalking out a detailed security plan. National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon is scheduled to land in the Afghan capital on Friday along with officials of the Intelligence Bureau.        
	A senior home ministry official said it was now certain that more ITBP personnel would be deployed. Our aid and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan will continue. A team of Indian officials was in Kabul a few months back to assess the situation. Their assessment, along with that of the current team (sent after the terrorist strike on Friday), will help us in formulating a new security plan, said the official.        
	There are about 4,000 Indians engaged in projects being funded from Indias $1.3-billion assistance to the war-torn nation. The officials are vulnerable as they work in hospitals, schools, power plants and other public places.

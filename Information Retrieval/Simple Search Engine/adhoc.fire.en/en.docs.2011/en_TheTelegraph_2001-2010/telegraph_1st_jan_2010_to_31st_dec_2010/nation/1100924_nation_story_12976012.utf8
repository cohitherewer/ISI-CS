          OUR BUREAU                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: The CPM has fallen back on its original foot soldiers to take on the Trinamul Congress in next years Assembly elections.         
	Senior CPM leaders sent out a clear message to over 1.6 lakh teachers  employed in around 60,000 state-aided primary schools across Bengal  that the time had come for them to pay back the party that gave them a better deal.         
	Deviating from the usual practice of advising teachers on how to impart education and announcing a few sops for the teaching community, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee sought their help to save the government.         
	Efforts are being made by reactionary forces like Trinamul and Maoists to uproot our government. You all will have to go back to your workplaces and join the people in building up resistance against Trinamul and the Maoists I dont want to talk about your issues today, Bhattacharjee said while addressing a gathering of around 8,000 primary teachers.         
	The CPM-backed All Bengal Primary Teachers Association (ABPTA) had organised a two-day sit-in demonstration at Metro Channel to condemn the killing of 31 school employees, including 23 primary teachers, in the Jungle Mahal area. Bhattacharjee, along with his cabinet and party colleagues, was invited to speak at the meeting today. All of us should stand united at this hour, said the chief minister.        
	With Trinamul steadily gaining ground in rural and urban Bengal, CPM will face one of the toughest challenges in next years Assembly elections since it led the Left parties to power in 1977.         
	Primary teachers  disgruntled with the low pay scale during the Congress regime  played an important role in bringing about the change in Bengal.        
	 The Left Front government rewarded them with a five-fold hike in minimum pay, from Rs 60 a month to Rs 300 in less than four years. Secondary and higher secondary school teachers were also the beneficiaries of the largesse as the salary of post-graduate secondary school teachers was raised from Rs 220 in 1977 to Rs 550 in 1981.         
	Our leaders realised from the very beginning that schoolteachers were crucial in strengthening our organisation in rural areas as they were the opinion makers. In this hour of crisis, we need their support, said a senior CPM leader.        
	Primary teachers carrying jholas, cycling from one village to another and campaigning for the Left candidates or talking about the benefits of land reforms, were a fixture in rural Bengal in the seventies and the eighties.         
	As the aim was to control education, CPMs education czars also managed to dominate college and university teachers associations through appointment of party nominees in key positions.        
	Primary teachers, however, remained the partys priority because of their numbers.         
	In the past two years, Trinamul has managed to infiltrate the college and university teachers associations but the CPMs hegemony in the ABPTA remains undisputed.        
	The party today sought to consolidate that base. We have already recruited more than 42,000 new teachers in our primary schools. But there can be many among them who may not be aware of our contribution. Go back and tell the new recruits how we had fought for them, school education minister Partha De told the gathering.

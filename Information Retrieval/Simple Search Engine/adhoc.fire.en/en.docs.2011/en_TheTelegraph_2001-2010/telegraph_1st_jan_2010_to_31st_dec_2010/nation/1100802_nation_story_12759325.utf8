	Kathmandu, Aug. 1 (PTI): The Supreme Court of Nepal has ordered Charles Sobhrajs wife Nihita Biswas, and her mother Shankuntala Thapa, who is his lawyer, to appear before it within three days for contempt of court.         
	The duo had accused the judges of corruption following a verdict on July 30 which upheld Sobhrajs life sentence.        
	The courts directive came in response to a petition filed by advocates Rajan Adhikari and Shanta Sedhain.         
	Justice Ram Kumar Prasad Shah, one of the two judges who announced the verdict against Sobhraj in the 1975 murder case of American tourist Connie Jo Bronzich, ordered police to arrest the two women if they did not surrender within three days and present them before the apex court.        
	How can you convict a person without any evidence? Shankuntala had asked after the verdict. We provided all the evidence necessary to prove that he is not guilty. They simply did not look at the facts, she said, adding her client was denied justice.        
	If convicted for contempt of court, they face a years imprisonment and/or a fine of Rs 10,000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raped by teacher, dumped by parents
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raped by teacher, dumped by parents
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Nov. 30: A 13-year-old student who was allegedly raped by her math teacher today came in for another shock when her parents marched off, leaving her stranded at a district collectors office.        
	Refusing to listen to officials or wait to speak to the collector at the Theni office, about 500kms from here, one of the parents said: We expected you to take care of our child at your school. But you did not. We dont require her now. You take care of her. As a punishment, you should take care of our girl now.        
	A Class VIII student of the residential Government Higher Secondary School at T. Bomminayakan Patti village, the girl was allegedly violated twice by her teacher, Mahendran, with the threat that he would fail her if she spurned him or dared to spill the beans.        
	Police said the girl kept mum about the incident for over a week, complaining to her mother only on November 25 when she went home. Her parents Soundarapandi and Annakili, both agricultural labourers, immediately lodged a police complaint.        
	Mahendran, who had been absconding, surrendered yesterday at the local court, the police said. Since the girl disclosed the matter after a week, a physical examination did not yield the exact results that come up in a rape case. So we are relying more on circumstantial evidence and interrogation, a police officer said.        
	After the parents left, the district officials took the girl to a government home. We will ask the parents to attend counselling, district collector Muthuveeran said.

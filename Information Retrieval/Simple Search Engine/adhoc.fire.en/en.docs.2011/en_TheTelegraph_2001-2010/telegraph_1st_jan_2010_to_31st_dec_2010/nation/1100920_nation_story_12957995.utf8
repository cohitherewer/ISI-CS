          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: When Mohammed Salim saw the tall and fair attackers ride in from the direction of the Red Fort, stop before the Jama Masjid and fire at the foreign tourists, he was frightened for a moment. Then he picked up a brick.         
	The pillion rider initially fired 8 to 12 bullets. Then the magazine dropped to the ground and I saw him reloading the gun. Realising he would fire again, I threw a brick at him, said the rickshaw-puller, the lone eyewitness.        
	He looked towards me and said something to the rider. I tried to chase them but they fired twice in the air and fled towards Chowribazar.        
	He added: They would be in their early 30s. They wore helmets but their faces were not covered. The shooter wore a green T-shirt.        
	The police are trying to develop sketches of the duo from Salims descriptions. An officer said seven empty cartridges were found on the road and the tourist bus had a bullet hole and a shattered windowpane. The weapon used could be a .38 or a 9mm revolver or a pistol, he said.        
	A large number of Indian and foreign tourists visit the Jama Masjid on Sundays. A strong police team has been deployed around the mosque and the area has been cordoned off.         
	The police are conducting checks at all entry and exit points in Delhi and have banned parking of vehicles outside important buildings and near the venues from today.        
	An Indian Mujahideen statement condemned the killing of civilians in Kashmir but did not mention the Jama Masjid firing.        
	We know that preparations for the Games are at their peak; beware, we too are preparing in full swing for a great surprise, it said. The participants will be solely responsible for the outcome (of our attacks) as our mujahideen love death more than you love life.        
	The email said the attacks would be a tribute to Atif Amin and Mohammed Sajid, the youths slain at Batla House.        
	The six-member Taiwanese group, who PTI said work with a TV channel in their country, had arrived yesterday and planned to visit Jaipur and Agra before returning home on September 27.        
	The injured are at the ICU of Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Hospital, where chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Union home minister P. Chidambaram paid a visit.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: A fresh monkeygate has burst into Indias sporting scene with a South African swimmer at the Commonwealth Games comparing some spectators to monkeys.        
	Organising official Lalit Bhanot of hygiene-gate fame, too, continued to embarrass his compatriots today by misunderstanding Roland Schoemans remarks and suggesting a crowd of real monkeys may indeed have given the swimmer cause for annoyance.        
	Many western contestants have complained with reason about Indian spectators failure to maintain silence during key moments of events, but Schoeman went further than anyone else yesterday.        
	It is unacceptable to... have people going on like monkeys, said the swimmer who was nearly disqualified from the 50m freestyle semi-finals after failing to hear the referee because of the noise.        
	His comments were made to TV channel Network 10 of Australia, whose police were enmeshed in a scandal today for making racist jokes over the electrocution of an Indian train passenger. Ironically, monkey is considered a term of racist abuse in Australia and its alleged use had led to the infamous monkeygate row involving Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds three years ago.         
	Bhanot, the organising committee secretary-general, however, provided some comic relief when asked to react to Schoemans comment. There are monkeys in that area and we are trying to get them out, Bhanot said, thinking the reference was to Delhis ubiquitous simians.        
	Bhanot had earlier been roasted for suggesting westerners had higher hygiene standards than Indians when questioned about the filthy conditions at the Games Village, with author Salman Rushdie saying he should be spanked.        
	Schoeman later said his comments were directed solely at an individual spectator and that otherwise, the spectators have been fantastic.        
	Another controversy broke out when Indias chief archery coach, Limba Ram, said an English official showed me his elbow and hurled expletives when he extended his hand towards the Briton after the English women teams one-point defeat to India yesterday. The English archers too complained about crowd behaviour but did not blame the defeat on them.        
	The crowd were intentionally shouting.... It was not good sportsmanship, said an English archery team official, Hilda Gibson. World archery body Fita has threatened to stop the competition if such crowd behaviour is repeated.        
	The Games organising committee has now asked officials, volunteers and announcers to ensure that crowd behaviour is appropriate... and in particular, silence is maintained at critical points.        
	Games Federation boss Mike Fennell, however, said crowd control was a problem across the world.

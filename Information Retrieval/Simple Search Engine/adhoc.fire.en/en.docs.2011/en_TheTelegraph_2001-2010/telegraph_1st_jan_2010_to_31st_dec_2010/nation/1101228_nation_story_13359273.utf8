          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vinod Rai                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Comptroller and auditor-general Vinod Rai today explained to the Murli Manohar Joshi-headed public accounts committee (PAC) how the 2G spectrum loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore had been arrived at.         
	The sum, etched in public consciousness since the scam revolving around A. Raja broke, is a presumptive figure, indicating what could have flowed into the Centres coffers if the spectrum sales to telecom firms had been fair.        
	BJP leader Joshi said Rai helped the PAC understand the basis of its report as well as the many technicalities involved.        
	The CAG, in a report tabled in the Parliament in November, had found serious irregularities in the manner in which 2G spectrum and licences were allocated in 2008 by Raja, who resigned following the allegations and was quizzed by the CBI last week.        
	At the PAC meeting this morning, the CAG explained the timeline of its report  it covers 2003, a year before UPA I came to power  and the methods applied to compute the notional loss figures, which range from Rs 57,000 crore to Rs 1.76 lakh crore.         
	Joshi and his colleagues were also given a briefing on the technical matters such as definition of spectrum  radio waves carrying mobile calls and data  and the amount of the resource given to each operator.         
	The CAG is a part of the PAC and has the constitutional obligation to assist us in understanding the basis of its report on 2G spectrum and related technical issues, Joshi told reporters.         
	The CAG report looks into accurate implementation of telecom policies, but the PAC can examine overall policy, even those of the BJP-led NDA years.         
	 Our agenda is only 2G but if required, we can go back and look into previous reports, Joshi said.        
	It was under the NDA government in 1999 that the telecom department shifted from a fixed-licence fee model, when annual fees paid by each operator was over Rs 2,000 crore, to a revenue-sharing system in 1999 when the fee was only Rs 5-10 crore.        
	The PAC comprises 22 MPs  14 from the Lok Sabha and eight from the Rajya Sabha. Ithad held its first meeting on the 2G report on November 22.         
	The CAG has explained that the methods applied to reach the notional loss are based on international accounting practices, Joshi said.         
	The figure of Rs 1.76 lakh crore includes an estimated loss of Rs 1.02 lakh crore from the issue of 122 new licences for 2G spectrum, Rs 37,154 crore from 35 dual technology (CDMA and GSM) licences and Rs 36,993 crore from allocation of extra spectrum to existing players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Difference between paralysis and boycott: Rs 2000 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Difference between paralysis and boycott: Rs 2000 
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The reason Basudeb Acharia was doubtful about getting a quorum for a meeting he was to chair today is also the reason the Opposition doesnt want to boycott Parliament but will paralyse it.        
	Rs 2,000  the daily allowance an MP gets to attend Parliament when it is in session and attend committee meetings when it is not  was the cause of Acharias headache.        
	The CPM MP, who chairs a parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, was unsure of getting the minimum members to hold the scheduled meeting because the House is in session now and MPs wont get paid extra to attend the meeting.        
	The travel and daily allowance is also believed to be a big reason why the Opposition, which has paralysed Parliament for nearly 10 days now to push for a JPC probe in the spectrum issue, is keeping from boycotting it.         
	MPs stand to lose their TA amp; DA if they stay away from Parliament. So, they come to the House every day to mark their attendance and then leave.        
	Apart from a daily allowance of Rs 2,000, they get free train and air travel.        
	Past records show that it takes a long struggle by the Opposition to get the government to agree to a JPC probe. In 1989, a JPC probe was ordered into the Bofors scam after a united Opposition held on for 45 days, which included days of boycott.        
	At first we forced adjournments. Then the entire Opposition started boycott. It went on for some 25-30 days. Then, too, the Congress government did not agree and then on August 30, 1989, all Opposition MPs resigned and the government gave in, recalled Acharia, a nine-time MP.        
	In the Harshad Mehta case, Parliament was paralysed for 17 days before a JPC probe was ordered.        
	So why are they not taking the boycott road this time? Consultations over the issue have not taken place. The option might be considered if the government continues to reject our demand, Acharia said.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha, today said the government had not been able to find a solution to the logjam while another minister ruled out winding up the House before the winter sessions scheduled end on December 13. I dont know how to resolve this impasse. Were trying, lets see, Mukherjee said.        
	Congress MP and party spokesperson Manish Tewari said MPs have no right to draw salary and allowances if they dont allow Parliament to function. Taking salary without work is illegal, he said.        
	Tewari has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, urging her to deprive MPs disrupting the House of their pay.        
	Why should we sacrifice our salary and allowances? The government has no moral authority to advise us when it is involved in scams worth crores, said RJD MP Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, adding MPs should sit on dharna after both Houses are adjourned.        
	Acharia pointed a finger at the BJP. In 1989, the BJP had only two members in the House. Now they are the principal Opposition, he said, adding the party had gone on the back foot on corruption by choosing to back Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.

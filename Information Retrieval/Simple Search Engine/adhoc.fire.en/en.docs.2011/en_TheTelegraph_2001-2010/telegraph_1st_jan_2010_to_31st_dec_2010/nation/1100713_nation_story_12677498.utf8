          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 12: Army chief General V.K. Singh has rued that civil administrators had not built on the successes of security forces in Jammu and Kashmir where law and order has been severely disrupted after relative calm.        
	The army was on standby in the Kashmir valley and patrolled through Srinagars streets last week after mobs pelted security personnel with stones and at least 11 youths were killed in police firing in the past month.        
	So far as the army is concerned, I think as security forces, a lot of work has been done. The situation has been brought to a particular level when other initiatives should have started to make way for betterment, he told a television channel in an interview.         
	The Kashmir situation has been tense for quite sometime and the reasons are many. The basic reason being that we have not been able to build on the gains that have been made, General Singh said.        
	Asked why the army was deployed when governments had been asking for the police to take the responsibility, Singh said: I think there was a sort of loss of confidence and they thought the army should be seen more prominently.        
	We said yes (to the deployment) as we are as much concerned as anyone else. The army is already there. It is already carrying out (operations) with the CRPF, with the police, in conjunction with the state. So we are there for various things and helping them.        
	Asked about de-inducting the army from Kashmir, General Singh said: Our deployment is dynamic, if we have reduced our deployment in the hinterland, we have strengthened our anti-infiltration grid so when you say de-induct, de-induct from where, for what, I really dont know. We are there to ensure the security on the Line of Control and the border thats the task given to us.         
	He said the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) was necessary in areas where the army was giving aid to civil authority to maintain peace. For special situations you need special measures, he said.

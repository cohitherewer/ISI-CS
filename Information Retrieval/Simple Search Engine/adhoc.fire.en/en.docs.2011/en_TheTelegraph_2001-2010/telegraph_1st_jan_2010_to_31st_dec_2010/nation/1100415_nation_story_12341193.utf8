The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bikash says no to polls
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bikash says no to polls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharya                                  
	Calcutta, April 14: Calcutta mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has told the CPM leadership that he will not contest next months municipal corporation polls.        
	Asked whether he was reluctant to be in the fray for the second time, the mayor told The Telegraph: I have told the CPM leadership that I will not contest elections this time. He didnt specify what he would do if the party top brass insisted. I dont know about the partys approval. It is not a question of the party saying yes or no. I have made my stand clear to the party that I wont contest. I have played my innings, the mayor said.        
	Bhattacharyya had contested the civic polls for the first time in 2005 and became the mayor on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees insistence. However, it is believed the chief minister is not happy with his performance.         
	Bikashbabu has spent more time away from the corporation than on attending to the work here, said a civic official.        
	Asked about Bhattacharyyas reluctance, a CPM state secretariat member said: Its true that he told the party about his unwillingness to contest. We are told he is firm on his stand. So, it will be difficult to persuade him, it seems.        
	The CPM leadership is now trying to field former MP and councillor Sudhansu Sil , it is learnt. Sudhansubabu is likely to contest from a north Calcutta ward. Although we are not projecting anybody as the mayoral candidate, somebody has to be kept in mind as Bikashdas replacement if we win. We are also considering Mohammad Salim alongside Sudhansubabu, said a Calcutta district committee leader.         
	The CPM failed to finalise and submit its list of candidates for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) polls at a meeting of the Calcutta district committee of the Left Front today. Front chairman Biman Bose is scheduled to announce the final list tomorrow.        
	We had a discussion on the probable candidates. However, the CPM could not submit its list. CPM leaders are facing certain problems in choosing candidates and they want to replace the current mayors-in-council with new candidates. We were told the mayor is not willing to contest, an RSP leader said.        
	A CPM state secretariat member said certain issues had to be sorted out. Some mayors-in-council need to be replaced. We will have to take a final decision by tomorrow morning so Bimanda can announce the front list in the afternoon. The RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI submitted their lists to the front a week ago.        
	The CPM leadership is also likely to deviate from its earlier decision not to field candidates who have been councillors for three terms, sources said.         
	Its true that we had decided not to nominate candidates who have been councillors for three terms. But we are likely to make an exception in the case of three or four candidates, a source said.        
	Among the three candidates who may be renominated are Abu Sufiyan and Amal Mitra. Sufiyan is member, mayor-in-council (bustee), of the CMC board while Mitra is the front chief whip in the civic body.

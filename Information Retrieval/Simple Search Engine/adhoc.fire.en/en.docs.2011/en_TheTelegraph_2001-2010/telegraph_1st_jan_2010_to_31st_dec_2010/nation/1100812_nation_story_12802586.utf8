  - Mumbai civic body begins collecting samples from markets        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A boy stands near packets of tea washed ashore from a container that fell off MSC Chitra in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                         
	Mumbai, Aug. 11: Over 500kg of fish samples in Mumbai have been found contaminated by the oil spill a day after the slick reached the citys shores.        
	The contaminated fish were collected from the three transportation points at Sassoon Dock (south Mumbai), Sewree (central Mumbai) and Bhaucha Dhakka (south-central Mumbai), the civic body reported.        
	The corporation has begun collecting fish samples from across the prime fish markets in the city and its suburbs.        
	Mumbai has 52 fish markets. We started a sample collection drive yesterday and have collected 24 samples so far. They have been sent to a municipal laboratory. The report will be available in a week, assistant municipal commissioner (markets) Deepak Kamath said.        
	The state government has asked its fisheries department to carry out random sampling at fish-landing locations like Sassoon Dock. The government had banned fishing on the coast after the MSC Chitra and the MV Khalijia-3 collided on Saturday morning off the Gateway of India shoreline, causing Chitra to tilt and disgorge 400 to 500 tonnes of oil.        
	Shipping authorities today formally acknowledged that the slick had reached the citys shores.        
	A directorate-general of shipping statement said: Oil slick has been sighted ashore, at Nariman Point to Cuffe Parade in Mumbai; Vashi and Airoli in Thane district; (and) Uran, Mandwa and Elephanta in Raigad District. Elephanta and Navi Mumbai/Barc (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) are reportedly the only sites where mangroves have been indicated to be affected.        
	Shipping authorities said Chitra appeared to have more or less stopped leaking oil since Monday. The Singapore-based salvaging company, SMIT International, today began retrieving the cargo containers that had fallen off the Chitra and secured 10 to 15 of them. Efforts to stabilise the precariously tilted ship failed, though, because of the choppy conditions.        
	The navy made a survey of the entire navigation channel in Mumbai harbour so that port authorities can decide when to reopen shipping traffic.        
	The captains of the two vessels have blamed each other for the collision. Captain Laxman Dubey of the Khalijia-3, which carried a St Kitts flag, told police he had tried to contact Chitra captain M. Ranjit Martin three times over the radio but received no response.        
	Martin told a sessions court, which restrained police from arresting him till August 18, that Dubeys negligence was responsible. He said the Khalijia-3 had not been seaworthy after being grounded by Mumbai port authorities following an accident on July 19. The vessel had been moving towards the port on August 7 when it collided with the outward-bound Chitra.

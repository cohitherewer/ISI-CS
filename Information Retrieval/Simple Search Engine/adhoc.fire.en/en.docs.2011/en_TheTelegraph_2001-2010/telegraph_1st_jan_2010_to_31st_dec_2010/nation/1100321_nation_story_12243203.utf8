          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, March 20: A government doctor accused by the CBI of fudging evidence to prove two Shopian women were raped before being murdered himself faced a rape case today after an MMS clip purportedly showed him having sex in his office.        
	State police have registered a case against Dr Ghulam Qadir Sofi under Section 376D of Kashmirs Ranbir Penal Code that deals with rape by a member of a hospitals management.        
	Police sources said the woman purportedly seen having sex with Dr Sofi, the chief medical officer of Pulwama, appeared to have been looking for a job. She seems to be a nurse, an officer said.        
	The state health department suspended Dr Sofi after the MMS clip began circulating, and has launched its own inquiry. Dr Sofi is currently on bail for alleged fabrication of evidence in the Shopian rape and murder case.        
	Kashmir had witnessed massive protests last year after the bodies of Asiya and her sister-in-law Neelofar were recovered from a stream on May 30, with people alleging they were raped and murdered by the security forces.        
	The CBI later came out with a report claiming the women had died by drowning. The report accused a team of six doctors, including Dr Sofi, of preparing slides with vaginal smear from two unknown women and passing them off as the Shopian womens to prove rape. Dr Sofi was then deputy medical superintendent.        
	He (Dr Sofi) has been put under suspension and attached with the directorate of health services, said Dr M.A. Wani, director of health services.

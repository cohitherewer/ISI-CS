The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 18 + 2 = 0, over to Sonia
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      18 + 2 = 0, over to Sonia
  - Sudip, not Mamata, complains about CPM terror         J.P. YADAV                                     
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Trinamul Congress today knocked on Sonia Gandhis door to complain about the ruling CPM in Bengal and demand action after 18 meetings with home minister P. Chidambaram and two with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yielded no results.         
	Despite being in the capital, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee remained in her official residence.         
	Sudip Bandopadhyay, the party chief whip in the Lok Sabha, led the delegation.         
	Sudip later said the delegation submitted a six-volume report chronicling the state-sponsored terrorism let loose by the CPM after the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.         
	This is the first time we met UPA chairperson Soniaji. We have met the home minister 18 times and the Prime Minister twice. This time, however, we are hopeful that our effort will bear fruit, the MP said.         
	Asked what made the party hopeful this time, Sudip said that Sonias response was positive. He referred to a particular reaction to put the point across. When I told her (Sonia) that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has said the choice was between choosing Left and death, Soniaji was startled, he said.         
	I told Soniaji that she can get our allegation verified by any central agency, he added.         
	The MP reportedly told Sonia that the chief ministers statement was a clear threat to the voters and a bloodbath wold follow if the Left was voted out in the Assembly elections.         
	I told her (Sonia) that after this, whether he (Buddhadeb) should be allowed to continue in power has become a big question and urged that the Centre should take action, Sudip said.         
	The delegation then went on to allege that the Bengal government was run from CPMs state headquarters on Alimuddin Street and not from the Writers Buildings. Soniaji nodded her head in acknowledgment, he said.         
	The MPs sought to explain why their party was demanding withdrawal of joint forces from Bengal. We also told Madam that the CPM was using the joint forces to reclaim lost ground. As the joint forces are advancing, the CPM is coming and resorting to area domination, he added.         
	Sudeep said Sonia told the delegation she would forward their complaints to the Prime Minister and the home minister.

	Come tomorrow, the Parliament standing committee on agriculture, headed by CPM leader Basudeb Acharya, will screen a film to convince members of the panel about the ill effects of Genetically Modified (GM) foods.        
	Sources said the 30-minute film, Poison on the Platter, was part of the Lefts efforts to resist moves by developed countries led by the US to promote life-form patenting to wrest control over the remaining resources of the globe.

          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, May 22: For the passengers and crew who died in the Mangalore air crash today, an aircraft that delivered an uneventful touchdown transformed within seconds into a death trap engulfed by hellish flames.         
	Forensic medicine doctors at the Kasturba Medical College (KMC), Mangalore, who had received about 100 bodies from the Air India Express aircraft until 11pm tonight said virtually all passengers appear to have suffered rapid, extreme and fatal burns.         
	Weve only seen charred remains so far, said Suresh Kumar Shetty, associate professor of forensic medicine and toxicology at the KMC. quot;The fire appears to have swept across the fuselage very quickly.         
	As the aircraft tumbled down a forested valley, according to accident injury analysts, some of the passengers could also have experienced intense forces of deceleration that could have caused serious and painful body injuries, including fractures or joint dislocations. But this kind of fire obliterates any evidence of other injuries that people might have experienced during the crash, Shetty said.         
	A team of six doctors from the forensic medicine department at the KMC began receiving the bodies this morning, and helped relatives to identify them  through clothing shreds or ornaments. About 70 bodies had been identified by 11pm, a doctor said.         
	Doctors say the process of charring is equivalent to turning bread into hard black toast. Complete charring makes it difficult for us to draw inferences about other features of the body, said Prateek Rastogi, assistant professor of forensic medicine. Doctors are unable to say, for instance, whether death was instantaneous or a slow struggle.         
	Among the bodies recovered, only the bodies of the two pilots would be sent for autopsies. Protocols require that pilots bodies are investigated to determine whether they were under the influence of alcohol or other substances.

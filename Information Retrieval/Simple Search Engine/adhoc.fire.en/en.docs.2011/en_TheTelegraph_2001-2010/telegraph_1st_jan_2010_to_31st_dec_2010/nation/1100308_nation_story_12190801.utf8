          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 7: The Janata Dal (United) today decided not to issue a whip against the womens bill, striking the proposed legislations opponents a blow a day before it is to be taken up in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Party chief Sharad Yadav wanted a whip but was left isolated once Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who commands the loyalty of a majority of Dal (United) MPs in both Houses, backed the bill his party had opposed till two days ago.        
	A Dal (United) source said the move to not have a whip was aimed at allowing Sharad to vote against the bill when it came up in his House, the Lok Sabha. In the Rajya Sabha, we (the partys seven members) will all back the bill, he said.        
	The government plans to take the bill up in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow and, if all goes well, follow it up in the Lok Sabha where, too, it has the numbers to get it passed.        
	With the Rajya Sabha battle appearing more one-sided than ever before, bill opponents Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad took their fight outside. They dared the Congress to explain why it had joined hands with the BJP to block the entry of backward caste and minority women in Parliament.        
	A week ago, both Mulayam and Lalu Prasad had walked out of the House with the BJP while the finance minister was delivering his budget speech.        
	The Yadav chieftains claim that the bill in its current form favours elite women and have demanded sub-quotas for women from disadvantaged sections.        
	In Lucknow, Mulayam asked that when half-a-dozen states did not have a single Muslim MP in the Lok Sabha, how could Muslim women be elected without specific reservation for them? This bill is dangerous.... anti-secular and anti-Muslim, he said.        
	In Patna, Lalu Prasad alleged that instead of implementing the minority reports of the Ranganath Mishra and Sachar commissions, the Congress was using the bill as a diversionary tactic.        
	As they lost the Dal (United)s backing, the Yadavs found a comrade in the Bahujan Samaj Party, which is preparing to vote against the bill because it is anti-OBC.        
	The Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and BSP have been re-crafting their strategies after their bad showing in the Lok Sabha polls. Aware of the migration of Muslim votes to the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam is tailoring his every move to regain the communitys confidence.        
	Congress sources dismissed his tactic. Let him say how many tickets he gave them (Muslim women) in the recent elections, a source said.        
	With the Bihar polls just eight months away, Lalu Prasad trained his guns on Nitish. He asked what had prompted the change of heart in the chief minister who had opposed the bill in 1997 as a member of a joint select parliamentary committee. He is trying to please his ally, the BJP, Lalu Prasad said.        
	The BJP continued to try and appropriate credit for pioneering the bill, its president Nitin Gadkari claiming his party had been the first to suggest the idea in 1995.        
	Law minister M. Veerappa Moily countered that no party could claim credit for the bill. The people of the country, women, and Parliament should take the credit, he said.

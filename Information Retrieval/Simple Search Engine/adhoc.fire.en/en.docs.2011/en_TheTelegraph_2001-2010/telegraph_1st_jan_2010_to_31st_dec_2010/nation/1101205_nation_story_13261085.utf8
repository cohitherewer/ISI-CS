The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spectrum hint from Sibal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spectrum hint from Sibal
                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 4 (PTI): Union telecom minister Kapil Sibal today said the government was looking into allotting more spectrum to telecom companies.        
	 This is something we are looking at. India is one of those countries which has lowest quantum of spectrum. We are looking at releasing more spectrum soon, the minister said in response to a query on whether the government would allocate more spectrum.        
	Sibal said the telecom ministry would soon send notices to telecom companies that were issued licences along with spectrum even when they were not eligible.        
	We have already taken a decision on this. We will be sending notices to these companies soon, Sibal told a news conference, adding that those found guilty would be penalised.         
	Among the companies which have received the licences are S-Tel, Uninor, Loop and Videocon.        
	Earlier this month in New Delhi, Sibal had said that the memorandum of association and equity conditions were not fulfilled during the issuing of licences and that the ministry believed some of the eligibility requirements were not in place when these companies sought the licences.

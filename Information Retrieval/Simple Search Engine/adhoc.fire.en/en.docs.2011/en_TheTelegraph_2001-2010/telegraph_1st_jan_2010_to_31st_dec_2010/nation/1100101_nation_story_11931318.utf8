          SUJAN DUTTA                                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: The eastern army commanders recommendation after the findings of an investigation into an alleged land scam is with the army whose chief, General Deepak Kapoor, will decide on the action to be taken, the top defence ministry official said here today.        
	The inquiry report has found Lt Gen P.K. Rath and Lt Gen Ramesh Halgali culpable and has also pointed to the involvement of the military secretary, Lt Gen Avadhesh Prakash. They could face a court martial or other disciplinary/administrative action.        
	There is a procedure laid down under law (the Army Act) and there is an internal process through which the army takes action, the defence secretary, Pradeep Kumar, said, not wanting to pre-empt the army by speculating on what such action might be. The defence secretary also said the report of the court of inquiry had not reached him.        
	The military secretary, Lt Gen Avadhesh Prakash, who is a principal staff officer to General Kapoor, is due to retire on January 31. Asked if the ministry and the army had taken note of this, defence secretary Kumar said: I am sure the Chief of Army Staff is aware and the general will take a responsible decision.        
	The court of inquiry was convened by the chief of the Eastern Command in Calcutta, Lt Gen V.K. Singh, who may succeed General Kapoor as the chief. The ministry has not yet forwarded his name to the appointments committee of the cabinet for approval but the process is just about starting now. The current chiefs term is till March 31, 2010.        
	The defence secretary said defence minister A.K. Antony had asked him to report on the inquiry. He has since submitted the report.        
	Kumar said that there was also an issue of the age of Lt Gen V.K. Singh when he was being considered before he was appointed as the General Officer Commanding in Charge, Eastern Command, in Fort William, Calcutta.        
	There was a mismatch in the records of the military secretariat and the adjutant generals branch. Lt Gen V.K. Singhs date of birth was settled as May 10, 1950, before he took over as the Eastern Command chief. Asked if the issue could come up again, the defence secretary said: When the processing is done, it will be dealt with.        
	A lieutenant generals age is one of the factors to determine if he can be found eligible for the chiefs job. If he is selected, it will also determine the length of his tenure and impact on the career prospects of other senior lieutenant generals.

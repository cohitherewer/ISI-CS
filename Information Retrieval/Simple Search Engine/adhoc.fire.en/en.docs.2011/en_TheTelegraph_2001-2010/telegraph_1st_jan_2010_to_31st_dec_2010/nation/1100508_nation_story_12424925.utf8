          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 7: The Centre has reintroduced a quota for MPs to nominate two students to Kendriya Vidyalayas under pressure across party lines, less than two months after the reservations were abolished.        
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal told the Rajya Sabha that the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan had decided to reintroduce the quotas bowing to the sentiments of the MPs.        
	Each member will be again eligible to nominate two students a year to the Kendriya Vidyalayas. The students will be nominated to central schools of the MPs choice.        
	The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the Kendriya Vidyalayas yesterday, Sibal said. But he also added that he would relinquish his quotas as an MP and as the HRD minister. Sibal has a discretionary quota of 1200 seats.        
	The minister had in March pushed through a decision to abolish the quotas, arguing that they were eating up seats that would otherwise be eligible to wards of government employees  the intended beneficiaries of the schools.

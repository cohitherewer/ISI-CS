The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Axed JD-U minister joins Congress
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Axed JD-U minister joins Congress
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jamshed Ashraf (second from right) joins the Congress in Patna on Sunday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, July 25: Sacked JD(U) minister Jamshed Ashraf today joined the Congress, strengthening the partys campaign to woo the Muslims in the run-up to the Assembly polls due in October/ November in Bihar.        
	The joining of Nitishs former cabinet colleague is being interpreted as the Congresss systematic campaign to reach out to Muslims in the state.         
	In fact, almost all the mainline parties, including the ruling JD(U) and the Congress, are locked in an intense battle to woo Muslims who constitute 16.5 per cent of the electorate.         
	Ashraf was sacked as the excise minister from the Nitish Kumar led National Democratic Alliance government in February after he alleged large-scale corruption in his own department and demanded a probe from the chief minister. Ashraf, subsequently, also resigned his Ballia seat as an MLA.        
	Sidelined, Ashraf joined the Congress in the presence of the Union minister Salman Khursheed, in-charge of party affairs in Bihar Mukul Wasnik and state party chief Mehboob Ali Quiser.        
	Recently, Nitish scored a point over his arch rival Lalu by inducting the Muslim face of the RJD, Md Taslimuddin, into the JD(U). But the Congress, which claims to be equidistant from both the JD(U) and the RJD, today gave Nitish taste of his own medicine by inducting his former cabinet colleague.         
	Ashraf is believed to be close to Nitishs estranged colleague Lallan Singh, who is said to be in the queue to join the Congress.        
	Choosing the occasion to attack the NDA government on the Muslim issue, Mukul Wasnik said: There is no difference between Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar in the context of doing welfare work for the Muslims.         
	Supporting Wasniks contention, Salman Khurshid said: The Bihar government had not been drawing the Centre funds meant for the minority welfare. Unlike UP, Haryana and several other states, the state government had given no proposal for drawing Centre fund for the minorities.

	Melbourne, Feb. 8 (PTI): Australia today tightened its immigration rules to favour higher-skilled workers instead of hairdressers and cooks, a revision that will lead to the rejection of around 20,000 migration applications from foreign students, including Indians.        
	Immigration minister Chris Evans said the revision of the rules would tilt the inflow of migrants in favour of doctors, engineers and IT professionals to suit Australias local demands.        
	He also announced scrapping of the Migration Occupations in Demand List to limit the eligibility for independent skilled migrants to a more targeted set of occupations. It (the MODL) encouraged overseas students to train in particular occupations to make it easier to acquire permanent residence, in the process skewing the skilled migration programme to a narrow set of occupations, Evans said. We were taking hairdressers from overseas in front of doctors and nurses, it didnt make any sense.         
	Highlighting the deficiencies in the existing system, Evans said: A Rhodes scholar would not pass the points test if he or she took a degree in chemistry or mathematics... (but) there are several occupations  cooks and hairdressers  where international students can study in Australia, acquire qualifications in a space of 92 weeks and be on the road to permanent residence.        
	He added that under the previous governments policy settings, the skilled migration programme has been delivering too many self-nominated migrants from a narrow range of occupations with poor to moderate English language skills who struggle to find employment in their nominated occupation.        
	The Age newspaper reported that the revision would affect 20,000 migrant applications from foreign students, including Indians.

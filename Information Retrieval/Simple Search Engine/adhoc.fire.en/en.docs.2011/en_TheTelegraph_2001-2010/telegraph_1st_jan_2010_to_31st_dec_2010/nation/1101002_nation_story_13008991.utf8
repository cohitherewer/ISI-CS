The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Urdu papers echo peace plea
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Urdu papers echo peace plea
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          A man reads a newspaper near Charminar in Hyderabad on Friday, a day after the Ayodhya verdict. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: Delhis Urdu newspapers today almost echoed their mainstream counterparts restraint and sobriety on the Ayodhya verdict.        
	The Urdu papers were cautious and reserved even in their editorials and comments, mirroring the popular sentiment for peace and asking Muslims to maintain communal harmony.        
	Rashtriya Sahara, one of the leading Urdu dailies in the capital, carried appeals from Muslim leaders and intellectuals.         
	One report was headlined, Supreme Court ka darwaaza khula hai (the doors of the apex court are open). Do not be sad as legal battle will continue. Do not take it as victory or loss as the matter will go to the Supreme Court, the article said.         
	The paper highlighted the governments warning that those trying to disturb communal harmony would be dealt with strictly.         
	The front-page lead in Sahafat was titled aastha bhari para (faith proved stronger), suggesting the verdict had gone beyond matters of fact but praising people for showing restraint and being calm.        
	The paper carried an appeal from Maulana Arshad Madani, the president of Jamaitul Hind, saying some anti-socials can try to disturb harmony but we should defeat them. The publication stressed this was a legal battle that must be fought democratically.        
	Akhbar-e-Mashriq mentioned the assertions of local ulemas and leaders that this verdict was very important but not the last.        
	The paper quoted an ulema praising the efforts for peace and communal harmony by leaders of all parties.        
	But some others fretted about the legal outcome. Hindustan Express suggested the verdict had not been worth the wait.         
	The paper went on to quote a Faiz Ahmed Faiz poetry on the pangs of Partition. Yeh daag-daag ujaala Yeh shab gazida sehar Woh intezaar tha jiska Yeh woh sehar nahin (This blemished light, this night-bitten dawn, this is not the dawn that we had pined for).        
	The poem was carried in an editorial, which concluded with a message to people to stay calm.         
	 This matter will go to the Supreme Court and will be a long-drawn affair. Be patient, hold your heart and lets see what happens next, the editorial said.        
	Some Urdu papers were critical of celebrations by BJP leaders at the party headquarters in Delhi soon after the verdict came out last evening.         
	They frowned on the way crackers were burst at the office and the manner in which the leaders hugged each other with smiles on their faces. They were in a celebratory mood, congratulating and embracing each other, said a report in Hindustan Express.

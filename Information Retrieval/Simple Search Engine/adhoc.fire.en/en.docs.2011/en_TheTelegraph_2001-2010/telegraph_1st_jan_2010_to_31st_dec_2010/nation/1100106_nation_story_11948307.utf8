          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Women labourers try out the head load manager at a construction site. Telegraph picture                                   
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 5: Carry a weight on your head if you must, but do it with less stress.        
	Thats the idea behind head load manager, a contraption built using technology developed by the Directorate of Research on Women in Agriculture (DRWA), to reduce fatigue and drudgery among women who make a living out of carrying things on their heads.        
	Launched here today, the contraption that is fixed to the shoulder with straps in the waist, has three parts  a head frame, a shoulder frame and a shaft to rest the load.         
	Anthropometry (human measurements) and the weight of the equipment were taken into account before designing the head load manager, explained the director of the directorate, Krishna Sreenath. Stature, height up to mid-shoulder, height up to sub-sternum and ear-to-ear distance were other factors that were considered.         
	Besides, there are straps to fix the frame, while a cushion on shoulder frame supports the shoulder muscles. It is easy to wear and can be used to carry a load of 20-30kg at a time, she added.        
	Priced at Rs 700, the contraption was the result of a two-year research project undertaken by the directorate whose findings have shown that it worked wonders for women working in, say, a farmland or a construction site, for 14-16 hours a day.         
	It is wrong to assume that available technologies are gender-neutral because women have different kinds of needs. Hence, we decided to come up with an equipment for the benefit of women who are used to carrying heavy loads, Sreenath explained.         
	According to the directorate, women on whom the contraption was tested reported significant relief and reduction in fatigue which enabled them to carry loads for longer durations and also climb stairs. The neck muscles and vertebral column were relieved from direct impact of the load. It transfers load impact from head to broad base of the shoulders, she said.        
	The directorate will now focus on marketing the contraption in rural areas where it is approaching womens self-help groups who are into vegetable vending. All we need is to find a suitable agency to produce and market the equipment. A poor woman may not be able to afford it, but an employer can, Sreenath said.

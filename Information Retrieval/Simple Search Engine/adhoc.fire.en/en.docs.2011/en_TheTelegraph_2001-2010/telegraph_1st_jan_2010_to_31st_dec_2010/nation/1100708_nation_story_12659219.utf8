The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Liquor flows on freebies
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Liquor flows on freebies
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                            
	Hyderabad, July 7: Buy a crate of your favourite beer, get movie CDs, glasses and casseroles free. Buy two crates, get saris, trouser pieces and nightwear free.        
	Or go in for some cheap liquor, and chomp on a succulent chicken leg for free.        
	Hic, hic, whats going on?        
	The freebies are flowing fast and furious with the alcohol in Andhra Pradesh with desperate liquor sellers resorting to desperate strategies to rake in the moolah. Having paid huge sums to snap up liquor licences at the government auction in late June, they have been thinking up innovative ways to increase sales and recover some part of the Rs 700 crore they have collectively shelled out.        
	The state government, which declared a budgetary shortfall of Rs 18,000 crore this April, auctioned liquor licences at rates 125 per cent higher than in 2008. One licence, for a liquor outlet at Nadikudi in Guntur district, went for a whopping Rs 5.2 crore.        
	As many as 6,596 licences were issued in Andhras 23 districts at the auction that is held once in two years.        
	We have no alternative but to go in for such gimmicks to achieve our targets, said D. Venkateshwar Rao, the general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh State Wine Dealers Association.        
	The dealers have been varying the freebies on offer to suit the tastes of different types of customer. Techies in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam are being wooed with pen drives and T-shirts. Other youngsters are being given film CDs, diaries and jotter pens. In urban slums in Vijayawada, Tirupati and Nellore, saris, lungis and nightwear are being used to lure labourers.        
	The chicken-leg freebie, first introduced in Naidupeta in Nellore district, is believed to be a huge success. A senior official of United Breweries Limited, Hyderabad, said the company fully supported the efforts of the dealers. The idea of offering household goods as freebies is targeted at women. They should feel that their husbands are coming home with something worthwhile whenever they spend money on liquor, he said.        
	Some retailers have even been placing advertisements in newspapers, distributing handbills and pamphlets as well as putting up public hoardings to popularise their marketing strategies.        
	In the past, dealers recovered the money they spent on licences by forming syndicates and selling liquor at prices higher than the maximum retail price. But with the government approving thousands of new outlets  in homes, parks, even auto-rickshaws  to augment revenues, this has become very difficult in most districts.        
	The state government has announced an excise turnover target of Rs 25,000 crore and excise tax revenue target of Rs 7,000 crore for liquor for the current financial year. In 2009-2010, the turnover was Rs 10,708 crore and the revenue Rs 2,900 crore.        
	Andhra chief minister K. Rosaiah, who holds the excise portfolio, is believed to have given excise commissioner Hiralal Samarai a free hand in fixing liquor licence fee rates. The government has also allowed some licensed outlets to set up belt shops or extension outlets.        
	About 10 per cent of the licences have been issued to women self-help groups in semi-urban and rural centres this year. Rural women, mostly agricultural labourers, are liquor consumers. So, a woman seller will be an acceptable proposition, said Ramkrishna Reddy, an excise official of Vijayawada.

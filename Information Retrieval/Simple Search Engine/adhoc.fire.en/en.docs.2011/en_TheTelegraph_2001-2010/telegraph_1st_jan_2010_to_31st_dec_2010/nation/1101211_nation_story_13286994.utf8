  - lecturer who set controversial paper held          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                  
	Srinagar, Dec. 10: A college lecturer who had set a question paper accusing the security forces of rights abuses in Kashmir was arrested today under a stringent law often used against insurgents.        
	Noor Mohammad Bhat, 46, a lecturer in English at Gandhi Memorial College, was summoned by Kashmir University in the morning and later taken away by police.        
	A police officer said Bhat had been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which can bring up to a seven-year prison term.        
	Normally, separatist leaders are booked under this act, the officer said.        
	University officials said Bhat had set the controversial English paper that asked first-year BA students to translate a passage from Urdu.        
	Roughly translated, parts of the passage read: The red-hot blood of our youth is being spilled like water. Small children are being beaten to death by the police and the army. Bullets are being pumped into the chests of girls and women.... But the government is in deep slumber; it seems to have turned deaf, dumb and blind....        
	Another English paper had asked commerce students to write their opinion on whether the stone-throwers were heroes. It could not be confirmed if Bhat had set this paper too.        
	The controller of examinations, A.M. Shah, said Bhats arrest had nothing to do with the university.        
	Officials at Gandhi Memorial College said Bhat was asked to set the paper at the height of the agitation.        
	Tempers were running high, and every day so many people were dying in firing by the security forces. Any paper setter would be influenced by the developments. Otherwise, I can vouch for him (Bhat) that he has no separatist links, a colleague of Bhat said. His wife and three children are terribly shaken by his arrest.

	Lucknow, May 20 (PTI): Allahabad High Court today dismissed the CBIs revision petition challenging a special courts decision to drop criminal conspiracy charges against L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and 19 others in the Babri Masjid demolition case.        
	However, the case against Advani and others for inflammatory and provocative speeches will continue at a Rae Bareli court.        
	The CBI had sought a directive for reviving the conspiracy charges against BJP leaders Advani and Joshi, Uma Bharti, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh and the others in connection with the demolition of the mosque on December 6, 1992.        
	Justice Alok Kumar Singh of the Lucknow bench of the high court said: Nothing is found against the correctness, legality, propriety or regularity in respect of any of the findings of the lower court. There is no embellishment in the impugned order neither on factual or legal matrix. Hence there is no occasion for this court to make any interference in the impugned order.        
	VHP leader Ashok Singhal and Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray were among the 21 who were given relief by the special court on May 4, 2001.        
	Reacting to the high courts decision, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said the CBI should move the Supreme Court.

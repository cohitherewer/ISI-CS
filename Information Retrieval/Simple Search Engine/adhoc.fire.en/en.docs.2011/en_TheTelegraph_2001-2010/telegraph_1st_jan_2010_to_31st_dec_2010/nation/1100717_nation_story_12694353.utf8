                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Naidu held in water war with neighbour
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Naidu being taken away in a police vehicle on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 16: Chandrababu Naidu was today arrested for trying to get to the disputed Babhali barrage project site, in a move that could aggravate the water war between Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Telugu Desam chief was picked up along with party legislators and later refused to secure bail, police sources said.         
	Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil had told the Assembly yesterday that Naidu would be arrested if he tried to defy Section 144 and reach the project site in Dharmabad in Nanded, 600km from Mumbai.        
	About 74 people were arrested in all, including 12 MLAs, 15 MLCs, three MPs and other Desam activists. The group was later moved to an industrial training institute in Dharmabad, where they would be put up overnight.        
	The dispute relates to a 2.74TMC barrage project over the Godavari that aims to bring over 8,000 hectares in Nanded under irrigation. A year after construction began in 2004, Andhra complained to the Centre that Maharashtra had violated the Godavari water disputes tribunal directive and begun constructing the barrage in the reservoir submergence area of the Sriram Sagar project.         
	The Central Water Commission tried to intervene in the dispute and set up a technical committee.        
	In 2006, Andhra filed a suit in the Supreme Court urging it to grant a permanent injunction restraining Maharashtra from proceeding with the construction. Andhra claimed that if the barrage was completed, it would cause a reverse flow of water and Andhra would be denied its share of waters awarded under an accord by the Godavari water disputes tribunal.        
	In April 2007, the Supreme Court passed an interim order giving Maharashtra the go-ahead to construct the barrage, but asking it not to install the proposed 13 gates till further orders.        
	Patil told the state legislative council that Maharashtra had spent Rs 165 crore on the project but had not installed the gates as per the apex court order. The next hearing is scheduled on August 10, he said.         
	Dismissing Naidus arrest and agitation as a political stunt, Save Babhali Action Committee chief Balaji Kompalwar said: Naidu was the Andhra chief minister when the project was sanctioned. Now that he is in the Opposition, he is trying to make an issue out of it. It is nothing but a political stunt.        
	Byelections to 12 Telangana seats are scheduled on July 27.        
	The action committee claimed the barrage would ease acute drinking water shortage in 57 villages. Water scarcity increases in December when the backwaters of Sriram Sagar project depletes, the activists claimed.

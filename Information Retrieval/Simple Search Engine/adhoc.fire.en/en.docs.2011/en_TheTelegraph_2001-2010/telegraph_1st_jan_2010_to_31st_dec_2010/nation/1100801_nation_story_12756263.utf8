The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Violence spirals, Geelani set free 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Violence spirals, Geelani set free 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 31: A jittery Jammu and Kashmir government released Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani this evening hoping the move would calm the Valley where two fresh deaths in police firing were reported earlier in the day.        
	Curfew orders were clamped today in most towns of Kashmir in order to confine residents to their homes but the step did not pay off. Pro-Azaadi agitators set ablaze two air force vehicles, a railway station and a police post in different parts of the Valley.        
	The deaths of the two men  Muddasir Ahmad Lone and Javid Ahmad  could compound the governments problems as the deaths have occurred in Bandipora and Baramulla, two districts that were relatively calm till yesterday.        
	The fresh wave of clashes between the forces and the pro-Azaadi brigade began yesterday after the police tried to thwart marches organised by Geelanis hard-line faction of the Hurriyat.         
	Geelani, though released, refused to leave the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), demanding that other political prisoners would also have to be set free.         
	An official source said: The leaders who are running the show (in Geelanis absence) are more hard-line than Geelani. We hope the strategy (of releasing him) will work for us.         
	At Pampore in Pulwama district, the protesters torched two air force vehicles after forcibly emptying them of passengers, several among them women and children. Police sources said reinforcements were rushed to the spot to protect the people in the two vehicles.         
	In Sopore district, a railway station was set ablaze by an angry mob. Security forces last night managed to quell an attack on the station but failed this morning. A police officer said the force fired hundreds of bullets in the air but the protesters were unrelenting. Some private vehicles parked outside the station were also torched, the officer added.         
	In another incident, agitators set on fire a police station in Baramulla. Similar bids were made on police posts at Pampore and Bijebehara but were unsuccessful.         
	Muddasir Ahmad Lone fell to bullets when a mob allegedly tried to attack a security force camp in Bandipora.         
	Javid Ahmad was killed when security forces fired at a crowd in Baramulla. Javid was brought to the hospital in a critical condition and he later succumbed to injuries, said Syed Amin Tabish, the medical superintendent of the SKIMS.

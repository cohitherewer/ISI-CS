The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Voice that echoes military targets Antony
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Voice that echoes military targets Antony
          SUJAN DUTTA                          Antony                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Defence minister A.K. Antonys direction to the army chief to take disciplinary action against his top aide on the Sukna land case has evoked mixed feelings in the force even though it is aimed at sending the message that the government will be tough on wrongdoers.         
	Army officers, unless authorised, cannot speak out in public, but they wonder if Antony was being overzealous at the cost of the soldierys image.         
	It is the duty of the government to make lions and tigers out of soldiers, not mice, an exasperated Major General Satbir Singh, the vice-chairman of the Ex-Servicemens Movement, said.         
	Singh wrote in a letter: This probably is the first time ever where the defence minister has bypassed all laid-down norms of propriety and the well-tested judicial system of the defence forces. This is nothing but direct interference in the performance of duties of the COAS (Chief of Army Staff). If appropriate corrective measures are not taken, it will deter the future commanders from using their discretion and taking bold decisions which are so essential in the battlefield scenario.         
	Major General Singhs organisation has, in the past, been used to voice the demand of the military for better remuneration to veterans and many of its leading figures, retired generals among them, had returned their medals to the President.         
	A chief will be more worried about his own image within the army than anybody else, General V.P. Malik, who was the army chief in Indias last war in Kargil in 1999, told The Telegraph.         
	You dont realise how this public knowledge (of differences within and of political directions) is hurting the army, he said.         
	General Malik wondered if there was a quieter way to resolve the dispute after a court of inquiry in Calcutta indicted the military secretary and three other generals. He recalled that in one instance, a lieutenant general was confronted with evidence of wrongdoing by his superiors and told to either resign or face disciplinary action. The lieutenant general resigned and is now abroad.         
	The veterans association leader is indignant and says the army chief should be his own person. I would, therefore, implore the chief of army staff to kindly take action as per his own bidding which will enhance the prestige of the office he holds. The whole nation is watching him, he wrote.         
	Technically, however, the defence minister is well within his brief.         
	Looking at it dispassionately, it is important to note that the government is also invested with powers under the Army Act, 1950, to convene and confirm a court martial, said former Judge Advocate-General, Major General Nilendra Kumar.         
	General Kumar said the defence minister could have been much harsher than merely overruling the army chiefs recommendation of administrative action against Lt Gen Avadhesh Prakash.         
	I think the ministry of defence has still not gone full throttle by setting aside or cancelling the chiefs direction but has advised him. Setting aside or cancellation of the army chiefs recommendation is a far graver option, he said.         
	In the early 1990s, then defence minister Sharad Pawar had slighted then army chief General S.F. Rodrigues when he told Parliament that Rodrigues was censured for calling Americans bandicoots in an interview. Pawars public admonition was received only with stoic silence in army headquarters.         
	But such reasoning does not cut much ice with soldiers who feel they are pawns in a political game. Mr Antony is throttling the army judicial system, Singh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dustbin rebuff from Congress
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dustbin rebuff from Congress

	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Amar Singh, busy cataloguing qualities of Sonia Gandhi that appear to have passed him by all these years, have been told by the Congress that it was not a dustbin.        
	The majority of Congress leaders laugh about his opportunistic rattle and assert that he cannot atone for his sins by saying good things about the Congress chief.        
	Congress leaders had a lot to talk about Amar, his politics and his future, but Satyavrat Chaturvedi, known to dislike the former Samajwadi Party leader, summed up the mood. Asked if Amar could be taken into the Congress, he said: I dont want to comment on any individual but the Congress is not a dustbin.         
	On a question about what Amars political future held, Chaturvedi said: Did he have a political past? How can he have a political future?         
	Chaturvedi, who was removed as Congress spokesperson because of his acerbic views on Amar at a time his services were required to push through the nuclear deal in the House, has his reasons to be critical.         
	But other Congress leaders who do not have any reason to dislike the former Samajwadi general secretary, too, described him as an untouchable.         
	Although the decision to allow Amar into the party will be finally taken by Sonia, there is no leader who sees a reason for his inclusion.         
	A minister in the Manmohan Singh government asked: What can Amar Singh offer the Congress? A few CDs? Are we interested in that? I dont think so. And in terms of politics, he is a huge liability. Rahul Gandhi is trying to do clean politics and Amars inclusion will be big blot on his record.         
	A senior AICC functionary, who demanded anonymity to escape abuses from Amar, said: If Mulayam Singh had to extricate himself from Amar after a decade-long friendship, who will trust him? We should not touch him even with a barge pole.        
	Amar recently praised Sonia and Mayavati, saying they were political personalities in their own right. About Sonia, whom he had once called pizza queen, he added that she had proved herself in India against all adversities.        
	Congress leaders have not forgotten his comments and claim that Sonia, too, nursed a strong sense of antipathy towards him.

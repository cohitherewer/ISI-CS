          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 25: An attempt by the health ministry to initiate research and financial reforms at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, has encountered resistance from sections of the faculty.         
	An organisation of the faculty called Progressive Medicos and Science Forum has dubbed the attempt a move to throw open the institute to industry influence and to eventually increase healthcare fees from patients.         
	A panel of health ministry officials and other experts today met AIIMS officials and sections of the faculty to discuss recommendations for reforms made by a committee led by cardiac surgeon Marthanda S. Valiathan.        
	The committees report had called for an independent evaluation of research conducted in AIIMS and appropriate analysis and rationalisation of funds spent by the institute.         
	The AIIMS faculty has been involved in research on multiple topics  clinical research, diagnostics, vaccines, drugs, said Valiathan, who was not present at the meeting today. We need a mechanism for the review of such research.         
	The committee had recommended a panel to oversee research which would include a representative from the industry. But some sections of faculty fear that this would increase industry influence in guiding research.        
	This could lead to a focus away from basic research to only industry-supported research, said a faculty member who is part of the forum.         
	Last year, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had said the recommendations would not be implemented without consultations with stakeholders. Some doctors believe todays meeting would be passed off as part of the consultative process.         
	The real stakeholders are patients who come to this institute, a senior doctor said. Some faculty members say the recommendations for rationalisation of finance would eventually lead to an increase in fees charged from patients.

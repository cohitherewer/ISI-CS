          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Narendra Modi                                  
	Ahmedabad, July 29: Narendra Modi was glued to the television in his office through the day after news flashed that the CBI could question the chief minister in the Sohrabuddin case, a close aide said.         
	Modis name is believed to have come up during the CBIs interrogation of Amit Shah, the former junior home minister arrested for his role in the fake encounter. Shah, a Modi confidant, faces the charge of murdering Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi, who were killed in 2005.         
	The BJP fears that if Modi is now summoned  a distinct possibility since he has always held the home portfolio, and Shah only had limited powers as minister of state  it would demoralise supporters ahead of the civic elections in October-November.         
	The chief minister, too, knows that one more round of interrogation  the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) had questioned him for nine hours in connection with the 2002 riots  will only strengthen opponents within the party who will call for his head.         
	But a close aide of the chief minister put up a brave front and dismissed the so-called internal report of the CBI that refers to Modi.         
	The chief minister has been unaffected by the reports. He has been doing his job least bothered about such reports, planted by vested interests, which have no basis, Jagdish Thakkar said.         
	The CBI, sources said, is scrutinising Modis decision in 2007 to transfer the then CID chief, G.C. Raiger, who was heading the Sohrabuddin probe. Raigers transfer orders were signed by the chief minister around the midnight of February 7, 2007, allegedly after he refused to dilute charges against senior policemen now in prison for the killing.         
	Modi had also transferred D.G. Vanzara, now in custody for the fake encounter, from the Anti-Terrorism Squad to border security just two weeks before Tulsi Prajpati , an associate of Sohrabuddin and the sole eyewitness to his killing, was murdered in 2006. His death is also blamed on Gujarat police.         
	Former minister of state for home Gordhan Zadaphia said today: It is a well known fact that a junior minister cannot take major decisions without consulting his boss. A junior minister cannot transfer IAS and IPS officers. So, naturally, the CBI will have to question Modi, who held the home portfolio, to find out his role, how he had influenced the probe.         
	The CBI investigation, which has led to the arrest of Shah as well as policemen close to the chief minister such as Abhay Chudasama, is turning out to be an embarrassment for the BJP.         
	With the CBI issuing summons for former DGP P.C. Pande, Rajkot police commissioner Geeta Johri , who had initially investigated the case, former CID chief .P. Mathur and suspended deputy superintendent of police N.K. Amin , the political stir that the BJP had threatened has already fizzled out.         
	 We will not be able to justify the home ministers action  extortion and murders. He has always been a self-centred man who has amassed huge wealth through illegal means, using his official position to extort money, a BJP leader said, declaring Shah guilty even before the investigation is complete. He said it would now be difficult to mobilise and motivate the partys grassroots workers .         
	Some of Shahs supporters who had campaigned for him have already deserted the former minister, said Shailesh Parmar, a resident of his constituency. Two days ago, when Shahs family vacated the official bungalow in Gandhinagar, there was hardly anyone to help them, he said.

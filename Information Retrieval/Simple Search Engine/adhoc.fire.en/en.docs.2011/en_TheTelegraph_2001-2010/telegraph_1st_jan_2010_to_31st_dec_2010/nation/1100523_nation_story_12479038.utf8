	Mangalore, May 22: Residents from nearby villages were the first to rush to the site of the plane crash today, helping rescue workers reach the spot and douse the flames.         
	They also lifted the charred bodies and carried them to ambulances.         
	At the hospital where the bodies were taken, workers of the Kankani Mahasabha, a local outfit, set up a shamiana for the relatives of the victims to assemble and identify the bodies.         
	Mangalore police commissioner Seemanth Kumar Singh said the police had to regulate overenthusiastic volunteers as the rescue vehicles could not reach the crash spot.

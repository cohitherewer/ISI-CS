The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia lends price support 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia lends price support 
  - Pranab gets pat for fine job as Congress chief echoes PM on rollback         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          File picture of Sonia Gandhi (PTI)                                        
	 New Delhi, March 4: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today said Pranab Mukherjee had done a fine job with the budget, throwing her partys full weight behind the government despite lingering concerns over the price spiral.        
	The endorsement came days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ruled out any rollback in the increase in petrol and diesel prices, saying the economy had the capacity to absorb the hike.        
	Sonia, too, made it clear the Congress was not in favour of a rollback, as she underlined the need for generating resources so that the government could spend on welfare schemes.        
	We have many essential social obligations and to meet them it is necessary to raise resources, she said, addressing the Congress parliamentary party. I congratulate the finance minister for a fine and delicate balancing act which has been widely welcomed.        
	She also asked Congress MPs to counter the Opposition propaganda by taking a brief from Pranabji on the salient features and new initiatives launched in the budget.         
	Sonias backing has come at a time the fuel price hike and the food inflation have triggered a tentative Opposition unity for the first time.        
	Parties ranging from the BJP to the Left, including outside supporters of the Congress-led government, had in a rare show of unity walked out during Mukherjees budget speech.        
	Sonia said the emphasis on expenditure in agriculture, rural development, infrastructure and social empowerment stands out boldly in the budget and voiced satisfaction that the social security fund for workers in the unorganised sector had taken shape and would soon become operational.        
	She also patted the government for taking the first step towards the right to food security by readying the draft bill for discussion.         
	Sonias unambiguous support for the budget, however, did not mean she had lost sight of the problem of high food prices.        
	(The) issue of food prices continues to be our foremost priority, she told the gathering of MPs from both Houses. We have responded to this pressing concern with all the resources at our command. Despite the fact that this was a crisis born out of circumstances outside our control, the government has put in place proactive policies to mitigate the hardships of the people.        
	Stressing the need for effective delivery through the public distribution system and stronger anti-hoarding measures, she said: The food price inflation detracts from the UPAs outstanding accomplishment in sustaining high economic growth that is so essential for generating resources for social welfare programmes and inclusive long-term prosperity.         
	The partys official mouthpiece, Congress Sandesh, too, had expressed similar views, arguing that one mistake could wipe out the gains of years of hard work.         
	Sonia appeared to have accepted the governments logic that factors like drought and economic slowdown were primarily responsible for the price crisis. She said these months have not been easy. We have faced many political and economic challenges we have come through and remained firm to our dedication and resolve.         
	Sonia also said the party was determined to pass the womens reservation bill in the current session of Parliament.        
	I personally attach the highest importance to the womens reservation bill. So many years have passed since Rajivji first unveiled his vision of empowering us women. This year on March 8 is the centenary of International Womens Day. What a gift to women of India (will it be) if on this important day this historic legislation is introduced and passed!         
	Sonia touched upon two other nagging concerns: poor attendance in Parliament and lack of co-ordination between the government and the party.         
	She told the MPs that even if they didnt participatein discussions, attending the House and listening to the proceedings was an education. She also asked ministers to periodically brief party MPs on important programmes and policies.

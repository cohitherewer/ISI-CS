          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 8: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has told BJP president Nitin Gadkari and senior leaders that if they brought back Uma Bharti to the party, he would have to resign from his post because he would be unable to handle the complications and problems that might arise.         
	Chauhans veiled threat has stopped the return of the prodigal sadhvi, at least for the moment.        
	Umas case was backed by Gadkaris predecessor Rajnath Singh, who argued the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the heartland would see in her return a positive signal from the BJP.         
	Rajnathji has told the party president as well as the RSS that Uma Bharti is still respected among sections of OBCs in Uttar Pradesh. We have a leadership vacuum among the OBCs and she will help fill it, a Rajnath aide said.        
	The RSS was in favour of getting Uma back, barring Suresh Soni, a senior functionary who was allegedly humiliated by her a number of times.        
	Other BJP decision-makers were unsure of what it meant, knowing Umas famous propensity to create trouble. Rajnath apparently assured them she would be confined to Uttar Pradesh and not allowed to get a footprint on her home state, Madhya Pradesh.        
	Chauhan is said to have asked the Delhi leaders if they would underwrite such an assurance. His case was that her coming would mean plunging the Madhya Pradesh BJP into turmoil at a time when the government-party equation was relatively smooth.         
	The speculation around Umas comeback increased when she called on L.K. Advani and Gadkari yesterday. Theres nothing new to this, she keeps meeting Advani, a source close to the sadhvi said.        
	Chauhan visited Advani soon after to plead his case and then met Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Gadkari. BJP general secretary Ananth Kumar, who briefed the press today, was non- committal when asked about Uma.

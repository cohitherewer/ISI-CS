          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 2: The alleged police terror during construction of a road project in Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex is snowballing into a political issue with the Opposition threatening to take to the streets.        
	While the Left is going to seek intervention of the Orissa State Human Rights Commission and governor alleging human rights violations, the Congress and BJP have announced agitations on the issue.        
	Addressing a joint news conference here today, leaders of CPI, CPI(ML) Liberation, CPI(ML) New Democracy, CPI(ML) and Lok Shakti Abhijan alleged that the police had been terrorising the tribal protesters, who were opposing construction of a common corridor road project in Kalinga Nagar for which they were losing land.         
	We will move the Orissa State Human Rights Commission and governor seeking their intervention, said Left leader Prafulla Samantara. Others like Ramakrishna Panda, Radhakant Sethi, Bhalchandra and Sivram echoed him.        
	The Amnesty International had also expressed its concern over human rights problem in Kalinga Nagar and drawn the attention of the chief minister, they said.        
	A fact-finding team of the Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee, headed by vice-president and former minister Prakash Chandra Debta, alleged that they had not been allowed by the Jajpur police to visit the affected villages.        
	BJP state president and former Union tribal affairs minister Juel Oram said the Naveen Patnaik government was trying to bulldoze democratic movements as it had a brute majority in the Assembly.        
	Condemning the state-sponsored terror, Oram, himself a tribal, demanded a halt to the forcible displacement and construction of common corridor amid police deployment. The issue should be resolved through peaceful negotiation, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Centre wants the chief ministers of Jharkhand and Bihar, Shibu Soren and Nitish Kumar, to attend a meeting along with Bengals Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to finalise the inter-state operations against Maoists.        
	The Maoist massacres in Bengal and Bihar and the abduction of an official in Jharkhand have forced Union home minister P. Chidambaram to ask for a clear endorsement, especially from Soren and Nitish, in the fight against Naxalites. The two leaders did not attend a meeting convened in Calcutta by Chidambaram last week.        
	Writing to Bhattacharjee, the home minister expressed shock at the attack on the Shilda camp. Obviously, there were serious lapses and the matter must be thoroughly inquired into, he said.        
	The home minister yesterday sent letters to the three chief ministers, asking Soren and Nitish to attend a meeting in New Delhi as early as possible. He has requested Bhattacharjee to be present at the meeting, the date of which will be decided after Sorens confirmation.        
	The New Delhi meeting is intended to finalise tentative decisions taken at the February 9 session in Calcutta.        
	Chidambaram said in his letter to Soren that both Bhattachajee and he had keenly felt the Jharkhand chief ministers absence on February 9. Soren had reported ill then but his absence strengthened suggestions that he was dragging his feet on cracking down on the rebels.        
	Sources in Ranchi said this evening that the chief minister had not yet discussed the new meeting with his aides.        
	In the letter to Soren, the home minister said Jharkhands deputy chief minister Raghubar Das, who along with the other Jharkhand deputy chief minister had filled in for Soren at the Calcutta meeting  had made certain statements at the meeting which have raised some doubts in my mind. Chidambaram wants all three states to be on the same page with the Centre in the fight against the Naxalites.        
	All three states invited to the meeting are considered laggards, either because of lack of political will or poor policing. What is also notable is that while Bhattacharjee and Chidambaram have struck a rapport, Soren and Nitish are seen by the home ministry to have been hesitant in their support to the Centre.        
	A question mark hangs over the political will displayed by the two chief ministers in dealing with the Naxalite menace, feel home ministry officials. Soren is being seen as soft on the Maoists because of the support that he allegedly received from them during the Assembly elections. Nitish apparently does not want the fallout of any offensive to dent his chances in next years Bihar Assembly polls.        
	In his letters to the three chief ministers, the home minister said the Centre had reached tentative conclusions on combating the Naxalites.        
	It is also necessary that to be assured that the state governments (of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal) and the central government are on the same page before commencing inter-state operations of the Jharkhand-Bihar and Jharkhand-West Bengal borders, Chidambaram said.        
	In the letter to the Bihar chief minister, Chidambaram expressed shock at the Jamui massacre and referred to specific intelligence. It is regrettable that the attack could not be thwarted despite specific intelligence shared by the central agencies with the additional director-general of police (special branch), Bihar, the home minister said.

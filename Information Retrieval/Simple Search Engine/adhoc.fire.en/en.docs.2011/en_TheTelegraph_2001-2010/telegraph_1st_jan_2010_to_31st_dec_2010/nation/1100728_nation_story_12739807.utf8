  - David Cameron keen to undo damage done to Delhi ties during Labour years        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          David Cameron                                         
	New Delhi, July 27: David Cameron, Britains youngest Prime Minister in two centuries, lands in India tonight to lay the foundation for a special relationship and unleash what observers have termed as one of the most brazen charm offensives by any of his predecessors in decades.        
	A longstanding marriage that needs to be injected with some more excitement, is how a source close to the visiting 90-member delegation described the UK-India relationship, adding that the only special relationship that UK has is the one with the US.        
	Camerons agenda is clear  to repair the damage wrought to India-UK relationship during the Labour years.         
	Government sources in New Delhi, still smarting under the 2009 visit by then foreign secretary David Miliband who linked the Kashmir dispute to the 2008 terror attacks, believe there is much repair to be done.         
	The new leadership feels that despite close traditional links, Britain missed out on being part of Indias growth story. But now, along with Washington, Delhi is set to become the centrepiece of British foreign and trade policies, said a source.        
	Richard Stagg, the UK high commissioner to India, said: When talking to UK ministers, it has been clear that they see this visit as setting the foundations for a new and even deeper relationship, not as a passing out ceremony at the end of a process. The objective is to inject a new energy, a new lease of life into a relationship that, they feel, the UK has not made as much of in the past as it might have.

	In 2005, Britain was the fifth largest exporter to India, but now is the 18th. British exports to India dropped from $6.4 billion in 2008 to $4.5 billion in 2009. Cameron also has his eyes set on several defence contracts. However, his attempts to charm India have come at a time when it has found more influential suitors in the US and Japan.        
	That Britain wants greater trade and economic ties with India is reflected in the composition of Camerons delegation and itinerary.         
	Cameron will land in Bangalore tonight. He will visit Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and also the Infosys campus. His chancellor of exchequer George Osborne will visit Chennai and Mumbai to meet industrialists and Bollywood movers and shakers.        
	The delegation will include six ministers, about 50 leaders of some of Britains largest companies, sportspersons and academics. Barclays Group CEO John Varley, defence giant BAe chairman Richard L. Oliver, jet engine maker Rolls Royce executive Miles Cowdry, chief executive of the FA Premier League, Richard Scudamore, and the heads of the British Museum and British Library are expected to visit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Keep review in apex court
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Keep review in apex court
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Supreme Court has glorified a detestable practice of patriarchal society by using the term keep in a recent judgment, a review petition filed in the court yesterday said.        
	The court is expected to use gender-neutral language and language that respects the dignity of women, the petition by an NGO said, adding that the appropriate word would have been partner or cohabitee.        
	The Mahila Dakshta Samiti also challenged the decision to keep out of the ambit of the domestic violence law cases involving women who cohabit with married men.        
	A two-judge bench of Justice Markandey Katju and Justice T.S. Thakur had defined the expression relationship in the nature of marriage under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and held that the 2005 law would not apply to women who lived with married men.        
	On a plain reading of the act, the only requirement for protection was that a woman should have cohabitated with a man for a considerable period of time, the petition said.        
	To deny the protection to those women who are in a relationship in the nature of marriage only for the reasons that the man... is previously married would amount to cutting down the width and ambit of the act, it said.         
	This would frustrate the object of the law, which was to protect women from domestic violence, and would violate the womans right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution, it said.        
	The review petition, which will go before the same bench, said the court had unnecessarily ventured into an area it wasnt asked to look into.        
	The issue was whether a woman staying with a man for a reasonably long time could be considered his wife under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. That issue has been referred to a larger bench.         
	In this case, Patchaiammal had filed for maintenance in a family court in 2001 saying she had married Velusamy in 1986 before being deserted.        
	However, Velusamy claimed he had married another woman, Lakshmi, according to Hindu rites in 1980. Therefore, his marriage with Patchaiammal was not valid.         
	The question, therefore, arose whether she was entitled to maintenance under Section 125. The court decided there was not enough evidence to establish whether she was the wife and sent the matter to the trial court to establish the facts.         
	Therefore, the need for interpretation of relationship in the nature of marriage did not arise, the petition said. The parties did not claim they were living together for sex and it did not seem that Lakshmi was either a keep or a servant for sexual purpose, it added.         
	The petition said use of expressions such as keep, are highly derogatory of women and discriminate against them on ground of marital status. It sought to have the word deleted on the ground that it was not warranted. Under the law, only chattel can be kept and not humans, it said.

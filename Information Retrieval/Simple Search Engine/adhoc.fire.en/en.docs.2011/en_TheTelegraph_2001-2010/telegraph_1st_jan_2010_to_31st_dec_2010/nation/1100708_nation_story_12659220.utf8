          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, July 7: A visually impaired man who cleared the IAS exam in 2006 but was denied a post on the ground that no such position had been identified for reservation, will be appointed within eight weeks.        
	The Supreme Court today passed the order in favour of Ravi Prakash Gupta, who will also get Rs 20,000 in legal costs within four weeks.        
	The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection, Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, provides for 3 per cent job reservation. Gupta, fifth on the civil services merit list for the handicapped, claimed he would have got a job had the Centre implemented the quota in the year he passed.        
	Only one post was allotted for the handicapped in the IAS in 2006, so Gupta was left out. The government claimed during hearings that it was setting aside other posts but was yet to do so in the case of IAS grades.        
	Gupta had earlier moved Delhi High Court, which too had upheld his claim and ordered his appointment within six weeks. The government was also asked to pay him Rs 25,000 in legal costs.         
	Guptas wait for a job appears at odds with claims by the Union ministries of social justice and personnel  which handles bureaucrats appointments and postings  that they were working towards the integration of the physically challenged into the mainstream.         
	Both ministers had parroted the argument that he could not be appointed as the posts to be reserved were yet to be identified.        
	Gupta  who argued his own case in the high court and the apex court  argued that if the government had set aside the 3 per cent, there would have been seven posts for those with disabilities, and he would have got one of them.         
	The government had argued that it was making such reservations since 1977 in Group C and D posts. Another 406 vacancies had been identified in groups in A and B grades in 1985. These, however, did not include IAS posts.        
	The IAS posts were identified in the IAS only in 2005, almost 10 years after the act came into force. But even then, it came with a devil in the detail: the government said these would be reserved for the future and not in the year Gupta had applied.        
	Gupta argued that the quota should have been set aside from 1996. If they were not filled, they would have been carried over.         
	The apex court bench of Justices Altamas Kabir and Cyriac Joseph accepted the arguments.         
	The judges asserted that making the reservation for the disabled dependent on identification of posts by the government was not the acts objective.         
	To accept such a submission would amount to accepting a situation where the provisions could be deferred indefinitely by bureaucratic inaction. Such a stand taken by the petitioners (the Centre) before the high court was rightly rejected, the judges said.

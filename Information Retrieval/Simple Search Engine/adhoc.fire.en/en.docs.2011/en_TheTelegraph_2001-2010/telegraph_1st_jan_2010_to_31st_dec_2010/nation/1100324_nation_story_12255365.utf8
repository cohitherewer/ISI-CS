	Calcutta, March 23: Richa, Sangeeta, Jai and Vijay had left their homes for office as usual this morning but there was no trace of them since afternoon when their office building  Stephen Court  caught fire.        
	Over 10 persons were missing till Tuesday night, according to police sources.        
	Their relatives were keeping a vigil on Sir William Jones Sarani off Park Street as dusk turned to dark.        
	Sibprasad Dutta stayed on. His daughter, Richa, 22, was still to be traced. She had called a friend and informed him of the fire but security forces did not let him enter the building when he arrived. Since then, calls on Richas mobile are going unanswered, said Dutta, trying to hide his tears.         
	Smoke still billowed from portions of the building.        
	Richa had joined this office just a month ago, added the father, a south Calcutta businessman.        
	It was the same tale for relatives of most of the others missing  twins Jai and Vijay Khandelwal, Sangeeta Kumari, Mita Aich, Anup Dutta, Farina Ansari and Sayar Golcha.        
	We have been visiting one hospital after another throughout the day but we have not been able to trace the brothers, Jai and Vijay, said Asif Sarda, a cousin of the twins from Rabindra Sarani, Liluah. Still in college and employed with Rawat and Sons Engineering Pvt Ltd on the fifth floor, the twins had left home at 10am.        
	God knows where they are now, Sarda murmured before running once more to joint commissioner of police Jawed Shamim and asking him if there was any word on the brothers.         
	They should search the building again. How can they say there is nobody trapped inside? asked a relative.        
	Sumita, in her early 20s, was looking for her father Anup Dutta, along with her mother Sampa. Do you think my father is safe? she asked the police officer accompanying them from one hospital to another.        
	Others complained of the chaos in the hospitals. Just look at the utter mismanagement. Is it so difficult to put up a list with the names of those dead and injured, wondered Rupa Ghosh, who was looking for missing colleagues at SSKM.        
	Also missing was Sayar Golcha, 62, a resident of the fifth floor of the building who had helped other members of the family escape.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chidambaram focus, step aside Tharoor
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chidambaram focus, step aside Tharoor
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 15: The BJP and sections of the Congress and government are more worried about P. Chidambaram than Shashi Tharoor.        
	They believe that while the junior foreign ministers possible exit will not substantively alter the quality and character of policy-making and governance, repeated provocations to home minister Chidambaram might have serious and far-reaching consequences.        
	If some Congress leaders concertedly paint Chidambaram into a corner, he may have no option but to throw up his hands, quit and return to his legal practice, a government source said.        
	Chidambarams centrality to fighting the Maoists prompted the BJP and the Left to give Tharoor a break as the budget session resumed today and turn their attention to Dantewada. When the NDA had served a notice for a discussion on the massacre in both Houses of Parliament yesterday, the BJP and its allies decided they must not lower the bar of discourse by raising the IPL row and the charges against Tharoor.         
	He (Tharoor) is a lightweight. We have said whatever we had to against him. The IPL concerns a minuscule percentage of the population, while roughly half the countrys districts are plagued by the Maoist problem. We might have been accused of pandering to the elite if we focused on Tharoor. So we went for the aam aadmi, a BJP leader said.        
	The BJPs strategy was to take mild potshots at Chidambaram instead of going for the jugular, the aim being to outdo the Maoists at their game of dividing the political establishment.        
	Arun Jaitley, the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader, opened the debate today. We didnt want to respond (with) snide remarks against the government or the home minister.... But what we dont need is a government which tries to pull down its own home minister... what we dont need is the half-Maoists on the treasury benches who try and pull down the government by saying that the fight against Maoism must be diluted, the BJP leader said.        
	The allusion was to Digvijay Singh  who has slammed Chidambaram in a newspaper article  Mani Shankar Aiyar and Mamata Banerjee.        
	In what would have been music to the CPMs ears, Jaitley referred to a statement by Mamata demanding that the joint operations by the Centre and the Bengal government in Lalgarh be called off. The railway minister had reportedly said she would defy the collective (cabinet) responsibility principle.        
	I think such a minister should be called to the Bar of this House and asked to explain the statement which defies all federal principles, Jaitley said.        
	The impression of disunity in the government and the Congress was reinforced later by K. Keshava Rao, the party leader in charge of Bengal. Speaking after Jaitley, Rao criticised Chidambaram for prioritising law and order, almost echoing Dijvijays argument, and adding the home minister was doing so perhaps under the influence of the BJP.        
	The party decision to field Rao, known opponent of the law-and-order line on Maoists, appeared significant to many. Unfortunately, whenever we talk about Naxalism in this House, all that the minister would get up to say is how much money the government has given to the state government for modernisation (of police).... What is required is... strategies like how many acres have been distributed (to the poor), Rao said.        
	Congress sources conceded some leaders had a problem with the Chidambaram mindset and wondered if the top echelons shared the view. They claimed Digvijay, however independent-minded he is, would not have done the hit job without a prod.

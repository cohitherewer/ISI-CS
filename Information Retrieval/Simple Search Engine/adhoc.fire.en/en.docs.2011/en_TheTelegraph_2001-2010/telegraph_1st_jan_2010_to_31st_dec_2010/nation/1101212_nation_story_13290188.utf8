          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Union home secretary G.K. Pillai today said neither he nor the ministry was behind the leak of the tapped phone conversations of lobbyist Niira Radia, and claimed he had not heard the tapes yet.        
	He said the allegation that he had leaked the tapes at home minister P. Chidambarams behest was unfounded.        
	Pillai, however, said the home ministry had authorised the interception of Radias calls at the request of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to investigate allegations of tax evasion. He said the CBDT had carried out the tapping.        
	I wish to clarify that neither I nor the ministry of home affairs had access or has any access to any of the tapes.... I also understand from the affidavits given by the ministry of finance that some portion of the tapes had been given to the CBI for investigation, he said.        
	The Wall Street Journal had on Monday quoted Pillai as saying that only the juicy elements of the tapes had been put out to titillate the media. The WSJ report had paraphrased Pillais comments to say the tapes leaked till now barely scratch the surface of the stuff that will be at the heart of the governments investigation.         
	Some media reports, however, quoted Pillai as having told WSJ that the leaked tapes were only the tip of the iceberg, prompting the interpretation by many that the home secretary was behind the leak.        
	Pillai today denied having used the phrase and said his WSJ interview had been misunderstood and quoted out of context.

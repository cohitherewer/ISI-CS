The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Leak spills Red Cross data on Valley torture 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Leak spills Red Cross data on Valley torture 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Omar Abdullah                                  
	Srinagar, Dec. 17: The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has given US diplomats evidence of detainees in Kashmir being systematically tortured, according to cables leaked by WikiLeaks.        
	US officials in Delhi were privately briefed by the ICRC in 2005 that Indian security forces were using torture methods, including electrocution, physical beatings and sexual interference, on hundreds of detainees.        
	In a report back to Washington, the diplomats recorded the ICRCs view that India condones torture and that the detainees were not Islamic insurgents or Pakistan-backed militants, who were routinely killed. They were civilians connected to or believed to have information about the insurgency.        
	According to the cables, the ICRC interviewed 1,296 detainees of whom 681 said they had been tortured. Of these, 498 claimed to have been electrocuted, 381 said they were suspended from the ceiling, and 304 cases were described as sexual.        
	A total of 294 described a procedure in which guards crushed their legs by putting a bar across their thighs and sitting on it, 181 said their legs were pulled apart into the splits (a configuration in which the legs are parallel to each other and extended in opposite directions).         
	In one cable, US officials reported: Terrorism investigations and court cases tend to rely upon confessions, many of which are obtained under duress if not beatings, threats, or in some cases torture.        
	The cables have given the ruling National Conference (NC) an opportunity to hit out at the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), whose leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was chief minister in 2005. The PDP has been criticising the Omar Abdullah government for the over 110 killings during the recent unrest.        
	Omar today preferred to play it safe and said he did not condone torture. The cables date back to 2005 when we were not in power, he said.        
	State law minister Ali Mohammad Sagar, however, said the alleged torture came during the time the Muftis healing touch policy was in place. What is the meaning of healing touch? Does it mean torturing people? he asked.        
	Sagar said the PDP had always accused the NC of atrocities but now it had a lot of explaining to do.        
	PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, however, said her party did not need a certificate from either the NC or WikiLeaks.        
	The truth is that we inherited the worst situation in 2002. We gave people reprieve from harsh laws like Pota (the then prevalent anti-terror law) and the Special Operations Group of police, which was committing grave atrocities on people. When Omar Abdullah became chief minister in 2008, the situation had largely improved but he has converted the Valley into hell in these two years, she said.        
	The separatists said they stood vindicated.        
	WikiLeaks has said what we have been saying all along (about) how political activists were being framed and booked under black laws, how torture was being pursued as a policy, moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said. Around 9,000 people have disappeared in custody.        
	Rights activists said the torture by security forces in Kashmir put to shame even the prisons at Abu Ghraib (in Iraq) and Guantanamo Bay.        
	Such incidents never stopped. Several youths in the recent agitation, including nine-year-old Sameer Ahmad Rah, were beaten to death by the security forces, said Khurram Parvez, programme coordinator for the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society.        
	We have to see how Indian civil society reacts. Will they wake up to these revelations? Parvez said.

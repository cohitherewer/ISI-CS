          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 10: CPM politburo member Brinda Karat has written to the Prime Minister, asking for a separate law to deal with honour killings.        
	In a letter to him, she said delays in setting up a legal framework to tackle the scourge was strengthening the perception that vote-bank politics was at work. Delays on the part of the central government to decide on a firm course of action in setting up a legal framework strengthens the perception that it is caused by the pressure of vote-bank politics, Brinda said, demanding that a comprehensive draft law be tabled in Parliaments monsoon session.        
	The letter follows a series of honour killings in Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh.         
	Taking a dig at P. Chidambaram, Brinda said it was unfortunate that the home minister did not understand the logic behind a separate legislation. Chidambaram had proposed that murder be redefined under the IPC to include death caused by persons who believe the victim or victims brought dishonour to their clan or family and should, therefore, be killed.

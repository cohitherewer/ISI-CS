The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 11.47am: He has left us   Stoic faces, then tears
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      11.47am: He has left us     Stoic faces, then tears
          SANJAY MANDAL AND SUBHAJOY ROY                                                   
	I have come to give you a sad news. Jyoti Basu is no more with us. He has left us. I cant speak any more.              
	Biman Bose had barely managed to hold back tears when doctors told him on Sunday morning that there was no hope. But there was no stopping him once he had broken the news of Basus death to the world an hour later.        
	The stoic face of the CPM gave way to a rare emotional outpouring in public as the Left Front chairman wept and walked back to the AMRI lounge  helped by party colleagues Rabin Deb and Amitabha Nandi  after making the 12.12pm announcement from a podium outside the Salt Lake hospital.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee turned emotional inside the hospital, as did former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. It was, as a party leader later said, something only Jyotibabu could do.        
	Sunday morning had seen a flurry of activity both inside and outside AMRI in the hours leading to Basus death. As doctors tried to revive Basus failing heart that registered a flat line on the cardiac tracing machine from 11.15am, the arrival of more than the regular morning visitors one after the other triggered frenzied speculation outside about his condition.        
	Bose, who was a regular at AMRI since Basu was hospitalised on January 1, reached the hospital at 10.41am to the news that the ailing CPM leaders pulse rate and blood pressure were alarmingly low.         
	The 95-year-old CPM leaders extremely critical condition had apparently deteriorated further through the night, starting with a sub-100 dip in systolic blood pressure for the second time in as many days despite SOS medication. His pulse rate was also below 40 and heartbeat was consistently irregular despite a pacemaker implant, a doctor said.        
	At 5.20am on Sunday, Basus secretary Joykrishna Ghosh  who stayed the night at the hospital  was informed that his boss was not responding to treatment. Ghosh immediately informed the CPM leadership of the warning signs.        
	We had administered Noradrenaline and Dobutamine (these are rarely used even on moribund patients) but Basus blood pressure wouldnt stabilise. We added two more drugs to the combination, Adrenaline and Dopamine, as the last resort but it made a difference only for a short while, said a member of the medical board.        
	By the time the medical board met for the last time on Sunday morning, everything that could be done to revive Basu had been tried out without any success.        
	 We took Bose to the ICU soon after he arrived and told him that there was no hope. We also requested him to break the news to Basus family, said a source in the hospital.         
	Basus son Chandan and sister-in-law Manjula Roy were in one of the VIP rooms on the eighth floor of the building  they had arrived together at 9.58am  when Bose and two doctors walked in. I am told that it can happen any minute, the Left Front chairman was quoted as saying.        
	Chandan didnt reply.        
	Outside the hospital, the buzz was that there would be an announcement any moment.         
	One flank of the main road and the emergency entrance to the hospital were barricaded, adding to the speculation.         
	In the ICU, doctors and nurses were desperately trying cardiac resuscitation protocol  a combination of massage and emergency medication  to revive the fast sinking Basu.         
	At 11.15am, Basus heart stopped beating, although the ventilator technically kept him alive.        
	The medical team gave up at 11.45am. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra  also a doctor  checked Basus pulse at 11.47am and confirmed that he was dead.

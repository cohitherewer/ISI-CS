	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today launched Dharani Yojana, that will allow e-registration of land projects.        
	It is a major e-governance initiative to enhance transparency and reliability of citizen centric government services, said the chief minister while launching the project here this evening.        
	Through this project, the revenue department will ensure delivery of property registration related services in a hassle-free environment, said Patnaik.        
	The online registration process has been re-engineered to make it faster, simpler, accurate and error-free. A deed could be registered in less than an hour. Encumbrance certificate and certified copies will be made available over the counter, the chief minister said.        
	Facilities of e-registration will be available throughout the state at all 177 registration offices.         
	The project is being implemented by Orissa e-Governance Service Limited (OESL)  a special purpose vehicle of the Orissa Computer Application Centre and Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services.         
	Nearly 400 persons have been engaged by OESL for implementing the project.        
	Under the e-registration project, which replaces the present system of manual registration, land can be registered within 30 minutes, said revenue minister Surya Narayan Patro.        
	Besides, computerisation of land records will help the state government settle long standing land disputes, decide mutation cases and earn more revenue for the state exchequer, said Patro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pill for your thought: House dwells on Sanjay baby
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pill for your thought: House dwells on Sanjay baby
          J.P. YADAV                                    Varun (top) and Sanjay Gandhi                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Varun Gandhi today watched from the back benches as the Lok Sabha discussed the population control issue his father Sanjay Gandhi raised 33 years ago, the six-hour debate ending in agreement that it was a roadblock in Indias way.        
	Varun lost patience and left after a while, but Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav  who had fought the Emergency and was jailed  gave him reason for cheer by hailing the strong measures Sanjay Gandhi took to curb population growth.        
	I am reminded of Emergency days. Some people blame Sanjay Gandhi. But I feel something has to be done to arrest the spiralling population. Sanjay Gandhi wanted that some issues should be dealt with a strong hand. I feel that along with incentives there is a need for strong steps and only then can a solution be found, Sharad Yadav said during a motion to discuss population stabilisation in the country.        
	However, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad made it clear he would not go back to the Sanjay Gandhi days and use coercive measures to check the burgeoning population.        
	There is a difference between Sanjay Gandhis days and now. We are not going to force anything. Everything has to be done through awareness and voluntarily, he declared.        
	The discussion gave key leaders a chance to boast about their small families as Azad painted a grim future if the galloping population growth rate was not arrested.        
	Rashtriya Janata Dal boss Lalu Prasad, who has nine children, was absent from the House although he was in Delhi. But his friend and Samajwadi Party chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav, used the opportunity to crow about his small family that saw BJPs Sushma Swaraj pitch in too.        
	Mulayam asked the health minister how many children he had. I have two children, Azad replied, leading Mulayam to declare proudly: And I have just one. Lauding him, Azad felt that Mulayam should be rewarded.        
	This prompted Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition, to declare: I have just one daughter. What will you do for her?        
	Parents with one child will be rewarded handsomely, Azad remarked with a laugh. He then underlined that the increasing population was a serious concern and everyone across the political spectrum should suggest measures to check it.        
	Immediately, Mulayam was up on his feet. Pointing out that poverty was the key reason, he said the poor ended up producing more children as they did not have access to affordable means of entertainment. At this, the House crackled with laughter.        
	Azad said the growing population could be one reason behind the price rise that rocked Parliament last week. He said the growth rate in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh was a matter of deep concern, and praised the southern states for checking it.        
	MPs cutting across party lines suggested that incentives should be given to those who have few children. Sumitra Mahajan of the BJP said development was the best contraceptive. Hukum Deo Narayan Yadav, also of the BJP, asked the Centre to declare religious gurus not advocating family planning traitors.

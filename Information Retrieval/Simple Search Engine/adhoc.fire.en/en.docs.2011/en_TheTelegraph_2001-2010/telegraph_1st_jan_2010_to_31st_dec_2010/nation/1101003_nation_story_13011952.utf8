The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Demolition rap in verdict 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Demolition rap in verdict 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: Readings of the Allahabad High Courts 8,000-page Ayodhya judgment reveal that it does indeed refer to the Babri Masjid demolition, with at least one judge describing the act as abominable.        
	Immediately after the verdicts announcement on Thursday, the first impressions of many had been that the three-judge bench had bypassed the December 1992 incident altogether.        
	The strongest condemnation of the demolition comes from Justice Sudhir Agarwal. A huge mob, in a most abominable manner, caused demolition of the disputed structure against all norms and principles of a civilised society, he says on Page 64 of Volume 20 of his judgment, the longest among the three judges.        
	His comment comes in the context of the removal of the deities from the three-domed structure in the run-up to the demolition and their reinstallation at the same spot on a chabutra (platform) built soon after.        
	The kar sevaks had carried off pieces of the demolished building as mementos, cleared the area, and built the chabutra (not to be confused with the decades-old Ram Chabutra on the outer courtyard, whose ownership has been awarded to the Nirmohi Akhara).        
	The other two judges have only made passing references to the demolition but desisted from condemning it, possibly because it was not part of the issues (framed by the court itself) in the title suits.        
	Justice S.U. Khan has restricted himself to recording the effect the demolition had on the country. The demolition caused almost unprecedented communal disturbance and divide. In Independent India only the frenzy and madness which was unleashed immediately after Independence and Partition of the country could surpass the magnitude of the situation triggered by the demolition, he says.        
	Although he lauds the resilience of the Indian people, who put the demolition and its terrible aftermath behind themselves, he warns against a repeat of those events. We must realise that such things do not happen in quick succession. Another fall and we may not be able to rise again, at least quickly. Today the pace of the world is faster than it was in 1992. We may be crushed, Justice Khan says.        
	He then explains that this controversy was foreign to these suits and was not covered by any of these issues, hence nothing need be said in this judgment regarding this aspect.        
	Justice Dharam Veer Sharma too has noted that the demolition took place but has not referred to it otherwise.

	Bhubaneswar, April 26: Traffic was hit in most parts of southern Orissa today as the economic blockade called by Maoists entered the third day.        
	Although no major incidents of violence were reported  except for two buses being set ablaze last night  the rebels made their presence felt through road blockades, posters and banners.         
	Police sources said armed rebels had asked passengers to alight before torching two buses at Lantaphuli on Orissa-Andhra border yesterday night.         
	The state suspended bus services in Naxalite-hit areas as a precautionary measure.         
	Movement of government buses in Koraput-Malkangiri has been cancelled to avoid untoward incidents. The buses remained off roads in Phulbani-Paralakhemundi, Mohana-Rayagada-Gajapati, Jeypore-Motu, Jeypore-Baipariguda-Kosagumuda and Jeypore-Machakund routes. Private bus owners also suspended bus services.

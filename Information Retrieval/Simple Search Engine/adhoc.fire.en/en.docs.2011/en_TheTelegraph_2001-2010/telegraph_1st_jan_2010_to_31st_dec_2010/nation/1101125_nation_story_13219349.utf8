The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Baby Moshe pines for home
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Baby Moshe pines for home
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 24: Baby Moshe, the face of 26/11 whose parents were killed in the attack at Jewish centre Nariman House, remembers his parents even now as he grows up in Israel, grandparents Nachman and Frieda Holtzberg said today.        
	Nachman and Frieda Holtzberg, speaking on the eve of a prayer service in memory of 26/11 victims, said the kid still put aside money in the name of his parents Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg as part of a Jewish tradition.        
	He is staying with the parents of Rivka along with the nanny Sandra (who saved the baby during the attack). As part of Jewish tradition, we keep small boxes where anyone in the family should save up money for the poor and put in money as many times as possible. Moshe put in money daily in memory on his parents, Nachman said at Nariman House, which is currently being rebuilt.        
	Moshe, who was three days short of his second birthday when the 26/11 attack orphaned him, turned four two weeks ago, and still remembers Nariman House as his home.         
	Moshe was rescued by his Indian nanny Sandra, who hoodwinked gunmen and ran out of the Jewish centre.         
	Narimans House reconstruction is, however, mired in a dispute. Chabad Lubavitch, which runs the centre, wants the building dedicated to Gavriel and Rivka and other terror victims with a synagogue and a hall.         
	The Holtzberg family trust wants Nariman House to be an innovative Jewish education centre for children, with Moshes room preserved as it is. Asked if money collected for the reconstruction was at the centre of the dispute, Frieda said: God forbid. It is not about money. Chabad wants Nariman House to have a memorial character, while we want it to be alive.

	Srinagar, June 28: A teenager and a nine-year-old were killed today as the CRPF fired on crowds protesting the recent shootings of civilians by its troopers, prompting the state government to call for a leash on the paramilitary arm.        
	The deaths of Tajamul Ahmad, 17, and Tariq Ahmad near Sopore have deepened a 17-day-old unrest in the Valley during which eight people have been killed in firing by the security forces.        
	Dozens of others were wounded in clashes through the day as the forces used bullets and tear gas to foil crowds answering a separatist call to march to Sopore in protest against the recent shootings by the men in uniform.         
	The CRPF said its men had fired in self-defence, according to PTI, which quoted home secretary G.K. Pillai as saying the paramilitary force had acted with restraint.        
	Enough is enough. They (the CRPF) have failed to address our concern, state law minister Ali Mohammad Sagar said.        
	The Union home minister should come to Kashmir and rein in the CRPF immediately. Bad elements and black sheep in the force are working against the interests of the country.        
	The embattled chief minister, Omar Abdullah, had rung up Union home minister P. Chidambaram last night, seeking his help to make the CRPF accountable for the recent killings. Omar today cancelled his proposed trip to Himachal where Sonia Gandhi was to lay the foundation stone for the Rohtang Tunnel.        
	Police said Tajamul was killed when the CRPF fired in Wadoora, Sopore, where hundreds had defied curfew to join the funeral procession of Bilal Wani, a young man killed last evening in alleged CRPF firing.        
	Tariq was killed at Delina, 10km from Sopore, when the paramilitary troopers allegedly fired at marchers heading towards Sopore from nearby Baramulla town.        
	Public anger exploded at Umerabad on Srinagars outskirts after police stopped around 7,000 marchers on their way to Sopore, 55km away, the clashes injuring several dozen personnel and protesters. A couple of policemen were surrounded and hit with stones and sticks before being rescued with great difficulty by their colleagues, who had to fire in the air.        
	Several separatists including moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq were placed under house arrest. Senior leader Nayeem Khan was arrested from Pattan in Baramulla, and Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik from his home in a midnight raid.        
	Separatists and the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) attacked the state government. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said governance had collapsed in the state and that the force used against the protesters had eroded the credibility of the mainstream politicians.        
	Soldiers killed        
	Three soldiers and five militants were killed in an encounter last night during an infiltration bid in Kupwara district.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong seat since freedom now BJPs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong seat since freedom now BJPs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Narendra Modi                          
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 17: The BJP today wrested the Kathalal Assembly seat from the Congress for the first time since Independence.        
	The victory came as a birthday gift to chief minister Narendra Modi, who turned 61 and lost no time in declaring that the BJPs triumph was over both the CBI and Congress.        
	Since the CBI has arrested former Gujarat junior home minister Amit Shah and IPS officer Abhay Chudasama in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, Modi has been claiming the CBI is targeting him.        
	Sources said Modis CBI and Congress comment was a clear indicator of what his partys poll plank would be for the October civic and panchayat elections.        
	Kathalal falls under the parliamentary constituency of Dinsha Patel, the Union minister of state for small and medium enterprises.         
	The BJPs Kanubhai Dabhi defeated the Congresss Gelabhai Jhala by 21,547 votes in the bypoll necessitated by the death of Gautam Jhala, who held the seat for four consecutive terms.        
	Modi claimed the victory in central Gujarats Kathalal, which has a 65 per cent Muslim population, was proof that he was now acceptable to the minority community and that rural people had begun to appreciate his development agenda.        
	However, the Congress dismissed it as an insignificant local issue that would have no bearing on the civic or panchayat elections. We were defeated because many of our leaders were inactive. And, of course, the BJP misused state machinery and used money and muscle power to win the seat, Congress leader Arjun Mothwadia claimed.        
	Political observers said one should not read too much into the bypoll verdict. One should not conclude anything. This is definitely not an indicator of which way the wind is blowing in Gujarat.

	New Delhi, Aug. 31 (PTI): A criminal case for amassing disproportionate assets cannot be closed with the death of the accused and the family members who benefited from the illegal wealth could be put to trial, Delhi High Court has said.        
	The court said the family members who were beneficiaries could be tried for the offence of abetting the deceased in amassing illegal wealth.         
	Justice S.N. Dhingra passed the order on a petition filed by the son of a deceased government officer, accused of amassing wealth beyond known sources.         
	The petition had sought the quashing of criminal proceedings on the ground that he cannot be prosecuted for the alleged crime committed by his father.         
	Rejecting his plea, the court said he could be tried for the offence of abetment as there was evidence that he benefited from the illegal wealth and he also played a role to legalise the ill-gotten money of his father.         
	The offence committed by the deceased, accused of amassing wealth through corrupt means, does not stand wiped out and the wealth still stands there in the hands of a legal representative of the deceased/accused and the role of the petitioner of acting as a conduit for amassing wealth for his father can be proved by CBI during trial, the court said.         
	Charges were framed against two accused persons, against one for substantive offence and against the other for abetment. If the main accused has died, that does not mean that substantive offence stands wiped out, it said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul rejects rally terms
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamul rejects rally terms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Mamata Banerjee today rejected the state governments conditions for her August 9 rally in Lalgarh, with party leader Partha Chatterjee calling them insulting.        
	The government had yesterday given permission for the rally but set certain conditions relating to its duration and the marchers routes citing the prohibitory orders that are in place in Jungle Mahal.        
	Mamata, before leaving for Delhi this morning, told Chatterjee and Subrata Mukherjee to convey her displeasure at the conditions.        
	The string of conditions is insulting. They should be withdrawn immediately, Chatterjee said.        
	Mukherjee said: It was undesirable to impose a set of conditions on a railway minister for a rally she has already worked out. She is a responsible railway minister and will do her bit in accordance with the Constitution.        
	One of the conditions was that the marchers routes must be discussed with police and cannot be changed once the police had fixed them.        
	Mukherjee said the routes would be decided by our district leaders in Lalgarh. He added: Mamata is not going to oblige the chief minister, who oversees the home portfolio, by taking the routes suggested by the police.        
	The other conditions required Trinamul to end the meeting before dusk, allow the police easy access to the routes and the rally venue, cooperate with the district administration to ensure a peaceful rally and share information on any security threat.        
	Home secretary Samar Ghosh said the conditions were standard practice and were required for the security of VIPs and those who will join the rally. Mamata had earlier put the onus of her security in Lalgarh on the state administration.        
	Maoist slur        
	Bankura police today arrested five Trinamul workers and supporters for alleged Maoist links, prompting the party to allege a CPM ploy to discredit it and create a deterrent atmosphere before the Lalgarh rally.        
	The police had picked up 10 Trinamul activists from their homes in and around Sarenga town in raids that began at 4pm, Bankura police chief Pranab Kumar said. Five have been arrested; the others were released this evening after questioning, he said.        
	He said those arrested had been charged with supporting Maoists and their activities, and with involvement in the burning of a bus on June 20 during a Maoist bandh.        
	Over 100 Trinamul supporters surrounded Sarenga police station demanding the activists be released. Those arrested are local party leader Somnath Duley, and Arun Duley, Uttam Chatterjee, Madhusudhan Chatterjee and Uttam Ahir.        
	Partha Chatterjee and some other party MLAs met governor M.K. Narayanan and asked him to ensure speedy recovery of the illegal arms allegedly stockpiled by the CPM in Burdwan and Hooghly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ramesh against city helipads 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ramesh against city helipads 
                            
	Mumbai, June 28 (PTI): Private helipads in cities do not make sense as they violate noise pollution rules, Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh said here today.        
	I have written to the chief minister (Ashok Chavan) on the issue. Private helipads violate noise pollution rules, Ramesh told reporters in response to queries on the status of the Maharashtra governments plan to set up helipads on Mumbai rooftops.        
	According to the minister, the notion of having private helipads does not make sense as at both national and global levels, we are demanding equity and equitable access to global atmospheric space.         
	Ramesh acknowledged there were several applications pending for such helipads.        
	His ministry told Bombay High Court in an affidavit earlier that it did not support more helipads in Mumbai.        
	R.N. Jindal, additional director in the ministry, had explained the stand recently. The MoEFs (environment ministry) view is that while the noise rules do not specifically debar private helipads, in view of the high ambient noise levels in Mumbai in general both during day and night, such new helipads are avoidable, Jindal said.        
	The affidavit was filed in response to a PIL filed by Mumbai NGO Awaaz Foundation, which had contended that the proposal for helipads would result in noise pollution. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) had conducted tests and found that the sound of helicopters taking off and landing was 100-120 decibels. This was double the norms for residential areas and silence-zone areas of between 45 decibels and 55 decibels.        
	The landing and take-off of a helicopter is associated with higher ambient noise levels. Such events would result in increase in average ambient noise levels in the vicinity, the ministry affidavit had said.        
	The state has plans to set up at least 12 helipads in the city. It has asked civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to amend its construction rules to allow new residential and commercial buildings to have helipads on their rooftops or in open spaces.

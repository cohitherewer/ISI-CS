          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 22: The Orissa government has been rapped for power scarcity not only by the Opposition but also by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG).        
	The issue rocked the Assembly during the just-concluded session, with the Opposition lambasting the Naveen Patnaik government for the ongoing power crisis in the state, which earlier had surplus energy.        
	Admitting that the state was passing through a power crisis, energy minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak said there was a shortfall of 400 MW to 500MW due to decrease in hydroelectricity generation caused by lack of adequate rainfall last monsoon. This government has not added a single megawatt of power during its 10-year rule, alleged an Opposition MLA.        
	While reviewing the performance of the state-owned Orissa Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC)  set up in 1995 with the objective of carrying on hydro power generation and maintenance of hydro power stations  the CAG observed: It cannot increase its installed capacity despite expenditure of Rs 228.77 crore for installation of new projects.        
	The corporations plan for capacity addition of 2,341 MW has remained unfulfilled, the CAG report noted.        
	In August 2007, the government had identified potential of developing 1,500 MW hydropower in the state by installing nine projects through joint venture with the National Hydro Power Corporation and OHPC. The proposed projects were Baitarani, Baramula, Khadaga, Lower Vansadhara, Mahanadi-Brahmani Link, Middle Kolab, Salki, Tel integrated project and Uteiroul.

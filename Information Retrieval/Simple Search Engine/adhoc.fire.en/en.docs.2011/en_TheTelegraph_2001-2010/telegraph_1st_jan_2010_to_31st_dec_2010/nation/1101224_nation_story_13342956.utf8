          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The BJP today turned down the governments offer for a full-fledged discussion on a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to probe the 2G spectrum scam while the Left said a formal proposal would have to come in an all-party meeting before it responds.         
	Finance minister and Lok Sabha leader Pranab Mukherjee told a media event yesterday that the government might suggest holding a special Parliament session to debate the JPC.        
	Lok Sabha Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj, who is in Jammu for a meeting of the BJPs central office-bearers, was quoted by PTI as saying: We do not want a debate on JPC, we want a JPC.         
	BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said: We have done a lot of talking. Now it is time for action. He (Mukherjee) is saying that he will have a special session.... We are looking for positive action. A call for discussion, at least instantly, looks as being redundant.        
	She maintained there was nothing new in the governments offer.         
	The CPM indicated that its mind was not closed on the idea. Senior Rajya Sabha member Sitaram Yechury said: A proposal should be formally made by convening an all-party meeting. We need to know if this is indeed a serious proposal because so far it has only come through the media.        
	The BJPs apparent obduracy riled Mukherjee. He told reporters outside his North Block office that the Opposition had destroyed Parliament by spurning his special session offer.

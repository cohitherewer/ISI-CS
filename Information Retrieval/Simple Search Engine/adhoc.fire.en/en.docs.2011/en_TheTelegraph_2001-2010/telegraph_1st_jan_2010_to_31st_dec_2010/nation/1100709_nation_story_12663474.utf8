The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stern message for Omar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stern message for Omar

	Srinagar, July 8: Home secretary G.K. Pillai has delivered a tough message to the Jammu and Kashmir government: deal sternly with protesters.        
	The tough words came on a day strict curfew was enforced in the Valley by thousands of men in uniform. The army staged another flag march on the outskirts of the city.        
	Official sources said Pillai held a series of meetings with chief minister Omar Abdullah, police chief Kuldeep Khoda, special DG CRPF N.K. Tripathi, the armys 15 Corps commander Lt Gen. G.S. Marwah, director-general of military operations Lt Gen. A. M. Verma and other officers.        
	There were directions to deal sternly with the protesters, primarily those instigating the violence or those funding the stone throwers, a government official said.        
	The home secretary also assured full support to the government and said more paramilitary force personnel would be made available to the state.        
	Omar has been wavering on how to deal with the fresh groundswell of azaadi in the Valley. He fears he may have to face serious consequences if he takes harsh measures.        
	A National Conference leader said the government was wary of taking action against the protesters as they enjoy massive public support. Whatever is the perception of the Centre that these protests are instigated from across the border, the fact is the entire Valley is protesting and we cannot wage war against our own people.        
	The chief minister is mindful that the party had to pay a heavy price for the policies during Farooq sahibs rule (1996-2002). When Omar sahib took over, he wanted to reverse all those policies.        
	Farooq is blamed for measures like strengthening the Special Operations Group of Police, which was responsible for human rights abuses.        
	The NC leader said the government had taken measures to check the unrest. Hundreds of youths had been arrested and most members of the separatist leadership were in jail or under house arrest.

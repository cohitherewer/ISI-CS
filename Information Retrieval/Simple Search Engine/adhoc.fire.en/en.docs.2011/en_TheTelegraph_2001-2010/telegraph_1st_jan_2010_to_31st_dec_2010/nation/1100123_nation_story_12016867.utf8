	Lucknow, Jan. 22: The CBI today named 51 current and former state home department officials in the mysterious disappearance of 23 files relating to the Ayodhya land dispute.        
	The agency submitted to Allahabad High Court the names of 12 retired and 39 middle-level officials, mostly from the home departments communalism control cell, which looks after Ayodhya files, one of which contained a note from Jawaharlal Nehru.        
	The land case had begun in the 1940s with the Babri Masjid Trust and the Ram Temple Nyas both laying claim to the plot on which the Babri Masjid stood.        
	The key files went missing during BJP rule in the state in 1998-2000.

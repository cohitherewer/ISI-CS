          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fresh rights                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 5: Orissa today announced 50 per cent reservation for women at all levels of the three-tier panchayat system.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced this at a state-level programme to mark Panchayatiraj Divas here this evening.        
	Earlier, the Biju Patnaik government had reserved 33 per cent seats in panchayat bodies for the fair sex in the early 90s before the implementation of the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution. As Biju was considered a pioneer in introducing the three-tier panchayat system, his birth anniversary is observed as Panchayatiraj Divas by the state every year.        
	Last year, the Union cabinet had decided to reserve 50 per cent seats in panchayat bodies for women by amending Article 243 (d) of the Constitution.        
	Addressing about 15,000 elected panchayat representatives today, Naveen said the transfer of 21 subjects under 11 departments, including co-operation, school and mass education, women and child welfare, panchayati raj, fisheries and health and family welfare were being made to panchayati raj bodies.        
	Naveen also announced that zilla parishad presidents would be nominated as vice-chairperson of the district planning committee. Steps would be taken to amend the laws to this effect.        
	Similarly, the panchayat samiti chairpersons would be nominated as vice chairperson in the block-level advisory committee of the food supplies and consumer welfare department, while zilla parishad members would be nominated as members in the governing bodies of higher education institutions in the respective locality, he said. At the panchayat level, officers would be made accountable to gram panchayats.        
	Meetings of gram sabha, gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad would be held on a particular date of every month. This will ensure accountability and transparency, he added.        
	The state has more than 1 lakh elected representatives in 30 zilla parishads, 314 panchayat samitis and 6,234 gram panchayats.        
	Four other states  Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh  also made provision for 50 per cent reservation for women, while Rajasthan has announced to implement it during the 2010 elections.

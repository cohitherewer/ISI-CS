The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fidayeen siege of Srinagar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fidayeen siege of Srinagar
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 6: Suicide attackers struck in the heart of Srinagar after more than a year, killing a police driver and injuring nine people before taking shelter in a hotel where people were feared trapped till late tonight.        
	Since the 2pm swoop, the two fidayeen have been firing intermittently at the security forces, who have cordoned off the area but said they would not storm Punjab Hotel in a hurry to avoid civilian casualties.        
	The states first suicide attack since Omar Abdullah came to power a year ago is being seen as another warning to the moderate Hurriyat leadership, which is planning a quiet dialogue with Delhi.        
	The moderates have virtually gone into a shell after one of them, Fazal Haq Qureshi, was attacked last month. Todays attack will further quieten the quiet talks, a Hurriyat leader said.        
	The militants, hiding their assault rifles under the pherans they wore, made a dramatic appearance at the city centre, throwing grenades and firing at the police and CRPF men posted at Lal Chowk. Security personnel and a journalist were among the injured.        
	As the encounter wore on, several hundred people trapped in dozens of hotels, shops and a court complex were evacuated, said the police chief of central Kashmir, H.K. Lohia. Officers said some people were believed to be still trapped but avoided the word hostage.        
	We are calling the employees of Punjab Hotel from our mobiles but there is no response. Maybe the militants are preventing them from taking calls, an officer said.        
	The Jamait-ul Mujahideen claimed responsibility but PTI said state police chief Kuldeep Khoda had blamed the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	A police constable said the militants first lobbed a smoke shell to disperse the crowd. Within seconds, they pulled out their assault rifles and began firing and shouting abuses at us. Our driver was hit and we ducked behind the vehicle. The militants lobbed a grenade and continued firing at us and the CRPF men who were nearby, the constable said.        
	Driver Mohammad Yousuf died on the spot. He had asked his officer for leave to attend a party at his in-laws home this evening, the constable said.        
	As hundreds of police and paramilitary personnel arrived, many shopkeepers abandoned their shops or huddled inside. The militants hopped from one building to another before taking refuge in Punjab Hotel.        
	Tabassum, a woman in her 20s, said she had rushed to a medicine store on the first floor of a building to escape the firing. For one moment, we had thought this was the end of our lives, she said.        
	CRPF deputy inspector-general Nalin Prabhat said: We have secured the buildings around the hotel. Our effort is to ensure the security of civilians before beginning the next phase of operation.        
	The forces are expected to storm the hotel after tiring the militants out.        
	Earlier, the security forces had struggled to quell protests by hundreds of people who had gathered outside the cordon and begun shouting pro-militant and pro-independence slogans. There were clashes between the police and protesters in adjoining Maisuma locality too.        
	The previous fidayeen attack in Kashmir had taken place in 2008. The fresh strike comes at a time the state and the Centre has claimed there were less than 500 militancy-related incidents in 2009, a 25 per cent drop from 2008.

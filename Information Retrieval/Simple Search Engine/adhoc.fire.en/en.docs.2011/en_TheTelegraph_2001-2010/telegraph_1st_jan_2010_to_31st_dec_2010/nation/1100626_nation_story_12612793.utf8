                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata grumbles, Pawar mumbles 
  - Trinamul chief says she will seek price rollback, Left dares her to leave UPA        OUR BUREAU                      Mamata Banerjee                                
	New Delhi, June 25: The UPA governments move to hike the prices of petroleum products has not gone down well with some of the UPA partners.        
	Trinamul Congress chief and railway minister Mamata Banerjee boycotted the meeting of the empowered group of ministers that took the decision.         
	She protested the hike, suggested she would seek a rollback but ruled out a pullout. The government has our crucial support and it will remain. At the same time, we are not happy, Mamata said.        
	The DMKs M.K. Alagiri, Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers, attended the meeting but opposed the move by handing a dissent note. NCP boss and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar was also said to have mildly voiced his reservations but turned silent when petroleum minister Murli Deora insisted the hike was inevitable.        
	The Left parties seemed more eager to take on Mamata than to oppose the increase. The CPM termed her boycott hypocritical and dared her to withdraw support. Politburo member Brinda Karat said: You should be in the cabinet meetings, you should be fighting against it. And if the government does not accept your views, you withdraw from the government.         
	The four Left parties  the CPM, CPI, Forward Bloc and the RSP  issued a joint statement dubbing the hike callous.        
	Mamata chose to ignore Brindas barb and focused on the hike instead. I am unhappy. I did not go to the meeting to give my approval to the decision. I had met finance minister (Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the ministerial panel) yesterday to convey my views. Our party does not support the hike because kerosene, LPG and diesel are directly linked with the common peoples kitchen. It (the hike) also affects farmers.        
	She signalled, rather feebly given her aggression on other occasions, that she would seek a rollback. I will request the government to re-consider the decision.         
	At the same time, she dropped hints about her limitations and why she couldnt prevent the hike. Our party has 19 members (Lok Sabha MPs) and the government has 271 members. We are not a very big party but we can raise our voice.        
	The Trinamul chief made it clear, though, that it was the Congresss decision. We can give our views but they (the Congress) are the major party. So they have to take a decision.        
	Deora insisted that all allies, including Mamata, agreed to the hike. Pawar, while going along with the decision today, had skipped the last meeting of the ministerial panel.        
	The note handed by Alagiri at todays meeting said the increase was very high. Later, DMK spokesperson T.K.S. Elangovan said in Chennai that the party had opposed the last hike too. Our leader (M. Karunanidhi) had written to the Prime Minister to roll back at least the diesel hike. This time too, our leader will take it up with the Prime Minister.

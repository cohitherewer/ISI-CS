          J.P. YADAV                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The BJP-led NDA and the so-called secular front led by the Left are engaged in a tug-of-war to add partners and take the Congress on over corruption and price rise.        
	Last Friday, Left leaders had appeared to pull off a coup when they got Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav to join them in persuading Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu to end his hunger strike.        
	Sharad was the only NDA representative among the leaders of nine parties, including the Left parties, who flew together from Delhi to Hyderabad where Naidu was fasting in protest against the state governments alleged indifference towards farmers.        
	Buoyed by Sharads presence, the Left has now asked Naidu to call a farmers rally in Guntur but not to invite the BJP or the Shiv Sena. A tentative date of December 30 has been fixed. All secular party leaders will be invited, CPI leader Sudhakar Reddy said.        
	If Sharad and other NDA leaders turn up, the Left will congratulate itself and project the event as a big stride towards cobbling together a non-Congress, non-BJP front.        
	BJP leaders, however, do not seem perturbed by Sharad rubbing shoulders with the Left. They said the Dal (U) leader was engaged in adding more parties to the NDA.        
	Chandrababu had once been part of the NDA. Sharad Yadav, as NDA convener, had gone to meet him to show solidarity with his fight for farmers, a BJP leader said.        
	Sharad, they said, has been tasked to talk to non-UPA parties and draft them into the battle against the Congress over the spectrum scandal and other corruption allegations, given the untouchability associated with the BJP.        
	The effort is yet to meet with any success. No party other than those already with the BJP turned up at the December 22 NDA rally in Delhi against the Centre.        
	The Opposition had broadly split into two camps  the NDA and the Left-led group  during the Parliament turmoil over the spectrum row.         
	The Left had taken care to distance itself from the BJP and had got together smaller parties like the Desam, AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Asom Gana Parishad to demand a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe.        
	Sharad could not be contacted, but one of the leaders on the flight to Hyderabad said he was engaged in one-to-one talks with Indian National Lok Dal leader Omprakash Chautala, who seems likely to join the NDA.        
	Sources close to Sharad said that more than expanding the NDA, he was trying to get the Opposition to keep up the heat on the government over the JPC demand.        
	Divisions within the Opposition do not matter as long as there is unity on the core issue of cornering the Congress, a Dal (U) leader said.        
	The leader added that the BJP was on a weak wicket because of corruption in its Karnataka backyard, and so it was important to coordinate with other non-Congress parties.        
	Sharad had recently indicated as much. The Congress is pointing a finger at the BJP (over corruption), but it should realise that even minus the BJP, the Opposition numbers demanding a JPC is high, he said.

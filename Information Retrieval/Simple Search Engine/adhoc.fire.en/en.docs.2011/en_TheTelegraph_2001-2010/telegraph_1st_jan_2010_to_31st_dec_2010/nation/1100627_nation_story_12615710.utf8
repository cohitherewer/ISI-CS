	Johannesburg, June 26 (PTI): A Pakistani suspected to be linked to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack was nabbed in Zimbabwe while trying to enter South Africa, raising fears that terror groups may try to target the soccer World Cup.         
	Imran Mohammad, 33, and Chaudhry Pevez Ahmed, 39, were caught at the Beitbridge border post between Zimbabwe and South Africa by immigration officials on June 20 when they were found travelling on fake passports.        
	Indications were that... Mohammad is wanted in Pakistan as he was allegedly involved in the terror attacks that rocked Mumbai, India, in November 2008, state-run Zimbabwean newspaper Herald reported.         
	The paper said the duo flew from Saudi Arabia to Tanzania, where they fraudulently acquired Kenyan passports before entering Zimbabwe by road.         
	The paper, quoting a police spokesperson, said investigations were on.         
	Assistant Commissioner Wayne Bvudzijena said: They are in Harare and in custody as investigations on the case continue.         
	Assistant regional immigration officer Evans Siziba added: Its an issue that is before the police. Maybe when they are through we will be at liberty to comment.         
	The police and immigration officials did not say if an international arrest warrant had been issued against the arrested persons.         
	With the purpose of the duos visit to South Africa unclear, the arrest raised concerns over the possibility of terror groups eyeing to target the World Cup.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Special task of Haryana force: extortion
          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                          TV footage of STF constable Jagbir Singh purportedly extorting money from a jeweller                                  
	March 15: A Haryana task force set up with handpicked unblemished policemen has been caught allegedly extorting money from the very businessmen it was supposed to protect.         
	The scandal has prompted the state government to disband the special task force (STF) pending the outcome of an inquiry. Seven personnel of the 15-member STF, including its chief, have been detained.        
	Among those detained for questioning is assistant superintendent of police Ashok Sheoran. The accused have not been arrested yet, superintendent of police, Panipat, Rajinder Singh, said. A case under Section 395 of the IPC (dacoity) and the arms act has been registered.         
	Rajat Kumar, a share broker in Panipat, has alleged that the seven had demanded Rs 10 lakh after threatening to book him in some cases. SP Singh said the accused had struck a deal with Sharma after which the trader paid them Rs 6 lakh.         
	Another Panipat businessman, jeweller B.K. Malhotra, had accused the STF men of demanding Rs 10 lakh from him. Malhotra said he had paid them Rs 1 lakh.         
	From the CCTV footage at the jewellery shop, our staff have recognised an STF constable, Jagbir Singh, as one of five personnel trying to extort Rs 10 lakh from Malhotra, Singh said.        
	Malhotra said: Six to seven persons came to my shop and threatened that cases would be lodged against me if I did not pay up. They said they were from the crime branch and had information that I was indulging in fraudulent activities. I agreed to pay Rs 1 lakh and asked them to come later.        
	Jagbir came back after an hour but I told him I would pay only in front of the other policemen. He immediately left the shop on the pretext of calling up his senior and never came back. Everything has been recorded on CCTV.        
	Both Kumar and Malhotra have sought police protection.        
	The STF, which was set up to investigate criminal cases, has been made non-operational till the completion of the inquiry, director-general of police R.S. Dalal told reporters in Chandigarh.        
	When the force was established in 2007, it was announced that only policemen with an unblemished record would be made part of the squad. It was also provided with sweeping powers.        
	SP Singh has been asked to investigate the extortion allegations, Dalal said.         
	Sheorans role in the incidents is not yet clear. The complainants have said he was not among those who had received the money as he used to remain seated in his vehicle outside the premises.        
	Sheorans name had also figured in the 2008 murder of Delhi encounter specialist, assistant commissioner Rajbir Singh. Rajbir, who had been provided Z-category security by Delhi police, had been shot twice in the head from point-blank range by property dealer Vijay Bhardwaj.         
	The weapon used to shoot Rajbir had been officially issued to Sheoran but was later reported to have been stolen.

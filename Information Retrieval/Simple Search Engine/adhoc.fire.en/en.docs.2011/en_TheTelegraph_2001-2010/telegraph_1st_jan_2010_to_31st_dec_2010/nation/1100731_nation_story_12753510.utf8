          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                            
	New Delhi, July 30: Lawyers who prevent colleagues from defending an accused, such as 26/11 gunman Ajmal Kasab, may now themselves be barred from fighting any case for anyone.        
	The Bar Council of India today assured the Supreme Court that such lawyers would be reprimanded, suspended or even removed from its rolls, losing their right to appear in any court in the country.        
	Whatever the popular mood, no lawyer can be prevented from representing terror suspects or those like the accused in the Nithari or Jessica Lal murders or the Jammu and Kashmir sex scandal, the bar council said.         
	It promised to punish any member who heckled, roughed up, threatened or in any other way prevented or restrained a fellow lawyer from fighting a case. The assurance comes at a time many bar associations have banned members from fighting certain cases (see chart). In Uttar Pradesh, those willing to defend blast accused have allegedly been beaten up or threatened with dismemberment by fellow lawyers.        
	More recently, the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Courts Bar Association passed a resolution barring its 1,060 members from representing Kasab or any other terror accused. Several lawyers who had agreed to defend Kasab have since backed off, allegedly under pressure from colleagues or threats emanating from street politics.        
	Under bar council rules, a lawyer can refuse a case only on the ground that he cannot find time or was not paid by the client.        
	A group of lawyers from Uttar Pradesh had approached the Supreme Court saying they had been prevented from representing some of the accused in the Barabanki serial blasts case. Following this, the apex court had asked the bar council what it was doing to deal with the problem.        
	Today, a bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia disposed of the petition after the bar councils assurance. The bench also had a piece of advice for lawyers who faced such pressure from colleagues.        
	This is a law-and-order problem. You should draw the attention of the district judge. He in turn will refer it to the high court, which will deal with it, Justice Kapadia observed.        
	One of the petitioners, Mohammed Shuiab, had said such bans violated a citizens fundamental right to justice. The Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to move court to enforce their rights, and the right to a free and fair trial. Another petitioner, Noor Mohammed, who had represented a group of arrested Students Islamic Movement of India office-bearers, said he was slapped and punched by colleagues. Some local lawyers had threatened to cut his legs and hands off, he said. He was later given police protection.        
	A third petitioner, Mohammed Jamal Ahmad, said he was gheraoed and intimidated for representing some blast accused in a Faizabad court. Lawyer Sanjeev Sachdeva filed an affidavit in the apex court on the bar councils behalf saying if the council received any such complaint, it would first direct the offending lawyers to stop what they were doing.        
	If they didnt listen, the complaint would be referred to the disciplinary committee.        
	 for action under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961, which implies a reprimand, temporary suspension or permanent removal from the rolls.

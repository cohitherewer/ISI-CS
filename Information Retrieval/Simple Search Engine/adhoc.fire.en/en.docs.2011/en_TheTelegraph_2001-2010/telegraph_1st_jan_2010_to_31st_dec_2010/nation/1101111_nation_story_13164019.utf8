          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Prithviraj Chavan wore as many as six hats in UPA-II  as minister of state for science and technology, earth sciences, the Prime Ministers Office, personnel, public grievances and pensions, and parliamentary affairs  and survived the one-person-one-post debate to remain a Congress general secretary.        
	But there was one hole in his resume: at 64, he was still a junior minister; younger colleagues like Kumari Selja had outranked him.        
	Chavan had another wish: he wanted to be a chief minister, even if it was only for a few months. In his words, after the countrys Prime Minister, it is the chief ministers who enjoy enormous powers.        
	Every time the media divined the prospect of a cabinet shuffle in Delhi, Chavans name figured as a promotion that was probable. It never happened. He was mentioned as a possible replacement for Vilasrao Deshmukh after the Mumbai attacks of 2008. That didnt materialise either.        
	Chavan started off as mildly sceptical of the Indo-US civil nuclear deal. He wondered how the Congress would make the sensibility switch, from being a proponent of non-alignment to embracing the US.        
	However, not for nothing did Manmohan Singh, who didnt carry the typical Congress baggage, pick Chavan to be a minister in the PMO over weightier aspirants. Chavan had worked under Singh in the Congresss economic cell when it was in the Opposition. Chavan had degree, political pedigree and a technocrats experience. In short, attributes that endeared him to Singh and Sonia Gandhi.        
	Chavan is a qualified design engineer from the Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani, and has a masters from Californias Berkeley University, where he experienced the stirrings of revolt in Joan Baezs songs and kept unkempt hair. After finishing studies, he worked for three years in the US aerospace industry.        
	In 1983, on returning to India, he started preparing a database of Indian languages so that land records could be computerised. The programme caught Rajiv Gandhis fancy. The two got along well and Rajiv persuaded Chavan to contest from Karad, near Pune, in 1984 despite his fears that he might be outwitted by the regional chieftains. Chavan won.         
	In a sense, Chavans victory was not surprising because his parents were of Congress provenance. More important, in their time, they had passed the loyalty test with flying colours. They stayed with the Gandhis through the Congresss splits in 1968 and 1978, undeterred by the rise of regional forces because they shared a vision that only a pan-Indian party could address the countrys complexities.        
	Chavan inherited their political legacy in more ways than one. In the 1990s, when the Congress covertly pooh-poohed Narasimha Raos and Singhs economic reforms, he appreciated their potential to unleash aspirations across the class divide.         
	Although he was not a minister in Raos government, he gave a political underpinning to the reforms agenda so that more of his colleagues understood them in the right perspective.        
	Like his father and mother, Chavan refused to join Sharad Pawars NCP. Pawar never forgave him for his betrayal and ensured he lost the 1999 Lok Sabha election.         
	Chavan was pragmatic enough to sense that Pawar would always outdo him. So, he never risked fighting another election, opting for the safer Rajya Sabha route to Parliament.        
	To the envy of other Congress leaders who won hard-fought elections, Chavan was a perennial favourite with Singh and Sonia.         
	Unlike his predecessors in the PMO  barring Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi  Chavan lasted a full term in the exalted office in UPA-I and was back in the second regime.        
	His colleagues grudgingly acknowledged he had what it took to keep a job and move on: a low-key presence, intellectual honesty and a clean record.        
	When he overcame his initial doubts about the nuclear deal, he strained every nerve to ensure it became a reality. Singh left the political management of the nuclear liability bill to Chavan. He delivered on his mandate.        
	Chavan has the luck of the fabled tortoise. As he sets foot on Maharashtras treacherous political terrain, doubtless with the blessings of Singh and Sonia, will he have what it takes to ward off his potential adversaries?

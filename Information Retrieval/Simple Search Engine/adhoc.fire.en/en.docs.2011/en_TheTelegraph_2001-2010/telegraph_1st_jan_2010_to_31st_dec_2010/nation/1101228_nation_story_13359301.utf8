The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indias rich on charity path   Country has a long history of philanthrophy, says Bajaj
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indias rich on charity path 
  Country has a long history of philanthrophy, says Bajaj          PIYA SINGH                                                   
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: Indias super rich may well be at an inflection point when it comes to philanthropy.         
	Last week, Azim Premji decided to transfer over Rs 8,846 crore ($2 billion) worth of shares in Wipro Ltd  the countrys third largest software exporter  to an irrevocable, not-for-profit trust that will fund charitable activities with a special emphasis on education.         
	The Premji largesse put the spotlight on some of Indias largest wealth creators who have started to open up their wallets in a burst of altruism.         
	Premji, the countrys third richest man with a net worth of $17 billion, stands apart as an individual donor with a ticket size even higher that Bill and Melinda Gates who have given $1.6 billion to charities in India so far.        
	This is fantastic. He really is an honourable man, said Assocham president Swati Piramals whose own group companies extensively work in the area of corporate social responsibility (more on that later).         
	That may be true but Indians have a long history of giving back especially to their own communities. We have been giving Rs 30 crore a year to charities and trusts ever since our grandfather was alive. Indians have actively engaged in corporate philanthropy for ages unlike developed economies. The Bill Gates and Warren Buffets have only come in recently, said industrialist and chairman of Bajaj Auto, Rahuj Bajaj.        
	The corporate doyen has a point. The Tatas and Birlas are well known for their charities and trusts that fund schools, colleges, specialised educational institutes and hospitals. However, the wealthy as well as corporates do not really show up as big donors in India compared with developed economies, according to a study concluded this year by global consultancy Bain amp; Company.        
	For instance, in India, individuals and corporations contributed only 10 per cent of giving compared with 75 per cent in the United States and 34 per cent in the UK, said a research paper titled An Overview of Philanthropy in India by Bain amp; Company .        
	This study also estimates that Indias giving totalled roughly $7.5 billion in 2009.        
	So Premjis decision to part with $2 billion worth of shares seems to indicate that super wealthy Indians are at a time in their lives when they are ready to loosen their purse strings for dedicated causes.        
	There are several reasons for this change in the mindset. First, the obvious. For an economy thats been growing at more than 7 per cent in the past two years  and expected to nudge up to 8.5 per cent this year  there has been a mind-boggling wealth creation in India. An international magazine has estimated that there are 69 billionaires in India. And the 100 richest Indians are worth around $300 billion.        
	Perhaps more important is the shift towards giving more to the countrys needs such as education and healthcare in an organised manner to uplift the economy as a whole rather than focus on handouts to their respective communities.        
	There is so much more to give now. And with the development of a voluntary sector in the last 20 years, wealthy Indians have a very clear idea about how to reach out to the really needy since we now have due diligence processes and validated NGOs in place, said Mumbai-based Centre for Advancement of Philantrophy chief executive Noshir Dadrawala. The centre advises charities on good governance practices, legal issues and acts as a lobby group with governments.        
	In recent times, there has indeed been a shift towards giving to a particular endeavour. For instance, HCL Technologies founder Shiv Nadar has pleged 10 per cent of his wealth for philanthropy. The Shiv Nadar Foundation focuses on education and has set up a not-for-profit engineering college.         
	According to Bain amp; Company, the Bajaj trusts have amassed $150 million and the Bharti Foundation started by telecom czar Sunil Mittal has notched up more than $60 million. Bharti Foundation schools are estimated to have so far provided free education to about 30,000 children in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. There are several others who are spending their millions wisely to try and meet the countrys pressing needs of education and healthcare. Other large corporate groups such as Reliance have made a start in these areas and have big plans on the anvil.        
	However, a very large section of India Inc prefers to give back to society through corporate social responsibilities (CSR) initiatives. It is often difficult to draw a clear line between what is done in an individuals capacity through foundations or at the companys level, says Swati Piramal. The Piramal group on its part has undertaken several CSR initiatives in the areas of clean drinking water, mobile healthcare and education.        
	As the Bain report said, most of corporate India is run by family owned groups. It is likely that some families and individuals view CSR initiatives as extensions of their own giving.         
	Premji, however, has chosen to step out of the mould. There is hope that others may follow suit. Individuals such as Vineet Nayyar of Tech Mahindra has gifted Rs 30 crore to the Essel Social Welfare Foundation.        
	I believe others can and will follow suit, said an optimistic Dadrawala.         
	Bill Gates who was disappointed in China when he tried to persuade the super rich to part with their millions may not face the same experience in the subcontinent.

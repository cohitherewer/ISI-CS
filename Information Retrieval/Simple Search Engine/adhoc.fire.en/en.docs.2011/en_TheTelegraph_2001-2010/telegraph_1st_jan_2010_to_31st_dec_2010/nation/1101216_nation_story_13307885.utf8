The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP fires oil salvo, says raids too late
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP fires oil salvo, says raids too late
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The petrol price hike was anti-people and unnecessary and the CBI raids on the offices and homes of corporate lobbyist Niira Radia and DMK associates were too little and too late, the BJP said today.        
	Spokesperson Prakash Javadekar claimed the reasons trotted out by the Centre to justify the price rise  increase in international crude prices and a decline in inflation  were unjustified.        
	He said the government first raised the price when the international price had soared to $140 a barrel. But when it fell to $80, the government brought down the price by only Re 1 a litre. Now, when the global price of petrol is $100, the government has raised the price by Rs 8.        
	Javadekar criticised the huge levy on imported petrol (the difference is Rs 4 on every litre imported) and said it was the highest taxation in the world. His third contention was the phenomenon of recoveries is notional because all the oil companies are making profits. Lastly, he stressed, petrol and diesel were now necessities, not luxuries.        
	The spokesperson contested the use of inflationary figures to support the increase. He said market food prices did not reflect the reality because from August 2010, the government had tweaked the basis of calculating the wholesale price index (WPI).        
	He pointed out that the base year had changed from 1993-94 to 2004 and the basket of 435 items gone up to 676 items. The result was the weightage given to food items went down from 15.4 per cent to 14.3 per cent. And more surprisingly, food grains like wheat, rice and millets per se account for only 0.4 per cent in the series, said Javadekar. So people were paying much more for such items than what was declared in the WPI.On the CBI raids, he said: Until FIRs are filed, the exercise is meaningless. After all these months, which of those raided would have kept incriminating documents? Therefore, a JPC is the only effective mechanism to monitor the governments actions.

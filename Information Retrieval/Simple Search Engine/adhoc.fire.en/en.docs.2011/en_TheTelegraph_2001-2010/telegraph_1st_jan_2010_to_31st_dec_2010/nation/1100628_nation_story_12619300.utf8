          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 27: The army went into a flutter today after its chief, General V.K. Singh, was quoted from an interview to a defence trade journal that he was against diluting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) that gives sweeping authority to the army in counter-insurgency zones.        
	V.K. Singhs remarks were published even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram have said they were exploring ways to make the act more humane.        
	Encounter killings in Jammu and Kashmir just last week and repeated violence in the Northeast have provoked public outcry demanding a scrapping of the act.

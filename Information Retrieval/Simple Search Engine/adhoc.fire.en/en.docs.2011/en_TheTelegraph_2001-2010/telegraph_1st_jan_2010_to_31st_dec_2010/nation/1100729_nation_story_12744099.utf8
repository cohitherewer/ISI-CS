The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jawans made sitting ducks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jawans made sitting ducks
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, July 28: The 75 CRPF jawans killed in the deadliest attack by Maoists were sitting ducks led into a suicidal act by local commanders who seemed on a padayatra or picnic, says a report on the massacre.        
	The report by former BSF chief E.N. Rammohan on the April 6 ambush in Chhattisgarhs Chintalnar forests says the CRPF leadership sent such a big team on patrolling duty without basic ground support and intelligence.        
	The manner in which the jawans died as sitting ducks shows the entire area was swarming with Maoist cadres who were led by a CC member (CPI (Maoist) central committee member) or a senior strategist. The tragedy is that although the information (about the rebels mobilisation) was available with the local police and the CRPF top brass, it was not conveyed down the line to the team that went combing the area.         
	The dossier is a follow-up to the findings Rammohan had submitted to the Union home ministry days after the attack. The fresh report has been sent to Andhra Pradesh and other states fighting the rebels.        
	Satyavan Yadav, who led the team and perished in the strike, was ill-informed about the geographical and tactical issues related to operations in a Maoist den like Chintalnar. It appears the CRPF jawans and their immediate bosses went around the entire exercise like they were on a padayatra or a picnic, the report says.        
	A previous attack in the same area, in Gadgadmet, should have alerted top officers to the possibility of a repeat. It is strange the jawans did not concentrate on occupying the hillock (from where the rebels fired) before launching combing operations.         
	In view of the information gap and evidence that inputs were not passed on, Rammohan has suggested that the CRPF should have its own intelligence wing.         
	The report also highlights the lack of basic facilities and failure to prevent disruption of supplies by the rebels, saying the Chintalnar outpost had no emergency arrangements. Normally troops choke supplies to rebels but in this case, the Maoists stalled supply of food to the jawans. Such a situation never existed in the past.

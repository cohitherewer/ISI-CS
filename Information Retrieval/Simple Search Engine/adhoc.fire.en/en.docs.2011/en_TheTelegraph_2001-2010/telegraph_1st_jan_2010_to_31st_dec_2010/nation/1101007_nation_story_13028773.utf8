          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Ayodhya verdict has cast a shadow of doubt over the BJP-Janata Dal (United)s plan for a joint NDA campaign in the Bihar elections.         
	It is believed that chief minister Nitish Kumar was increasingly disconcerted at the thought of sharing public space with L.K. Advani and Ravi Shankar Prasad  among the BJPs star campaigners  because of their close association with the Ayodhya issue.         
	Although in principle the BJP  more to the point, its Bihar leaders such as Sushil Modi  have decided to drop the A word from the poll discourse, a source wondered whether Advani and Prasad could check themselves from speaking about it in speeches.        
	For Advani, Bihar is an integral part of the Ayodhya chapter he scripted for the BJP. His Ram rath was stopped and Advani arrested in Samastipur on the orders of Lalu Prasad, then the chief minister, in October 1990.         
	Advaniji harks back to the past often when hes speaking and I cant see him not recalling his arrest, a Bihar leader said.        
	Prasad, who was the counsel for Sri Ram Lalla Virajman in Allahabad High Court, has been felicitated outside Bihar for the victory. Although the Bihar unit was directed to hold its horses, sources said even if Prasad was restrained, there is no guarantee that our workers will not greet him with Jai Shri Ram.        
	A Dal(U) leader admitted that Nitish had told his confidants that while he had managed to get Narendra Modi and Varun Gandhi off his back, he was worried about how he could handle Advani and Prasad.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, July 26: The army today raised the spectre of women officers commanding men and being captured by the enemy as it argued in the Supreme Court against a high court order to grant permanent commission to women.        
	It also claimed that the air force and the army were as different as chalk and cheese, which is why the first could grant permanent commission to women but the second could not.        
	The air force has already complied with the high court order. The air force rules are clear: women will be offered permanent commission if found suitable. But the army rules clearly say they will be released after expiry of their contractual period, defence ministry counsel Parag Tripathi said.        
	He argued that the practice could not be called discriminatory because it was compatible with the Constitution and the Army Act, 1950.        
	It (granting permanent commission) will have a fundamental impact on functioning and discipline in the army. There are other issues as well  commanding men and the fact that they (women) could be captured as PoWs (prisoners of war), Tripathi said.        
	Delhi High Court had, on March 3 this year, directed the army and the air force to grant permanent commission to women but the defence ministry has challenged the order in the apex court.        
	Women are now recruited into the army only on short service commission (for a maximum of 14 years). Men can qualify for permanent commission depending on their service record.        
	Tripathi said the high court order was based on the mistaken notion that army rules were silent on the subject. He said the army notification seeking to employ women in the short service commission clearly said they would not be given permanent commission.        
	He cited Article 33 of the Constitution, which says Parliament can restrict or abrogate the fundamental rights relating to the armed forces to ensure proper discharge of duties and discipline.        
	He also mentioned Section 12 of the Army Act, which says no woman shall be eligible for employment in the regular army, except in such corps, departments, branches or other bodies as the Centre may specify by notification.        
	The bench of Justice J.M. Panchal and Justice Gyansudha Mishra said: You should have raised this argument at the threshold.        
	Tripathi insisted this argument had been raised in the high court, and added that the army notification about women not being granted permanent commission was never challenged in the high court.        
	This notification can only be struck down after the court considers the policy laid down in Article 33 and Section 12 of the Army Act, he said. That was not done, he said, implying that if Article 33 and Section 12 stood, the notification would too.        
	The top court directed the government to produce the army notification, if any, by Monday.        
	The defence ministry had appealed the March 3 order on July 6 after the high court issued contempt notices to the army chief, defence secretary and adjutant-general for not complying with its order.        
	The March 3 order had come on a petition filed by 52 women officers from the army and the air force. There are 4,101 women officers in the army, 784 in the air force and 252 in the navy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre tweaks school plan for Bengal 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre tweaks school plan for Bengal 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 7: The human resource development ministry is tweaking its flagship scheme to universalise secondary education exclusively for Bengal  forced by the desperate shortage of government schools in the state.         
	The HRD ministry will fund select privately run, government-aided schools in Bengal under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) because less than 5 per cent secondary schools in the state are government-run, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan that has propelled Indias primary school enrolment rate to nearly 100 per cent, the RMSA aims to universalise secondary education exclusively through government-run schools.         
	But the UPAs single largest new education scheme, launched a year back, was almost immediately questioned by Bengal at internal meetings between the HRD ministry and state officials.         
	The HRD ministry initially refused to tweak the scheme but has now decided that it cannot hope to increase secondary school enrolment in Bengal merely through government schools, sources said.         
	But the ministry is determined that it will make an exception only for Bengal  the state with the lowest percentage of secondary schools in the government sector. We have literally been forced into tweaking the schemes rules because Bengal just doesnt have the government schools to significantly improve secondary enrolment, a source said.         
	Under the scheme guidelines, the Centre funds government schools to expand their infrastructure, classrooms, apart from assisting states in publicity drives. Each selected school receives central financial assistance to contribute towards increasing student enrolment.         
	India has a national secondary education enrolment rate of around 52 per cent. The RMSA aims at achieving a gross enrolment rate (GER) of 75 per cent by 2014. The most backward states, like Bihar, have a GER of about 25 per cent.         
	But the Bengal case also revealed a deeper national challenge that the central and state governments will face in increasing the national GER to 75 per cent in five years. Statistics with the ministry show that nationally the country is dependent on private schools for secondary education.         
	Only 40 per cent of schools offering Classes VI-VIII are government run  31 per cent contributed by central and state government institutions and nine per cent by municipal schools. The figure drops further for higher secondary schools  Classes IX-XIII  with only 37 per cent of such schools run by governments.         
	Thirty-one per cent are run by the central and state governments and six per cent by municipal bodies, the statistics show.         
	In effect, India is trying to achieve 75 per cent GER through about 40 per cent schools.

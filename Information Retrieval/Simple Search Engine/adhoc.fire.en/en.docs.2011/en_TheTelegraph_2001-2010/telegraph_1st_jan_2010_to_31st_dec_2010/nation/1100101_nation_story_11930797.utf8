	Dec. 31: Two women who were apparently made to act as human shields by Maoists suffered bullet injuries today when security forces opened fire in a West Midnapore village.        
	The women have been admitted to Bankura Medical College Hospital, where the condition of one is termed critical.        
	Police sources said the security team from Bhalukchira camp was sent to Keshia village, about 6km from the Bankura border, after a tip-off about Maoist presence there.        
	When the team reached Keshia around 2.30pm, it ran into a human shield of women, according to police sources. Suspected Maoists opened fire from behind the women, an officer said. The joint force team retaliated, injuring at least two women.        
	Jharna Ahir, 30, was hit in an arm while Rekha Karmakar, 35, suffered bullet wounds in her arm, chest and trachea. Karmakar was taken for immediate surgery.        
	Toll touches 100        
	Maoists shot dead two former CPM men in West Midnapores Belpahari last night, raising the toll of political activists killed by them this year to 100.

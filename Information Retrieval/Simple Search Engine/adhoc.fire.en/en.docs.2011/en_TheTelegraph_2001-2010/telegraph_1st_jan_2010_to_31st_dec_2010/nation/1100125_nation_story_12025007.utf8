	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 24: The body of CPM zilla parishad member Anand Masiharo, abducted and reportedly killed by Maoists, is yet to be traced.        
	Masiharo was kidnapped from Sundergarh district on Friday night.        
	Some local villagers informed police that a body had been spotted near Kadamtola area near Sanbalijodi along the Orissa-Jharkhand border. However, the district police team could not find the body at the spot.         
	No such body has been found. We cannot confirm his death, too. Combing operations are on to trace Masiharo, said Sundergarh police superintendent Diptesh Patnaik, adding that the reason behind the abduction was still not known.        
	The 35-year-old leader was abducted by about 50 rebels, who had stormed into Roxy village on Friday night. He was dragged out of his home and taken away to an unknown place at gunpoint by the rebels who disappeared into nearby forest.        
	The same night, the rebels had abducted two brothers  Harinath Mundari and Narendra Mundari  from Jamdiha under K. Balang police station. They also attacked a dhaba owned by them and beat them up before taking them away. The rebels had looted clothes and other food items from a grocery shop, also managed by the Mundari brothers. The Naxalites also looted two dumpers and two motorbikes also. While the two brothers have been released, Masiharo is yet to be traced. The Mundari brothers reached home last night around 10pm, saying they were let off by the Maoist kangaroo court.        
	Meanwhile, Maoist posters and leaflets have been recovered across the district ahead of the two-day bandh, starting tomorrow.         
	Demanding the release of Subhashree, alias Saswati, wife of top Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda and others, the CPI (Maoist) has called an economic blockade across the state on January 25 and bandh on the Republic Day.

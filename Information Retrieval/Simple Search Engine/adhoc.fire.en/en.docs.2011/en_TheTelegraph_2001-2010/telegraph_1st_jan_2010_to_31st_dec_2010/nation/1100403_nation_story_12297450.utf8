	New Delhi, April 2: Four Indian Navy warships, a submarine and two Singaporean vessels have assembled near the Andamans for fortnight-long war games starting tomorrow.         
	Indian naval helicopters and surveillance aircraft will also participate in the drill that will be held in two zones, the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal.        
	The SIMBEX (Singapore Indian Maritime Bilateral Exercise) is an annual drill that began in 1994.        
	The exercises have graduated from purely training oriented anti-submarine warfare exercises to complex exercises, involving multiple facets of operations at sea, navy spokesperson Commander P.V. S. Satish said.        
	The 2010 edition that will end on April 16 will incorporate complex three-dimensional (under-surface, surface and air) threat scenarios.        
	For the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), a frigate, the RSS Intrepid, and a corvette, the RSS Victory, will participate in the drills. The Indian Navys deployment involves the INS Batti Malv (fast-attack craft) and INS Mahish (landing ship tank) from the Andaman and Nicobar Command, IN ships Ranvir (destroyer), Jyoti (tanker) and a submarine from the Eastern Fleet.        
	The Singaporean warships will anchor at Port Blair and Visakhapatnam during the exercise.

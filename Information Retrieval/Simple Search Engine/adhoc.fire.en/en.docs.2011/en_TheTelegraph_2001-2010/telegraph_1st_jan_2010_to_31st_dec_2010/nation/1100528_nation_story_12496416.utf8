	Midnapore, May 27: Suspected Maoists shot dead one of the four gram panchayat workers they had kidnapped in West Midnapore yesterday and released the other three.         
	The body of Shatrughan Ghosh, 42, a Group D employee of the CPM-run Patina panchayat in Nayagram, was found by the side of a road in a neighbouring village.         
	Maoist posters, found near the body of the CPM branch committee member, accused him of being a police informer.        
	The other three employees  Satyajit Giri, the secretary of the panchayat, Gouranga Patra, an assistant secretary, and job assistant Sanat Das  have returned home.        
	This was the first time that the Maoists abducted panchayat employees.        
	Jhargram superintendent of police Praveen Tripathi said the four were kidnapped on their way back to office after reviewing work under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme at the local panchayat samiti office in Baligeria.        
	Shatrughans body was found today. The others have returned home, Tripathi said.        
	A villager who witnessed the abduction said a group of 15 armed men stopped the panchayat workers auto-rickshaw on the Nayagram-Gopiballavpur road. They asked the four to get off and took them away towards Chamarbandh near Keshia forest, the villager said.         
	Sources in Keshia village said the Maoists released three of the kidnapped persons soon after reaching Chamarbandh.        
	The police said Maoists had started frequenting Nayagram after they killed six CPM leaders there in January.

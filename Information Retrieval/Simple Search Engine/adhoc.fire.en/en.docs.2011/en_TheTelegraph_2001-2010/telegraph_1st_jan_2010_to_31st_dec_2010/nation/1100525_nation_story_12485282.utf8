The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIT boost for young teachers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IIT boost for young teachers
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 24: Call it the Rahul Gandhi doctrine at the IITs.         
	Indias premier engineering schools plan to select for the first time young professors for induction into their boards of governors to inject fresh perspectives into decision-making as the institutes chart their future.        
	The human resource development (HRD) ministry has appointed a three-member panel to scout all the IITs and the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and headhunt for 150 young professors, top government and institute officials have told The Telegraph.        
	The shortlisted faculty will be further whittled down after a series of interviews. Successful candidates will be nominated to the boards of the IITs and the NITs as special invitees, the officials said.        
	This is the first time we are trying something like this. It is an opportunity of a lifetime for young professors to sit alongside some of the countrys biggest names and assume a leadership role, a source said.         
	The HRD ministry panel was appointed on May 7 and will be chaired by IIT Guwahati director Gautam Barua, with the Jaipur-based Malaviya NIT director Raj Pal Dahiya and IIT Madras professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala as the other members.         
	India has 15 IITs and 20 NITs. Each IIT and NIT has a 15-member board of governors (BoG) chaired by an outsider appointed by the HRD minister.         
	The boards of most of these institutes are headed by some of the countrys best-known scientists, such as former atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar (IIT Bombay), R. Chidambaram (IIT Madras) and Goverdhan Mehta (IIT Jodhpur).         
	Industrialists, bureaucrats (current and retired) and corporate executives make up the rest of the members on these boards.         
	The BoG is the highest decision-making authority of an institute. It was always felt that senior, experienced people alone could contribute to the process. But that thinking is changing, a senior administrator said.         
	Last years prolonged pay protests by IIT professors was largely fuelled by the rage among young faculty members who felt that they were not being compensated enough for choosing teaching over corporate jobs.         
	The ministry and the IITs are hoping that they will better understand the needs and demands of young faculty members by giving them a direct voice at the BoGs.         
	Giving these young teachers a platform at the high table of their IITs will hopefully help bridge the generation gap within the Institutes, a source said.         
	The young professors selected will learn administrative and leadership roles by participating in key board discussions.

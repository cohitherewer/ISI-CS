                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Terror and   trade to check Pak intent
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Nirupama Rao and Salman Bashir                                        
	New Delhi, June 20: The tone of the foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan in Islamabad scheduled this Thursday will not be accusatory but exploratory, senior government officials said today.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao will hold the talks with her Pakistani counterpart Salman Bashir. Raos trip will be the first visit by a senior Indian official or minister to Islamabad since May 2008. India had aborted the composite dialogue after 26/11. The foreign secretaries had met on February 25 this year, but in Delhi.        
	India, the officials said, will explore Pakistans intent to normalise relations at the June 24 discussions. One test of this will be the neighbours willingness to boost trade ties and whether it is ready to give India the most favoured nation status. The term means a nation will treat another country like others and not discriminate against it in trade matters.        
	The officials said they were willing to discuss all other issues, too, at the meeting where the two sides are expected to scratch each others minds to find ways to lessen their trust deficit. New Delhi will raise the issue of terrorism and its information that attacks initiated in Pakistani soil could take place in India or its stations in Afghanistan.        
	It is Pakistans responsibility to ensure that groups operating from its soil are not able to carry out such attacks as any such strike in the future will have a very damaging impact (on the ties), an official said.        
	On Friday, India handed over to Pakistan a dossier related to 26/11. It contained information on the roles of Hafiz Saeed, chief of alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba front Jamat-ud-Dawa, and Lashkar top gun Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi in the Mumbai attack. The document was given in response to questions raised by Islamabad in April.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram will hold a bilateral meeting with Pakistans interior minister Rehman Malik on Friday, a day after the discussions between the foreign secretaries. Chidambaram is travelling to Pakistan to attend the Saarc home ministers meeting on Saturday.         
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna will also be in Islamabad, on July 15, for talks with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.        
	During Chidambarams talks with Malik, the Indian side will urge Pakistan to dismantle the terror infrastructure, check fake Indian currency smuggled into India not only from Pakistan but also from other neighbouring countries and speed up the trial in Pakistan of the 26/11 suspects.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Congress is set to amend its constitution at this plenary, extending the party presidents tenure from the existing three years to five years.        
	The partys subjects committee today approved a draft resolution suggesting the change.        
	After the amendment is formally carried out  through a voice vote if no one dissents  the organisational elections and the plenary too will be held once in five years instead of three years.        
	The party has been brazenly violating the existing rule of holding the plenary every three years  even the current plenary is being held after almost five years. The party leadership, therefore, thought it wise to amend the constitution and legitimise the delay.        
	Under the existing constitution, the All India Congress Committee meeting is to be held at least twice a year but this will now be changed to a once-a-year rule. The party has been regularly flouting this norm, too.        
	The membership fee of Rs 3 will be increased to Rs 5.

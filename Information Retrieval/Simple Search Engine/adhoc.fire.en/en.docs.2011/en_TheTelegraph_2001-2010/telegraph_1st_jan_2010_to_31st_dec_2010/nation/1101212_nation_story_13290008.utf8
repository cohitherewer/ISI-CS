          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 11: Kick the butt and get paid for it.        
	An Andhra minister in Kiran Kumar Reddys government is planning to reward every smoker in his department who agrees to junk the cancer stick with Rs 2,000 every month.        
	This is not the first time minor irrigation minister T.G. Venkatesh will be trying out such a scheme. As an industrialist and hotelier in Kurnool before his political foray, he has already weaned some of his employees away from the destructive habit.        
	Each of my ministry employees who quits smoking will get Rs 1,000 as immediate incentive and another Rs 1,000 will be transferred to their PPF accounts, Venkatesh, a first-time minister, said.        
	The idea behind paying people was more symbolic than monetary, he said, the cash only serving to remind quitters how much they would be able to save each month if they gave up puffing. Do not look at the monetary benefits but at the spirit behind my campaign.        
	Under the scheme Venkatesh had introduced for his employees two years ago, each person was required to give an undertaking in writing that he/she would give up smoking for keeps. In return, each would be paid Rs 1,000 a month.        
	The condition for payment was that if anyone was caught puffing on the sly or going back to the habit full time, all the money paid to the person till date would be deducted from his/her salary.        
	I am not giving them charity, said Venkatesh, who has been paying his employees out of his pocket. In case of his ministry staff too, he proposes to pay from his personal funds to begin with but would be on the lookout for donors.        
	According to district authorities, hundreds of Venkateshs 19,430 private employees have been beneficiaries of his no-smoking scheme. The monthly bill is as high as Rs 20 lakh, the minister, who owns at least six industrial units including Rayalaseema Paper and Rayalaseema Alkalis, said.        
	Venkatesh said he had put in place a mechanism to monitor whether employees who had signed up were cheating on him or whether non-smokers had signed up just to get the money. He would install a similar watchdog mechanism in his ministry  it has about 28,000 employees in all  before introducing the scheme, he said.        
	A spokesperson for VST Industries Ltd, the manufacturers of Charminar cigarettes, said: We commend the ministers scheme and wish him luck to succeed in spite of the impact it will have on the industry.

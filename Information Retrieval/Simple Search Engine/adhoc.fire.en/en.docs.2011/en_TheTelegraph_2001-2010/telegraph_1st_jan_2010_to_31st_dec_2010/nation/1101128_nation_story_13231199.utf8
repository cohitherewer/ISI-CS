The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stones in hand of govt staff
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stones in hand of govt staff
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Nov. 27: Government employees in Kashmir are not only striking work and disobeying seniors in response to the separatists call, some of them have joined the bands of stone-throwers.        
	Some 60 government staff, including a special police officer (SPO), have been arrested since the unrest began on June 11, Kashmir police chief S.M. Sahai has said. Another 75, including some officer-level employees, are under the scanner.        
	Seven of them (the arrested 60) have been booked under the Public Safety Act. In some cases, they participated in stone-throwing and in others they instigated the trouble, Sahai said.        
	The Public Safety Act allows detention without trial for up to two years. One of the seven booked under this law is Nissar Ahmad Sheikh, an SPO whose arrest was reported in The Telegraph two months ago. SPOs are not the regular police; they are causal employees who carry out some policing duties.        
	Most of the arrested government employees have received bail, police sources said, but some have been suspended by their departments following a police request for disciplinary action.        
	Those who were arrested are mostly low-ranking employees, a police source said, but some officers too supported the unrest and we are mulling action against them.        
	Thousands of government employees have struck work in response to shutdown calls from separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. In several instances, staff have refused to obey superiors orders.        
	A zonal education officer from Trehgam, Mohammad Munawar Shah, refused to perform magisterial duties assigned to him by the district magistrate in July. As punishment, he was attached with the additional deputy commissioners office in August.        
	Before him, a senior superintendent of the CID, Ghulam Hassan Bhat, had refused to take over as Baramulla police chief. He was attached to the police headquarters as punishment.

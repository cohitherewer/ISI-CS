The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ore crisis hits Orissa steel units hard
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ore crisis hits Orissa steel units hard
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          ore supply shock                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 30: The steel hub at Kalinga Nagar now suffers from an acute shortage of iron ore.         
	To add to the crisis, some steel units  for the first time in the history of this mineral-rich state  have to import ore from Bellary in Karnataka to avoid closing down.        
	Traditionally, Orissa is known for its quality and affordable iron ore, but the situation has changed so much that now the units are fighting twin battles- threat of closure and no reserve to run their plants in future days.        
	The Kalinga Nagar Industries Association president and managing director of KJ Ispat Limited, Purushottam Kandoi, said: Usually, the plants have to reserve ore for at least three months for smooth run, but when there is no ore even now, there is no question of thinking about the reserve stock.        
	Kandoi said the 10 steel units under the association started functioning as they were given assurance of uninterrupted ore supply from the nearest Daitari mines, but its closure for various reasons, including environmental clearance and pollution control, have changed the situation in the past six months. Above all, the mining scam in the state has created fresh troubles for the investors, he said.        
	With an annual production capacity of around 3 million tonnes, four units  Visa, Maithan, Dinbandhu and KJ Ispat  has already downed their shutters, the association members claimed, adding that in the long run this might create job loss, deterioration of law and order, fiscal loss and less revenue collection. These units alone must have generated more than Rs 300 crore, they claimed.        
	As the mineral transportation sector in Orissa is largely controlled and dominated by mines mafia, they were taking advantage of the present situation and were charging unreasonable rates.

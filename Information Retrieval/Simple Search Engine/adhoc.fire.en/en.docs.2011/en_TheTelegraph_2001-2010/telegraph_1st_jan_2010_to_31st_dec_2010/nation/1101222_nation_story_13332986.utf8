  Specific queries on telecom link           OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Niira Radia                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: A five-member CBI team today questioned corporate lobbyist Niira Radia at her south Delhi residence for over three hours, a day after issuing summons to former telecom minister A. Raja.        
	We asked her specific questions on her association with telecom companies and also her interaction with A. Raja. Her statement was recorded under Section 160 of the CrPC, a CBI officer said.        
	Asked why Radia was not summoned to the CBI office, the officer said: Under Section 160, no male under the age of 15 or woman is required to attend any place other than the place in which the male person or woman resides.        
	Vineeta Thakur, the CBI deputy inspector-general, declined comment. Its the discretion of the investigating officer whether he/she wants to summon the person to the office or question the person at his residence, she said.        
	She also refused to comment on whether Raja would be summoned to the CBIs office.        
	The officer said the CBI was awaiting the CFSL report on the computers that had been seized from Radias house and her office, Vaishnavi Communications, during the November 14 raid.        
	The CBI team, which reached Radias home at 10am and left at 1.30pm, was accompanied by an officer of the Enforcement Directorate, which questioned her last month on money-laundering allegations. The ED had summoned Radia to its headquarters where she was interrogated for seven hours and made to write a statement.        
	We are only investigating the criminality part. The ED is probing whether there was any money laundering in the scam. Both agencies are assisting each other, Thakur said.        
	Another CBI officer said the agency would submit its status report to the Supreme Court by February.        
	After conducting so many raids and questioning people, we are planning to start specific cases against some people under the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly influencing government servants for personal benefits, he said.        
	On October 21, 2009, the CBI had registered a case against unknown officials of the department of telecom and unknown private persons/companies for allegedly causing loss of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer.

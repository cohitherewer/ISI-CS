The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pappus poll fate sealed
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pappus poll fate sealed
          NALIN VERMA                          Pappu: Politics is over?                                  
	Patna, May 3: Quashing the bail of former MP Pappu Yadav, alias Rajesh Ranjan, the Supreme Court today apparently sealed the political fate of the don whose name struck terror in the Kosi belt comprising 30 Assembly constituencies on the Bengal and Nepal borders.        
	Patna High Court on February 18, 2009, granted bail to Pappu in what the legal and political circles found most unusual manner. Using the legal breather, Pappu fielded his mother and wife on Congress tickets from Purnea and Supaul, respectively, in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.        
	The apex court, in its ruling today, virtually issued a stricture on the high court for granting him bail despite the fact it had restrained the courts from releasing the don, who was awarded life sentence in the murder of CPM MLA Ajit Sarkar by a CBI special court.        
	Pappu, over the years, has ruled the Kosi region the way RJD don Mohammad Shahabuddin reigned the north Bihars Siwan region till the court awarding him life sentence in the kidnapping and murder of a CPI(ML) worker.        
	Pappu, who won the Purnea Lok Sabha seat in 1999, failed to enter the poll arena in 2009 with the court declaring him a convict. Though he fielded his mother and wife in the 2009 polls, both of them lost.        
	The don, who represented Purnea four times and was arrested in the wake of Ajit Sarkars murder in June 1998, was released only a couple of months before the 2009 elections. He said he had not got much time to campaign for his mother and wife.         
	Pappu also won the Purnea seat in 1999 on an RJD ticket from jail, and that too with huge margin.        
	The Congress did not induct him officially in the party. But his wife and mother are in the Congress, which had been apparently banking on the dons clout in the region for success in the polls.         
	But the apex courts order today virtually sealed the political career of the don for he appears set to stay behind the bars during the coming Assembly elections. And his wife and mother might find it hard to carry out the political operations in the absence of Pappu, their real strength.

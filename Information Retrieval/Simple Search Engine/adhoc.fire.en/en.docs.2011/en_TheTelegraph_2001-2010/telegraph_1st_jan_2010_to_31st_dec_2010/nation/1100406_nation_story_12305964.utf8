          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Yeddyurappa being offered a sweet after the BJPs win in the civic polls in Bangalore on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Bangalore, April 5: The BJP has bagged the Bangalore municipal corporation for the first time, pulling off a surprise victory in the information technology hub at a time the party-run Karnataka government is grappling with faction feuds.        
	The BJP won an outright majority, securing 112 of the 198 civic seats.        
	The is the first time in 54 years that a Sangh parivar affiliate is winning the reins of the city, where the Congress used to hold sway and elections were due over three years ago.        
	Bangalore will now become the jewel in the BJP southern crown. Karnataka is also the first  and so far, the sole  state in the region with a government led by the party.        
	The triumph in Bangalore is in line with the 2008 Assembly election results in which the BJP had won 17 of the 28 seats within the corporation area. However, since then, the fortunes of the BJP had taken a dive because of rebellion that had pushed the government to the brink.        
	The Congress, which controlled the corporation earlier, came second with 64 seats in the corporation. Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) won 15 seats. The remaining seven seats went to other parties and Independents.        
	Elsewhere in Karnataka, the BJP controls the Mangalore municipal corporation and the Hubli-Dharwad civic body, having won both before it came to power in the state two years ago.        
	Todays victory is seen as a shot in the arm for chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, whose government has been wracked by factionalism leading to the stand-off between him and MLAs led by the powerful Reddy brothers since last November.         
	With such massive support from the people of Bangalore, we redeem our pledge to make Bangalore a model global metro, Yeddyurappa said after the results were declared today.         
	Yeddyurappa promised a development blitz in Bangalore, Indias Silicon Valley that is groaning under its own weight and lack of infrastructure. Over the next three years, he said, the government will spend Rs 22,500 crore on building infrastructure.        
	The civic elections were held after a delay of over three years caused by a move to carve out a larger municipal body, Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), by bringing in the fast-developing areas on the citys outskirts under a common administration. The term of the previous corporation ended in 2006.        
	Since winning power in the state on a wafer-thin majority in the Assembly with the help of Independent candidates in May 2008, the BJP has cemented its position by winning key bypolls that were necessitated by a spate of defections from rivals Congress and Dal (Secular).        
	 In the Lok Sabha elections last year, the BJP had won 19 of Karnatakas 28 seats, the highest tally for the party among all the states.        
	The Congress said the BJPs money power and abuse of official machinery had helped it win. The party in power always has an advantage. The party also blamed poor turnout.

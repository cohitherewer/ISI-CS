          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Feb. 3: Railway Board secretary K.B.L. Mittal, appointed when Lalu Prasad was in charge, has been replaced by Shivaji Rakshit, till now an adviser to South Eastern Railway which falls on current minister Mamata Banerjees home turf.        
	Mittal, 57, was appointed to the post on December 31, 2008, and enjoyed the rank of additional secretary. Mittal, due to retire in March 2012, was asked to demit office last evening by the railway ministry, official sources said.        
	Mittals successor Rakshit was financial adviser to South Eastern Railway.        
	Officials were tightlipped on the reasons behind the administrative change, which has been brought about 20 days before the presentation of the railway budget.        
	But Railway Board sources said Mittals transfer was routine and would have no bearing on the budget. A Railway Board secretary deals with only administrative matters, a source said. It is the Railway Board chairman who deals with policy matters.        
	Trinamul complaint        
	In Delhi, the Trinamul Congress has alleged that alongside Naxalites, CPM workers in the three rebel-hit districts of Bengal possess illegal arms and ammunition and demanded that the central forces confiscate them.        
	A delegation of ministers Sisir Adhikari, C.M. Jatua and Mukul Roy today met home minister P. Chidambaram and Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan. The delegation urged Chidambaram to ensure that the central forces compelled the CPM cadres to surrender the weapons.         
	They iterated the demand that the anti-Naxalite operations in Bengal be carried out exclusively by the central paramilitary forces. The delegation alleged that the state police were highly politicised.

	Ranchi, Feb. 16: Income tax officials today conducted raids on the houses of Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Sorens private secretary as part of a wider crackdown on former chief minister Madhu Kodas associates.        
	The officials swooped down on Sorens secretary M.L. Pals houses  one in Jamshedpur and two in Ranchi. Search and seizure operations were conducted in 70 locations across the country, including Patna, Delhi, Mumbai and Chaibasa.        
	Todays raids were a follow-up to ongoing investigations into the scam involving Koda, who is alleged to have amassed illegal wealth worth Rs 2,000 crore by handing out mining leases.         
	Pal, considered close to both Koda and Soren, is said to have used his influence to facilitate the deals. Also, the Koda government was alleged to have favoured firms floated by Pals son.

  - Washermen plot to go to Gujarat school           SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                     
	New Delhi, July 25: The Supreme Court has said it will not question the need of state governments to acquire land and upheld a Gujarat government decision to take over a plot in a crowded residential area of Surat to establish a school.         
	In respect of need and necessity, it is for the government and their authorities to take a decision considering various aspects. If such a decision is taken based on materials, it is not for the court to doubt their claim, a two-judge bench said on Friday.         
	The high court had earlier on January 12, 2009, upheld the states claim that the land was necessary to set up the school. That decision, which came 19 years after the petition was filed in the high court in 1990, was challenged by several washermen who traditionally used the plot for their livelihood.         
	Dahyabhai Ranchhoddas Dhobi and others contested the state governments decision to acquire 848.66 square metres in Surat on several grounds.         
	They argued that this was the only land available to them for carrying on their livelihood, that there were other vacant and open plots adjoining their land, and that there were a number of schools run by the Surat Municipal Corporation within a 1km radius of the site.         
	Schools could not be established in residential areas by changing the use of land, the petitioners contended. They also claimed that the state had violated several provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.         
	On the other hand, the state government claimed that the land was required for establishing a primary school and said they had fully complied with the statutory notices and other requirements.         
	The state also accused the land owners of not taking the opportunity to participate in the process of filing objections against the acquisition.         
	The Supreme Court has upheld the states stand and noted that the notification for acquisition of land was published in its official gazette on March 9, 1989. A public notice was displayed at the office of the mamlatdar (revenue officer) of the ward on April 20, 1989, and hearing of objections was fixed for May 20, 1989. Objections from the public were also heard on several other days, the court said, going by the statement of the land acquisition officer.         
	The two-judge bench also rejected a contention that the award of compensation by the collector was illegal as it was not made within two years of the notification for land acquisition.         
	The time bar would not run from the first notice issued under Section 4, but from the date of the last publication of the Section 6 notification which states that the land was required for a public purpose, it said. The notice under Section 6 is issued after all objections have been heard.         
	The time bar was given to the collector to freeze the market value of the land to be paid as compensation, the court said. In this case, the notification under Section 6 was published on April 19, 1990, and the award was given on April 18, 1992. Hence, the award was on time.         
	The court rejected the plea that residential land could not be used to set up a school and also the claim that there were several schools in and around the area. The municipal corporation had said there was no municipal school nearby and that the schools located in Begampura, Moti Talkies, Mumbaivad, Shetranjivad, Viramgami Maholla were far from the land under acquisition. It also claimed that a rise in the population in Surat had made it necessary to set up a primary school in the area.         
	In respect of need and necessity, it is for the government and their authorities to take a decision. If such a decision is taken based on materials, it is not for the court to doubt their claim, judges P. Sathasivam and Anil R. Dave said.

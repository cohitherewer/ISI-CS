          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                      A flooded locality in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Hyderabad, May 21: The pain of separation killed the Laila of legend, but this Laila thought nothing of spoiling the union of many a thousand young hearts.        
	The cyclone prevented weddings across the states 10 coastal districts yesterday, turning the marriage venues into makeshift relief camps. The waterlogged roads and railway tracks left thousands of baraats stranded.        
	Adding to their woes, the district administrations today warned against any public event being held in the next few days. The cyclonic storm, which has killed 25 people, destroyed crops and flooded cities and villages, has weakened but the authorities are taking no chances.        
	Thousands of marriages were lined up yesterday because of the auspicious date. There are no good muhurtams for another 20 days, rued Visakhapatnam astrologer Srinivas Sharma.        
	Caterers, taxi operators and wedding consultants wore a disappointed look, so did jewellers and shopkeepers.        
	The revived IT industry had encouraged lavish spending on weddings, said K.S. Rao of Visakhapatnam. The cyclone has dampened the buying spree at the wedding malls of Vizag, Rajahmundry and Vijayawada.        
	These farm-rich and aqua-rich coastal districts had witnessed over Rs 320 crore worth of gold purchases on May 16, the auspicious Akshaya Tritia, said Vanaja Rao, a wedding consultant.        
	Anxious parents have been running to her for alternative dates. We can organise weddings only by the end of June, but the agricultural season is a major obstacle for most farmers families, she said.        
	In Ongole town of Prakasam district, now under knee-deep floodwaters, 521 weddings had been slated in 45 marriage halls for Friday. They have all been called off.        
	Instead of going to the kalyana mandapam (wedding pandal) we are rushing to government relief camps, said Surayaprakash Reddy, a hotel owner whose daughter was to get married this morning.        
	Police and district authorities forced them to abandon the event as power and water supply has been disrupted.        
	Still, some of yesterdays cancelled weddings were held hurriedly today at Baptla in Guntur. I shall host the wedding dinner at a later date, said Gopal Rao, a schoolteacher and father of bride Ratna.

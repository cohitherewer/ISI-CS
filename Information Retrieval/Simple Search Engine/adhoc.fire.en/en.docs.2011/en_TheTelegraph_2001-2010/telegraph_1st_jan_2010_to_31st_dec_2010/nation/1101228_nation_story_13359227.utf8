The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Terror alert to all states
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Terror alert to all states

	New Delhi, Dec. 27: The Centre today issued a terror alert to all states, days after a warning to Mumbai and Ahmedabad and the arrest of an alleged Lashkar operative in Karnataka.        
	The threat seems to be from the seas as there have been alerts almost daily to the navy and the coast guard, especially in Mumbai. But in this case the inputs have come from Karnataka. The first alert in the last week of November had come from a foreign agency, sources said.        
	Last week, Mumbai police had warned of a terror threat in the metro after an alert from the Union home ministry. A man suspected to be a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative had also been arrested by Karnataka police and jointly questioned by them and central intelligence agencies, sources said.        
	Following the interrogation, hints of a possible threat to coastal areas were arrived at, intelligence sources said. Then came inputs on how two crack teams of Lashkar operatives could target almost any public place. The Taj group of hotels and the Taj Mahal are under security surveillance.        
	Additional central forces have been sent to Goa in view of the tourist rush, said home ministry sources.        
	The new coastal security mechanism has been activated. State marine police forces, department of customs and the coast guard are keeping vigil on the Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala coasts. A few unidentified vessels have apparently been spotted off the Mumbai coast, sources said.        
	Goa is under focus because of independence celebrations and a film festival. Goa gained independence from the Portuguese in December 1961 after Indian forces marched in on 18-19.        
	David Coleman Headley, the American double agent who collaborated with the Lashkar and is now in US custody, had surveyed several sites in Mumbai, Pune, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Security has been stepped up in all these places.

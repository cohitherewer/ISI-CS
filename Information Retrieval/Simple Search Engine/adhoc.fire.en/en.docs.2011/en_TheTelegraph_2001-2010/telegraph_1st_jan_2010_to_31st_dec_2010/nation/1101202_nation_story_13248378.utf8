  - Party fights dissidence by rewarding allegiance          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy being blessed by cabinet colleague J Geetha Reddy before taking charge in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (PTI)		    
	Hyderabad, Dec. 1: Jaganmohan Reddys resignation from the Congress and Parliament may have come as a blessing for his late fathers ministers, most of who found place in the new Andhra Pradesh cabinet today, because the party wanted to foil possible dissidence.         
	Many Congressmen are relieved for not having to shoulder the burden of being a Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy loyalist any more. YSR (Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy) was very dear to us but he was one among us. Jagan was dropped amid us and acted high and mighty always, said a senior Congress leader from Rayalaseema.         
	Most of the 150-odd MLAs who had signed a memorandum on September 3, 2009, supporting Jagans claim to the chief ministers chair after YSR died heaved a sigh of relief as the majority in the YSR and K. Rosaiah cabinets  26 of the 33  were sworn in as ministers in the new Kiran Reddy dispensation.         
	Only five hardcore followers of Jagan  B. Srinivsa Reddy (mining), Pilli Subhaschandra Bose (social welfare), Shilpa Mohan Reddy (housing), Gade Venkat Reddy (endowments) and P. Ramachandra Reddy (forests)  were left out.         
	Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, the younger brother of YSR, was given a cabinet berthmuch against the wishes of Jagan and his family.         
	The Congress high command was careful to maintain the regional balance by giving 16 berths to Telangana, eight to Rayalaseema and 15 to coastal Andhra.         
	A Kiran Reddy aide, however, emphasised that the main criterion was loyalty to the high command. Loyalty to the party president and high command emerged as the sole criterion in the final count, he said.        
	The Congress high command reworked the entire list presented by Kiran Reddy in which he had suggested dropping at least 23 names in the Rosaiah cabinet. They will become a burden on me as I am a first-time minister and also chief minister, he reportedly told Veerappa Moily.         
	But after Jagans surprise resignation, the high command decided to retain most of the ministers. We had to keep them or they would have become dissidents and also prospective defectors to the Jagan camp, Moily is believed to have told senior state Congress leaders who wanted berths in the cabinet for their followers.         
	The general atmosphere of confusion today led to a couple of swearing-in goof-ups.         
	Two Congress MLAs misread the cue while taking oath and took oath as chief ministers. Erasu Pratap Reddy managed to correct himself later, not so for Sudarshan Reddy.         
	A veteran Congress minister later said: Now onwards, we have only one high command, that is Sonia Gandhi. His words almost betrayed that with or without YSR, Jaganmohan had become a parallel power centre in the state.         
	Since YSRs death, his flock was in a dilemma on how long it could keep chanting the Jagan mantra. Many veterans were upset with the sons many whims.         
	An hour after the swearing-in, a couple of ministers resigned because they were unhappy with their portfolios. Komtoreddy Venkat Reddy, given charge of infrastructure and investments, and Vatti Vasant Kumar, who got tourism, sent in their resignation letters to the chief minister.         
	Late at night, 10 ministers met at Vasant Kumars house to deliberate on what their next step should be amid a buzz that two more ministers may resign soon.

	Bhopal, Jan. 5 (PTI): An MPhil student of Barkatullah University here was allegedly gangraped by three persons, including a doctor, on the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) campus, police said today.        
	The incident took place on Sunday after the girl, who stays at the varsity hostel, left the premises without the permission of the hostel warden to meet a black magician. She then met an acquaintance, Pradeep More, who took her to Dr Raghuraj Pandey at the BMHRC, police said.        
	They were joined by Anand Mishra, a black magician, who tricked the girl into drinking liquor laced with drugs, following which she fell unconscious.         
	The trio then allegedly gangraped her.        
	The accused had taken the girl to a cinema yesterday when she managed to send an SMS to the hostel warden who alerted the police.

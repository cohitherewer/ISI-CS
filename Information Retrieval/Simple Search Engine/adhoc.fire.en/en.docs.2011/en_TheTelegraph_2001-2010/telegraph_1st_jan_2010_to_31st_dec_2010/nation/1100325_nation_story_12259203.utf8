The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 10-10: IPLs breezy Chennai rival
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      10-10: IPLs breezy Chennai rival
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          A tournament for the Thalapathy trophy underway in Chennai                                  
	Chennai, March 24: Playing out in Chennai: Indian Premier League versus the DMKs cricket league.        
	This one may not be in the same club as Lalit Modis big show. But the ingredients are all there  an abbreviated format, under lights, attractive prizes and over 2,000 teams, one from almost every street corner.        
	In its third edition, much like IPL, the DMKs own cricket league has proved a major draw among the youth of south Chennai.        
	The party aims to score high, too. It is one way to encourage youngsters who play street cricket and give them a stage to prove their skills. Also, it is an opportunity to convert them into supporters of the DMK since they know who conducts the tournament, said J. Anbazahagan, the DMKs south Chennai secretary, who started the night matches to coincide with party strongman M.K. Stalins birthday in March 2008.        
	During one of those matches, nearly 200 spectators at the corporation ground in RA Puram gawked at Mylapores Jolly Boys battling the Baba 11 from nearby Mandaveli.         
	A commentator droned on through a public address system about the score  the runs needed and balls remaining (sorry no electronic scoreboards or action replays here). Just two overs per bowler, he reminded a team trying to sneak in a third over to a stronger bowler.        
	The game is breezy. It is called Ten-Ten 10 overs to each side and played with a special cricket tennis ball  almost making the Twenty20 sound slower. Cricket fever has become a habit. Three months after it was started in March 2008, one more tournament was held in June the same year to coincide with DMK chief M. Karunanidhis birthday. Today, the matches dominate the citys night cricket, which began over a decade ago.        
	The political strategy behind it is clear. The trophies are named after Thalapathy (Stalins title meaning general) and Kalaignar (Karunanidhis honorific meaning litterateur), Anbazahgan said. The winners receive the trophy from Stalin himself.         
	To spread the message further, billboards of the DMKs top two leaders dot the three grounds where the tournament is played between 5 and 11pm from March 6 to April 5. There is no entry fee or age limit, and a group of 12 can just band together as a team and enter the fray.        
	We give them two cricket bats, two tennis balls and two sets of stumps. We also give them T-shirts with Stalins picture which they should wear during the matches. This has an impact even on youngsters who may not be pro-DMK but will cease to be anti-DMK when we go to their areas during election campaigns as they will remember us as the organisers of the cricket tournaments, said D. Mathivanan, a local party functionary.        
	Organising such a tournament costs money  rent for floodlights, their scaffoldings, gallery, power bill and rent to the corporation for the playground.         
	Most of it (the money) is collected by local functionaries of the party but the prize money of Rs 1 lakh for the winning team and Rs 10,000 each for the best batsman, bowler and all-rounder is given by Anbazhagan himself, said Sridhar Babu, the organiser at the RA Puram grounds.        
	Also, being the ruling party comes in handy as local traders and businessmen chip in with some help for favours done. For the likes of Anbazhagan and other functionaries, the tourney helps them earn brownie points with the top party leadership.        
	Even though it clashes with this years IPL and annual exams, the tournament has proved a good draw with keen spectator interest. My friends in our street would rather come to cheer me than watch (M.S.) Dhoni on TV playing for Chennai Super Kings, quipped Jayaprakash, an electrician playing for Jolly Boys.

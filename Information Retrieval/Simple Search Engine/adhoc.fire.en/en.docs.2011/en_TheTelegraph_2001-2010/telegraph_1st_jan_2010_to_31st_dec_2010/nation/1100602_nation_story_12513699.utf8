The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS in terror weed-out 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      RSS in terror weed-out 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 1: The RSS is on a rectification drive that will try to weed out swayamsevaks linked overtly and covertly to organisations such as Abhinav Bharat and with activities that qualify as Hindu terrorism.        
	Top leaders have decided to remain silent on the arrests of those suspected to be engaged in acts of terror as long as the investigations are under way, cooperate with the government and officially condemn the incidents.        
	The Sangh also plans to put an end to the kind of statements of support that BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh had issued after sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and former Lt Colonel Srikant Purohit were taken into custody over their alleged involvement in the Malegaon blasts.        
	A Sangh functionary explained why. The organisations image might take a beating that can be worse than the bad name we earned after Mahatma Gandhis assassination. Terrorism is a dirty word and people are not in a mood to make a distinction between Hindu terror and Islamic terror. A Hindu who indulges in acts of terror will be judged by the same yardstick as a terrorist of another faith.        
	The cleansing comes after investigations into the Ajmer Dargah, Samjhauta Express and Hyderabads Mecca Masjid blasts  all of them in 2007  and the 2008 Malegaon explosions implicated persons directly and indirectly connected with the Sangh.        
	Devendra Gupta, arrested recently over the Ajmer attack, was a Sangh vibhag pracharak (section propagandist). Privately, Sangh sources owned up Gupta as one of them, but stressed there was no question of giving him legal or financial help. So too with sadhvi Pragya, who was a member of RSS student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.        
	Apparently, the RSS took a dim view of the solidarity shown by Goas BJP leaders for Sanathan Sanstha, a Hindu outfit that allegedly triggered the pre-Diwali blasts at Panaji in October 2009. The BJP, a source said, should not play politics at a time the government is discreetly going about the probe and refraining from scoring political points against the RSS-BJP.        
	Sangh leaders have conveyed to the government that it must mercilessly bust the Hindu terror rings, operating through Abhinav Bharat and military training schools in Maharashtra, and arrest Ramji Kalsangra, an absconding Ajmer suspect.        
	Unlike the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Seva Bharati, the Abhinav Bharat is not a proven arm of the Sangh. But because the RSS does not maintain a record of its adherents  their numbers are estimated by the attendance at the daily, weekly and monthly shakhas or camps  sources admitted to the possibility of swayamsevaks also being members of the Abhinav Bharat.        
	There is another consideration behind the RSSs defensiveness. Evidence of Hindu terrorism will weaken our (the countrys) fight against Pakistan. Islamabad can turn around and say search your own house before screaming about cross-border terror, the source said.

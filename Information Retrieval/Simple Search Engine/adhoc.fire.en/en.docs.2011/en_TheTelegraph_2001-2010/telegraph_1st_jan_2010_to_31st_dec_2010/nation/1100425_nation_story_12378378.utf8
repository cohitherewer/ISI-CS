The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hail of home support greets Tharoor
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hail of home support greets Tharoor
          JOHN MARY                                            
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 24: For a man tweeted out, it was one hail of a reception.        
	Local cricketers, Congress workers, professionals and common city folks swarmed the airport lounge here in a rare show of solidarity today as Shashi Tharoor landed in the Kerala capital, a week after quitting as junior foreign minister in the wake of the IPL row.         
	While some waved placards, others raised slogans as Tharoor emerged from the lounge to glide through an impromptu arch of cricket bats his fans had made.        
	The turnout made up for the lack of street rallies here when Tharoor had resigned. Members of the Kids Cricket Club, the lone group to have taken out a rally after Tharoor ste- pped down, held up placards saying: keep on batting, hundreds of thousands are behind you.        
	Tharoor asked district Congress leaders present in the crowd to move out, lest the rousing reception  barely a year after Congress workers had burnt his effigy when his candidature was first announced  inconvenienced other passengers.         
	But once outside the airport gate, he mounted a vehicle and, hands folded, said he was overwhelmed.        
	I did no wrong. I only tried to do something good for the state. I was accused of graft but even those who hurled the allegation never believed it because, when I confronted an Opposition MP, he said he did not suspect me Tharoor said.        
	I am glad that my resignation has led to a thor- ough probe into the corrupt practices in the IPL and many truths are coming out. I am happy to be back among my people. You are my strength. I used my per- sonal contacts to work in the interest of Kerala, he added.        
	This man paid the price for being straight and honest, said a youth who was part of the motley gathering. He is not like the rest of the conventional pack that never misses an opportunity to make money.        
	Some posters that have appeared in the city, however, criticised the former diplomats association with Sunanda Pushkar, whose free equity in the IPL Kochi franchise triggered the events that led to Tharoors resignation.         
	Tharoor didnt have a formal meeting with the media, apparently on a directive from his party bosses, though he denied there was an official gag.         
	Later, addressing the district Congress committee at a meeting, Tharoor said he had only wanted to promote the cause of the state. Im keen to have an IPL team for Kerala. It will give opportunities to youngsters here to play with international cricketers he said.

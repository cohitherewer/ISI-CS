The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi spoils BJP lunch with PM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi spoils BJP lunch with PM
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Amit Shah at an event held in Ahmedabad recently. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, July 23: The BJP today spurned a lunch invite from the Prime Minister to express solidarity with Amit Shah, but having shown it had stood by him, party leaders were veering round to the view by tonight that Narendra Modis junior home minister should resign.        
	The CBI is closing in on Shah for his alleged complicity in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter killing.         
	The snub threatens to hold up Parliament that begins on Monday for a month-long session and proposes to pass legislation such as the civil liability for nuclear damage bill and the womens reservation bill.        
	However, the BJPs initial political instinct was to distance itself from Shah, regarded as Modis factotum, for fear that its objective at self-projection, as a responsible, law-abiding entity that respected constitutional and parliamentary propriety and norms, might get undermined.        
	Sources said last evening the Gujarat chief minister  who in the past was miffed with the Delhi darbar for not lending a shoulder to the beleaguered Shah  called a couple of senior leaders and wanted to know if they would take up the issue in Parliament.        
	In the BJP, a signal from Modi is usually treated like the almightys writ. On Thursday night, Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs four invitees  L.K. Advani, Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj  met at Advanis residence and decided that there was no point being nice to Singh when the CBI was hounding Modis lieutenant.        
	Briefing the press today, Sushma, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, said: The government is bent on using the CBI against its political adversaries. Amit Shahs case proves the government wants to pollute the atmosphere. We decided against going to the lunch because discussions can be held in a congenial and not a polluted atmosphere.        
	Singh wanted to take up the engagement with the Opposition from where Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha and finance minister, had left.         
	For a greater part of the week, Mukherjee had the non-Congress leaders over for lunch and tea in an effort to build a consensus over contentious bills and issues such as caste census and unrolling the goodwill service tax (GST) regime.        
	This morning, after a second sitting, Advani informed Mukherjee and the Prime Ministers Office of the BJPs inability to attend Singhs lunch. On July 19, we lunched with Mukherjee and had a detailed discussion on GST in a conducive atmosphere. We looked forward to a similar session with the Prime Minister but it seems the government deliberately vitiated the scene, Swaraj said.        
	However, the Delhi-Gandhinagar enforced bonding carried a double-edge: while it again proved that Modis pre-eminence was indisputable and that he leveraged his clout to have his way unlike his peers B.S. Yeddyurappa and Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the BJP did not score in this aspect.        
	Congress sources claimed there was no way the Left would wish to be seen in the BJPs company if Modi and Shah occupied centrestage in its parliamentary discourse. From that viewpoint, we have divided the Opposition in Parliament, a Congress minister claimed.        
	BJP sources admitted that their ally, the Janata Dal (United) would not want to be involved with the Gujarat events  not after the way Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had rebuffed Modi in Patna during the partys national executive.        
	Asked if Opposition unity had been affected, Sushma said: No, together we will encircle the government on price rise. The Left has already stated there will be no formal floor co-ordination with the BJP.         
	Sections of the BJP felt that emotive planks, implying persecution and vindictiveness, often resonated more in the political space than bread-and-butter issues. The Shah-Modi issue, they claimed, was comparable to Indira Gandhis victimisation by the Shah Commission during the Janata Party rule in the seventies.        
	The RSS said they would rally behind Modi although they dont like his ways. The Centres one-point agenda is to hunt him down. We will fight back politically outside Parliament, a source said.        
	Others were disconcerted with the thought that Modis resurrection might trigger off a fresh round on internal struggle for the power sweepstakes even before the BJP set its house in order.

	Srinagar, Sept. 12: Hundreds of arsonists today targeted a state ministers ancestral home in Anantnag, the first attack on a legislator in the last three months of bloody protests in the Valley.        
	According to education minister Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed, the protesters came in several hundreds and were led by Hurriyat activists and former militants.        
	The minister, who recently claimed that the Valley youth were going back to school and college instead of joining protests, said the mob came twice to attack his house.         
	The police said the protesters stayed put for over an hour in the afternoon but managed to damage only the gate of the house at Damhal Khushipora in Anantnag district, about 60km from Srinagar. They could not enter the house, the police said.        
	Sayeeds family had gone to the ancestral house yesterday to celebrate Id. The family escaped unhurt and was escorted to Srinagar, where protesters set fire to government after Id prayers yesterday.        
	A police source said the force first tried tear gas to scatter the crowd but opened fire later when the tear gas had no effect on the hundreds, who had come armed with stones.         
	One youth, identified as Salim Malik, was injured in the firing. Several others were injured in clashes between the protesters and Sayeeds supporters.         
	Sayeed, who is the seniormost minister from the Congress in Jammu and Kashmir and has also been the partys state chief, said: My supporters were present in strength. There were clashes and my supporters beat them back. Some of my supporters were also injured.         
	Describing the attack, he said: They (the mob) tried to break the wall but did not succeed. My security guards fired a couple of shots to disperse them. They were chased away. After we left the place, they again attacked the house.         
	Police sources said a large team of security personnel was guarding the house and reinforcements were rushed to disperse the mob. The family was rescued and shifted to Srinagar, a police officer said.         
	Although curfew was imposed on several parts of Kashmir after yesterdays Id violence, there were reports of people flouting the restriction orders and throwing stones at security personnel. Curfew on the day after Id is unusual in the Valley as the festival day and the day after are generally peaceful.         
	The police said some people threw stones at a police post in Sopore and were chased away. Some residents also defied curfew at the Boatman Colony in Srinagar, where security forces again became the target of stones.         
	In Baramulla, eight policemen were injured in stone-throwing. One CRPF mobile bunker was attacked with a petrol bomb and suffered minor damage. Some protesters also burnt down a government school at Wangam in Handwara, the police said.        
	Today, the death toll in the three months of protests rose to 70 when Mohammad Ashraf, a youth injured in police firing on September 6, succumbed in hospital.

  - Info sharing good: PC        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                             GK Pillai (top), a sketch of David Headley                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: P. Chidambaram today played down home secretary G.K. Pillais comments that the US hadnt shared 26/11-related intelligence on David Headley, saying the issue has been blown out of proportion.        
	The Headley issue has been blown out of proportion. Intelligence sharing has been extremely good, the Union home minister said, hours after US ambassador Timothy J. Roemer called on him. The envoy, Chidambaram said, met him to express satisfaction over security arrangements for Barack Obamas visit from this week.         
	Chidambaram said the US was conducting a full review of the intelligence on Headley and that he would comment on the matter after the exercise was over. What they knew about David Headley and when they knew about that and made the connection with 26/11, it is a matter, I am told, under full review in the US.        
	The comments are being seen as an attempt to avoid upsetting Obamas team or the external affairs ministry  whose stand differs from the Chidambarams ministry on Headley  ahead of the Presidents visit.        
	The review will cover what US intelligence agencies knew about Headley, and Obama is expected to be armed with the information to address Indian concerns.         
	But Roemer did not specify if the review was prompted by Pillais comments. I do not know, he said on being asked if the exercise was ordered after the home secretarys comments.        
	We were disappointed that the name of David Headley was not provided to us either before 26/11 or post-26/11. If we had known, we could have nabbed him when he came here in March 2009, Pillai had said last week.        
	Speaking about the review, US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes had said in the US last week, after Pillais statement, that the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, was on the job since August.        
	Chidambaram appeared ken to avoid any impression that the government wasnt pursuing Headley strongly enough, indicating that the Lashkar suspects extradition was still on the agenda and could figure in talks with Obama.

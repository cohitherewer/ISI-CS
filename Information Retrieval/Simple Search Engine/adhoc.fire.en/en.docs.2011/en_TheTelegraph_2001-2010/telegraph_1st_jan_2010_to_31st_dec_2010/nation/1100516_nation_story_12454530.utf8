          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 15: An international environmental group yesterday claimed it had detected six hotspots of radiation still remaining in the neighbourhood of a shop where a gamma irradiator had been broken up by scrap merchants.         
	Greenpeace activists said the sources of radiation at these six sites were probably tiny, virtually invisible sources of cobalt-60 that came from the machine sold by Delhi University faculty and left behind after a clean-up by Indian authorities.         
	Greenpeace activists claimed that the detection only suggests the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) staff who had decontaminated the scrap market had not been able to take all the material away.         
	Weve informed the local police and the AERB, said an activist. Government radiation safety officers were unavailable today to comment on the significance of this finding.                    
	A person who stands continuously about a metre away from a hotspot for five days is likely to receive the maximum allowed dose of radiation, said Jan Vande Putte, a Greenpeace radiation safety expert. At a distance of 10cm, a person needs to stand only for two hours for maximum dose.         
	Putte said this level of radiation is not expected to lead to acute radiation poisoning of the kind experienced by the eight scrap market workers in Delhi, but continuous exposure over several years could increase the risk of cancer.         
	These levels make radiation toxicity unlikely unless a person spends several hours or days very close  within a metre  to the spot. Putte conceded that the increased risk of cancer is limited.

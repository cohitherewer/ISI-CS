	Mumbai, Nov. 3: The hardy coconut has made the hallowed list of VIP-unfriendly arsenal that was so far filled with shoes, bricks, pies, tomatoes and rotten eggs.        
	Coconut trees outside Mani Bhavan, where Mahatma Gandhi used to stay and where Barack Obama will go this weekend, have been disarmed to avoid the possibility of the tough nuts falling on the head of some dignitary.        
	Nobody has publicly mentioned the possibility of the coconuts being used as missiles but in the ever-evolving world of ingenious protests, any ball-like object can become a potential threat.        
	The umbrella-like branches of the trees have also been trimmed on the request of Mani Bhavan authorities. The officials asked the civic body to cut the branches and pluck the coconuts as a precautionary measure.        
	The coconuts on the trees have dried up, and they often fall on the visitors coming here. So, we requested the ward officer to remove them as a precautionary measure. Why should we take a chance? asked Mani Bhavans executive secretary, Meghshyam Ajgaonkar.        
	It could not be established if any dignitary ever had an Isaac Newton moment with a coconut, the consequences of which wont be as pleasant as when the apple fell.        
	But the officials of Mani Bhavan, which houses a museum, a research centre, and a room where the Mahatma preferred to stay during his Mumbai visits, seem to have shown remarkable foresight, if a perception in Kerala is taken into account.        
	In Kerala, the capital of coconuts, people do cast a wary eye upwards once in a while when walking in coconut orchards  especially in these days of manpower shortage when professional pluckers are hard to come by.         
	Other than removing the possibility of a coconut calamity, Mani Bhavan has been spruced up with a fresh coat of paint and a shamiana erected around it.        
	US and Indian security establishments are expected to conduct a full-fledged security drill tomorrow in which multiple agencies are likely to participate. US Secret Service agents, National Security Guard commandos, the NSG-trained Force One squad of Mumbai police and navy and air force personnel are expected to take part.        
	US Marines have taken over the security on the sixth floor at the Taj where the President is expected to stay. Marine One, the chopper the US President uses, has already arrived, and so has the presidential limousine.        
	The Taj hotel would be declared a no-fly zone for two days.        
	Several US aircraft have landed at the Mumbai airport. A C-17 transport aircraft arrived this morning around 10am, and left the airport around 3pm. Two Marine helicopters are currently parked at the airport. More aircraft are expected to arrive tomorrow, an airport official said.        
	The plane is part of the 15-aircraft fleet expected to arrive in Mumbai before Air Force One touches down on November 6 noon.        
	Officials from Force One, headed by Sadanand Date who battled Pakistan terrorists at Cama Hospital, today inspected different venues where the President would visit.        
	The inspection follows an exercise by the police to sanitise many areas in south Mumbai last week. The police carried out searches at more than 90 establishments.        
	Even Bade Miyan, a popular kerb-side kebab joint located behind the Taj, has been asked to shut down during the two days the President camps at the hotel.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Best-selling British physicist-turned-author Simon Singh will receive the first Leelavati Award for public outreach in math at the worlds biggest conclave on the subject in Hyderbad later this month, the meetings organisers announced today.         
	Singh, who studied physics in the UK and worked at a subatomic particle accelerator lab in Geneva before turning to documentary- making and writing, will get the Rs 10 lakh ($20,000) Leelavati Award at the quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), 2010.         
	Singh, 46, born to Indian parents who emigrated to the UK in 1950 from Punjab, wrote Fermats Last Theorem in 1997  a book some fellow mathematicians have described as the first popular math best-seller. Singh has also written a book on the history of codes and produced a trilogy for BBC Radio 4 on numbers.         
	The executive organisation committee of ICM-2010 instituted the Leelavati Award as a one-time prize but panel members said they were trying to make it a regular feature at future ICMs.         
	We thought this was an appropriate time to have an exclusive prize for public outreach in math, said M.S. Raghunathan, a professor of math at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, and the committee chairman.         
	The prize is named after 12th century treatise Leelavati by Indian mathematician Bhaskara-II. The treatise employs verse to pose problems in elementary math and provides hints to solutions. The book appears to have been a key source of learning arithmetic and algebra in medieval India, the ICM secretariat said in a statement today.                                 
	There already exist awards  such as the Kalinga Prize  that honour excellence in public communication of other sciences such as physics or chemistry. But there has been nothing like that for math, Raghunathan said.

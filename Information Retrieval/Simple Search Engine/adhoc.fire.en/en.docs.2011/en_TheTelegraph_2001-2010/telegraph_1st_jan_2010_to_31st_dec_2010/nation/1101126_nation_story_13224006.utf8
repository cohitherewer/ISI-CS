The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raja probe poser to CBI 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raja probe poser to CBI 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      Supreme Court: CBI lsquo;beating around the bush rsquo;                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Supreme Court today wondered why A. Raja and two top telecom officials had not been questioned over the 2G spectrum allocations, saying the CBI was beating around the bush despite the CAGs revelations of several irregularities.        
	You have said 8,000 documents have been examined. Still, you are beating around the bush. Why has no one has been questioned. It (questioning the former telecom minister, his telecom secretary and another official) is the minimum expected from the CBI, a bench of Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice G.S. Singhvi said, a day after declaring that they would ensure an honest probe.        
	Justice Singhvi, the senior judge on the panel, pointed out that the CBI had information that Swan Telecom had transferred its licence to others for Rs 5,000-6,000 crore within a few days of getting it. It would have brought at least Rs 9,000 crore (to the exchequer). The CBI had this information.        
	Justice Ganguly underscored the CAGs importance and the irregularities it had brought to the fore. The CAG has a very important position under the Constitution. It is an authority set up under the Constitution. If such an authority gives such a report, any reasonable person will question the minister and his secretary.        
	The criticism of the CBI came during a hearing on a petition filed by an NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which has sought monitoring of the probe either by the court or a team of officials of impeccable integrity.        
	Opening the arguments, CPILs lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the CAG report showed criminal misconduct by those involved in the 2G spectrum allocation. The CBI should have arrested or interrogated some persons. But no critical persons have been arrested or interrogated so far.        
	Bhushan cited the CAG reports findings that the Trai Act had been flouted in the spectrum allocations, and that the advice of the finance minister and the Prime Minister to refer the matter to a group of ministers, ignored. This, he said, had caused losses to the exchequer in terms of lost spectrum fees.        
	Auction would have been the best way to fix spectrum prices but Raja and his officials gave it to telecom firms on a first-come first-served basis, Bhushan said. However, even that was changed later in a way that those who gave bank drafts first got the licences first.        
	At this point, Rajas counsel T. Andhyarujina interjected, arguing that the minister only entered the scene after May 13, 2007.         
	Justice Singhvi brushed off his arguments and instead asked the CBI why no FIR had been registered against the specific two companies (Swan and Unitech) identified in the CVC report. An FIR has been lodged against unknown companies and persons. But they are not unknown, he said.        
	K.K. Venugopal, the CBI counsel, argued that the information so far was too little. But the judges asked him to file a probe status report by Tuesday.

	New Delhi, March 11: A BPO executive has been arrested for the alleged murder of his junior after she spurned his advances.        
	 Baljeet Singh was picked up by Noida police yesterday, eight days after the body of Pooja Bhatia, 23, was found in a lake in neighbouring Faridabad.        
	The post-mortem revealed death because of drowning. The body had been cremated as it was unclaimed for sometime. Poojas relatives identified her clothes and other items, after which Singh was held.        
	Pooja had left home on Holi, March 1, saying she was going to a picnic with colleagues, but never returned.         
	The Bhatias had filed a kidnapping complaint against Singh. Pooja, a telemarketing executive at the BPO, was to get married soon. Singh was her immediate boss, a team leader.

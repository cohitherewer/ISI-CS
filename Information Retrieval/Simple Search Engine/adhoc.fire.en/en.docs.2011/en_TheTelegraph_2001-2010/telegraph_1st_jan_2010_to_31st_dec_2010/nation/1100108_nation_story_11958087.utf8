The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Meeting to decide Amars resignation
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Meeting to decide Amars resignation
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Lucknow, Jan. 7: Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is expected to convene a meeting of his partys parliamentary board within the next two days to take a call on whether Amar Singhs resignations from crucial posts should be accepted.        
	A highly placed source said: The mood is yes, he should be immediately relieved because he is so unwell. Let him rest.        
	Amar, who announced his intention of making himself politically dispensable to his party in a recent blog, yesterday faxed his resignations from his posts of general secretary, spokesperson and parliamentary board member.        
	The source said Mulayam would go ahead with the meeting whether or not Amar returns from Dubai, where he is vacationing, though the Rajya Sabha MP posted a report on his blog today that said the meeting would be held only after he returned.        
	There is no need to wait for him because he has already stepped down as a board member, the source said.        
	Mulayam told The Telegraph he and Amar had not spoken since the resignations were faxed from Dubai. Neither of us tried to contact the other, he said. Whats the hurry?        
	Samajwadi sources said Amars options outside the party didnt look exciting. He is unlikely to get the profile and clout we gave him anywhere else, said one.        
	This is why he shrewdly stayed on as a member. He doesnt want to forfeit the five-and-a-half-year term he has in the Rajya Sabha, a former Lok Sabha MP said.

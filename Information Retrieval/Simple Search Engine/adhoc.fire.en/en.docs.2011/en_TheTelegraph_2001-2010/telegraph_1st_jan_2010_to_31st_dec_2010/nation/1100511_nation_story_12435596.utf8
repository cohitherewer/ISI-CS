          G.C. SHEKHKAR                              
	Chennai, May 10: The Centre has permitted slain LTTE chief V. Prabhakarans mother Parvathi to stay in Tamil Nadu for treatment but has imposed certain conditions, chief minister M. Karunanidhi told the Assembly today.         
	One key condition is that Parvathi should stay only at the hospital chosen for the treatment, not anywhere else. If she so wishes, the state will make arrangements for her treatment in a government hospital.         
	Also, Parvathi should not have contact with any political party or banned organisations or those connected with them. She should interact only with close relatives whom she has mentioned specifically for the purpose of her visit, Karunanidhi, who had taken up her matter with the Centre, said.        
	The conditions have been conveyed to the Indian mission in Malaysia  where Parvathi stays now  which has been directed to issue a six-month visa solely for medical treatment. Normally, such a procedure takes long but the state and Centre acted fast considering the health of the 80-year-old lady, Karunanidhi said.        
	Parvathi was denied entry at the Chennai airport last month after arrival from Malaysia by immigration officials who told her she was among those blacklisted from entering the country. She had to return to Kuala Lumpur.        
	Pro-LTTE leaders, who had made arrangements for her stay last time, went on the offensive against the DMK government in the state and the Congress-led UPA in Delhi, accusing them of being inhuman. Karunanidhi had then said if Parvathi sent a request herself, it would be considered sympathetically.         
	In spite of pressure from the leaders  MDMKs Vaiko and Tamil National Fronts P. Nedumanaran  that she must not apply for permission, Parvathi sent a request through email to the chief ministers office early this month.        
	During his visit to the national capital last week, Karunanidhi had taken up Parvathis case with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and home minister P. Chidambaram and got the green signal.        
	The conditions would deter any of the pro-LTTE groups from contacting her or exploiting her presence to whip up support for the LTTE and its lost cause of Eelam (homeland). Karunanidhi, without appearing to be pro-LTTE, has managed to show that he is a humanist, after all. The chief minister is even said to be planning to have one of his ministers call on Parvathi at the hospital, scoring another brownie point over his critics.

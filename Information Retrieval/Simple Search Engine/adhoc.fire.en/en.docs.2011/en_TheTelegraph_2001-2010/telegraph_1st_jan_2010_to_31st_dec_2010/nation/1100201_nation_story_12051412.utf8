The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh plays protector to Mumbai migrants
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh plays protector to Mumbai migrants
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: Hindi-speaking residents of Maharashtra have found a protector  in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.        
	The RSS has directed its swayamsevaks in the western state to rise above regional bias and protect non-Maharashtrians who have been targeted by the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena for taking away the livelihood of the Marathi-speaking population.        
	We have told our volunteers to try and contain the spread of anti-Hindi feeling in Maharashtra and protect everyones source of livelihood. Incidents like those that happened should not be repeated, Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav told The Telegraph.        
	The cue for the Sanghs directive was a statement by chief Mohanrao Bhagwat while addressing reporters in Guwahati yesterday.        
	Bhagwat said India belonged to every Indian and nobody could take away the right to earn a living in any part of the country. Language, caste, sub-caste groups, tribes can be different but all are sons of India, he said.        
	Bhagwat questioned the Sena and the MNS claim that Marathi-speakers were not getting jobs because of migrant influx. This is a misconception, he said, adding that the solution to this grievance did not lie in refusing people of one state entry into another. The solution can be found if the administration and the government are dedicated.        
	Bhagwat urged all political parties to rise above vote-bank politics and consider the issue. National integration is above all else, he said.        
	BJP leaders of the Hindi heartland sounded relieved at the statement, more so as it came from a Maharashtrian who heads the fountainhead of a stream of politics that is identified more with chauvinism and not inclusiveness.        
	It is consonant with a position that we have consistently held and it will send a positive message across the country, said spokesperson and Bihar Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy.        
	Bihar goes to polls in October and the BJP was concerned about the implications of the tirade against Hindi speakers but could say or do little because it was caught between two allies: the Sena in Maharashtra and the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar.        
	By speaking for us, Bhagwatji has resolved the issue. We hope the Sena takes it in the intended spirit, a BJP functionary said.        
	An insider, however, said elections were not the sole consideration for the RSS. The sarsanghchalaks statement is not to bail out the BJP but to restate the Sanghs conviction in nationalism. The message for Maharashtra should be read in tandem with what he said about the militant group Ulfa.        
	Bhagwat had rejected the idea of talks with Ulfa and other insurgent groups in the Northeast, saying Indias sovereignty and integrity were non-negotiable.

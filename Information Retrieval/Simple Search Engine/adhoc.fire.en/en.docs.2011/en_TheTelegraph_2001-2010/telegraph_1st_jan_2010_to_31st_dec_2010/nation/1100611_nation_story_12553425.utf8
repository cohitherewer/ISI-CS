	New Delhi, June 10 (PTI): The Supreme Court today told a couple in a matrimonial dispute that a person loses his or her independence after marriage.        
	Once a person is married, where is the question of independence? It is lost, a bench of Justices Deepak Verma and K.S. Radhakrishnan quipped while hearing the dispute between a military officer and his estranged wife working with a software company.        
	The bench made the remarks after the counsel for the husband, Hitesh, complained that the marriage had irretrievably broken down to such an extent that the wife, after filing the suit for divorce, taunted the husband with a Happy Independence Day.        
	When the counsel said the husband was suffering from several health problems, the bench replied: That is the dividend of marriage!        
	The court said in marital disputes children should not suffer. The worst sufferer will be the child. We do not want this to happen. It is better you sort out the matter mutually, it told the couple.

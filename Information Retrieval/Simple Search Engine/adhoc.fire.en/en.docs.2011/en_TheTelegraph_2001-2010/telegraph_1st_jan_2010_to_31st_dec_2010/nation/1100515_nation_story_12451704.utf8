	New Delhi, May 14: The Union health ministry is scrambling to find a legislative route to seize some level of control over the Medical Council of India, the nations apex regulator of medical education tainted by corruption at its highest level.         
	Health ministry officials have pencilled a proposal to ask a panel of medical experts to govern the MCI, while the existing body is kept in abeyance and the government pursues new legislative action to regulate medical education, sources said.         
	Health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this evening to finetune the proposal and possibly discuss names for members of the new panel, a health ministry source said. A proposal to keep the MCI in abeyance and let the panel oversee its functions would require an ordinance from the government, the source said.         
	The new initiative, some medical educationists say, comes after a decade of inaction during which the Centre could have exercised options to clean up the regulator embroiled in corruption scandals since 2001, but didnt.         
	The controversy erupted earlier this year after MCI president Ketan Desai was arrested by the CBI on allegations that he had sought payment for the approval of admissions in a medical college in Patiala, Punjab.         
	Azad had told Parliament last week that the 1956 act which governs the MCI does not empower the health ministry to intervene, indicating that the government was thus helpless to check wrongdoing by the body.         
	However, a member of a former government medical task force on medical education said the government could have  if it had wanted to  establish a commission of inquiry at any time to investigate the affairs of the MCI.         
	The act does allow the creation of a commission of inquiry, but this was never done, said K.M. Shyamprasad, a former vice-president of the National Board of Examinations, an agency involved in postgraduate medical education.         
	In response to a petition by a Delhi-based doctor, Delhi High Court had in 2001 convicted Desai of accepting gifts of Rs 65 lakh for himself and his family on the basis of probes by income-tax officials.         
	The high court had ordered the CBI to prosecute Desai. But a CBI report filed in 2005 said there was no evidence that Desai had provided favours to those who had paid him the money  and dubbed the payments as goodwill money or gifts.         
	Shyamprasad, who is among doctors who have tracked the MCI events for over a decade, said the government accepted the CBI report, and chose not to pursue the conviction of Desai in the Supreme Court.         
	Approvals and inspections of a burgeoning number of private medical colleges across India provided opportunities for corruption in the MCI, Shyamprasad said. However, a panel of doctors asked by the Supreme Court to probe into MCI affairs between 2005 and 2008 did not turn up any evidence of corruption.         
	There are skeletons in the MCI cupboard that no one  no one  wants to pull outside, Shyamprasad told The Telegraph.         
	In February 2009, Shyamprasad had written to former health secretary Naresh Dayal, asking him to take necessary steps to prevent Desai from returning to the MCI as president in the interest of justice and to uphold the image of the MCI. There was no response, Shyamprasad said.

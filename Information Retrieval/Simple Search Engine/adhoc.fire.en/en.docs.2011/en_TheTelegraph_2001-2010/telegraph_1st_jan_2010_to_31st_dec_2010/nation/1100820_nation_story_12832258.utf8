The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak fires at army posts in Jammu
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak fires at army posts in Jammu
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 19: Pakistani troops fired heavily on Indian forward posts in the Krishnaghati sub-sector of Jammus Poonch district last night, allegedly to provide cover for infiltrating militants.        
	The shooting came as a nine-year-old boy, injured in alleged security force firing last week, died today, taking the death toll in the two-month-old unrest to 60. The security forces also fired at protesters in Srinagar, injuring three members of a family including two women.        
	The army said Pakistani troops fired mortar shells, rockets and other ammunition at Indian positions for around two hours, in their second ceasefire violation in a month.        
	Pakistani troopers targeted at least eight forward positions. Fortunately, there was no casualty on our side. We have sought a flag meeting at an appropriate level to register protest, defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Biplab Nath said in Jammu.        
	In the same sector on July 16, the Pakistani army had used small arms and rockets to target Indian forward positions. However, there were no losses on the Indian side of the Line of Control.        
	Milad Ahmad Dar, 9, lost his six-day-old battle for life at a hospital here today. He had been hit by a stray bullet during clashes between the security forces and protesters at Harnagh village in Anantnag on Saturday.        
	Hospital sources said the boy was playing with friends when the bullet, fired from a distance, hit him.        
	His family said he was not part of any protest and the bullet was fired somewhere else. His family saw him bleeding profusely from the head but had no idea that a bullet had hit him till a CT scan was done, a hospital official said.        
	The news of the boys death led to fresh tension in the area and curfew was imposed in Anantnag and Koimoh towns.        
	In Srinagars Soura locality, the security forces fired at protesters, injuring a 17-year-old girl, Sumera, her father and her sister-in-law. Sumera has received injuries in her lungs and abdomen; her condition is critical, a doctor said.        
	In Sopore last night, militants attacked the home of National Conference MLA Mohammad Ashraf Dar, killing his personal security officer and injuring two people. Dar was not at home.        
	Curfew and a Valley-wide strike paralysed life today as well.        
	The Indian Army has said that there was a controlled retaliation to the Pakistani firing at the Krishnaghati sector. A flag meeting of sector commanders is likely.        
	There have been 30 ceasefire violations along the Line of Control so far this year alone and about 10 have been in the Krishnaghati sector, an army source said.        
	A Northern Command source from Jammu said last nights firing began around 1am near Poonch. He alleged  in a throwback to the pre-ceasefire days  that Pakistani troops were giving covering fire to militants being pushed into the Indian side.        
	Asked if this was the biggest exchange of fire since the ceasefire, the officer replied: That I cannot say. But there was controlled retaliation by our troops.         
	Pakistani troops aimed 82mm mortars and rockets near Indian Army posts.        
	Though there have been allegations from both sides of intermittent ceasefire violations since November 2003, the truce on the LoC, the International Boundary and the Actual Ground Position Line in Siachen has held by and large.        
	There has not been a single instance of troops firing at villages and settlements, unlike the situation before the ceasefire. But last nights exchange of fire has happened as security forces are battling stone-pelting protesters in the Valley, raising the threat-perception in Kashmir by a notch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Defendant No. 17 with a cousin who ruled UP 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Defendant No. 17 with a cousin who ruled UP 
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Ramesh Chandra Tripathi                                  
	Lucknow, Sept. 23: Ramesh Chandra Tripathi who?        
	That was Lucknows reaction nine days ago. Today, the elusive 73-year-old who has written several books on religion was an unlikely object of extreme emotions.        
	The city either praised him or reviled him for the way he had got the Ayodhya verdict stayed just a day before it was to be passed. Those disappointed at the apex court decision whispered conspiracy theories: apparently, the man was a Congress pawn.        
	Secrets tumbled out. Sources in Faizabad, Tripathis native place, said he was a cousin of late party leader Sripati Mishra, who had been Uttar Pradesh chief minister from 1982 to 1984. Apparently, Tripathis father and Mishras mother were siblings.        
	No one had seemed to know anything about his past, though, when he emerged from the shadows on September 14, petitioning the high court to defer its verdict. Some of the lawyers in the court had found him mentally not balanced others said he need not be taken seriously.        
	Yet, Tripathi had been defendant No. 17 in the title suit for nearly four decades. But, as the lawyers said, there were dozens of petitioners in the case. Tripathi had never appeared in court and his counsel never expressed any views, his opponents alleged in the apex court today, trying to get the non-serious petitioners appeal dismissed.        
	Even on the Internet, a search for Ramesh Chandra Tripathi led to another R.C. Tripathi, a retired IAS officer.        
	Tripathi is a retired defence expenditure accountant. He lives alternately in Lucknows Gomtinagar with his daughter or in Ambedkarnagar district with the rest of his family, his lawyer in Lucknow, Prasant Chandra, said.        
	Tripathi had retired in 1997. On September 12, he came to me, Chandra said. He was not well off, so I didnt charge any money. Nor did his lawyer in the Supreme Court.        
	Congress leader Akhilesh Pratap Singh denied the party had in any way influenced Tripathi. His sons, college teacher Shyamdhan and government employee Bibhakar, said Tripathi had never cultivated political links. He is not a politician, Bibhakar said.        
	I dont know about his political links; I dont think he did this because of his family connections with the Congress, Chandra said. But what he has done is for the general good; it doesnt matter if the Congress had anything to do with this.        
	Tripathis Ambedkarnagar neighbours said he never flaunted his political connections but added that during his frequent visits to Lucknow in recent times, he may have rebuilt his Congress ties.        
	He is a very humble and deeply religious man, keeps a low profile and is not always very social, a neighbour said. Tripathi has written several books in Hindi on spiritualism, some of which are titled Vaishnodevi, Vindhyachal and Hanumandev.         
	He had first taken an interest in the Ayodhya dispute in 1971 when he was posted in Jammu and Kashmir. He had then filed a petition before the Faizabad court saying the sites gates should be opened for worshippers. But as judgment day approached, he was scared and wanted to stop the verdict, a relative said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Oct. 25: The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, has served a suspension notice on professor Amit Kumar Ghosh, accused of running an unapproved institute and duping students with the claim that it was a branch of the premier tech school.        
	He has been suspended pending investigation by the inquiry committee, said A.K. Mazumdar, deputy director of the IIT.        
	According to the institutes code of conduct, no faculty member can be involved with any other institution without permission from the authorities.        
	Ghosh, head of the department of aeronautical engineering, has been accused of running the Institution of Electrical Engineering (IEE) in Kharagpur and offering diploma courses without the approval of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).        
	Earlier this year, some of the IEE students had found out that the institute had no connection with IIT Kharagpur and did not even have AICTE approval, mandatory for an institute teaching any technical course. They had registered a complaint with the IIT Kharagpur director.        
	On Friday, the Union human resource development ministry asked the IIT for a report on the matter.        
	The decision to suspend Ghosh was taken today at a meeting chaired by IIT Kharagpur director Damodar Acharya, who has already set up an inquiry committee comprising faculty members.        
	Till the inquiry committee submits its report, Ghosh shall remain suspended from his duties, Mazumdar said.

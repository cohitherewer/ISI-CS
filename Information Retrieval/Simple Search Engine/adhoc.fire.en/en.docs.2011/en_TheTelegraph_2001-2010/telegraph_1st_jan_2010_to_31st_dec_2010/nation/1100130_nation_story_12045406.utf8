	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 29: The body of Citu leader, Thomas Munda, abducted by Maoists on January 25, was found in a forest in Sundergarh today.        
	Munda was abducted by the rebels during a raid at SAIL-owned Kalta mines in Sundergarh district on January 25 when they had called a statewide economic blockade. His body was found at the Renjeda forest today, police said.        
	The Maoists also left behind a poster, claiming that Munda was sentenced to death by a kangaroo court, as he was a police informer.        
	Mundas family members had appealed to the Maoists through the media to release him. Earlier, the rebels had released three other abducted persons.

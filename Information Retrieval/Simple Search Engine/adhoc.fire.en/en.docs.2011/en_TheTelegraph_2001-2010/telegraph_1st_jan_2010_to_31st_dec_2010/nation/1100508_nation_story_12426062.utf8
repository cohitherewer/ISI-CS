The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan to lift ban on deemed tag
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plan to lift ban on deemed tag
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                            
	New Delhi. May 7: The human resource development ministry is preparing to again start awarding deemed university status to institutions, lifting a ban it had imposed in June 2009, officials have told The Telegraph.        
	The move comes after a massive pile-up of applications from institutions aspiring to the deemed tag, which allows them to award degrees without direct legislative scrutiny unlike full-fledged universities.        
	But the decision to re-open the deemed university bazaar  as some officials jokingly referred to the move  comes amid a feeling that the tough new regulations adopted will help enforce standards at these institutions.        
	The new regulations  reported by The Telegraph on April 20  require new aspirants to hold the highest possible rating that is offered by accreditation agencies.        
	Institutions must exist as colleges for 15 years before they become eligible for deemed university status.        
	They are also barred from offering distance education courses.        
	The ban on awarding deemed university status was formally put in place by HRD minister Kapil Sibal on June 4 through an order to the University Grants Commission.        
	The UGC was also asked to conduct an inquiry into all 130 institutions already granted deemed university status. The ministry conducted a parallel probe.        
	While the UGC probe recommended that all 130 deemed universities be allowed to retain their tag, the ministry review found 88 of them unfit. It suggested that 44 among these 88 be given three years to try and improve their standards.        
	It also recommended that the remaining 44 be stripped of their deemed status immediately. The Supreme Court is hearing a case on these deemed universities.        
	The Centre had asked the Supreme Court to stay admissions to these 44 deemed universities till it decided the issue, but the court has turned the request down. The apex court had earlier ordered the government not to act against these institutions till it had delivered its verdict.

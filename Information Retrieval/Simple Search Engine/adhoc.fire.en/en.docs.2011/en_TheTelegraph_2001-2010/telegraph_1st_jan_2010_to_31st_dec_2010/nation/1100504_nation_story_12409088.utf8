          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Ranchi, May 3: The four BJP ministers in the Shibu Soren government attended a cabinet meeting in Ranchi today even as party seniors in Delhi insisted that they had been instructed otherwise, indicating a lack of communication within the party.         
	A senior BJP leader in Delhi said that if Soren did not step down as Jharkhand chief minister in the next two days, the partys MLAs would meet the governor and withdraw support to his government.         
	Even though some BJP leaders like Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Gopinath Munde are of the view that Soren should not keep them waiting, former party president Rajnath Singh said the government and the alliance with the JMM must be saved at all cost.         
	A source said the BJP leaderships call to boycott todays meeting would be a wake-up call for the JMM chief and his son Hemant.         
	However, BJP ministers Neelkanth Singh Munda and Baidyanath Ram claimed that there was no instruction about boycotting the meeting.

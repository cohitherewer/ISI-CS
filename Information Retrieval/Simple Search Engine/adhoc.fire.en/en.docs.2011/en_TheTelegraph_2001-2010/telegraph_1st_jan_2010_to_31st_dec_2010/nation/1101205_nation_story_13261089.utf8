          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Delhi police are planning to seek the external affairs ministrys permission to proceed against diplomat Ketan Shukla, accused by his former maid of raping her when he was deputy high commissioner in Kenya between 2007 and April this year.         
	The police last night registered a case of rape and criminal intimidation against Shukla on the basis of complaints lodged by the maid.         
	We will soon write to the ministry of external affairs before taking any action against Shukla. We need their nod for arresting him, a senior police officer said. We need the go-ahead from the ministry even if we need to interrogate the diplomat, he added.         
	The maid was taken to a government hospital today by the police for a medical examination.         
	The medical report will not be of that much importance as the complaint has been registered almost a year after the alleged sexual assault took place. We need to question Shukla to ascertain whether the allegations are true or baseless, another officer said.         
	The maid has alleged that Shukla, now posted as secretary to the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission, raped her and threatened her with dire consequences if she raised her voice. She alleged that he did not pay her the salary of Rs 10,000 for the past three years while posted in Kenya.         
	The Ahmedabad-based Shukla denied all the allegations, claiming the woman was paid to tarnish my image.         
	If she had a problem, why didnt she inform anyone then? We came back to India in April 2010 and she waited till yesterday to inform the police, he said to a news channel today.        
	BPO rape arrest        
	Delhi police today arrested a fourth accused in the rape of a Mizoram girl from Sohna district in Haryana, reports PTI.        
	Iqbal alias Bada Billi was apprehended by a team of Delhi police, a police official involved in the probe into the incident said.        
	While two accused Shamsad and Usman were arrested from Mewat in Haryana, a third person Shahid surrendered to the police in Faridabad.

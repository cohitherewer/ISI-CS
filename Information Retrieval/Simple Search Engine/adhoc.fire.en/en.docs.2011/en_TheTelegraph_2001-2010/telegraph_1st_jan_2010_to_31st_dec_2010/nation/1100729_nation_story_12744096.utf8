The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shah refuses to walk off cricket pitch
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shah refuses to walk off cricket pitch
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, July 28: Held by the CBI, sent to jail by a court, Amit Shah is refusing to leave the wicket.        
	The former Gujarat minister, in judicial custody for alleged involvement in an encounter killing, is refusing to quit as cricket administrator.        
	Shah, Narendra Modis Man Friday who helped the chief minister become president of the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), apparently to gain greater political acceptance, is holding on to his post of vice-president in the body his opponents allege he had fraudulently captured last year.        
	They say Shah, an accused in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case, got 50-odd supporters nominated from various schools and cricket clubs in the city to swing the vote in their favour, ending Congress control over the cricket body.        
	Among those he got nominated to the association were his son Ajay, 22, from Khadia Cricket Club, loyalist Nawlaege Patel from Raipur Cricket Club, brother-in-law Pradip Shah from City High School and councillor Gautam Shah from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.        
	He also got several supporters  Ajay Patel, Vipin Patel, Yashpal Chudasama and Kamalesh Tripathi, all wanted in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case  nominated as members of the Central Board of Cricket of Ahmedabad. The central board members elect the GCA office-bearers.        
	The CBI, which is questioning Shah in judicial custody, has declared Ajay Patel and Chudasama absconders. The two are accused of tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses.        
	Former GCA office-bearer Pouchi Patel said Shahs refusal to step down was unacceptable.        
	However, most GCA office-bearers, a majority of them supporters of the ruling BJP, seem to have no problem with Shah continuing.        
	Rajesh Patel, one of the four GCA vice-presidents including Shah, said he had no opinion to offer.        
	But Pariman Nathwani, another vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand, said Shah neednt resign as the GCA was not a government body. Moreover, Nathwani added, the members and office-bearers of the cricket body had full faith and trust in Shah.

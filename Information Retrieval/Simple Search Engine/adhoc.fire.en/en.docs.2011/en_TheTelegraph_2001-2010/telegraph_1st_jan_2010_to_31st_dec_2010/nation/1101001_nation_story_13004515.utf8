          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: The steady supply of power had managed to do what it was meant to: it had kept the streets of Malegaon free of loitering people when the verdict of Allahabad High Court came in.         
	The decision taken by Malegaons peace committee to keep the power loom town free of load-shedding had kept thousands of workers busy through the day. The idea was to ensure that people, especially youngsters, dont idle around on the streets when the verdict came in, said Saleem Bhai, a loom worker.        
	Malegaon has nearly one lakh looms and a majority of the workers employed are Muslims. On any other day, this textile town, considered among the most communally sensitive along with Bhiwandi near Mumbai, witnesses load-sheddings for three hours in the morning and three in the evening.         
	The decision to keep Malegaon load-shedding free was taken in a peace committee meeting chaired by Nashik collector P. Velarasu in co-ordination with Malegaons religious and political leaders led by its MLA and imam, Mufti Mohammed Ismail.         
	I spoke to or met religious and political leaders after the verdict. They all said irrespective of whether they agree or not, they will respect the verdict, said ASP Chandrashekhar Chowghule.

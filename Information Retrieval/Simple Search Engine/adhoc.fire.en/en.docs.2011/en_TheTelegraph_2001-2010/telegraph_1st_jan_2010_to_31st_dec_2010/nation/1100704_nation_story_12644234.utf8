The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM banks on central rule for early polls 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM banks on central rule for early polls 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Biman Bose and Sitaram Yechury                                 
	New Delhi, July 3: The besieged and beleaguered CPM is now banking on Presidents rule in Bengal to save its sinking ship.         
	Here to participate in the two-day party politburo meeting, CPM state secretary Biman Bose attempted to egg on the Centre to impose Presidents rule in Bengal and hold early Assembly elections to fulfil ally Mamata Banerjees wishes.         
	For early Assembly polls, the Centre will have to impose Presidents rule. If they (the Centre) impose Presidents rule, we are ready for it, Bose said when asked about Mamata having asserted that the Assembly elections would be held after the Pujas.         
	The CPM, which has for long made political capital out of Centre-state relations, appears to be hoping against hope to reignite the issue if the Centre succumbs before Mamata and imposes Presidents rule.         
	CPM leaders admitted that they did not expect the Congress-led government to take the drastic step of using Article 356 but, if it did, they would only gain amid all-round hopelessness. Our defeat in Bengal looks almost imminent and, in such a situation, Presidents rule can hopefully generate some sympathy and give us an issue to exploit, a senior party leader said.         
	Sources said the party would dare the Centre to impose Presidents rule.         
	The CPM feels that given the wide resentment against the Left in the state only a larger political issue, if at all, can salvage its position.         
	Bose indicated so when he said the partys review of the recent civic poll debacle had shown that the elections were fought on a larger political issue raised by the Opposition, which the Left could not counter well enough.        
	We (the Left) had concentrated on civic issues. The Opposition raised larger political issues and we failed to counter them and convince the people. This was one of the major reasons for our defeat, Bose said when asked about the civic results, which the politburo is going to review.         
	The analysis, however, was also said to be the Bengal party units attempt to trash the central leaderships charge that the Left was loosing because of failures in governance.         
	The politburo today discussed the present political situation and tried to firm up its political stance of whether to treat the communal forces or the Congress as its enemy No. 1.         
	The issue is likely to widen fissures in the party with many leaders from Bengal raising questions about the CPM calling for a countrywide strike on the fuel price rise the same day as the BJP  on July 5.         
	Politburo member Sitaram Yechury tried to play down the issue. We have nothing to do with the BJP. They have given a separate call.        
	Asked whether the CPM had decided to sharpen its anti-Congress stand, Yechury said that given the economic policies being followed by UPA II, the party had no choice but to oppose it.

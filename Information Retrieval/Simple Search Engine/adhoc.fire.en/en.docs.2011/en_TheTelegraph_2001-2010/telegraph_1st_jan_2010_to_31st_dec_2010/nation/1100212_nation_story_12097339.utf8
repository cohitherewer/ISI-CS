The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | McQueen, a genius
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      McQueen, a genius

Her thoughts are with his family at this sad time.(Reuters picture)                            
	Designer Anamika Khanna explains what she and fashion have lost.              
	His work is magical. He is a genius. I cant bring myself to say he was. I speak of him, I get goosebumps.        
	I see each of his collections 500 times. My office thinks I am obsessed with him. Ever since I saw his spring 2005 collection where he converted the ramp into a chessboard where models played the game, each dressed in character but in true fashion, I have been hooked. It still amazes me how he did the Kate Moss hologram in 2006.        
	He is an identification of sorts. His clothes were always beautiful, never bizarre. He also had an Indian ethos in some collections but then he always moved on. Every single bit of him has inspired me. His style was clever and thoughtful. The world waited for his collection.                              Khanna, Mukherjee      
	Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee grapples with what might have gone wrong              
	McQueen has been the flavour of the season for a long time. He has been talked about a lot. And that adds up to a lot of pressure. No one knows what went wrong... whether he had financial problems or personal issues but what everyone does know is that the industry is a bitch.        
	A designer exists only if he delivers a hit collection or a freebie. I am talking out of my hat but maybe McQueen did not have a support system outside his work place. I know from personal experience that designers have it hard. It is relentless, never-ending. You get out of one collection and before you say Jack Robinson, you are in the middle of another.        
	Balancing creativity and commerce is the challenge in this superficial industry. There is only one word of advice for the ambitious who want to stay on top of their game  detachment.

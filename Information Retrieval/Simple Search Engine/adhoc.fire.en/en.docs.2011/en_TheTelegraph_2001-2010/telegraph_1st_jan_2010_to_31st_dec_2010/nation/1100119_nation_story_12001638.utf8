The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glacier row puts UN panel on back foot 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Glacier row puts UN panel on back foot 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Gangotri glacier                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Indian geologists who had two months ago accused a UN climate science agency of misleading the world with alarmist predictions about Himalayan glaciers have now said they stand vindicated.         
	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has launched an exercise to find out how its fourth assessment report issued nearly three years ago contained a prediction that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. Were looking into it. Were trying to understand the underlying basis on which this was included in the assessment report, said Rajendra Pachauri, head of the IPCC and director general of The Energy and Resources Institute, New Delhi.         
	Several Indian scientists have questioned the prediction and a senior geologist had compiled a paper for the government, questioning the claim.         
	We knew this all along  the glaciers are not going to disappear so soon, said Vijay Raina, former scientist with the Geological Survey of India, who was tasked by the ministry of environment and forests to prepare the paper on the Himalayan glaciers.         
	The paper, which combined archived data from the GSI and observations from academic institutions, agreed that some glaciers were melting, but the rate of retreat would not make them disappear by 2035.         
	Indian geologists have said that while global warming may be causing average temperatures to rise, this increase does not translate into equal glacier melt rates everywhere.         
	The IPCC introspection follows revelations that the authors of the report did not rely on any peer-reviewed scientific publication.         
	Indian climate researcher Murari Lal, one of the authors of the report, said the date and prediction were based on comments by Syed Hasnain, an Indian scientist, that appeared in publications but not in scientific journals.         
	Hasnain was not available for comments today.

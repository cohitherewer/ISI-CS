The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rosaiah skips PM meet amid deputy buzz 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rosaiah skips PM meet amid deputy buzz 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the event to lay the foundation stone for the power plant. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Sept. 1: Andhra chief minister K. Rosaiah today reported sick for the Prime Ministers events in the state on the eve of Y.S.R. Reddys first death anniversary amid speculation that the Congress high command was considering a deputy chief minister.        
	Rosaiah, 78,  said to be suffering from viral fever  skipped programmes where Manmohan Singh flagged off two long-delayed projects touted as showpiece plans that YSR had brought to the state.        
	One was the foundation-laying event for a Rs 6,000-crore NTPC-BHEL plant, the other was a revamp of Tirupati airport. Rosaiah had called the Prime Minister last evening and requested him to go ahead with the events.        
	But within hours of the no-show, rumours were rife that Geeta Reddy, the states information minister, had been invited to Delhi by the high command to discuss several issues, including her elevation as deputy chief minister to assist Rosaiah.        
	Officially, Geeta has been called to Delhi to represent the Congresss Andhra unit in endorsing Sonia Gandhis re-election as party chief.        
	Rosaiahs reported illness has also put under a cloud his participation in YSRs death anniversary programmes tomorrow. YSRs son Jaganmohan (Jagan), who has long lobbied to unseat Rosaiah, will lead the events.        
	The chief minister was scheduled to address the official YSR memorial meeting in Kurnool. But observers believe Rosaiah wants to avoid a confrontation amid reports that pro-Jagan supporters planned to heckle the chief minister. Such scenes had been seen at YSRs memorial meeting organised by the party last year.        
	They (Jagans loyalists) know I am just a temporary chief minister. It is not my fault if the high command does not want Jagan at this juncture, a minister who had gone to see the chief minister today quoted him as saying.        
	If Rosaiah had gone to the Prime Ministers programmes, he might have felt like a temporary chief minister there, too. Singh lavished praise on YSR, saying the late chief minister  who died in a chopper crash on September 2 last year  had propelled Andhras development with his drives in agriculture and industry. The words may not have been music to the ears of Rosaiah, who has resented the tendency to perceive all that is good in Andhras governance as YSRs legacy, and has been striving to leave his own mark as chief minister.        
	Later this evening, Singh visited the Tirumala temple of Lord Balaji, near Tirupati.

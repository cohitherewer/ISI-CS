The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Murmurs on DMK tie-up
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Murmurs on DMK tie-up
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Dec. 16: The Congress and the DMK today asserted that all was well with their alliance, a day after the CBI raided homes of DMK leaders associates, but murmurs of a separation from the southern ally have been heard within the Congress.        
	Together we will prove there is nothing wrong, said DMK Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi, one of whose aides office was raided yesterday.        
	Tamil Nadu Congress chief K.V. Thangkabaalu also said the alliance was strong. Just as the Congress took action on allegations of corruption, the DMK will also subject itself to the due legal process to clear its name, he said.         
	In Delhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad said the raids would not affect the alliance.        
	Despite the public posturing, there is a growing opinion in the Tamil Nadu Congress that the party should use the spectrum scam to move away from the DMK and explore an alliance with either the AIADMK or Vijayakanths DMDK.         
	The high command is making the same mistake that Narasimha Rao made in 1996, when he revived the alliance with Jayalalithaa when she had become very unpopular. The Congress will sink along with the DMK if we contest the coming elections in its company, said a senior Congress MLA. When Jayalalithaa is ready to accept our terms, what is wrong in signing a deal with her? he asked.        
	But home minister P. Chidambaram is standing by the DMK. Sources close to him want to use the findings of the raids to strike a bargain with the DMK and get at least 80 seats for the Congress during next years Assembly polls.

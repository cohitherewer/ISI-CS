The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM derailed in Delhi, by Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM derailed in Delhi, by Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 12: As if her nexus with Maoists in Bengal wasnt bad enough, the CPM today had to grapple with Mamata Banerjees nexus with a more fearsome breed in Delhi: railway ticket examiners.        
	These men in black, the scourge of hundreds across India every day, allegedly tried to sabotage the Left Fronts anti-price rise rally in the capital by trying to stop people from reaching it. All at railway minister Mamatas behest, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury claimed.        
	Mamata Banerjee was worried at the enormous response for this rally. Her railway ministry was worried. Thus, our supporters were inconvenienced in the trains. They were not allotted seats and were fined excessively, he said.        
	A group of women rallyists from Karnataka claimed railway officials had forced them to cough up Rs 27,000 in fines with threats of jailing them.        
	The railways are public property. The poor people who travel to Delhi to attend political rallies  not just the Lefts but those of other parties too  are generally treated with respect by railway officials. However, this time was different, a CPM leader said.        
	At several places, railway officials were not co-operative. We have reason to believe that the instructions came from the railway minister herself.        
	A close aide of Mamata laughed it off, saying ticket-less travellers were fined as a matter of routine. But its good that the CPM has finally started obeying the law (paying fines). However, there was no special attempt to target anyone, he said.        
	The fine for ticket-less travel on long-distance trains is half the fare  so, if the ticket costs Rs 400, the ticket-less traveller must cough up Rs 600.        
	If railway staff stopped Left supporters, as alleged, the Left supporters stopped MPs by enmeshing them in traffic snarls. The rally, which stretched from Jantar Mantar to the Ramlila Grounds, was being held 1km from Parliament.        
	Many MPs complained to me that it took them an hour to reach Parliament instead of the usual 20 minutes. I want to tell them that if they do not pay heed to our demands, the next time they will not be able to reach Parliament, Yechury crowed.        
	The rally, the Lefts biggest here since the anti-GATT protests in 1994, was attended by 1-1.5 lakh people, reckoned the CPMs Yechury and Brinda Karat and CPI boss A.B. Bardhan. Police officers cited a more modest 60,000-plus.        
	The meeting ended with a resolve to launch a countrywide satyagraha and jail bharo on April 8 against the inflation. It will be the biggest peoples movement after Independence. We will gherao and picket central government offices. Twenty-five lakh people across the country will court arrest, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.

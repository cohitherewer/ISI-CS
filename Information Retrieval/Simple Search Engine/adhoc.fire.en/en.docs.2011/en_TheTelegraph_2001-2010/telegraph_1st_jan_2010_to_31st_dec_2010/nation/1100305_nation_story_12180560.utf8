          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, March 4: Chief minister M. Karunanidhi doesnt seem to have much faith in his flock  he believes forbidden scenes on TV could lead them to sin.        
	The DMK boss today promised to crack down on Swami Paramahamsa Nithyananda, but appealed to TV channels not to telecast the self-proclaimed god mans alleged sex romp with a Tamil actress as such scenes could lead to further cultural decline.        
	The media might argue that a thorn needs to be removed by another thorn but it would be more like giving a drunk more to drink. In the end, only the society would get more corrupted morally, he cautioned.         
	But at Burma Bazaar in north Chennai, buyers clamoured for the Nithyananda-Ranjitha CD. Each CD is going for anywhere between Rs 80 and Rs 100. The buyers want only the unedited version since the channel had edited the more interesting parts, said Ghouse Mohammed, a trader at Burma Bazaar.        
	Police today registered a case of cheating against Nithyananda, following a complaint by an advocate, Rama Sivaraman, who claimed Nithyananda had amassed wealth by misleading the public and collecting donations from them and then misused the funds for personal gratification.        
	We have registered a case under Section 420 of the IPC based on a complaint from an advocate yesterday. Nithyananda will be arrested if he is apprehended. But his whereabouts and that of the actress, Ranjitha, are not known. We have launched a search for the two, Chennai police commissioner T. Rajendran told reporters today.        
	The commissioner said if more complaints were filed against the 32-year-old seer and the actress, a second-line heroine of the 90s not active in films now, the police would accept them as well.         
	As if on cue, R.C. Manoharan, another advocate, sent a complaint to the commissioner, saying Ranjitha should be prosecuted for arousing the sexual feelings of innocent viewers with her overt gestures. This overt act might lead to sexual crimes, he said.        
	In T. Nagar, central Chennai, Ranjithas house remained locked.         
	The seers headquarters in Karnataka, Nithyananda Dhyanapeedam, today issued a statement that said the entire video was a hoax aimed at discrediting the organisation and the Swamiji.        
	It appealed to his followers not to be confused or agitated or be misled by the false propaganda. The statement, however, did not throw any light on Nithyanandas whereabouts since he was last seen in public at a discourse in Pondicherry in February.        
	Karnataka home minister V.S. Acharya told the Assembly the government would take stringent action against Nithyananda.

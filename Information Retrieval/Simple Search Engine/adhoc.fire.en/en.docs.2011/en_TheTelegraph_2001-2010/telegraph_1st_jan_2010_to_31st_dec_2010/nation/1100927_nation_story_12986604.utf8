          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 26: The CPI today accused ally CPM of being tight-fisted in seat-sharing and borrowed a family planning phrase, nasbandi (male sterilisation), to signal it wanted a better deal in the Bengal polls next summer.        
	The ultimatum came from CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. The CPM should begin seat-sharing discussions among (the Left) Front partners right now because the Assembly elections are only six months away. But the CPM should be flexible while distributing seats because nasbandi to hai nahi (there is no sterilisation), Bardhan told a party convention at Netaji Indoor Stadium this afternoon.        
	CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar explained what Bardhan possibly meant. Bardhanda wanted to drive home the message that the CPM should be flexible while distributing seats among the Front partners. He wants the CPM to drop the old formula which seems like family planning rules that say a person shouldnt have more than two children. We have been allotted only 13 seats for years. Now we want more.        
	Bardhan also took a swipe at the comments of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other CPM leaders that gave the impression the Left Front, stung by successive poll debacles, had already lost the battle. We will have to prepare a mindset that we will win... come what may. If you keep thinking that you have already lost the game, then it is all over, he said.         
	On September 19, Bhattacharjee had uttered jadi sarkar thake. (if this government remains in power) in a speech, but added in haste amra aachi, eta sambhob (we are here and it is possible).

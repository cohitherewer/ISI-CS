The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ring! Omar, rival back on talking terms
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ring! Omar, rival back on talking terms
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                             Mehbooba, Omar                                 
	Srinagar, July 10: India and Pakistan had resumed talking but not Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.        
	The chief minister and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president today finally got down to talking to each other  for the first time in at least a year.        
	Omar rang up Mehbooba to try and persuade her to join Mondays all-party meeting after having written to her earlier in the day with the same request.        
	Omar has called the meeting to try and evolve a united response to the unfolding situation in Kashmir, where 15 people have died in alleged security forces action in the past one month.        
	The PDP had yesterday refused to participate in the talks, saying it was unable to appreciate the purpose of calling a meeting of political parties at this juncture.        
	PDP sources said the party was unlikely to change its decision despite the chief ministers call, but would do so if the Prime Minister asked it to. As of today, our decision stands that we will not participate, a PDP leader said.        
	Sources in Omars party, the National Conference, however, said the chief minister talking to Mehbooba was itself an important development.        
	What we know for sure is that they have not been on talking terms since last years allegations by the PDP that Omar had figured in a sex scam. They would not even look each other in the eye, the source said.         
	Even before that (since Omar took over as chief minister in January last year till the sex scam allegation in July 2009), they may have rarely talked.        
	After the PDP had dragged him into a sex scam, Omar had tendered a conditional resignation before the governor, which he withdrew after the investigators cleared him.        
	In his letter to Mehbooba today, Omar said he would be personally grateful if she changed her mind on Mondays meeting.        
	We are on the crossroads of a crucial phase in Kashmir and its time for all of us to join hands and work together irrespective of our political beliefs, the letter said. Let us all come together to do a comprehensive analysis of the situation and jointly lay a road map for a better tomorrow.

	Bankura/Midnapore, March 21: Suspected members of the armed wing of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities allegedly fired at policemen setting up a camp in a Bankura pocket where the militia had abducted headmaster Ranjit Duley weeks back, prompting retaliatory action by the cops.        
	The attack was repelled by the police, and work is going on to pitch the camp.        
	Among the policemen present at the site was Arindam Das, who took over as inspector-in-charge of Sarenga police station last week after his predecessor Rabi Lochan Mitra died in an encounter with Maoists on February 25, police sources said.        
	The camp was being set up at Sarengas Telijant, 15km from Sarulia from where headmaster Duley was kidnapped and released this month, when members of the milita  Sidho Kanhu Gana Militia  allegedly opened fire.        
	Telijant has been picked to replace the more vulnerable Bhalukchira camp, which was one of the many closed down after the February 15 Maoist attack on the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in West Midnapores Shilda in which 24 jawans died.         
	The sources said the militia had struck to prevent the camp from being set up, adding the exchange of fire lasted about 40 minutes. A CPM supporter, Madhu Duley, was killed last month. There was an encounter on March 7, two days after Duley was kidnapped. We felt a camp was needed at Telijant, an officer said.        
	Bankura police chief Vishal Garg confirmed the encounter. There was an exchange of fire from both sides but no one was injured. The militia also exploded two improvised explosive devices but there was no damage.        
	Trinamul protest        
	Around 150 villagers, most of them women, from Salboni blocked the Midnapore-Lalgarh Road today demanding the release of a Trinamul Congress worker who was arrested yesterday for alleged links with Maoists. Pratap Mahatos wife Namita said her husband had nothing to do with the rebels.

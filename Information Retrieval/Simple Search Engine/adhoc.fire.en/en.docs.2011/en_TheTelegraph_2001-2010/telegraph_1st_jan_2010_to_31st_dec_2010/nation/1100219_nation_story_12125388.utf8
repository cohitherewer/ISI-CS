The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tents test loyalty to tenets 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tents test loyalty to tenets

	Indore, Feb. 18: The tiny white tents spread over the Kushbhau Thakre village have become a litmus test of a BJP leaders commitment to the tenets held dear by the RSS.         
	If a person spurns the comfort (or discomfort) of the two-room shelters with attached bathrooms for the powerful and the privileged or carps about the lack of water and malfunctioning flushes, the chances are he or she might be a persona non grata to the Sangh bosses watching from their Nagpur base.        
	Sushma Swaraj, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, realised this to her grief this morning. The Hindi papers and TV channels of Indore carried copious reports of how she refused to stay in a tent allotted to her and checked into a hotel. A fuming Sushma confronted journalists and asked how the canard originated and spread. What lies! Since yesterday, in the biting cold, I stayed in the tent. I havent moved out of this complex, I have not complained about a thing, she said.        
	BJP spokespersons who briefed the press didnt help matters. When one of them, Prakash Javdekar, was asked if it was true that many leaders had opted to move into hotels, he said he didnt know. He, however, added that Rajnath Singh, the former party president, was the one who had moved out because he was suffering from a viral ailment.         
	Javdekar was later ticked off for being economical with the truth. The truth is that every top leader, including L.K. Advani, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari and the chief ministers and deputy chief ministers, stayed put in the tents that can be described as spartan, but comfortable. Jaitley, for instance, jokingly told a confidant that if he dared to venture out of the complex, the news would hit the headlines and, therefore, he would have to be doubly careful.        
	When Maneka Gandhi and son Varun stomped out last night because their vehicles were not allowed to cross a red line drawn for security reasons, the inference was that neither could look forward to securing a position in the new BJP presidents team of office-bearers. Varun was looking to becoming a general secretary or head of the Yuva Morcha. It seems very unlikely. In its present mood, the RSS is unwilling to tolerate individual shenanigans, a BJP functionary said.        
	On the other hand, a former Rajya Sabha MP and entrepreneur, not exactly known for a frugal life-style, chose to stay in a tent. His only indulgence  if it can be termed as one  was having a non-vegetarian meal at night since he couldnt have too much of the sparse saatvik food (extreme vegetarian fare cooked without onion and garlic) dished out by the BJP.        
	But his gesture has earned him brownie points with the Sangh and Gadkari and, perhaps, an important post in the new dispensation.        
	So mindful are the leaders of their Ps and Qs that the chief ministers have set up mini-secretariats in their tents and remote-control their administrations rather than work out of hotels. Even a security-enveloped Narendra Modi refused to think of anything other than his tent, where he functions with a personal aide and a minister. Why do we need a team of officials? In Gujarat, it is the politicians who govern, not the bureaucrats, said Amit Shah, a minister in the Modi government.         
	Former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje didnt have any such dilemmas  she didnt show up. But her absence was construed as insubordination and might cost her an attempted rehabilitation in the central team after she resigned as Opposition leader in the Assembly.

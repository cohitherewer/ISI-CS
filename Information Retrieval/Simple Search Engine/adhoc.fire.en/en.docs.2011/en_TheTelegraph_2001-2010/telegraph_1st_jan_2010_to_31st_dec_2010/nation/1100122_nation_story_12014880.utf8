The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kashmir phone relief with stiff riders
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kashmir phone relief with stiff riders
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 21: The Centre today lifted the nearly three-month-old ban on prepaid cellphones in Jammu and Kashmir, but with strict conditions for verification of customers.        
	Among the key riders set in the Centres foolproof plan to ensure proper verification of the nearly 38 lakh prepaid subscribers is one that limits connections to a maximum of six for a family. Customers who already have a connection will have to give reasons for seeking a fresh one.         
	The new guidelines for verification have been finalised by the Union home ministry, which had clamped the restrictions on November 1 over security concerns arising from the insurgency in the border state.        
	Operators have been asked to strictly adhere to the Telegraph Act, under which they will now have to disconnect services within two hours if the address or any other document given by a customer is not found to be correct.        
	Utmost caution and discretion should be exercised in providing more than one connection. The degree of verification for a second connection shall be stricter and for a third connection even stricter and so on. In any case, no person shall be entitled to or provided with mobile connections (prepaid or postpaid held by a customer in his name or that of his family members) exceeding six in number, the guidelines state.         
	Operators will have to send a daily and a monthly list of re-verified prepaid users to the authorities, the guidelines said. Postpaid users will also come under closer watch: if the bill sent to such a subscriber is returned or if it remains unpaid for 90 days, the operator will be required to inform the authorities immediately.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah, who had been pushing for an end to the ban, welcomed todays relaxation and thanked Union home minister P. Chidambaram for accepting the states request. Lifting the ban has come as a relief to lakhs of subscribers, as also to thousands of young people who are engaged in this activity (selling connections). The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party also hailed the move.        
	B. Ahmad Dar, chairman of J amp;K STD and PCO Owners Association, was happy but questioned the justification of the ban, which had left around 20,000 dealers selling recharge coupons virtually jobless and invalidated 38 lakh of the states 45 lakh connections.         
	We are ready to co-operate with the government to ensure that the connections land in the right hands. What was the need of the ban when we were willing to co-operate? Dar asked in Srinagar.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj and Congress leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee at the lunch meeting on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar failed to break the parliamentary deadlock on the 2G scam with BJP leaders today, but the governments sights are now on talks tomorrow with other Opposition parties it hopes will be less rigid.        
	The government side, represented by ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Pawan Bansal and V. Narayansamy, told the BJP leaders that investigations were continuing into the spectrum scam and that the Prime Ministers willingness to appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) should be enough.        
	But the BJP team, represented by L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj, stuck to its demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC), wondering why the government was adamant if it did not want to hide anything.        
	With both sides sticking to their positions, the meeting ended without any breakthrough.         
	The government had not expected the BJP to change its stance suddenly, with the budget session less than two months away. But the purpose of calling the meeting was to send the message to the people that the BJP was being unreasonable despite sincere efforts by the Congress-led UPA to restore normality in Parliament.        
	BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that the BJPs position is that we are asking for a JPC.        
	She made it clear that the onus of ending the impasse was on the government. The responsibility of running the Parliament lies with the government. The way out to run the (budget) session is clear. The government should find a way to take the Opposition along, she said.        
	But Kumar continued to hold out hopes of a truce.        
	There might be some ups and downs but whether they are leaders of the ruling party or the ruling coalition or leaders of the Opposition, they all are very committed to ensuring that Parliament runs. I am sure with their differing views they will be able to find a common ground and I am very optimistic that something positive will emerge, the Speaker said after the meeting.        
	The government has played its cards differently this time. It has invited non-BJP parties separately to gauge their response to the Prime Ministers offer to appear before the PAC. Many in the government believe some of these parties may strike a discordant note and take the initiative to break the deadlock. Even if one or two parties express their willingness to work normally in the budget session of Parliament, the message will go out that the Opposition was not fully united, a Congress leader said.        
	The government sees signs of unease among some parties at keeping Parliament paralysed longer. The next general election is three-and-half years away, they cannot shut Parliament for so long. They have to find a middle path. Very few people will like disruption to go on like this. The Opposition cannot set conditions for running Parliament. We have said no-JPC but offered many things. The Opposition should show some flexibility, the Congress leader said.        
	The Samajwadi Party and the Left, in particular, are not comfortable with the idea of disrupting the budget session. The Left is jittery because it would not like to be seen working in tandem with the BJP before the Assembly elections in Bengal and Kerala next summer.         
	The government feels most Opposition parties will gradually fall in line, maybe in February, if not at this stage. It is a continuous process. We will keep talking to the parties. We are optimistic of a solution, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said.

          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Jan. 1: The Congress central leadership today issued a show-cause notice to an Andhra Pradesh minister for attacking K. Rosaiah over Telangana yesterday, but the cracks in the party opened wider with two more senior leaders firing salvos at the chief minister.        
	Ministers and MLAs from the two sides were engaged in a public verbal battle today, each group accusing the other of fanning the turmoil.        
	The Congress sent the notice to the state IT minister from Telangana, Komtireddy Venkat Reddy, for deliberately lowering the partys prestige after he lambasted Rosaiah for saying Maoists had got involved in the statehood movement.        
	Venkat Reddy is the only one among the 11 state ministers from Telangana who had sent quit letters to Sonia Gandhi last week not to have taken his resignation back.        
	Today the chief minister came under attack from Congress Working Committee member K. Keshav Rao, who is from Telangana, and MLA and former minister R. Damodar Reddy.        
	Rao criticised Rosaiah for not withdrawing false police cases against students and other Telangana supporters. Damodar Reddy objected to Rosaiahs alleged complaint against Venkat Reddy to the high command.        
	When the minister has already offered his resignation, does it really matter if you complain against him to the high command? Damodar Reddy asked.        
	He alleged: It was the chief minister who prompted the coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema ministers and MLAs to resign and agitate against Telangana.        
	The notice to Venkat Reddy was issued by All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi, who is in charge of organisational affairs, after he received a report from Veerappa Moily, the partys man in charge of Andhra Pradesh. Venkat Reddy has seven days to reply.        
	Endowment minister Gade Venkat Reddy, who is not from Telangana, triggered another furore in the party by declaring that Congress members in Andhra Pradesh were divided over Telangana.        
	The Congress party is divided on Telangana; so what can be achieved at the Delhi-level consultations? he said. The decision announced by home minister P. Chidambaram appears to lack concurrence of the Congress party or its president Sonia Gandhi.        
	He demanded that an independent agency be given a timetable to conduct a survey and gauge the sentiments of the people of all three regions on Telangana.        
	His comments drew furious criticism from pro-Telangana leaders within the Congress and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). Damodar Reddy demanded disciplinary action against him for dragging Sonias name into the controversy.        
	The AICC secretary and member of the legislative council, P. Sudhakar Reddy, suggested that ministers from Rayalaseema and the coasts restrain themselves and support the Centres initiative to create a Telangana state.        
	The Osmania University students joint action council accused Gade Venkat Reddy of trying to further delay statehood for Telangana.        
	The students have resolved to continue their agitation. They today protested against the 10 Telangana ministers who have withdrawn their resignation letters. Holding the ministers portraits, the students shouted slogans on their campus such as down with Telangana ministers.        
	The students celebrated the New Year last night with nightlong sloganeering and pro-Telangana cultural programmes.

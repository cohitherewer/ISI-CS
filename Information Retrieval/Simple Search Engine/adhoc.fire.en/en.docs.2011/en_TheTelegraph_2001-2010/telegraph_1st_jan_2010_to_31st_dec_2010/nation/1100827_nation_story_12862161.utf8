The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Non-lethal mantra for mob control
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Non-lethal mantra for mob control
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The toll among Kashmirs protesters has prompted the Prime Minister to advocate methods of crowd control that will not result in deaths.        
	Manmohan Singh today called for a task force to be formed to suggest non-lethal techniques of maintaining public order, but disappointed expectations that he would be sending out a political message to the Valley.        
	We need to revisit standard operating procedures and crowd-control measures to deal with public agitations with non-lethal, yet effective and focused, measures, Singh told a conference of directors-general of police (DGPs).        
	I would request the home minister to establish a high-power task force to come out with a set of recommendations on these issues in the next two or three months.        
	Singh said the issue of public order in Kashmir had become a cause for concern despite the reduction in militancy. Since June, firing by the security forces has killed more than 60 people, many of them children and teenagers, and some of them unintended victims of stray bullets.        
	Although institutes like the Defence Research and Development Organisation have devised novel weapons of crowd-control  such as the chilli bomb made out of the northeastern bhoot jolokia  the police forces still use rubber bullets and tear-gas shells.        
	The Prime Minister said crowd-control methods could not be the same in different locations and situations. We cannot have an approach of one size fits all, he said, adding that many countries had put in place procedures that varied according to the situation.        
	Indias problems are more diverse than those of many other countries, with forces such as the CRPF battling militants in Kashmir as well as the Maoists in central and eastern India.         
	The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to talking about public order in Kashmir. Union home minister P. Chidambaram had yesterday said that in the next few days, the government hoped to find that elusive starting point from where it could reach out to the protesters and restart the dialogue process. Singh was silent about that.        
	He asked the DGPs to build up the capacity for intelligence-gathering in the various Indian languages. He called for increasing the recruitment quota in the paramilitary for candidates from areas affected by militancy and Maoism.        
	Five years ago, such reservation was increased from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. I think we need to take this further, Singh said.        
	Such an increase could be important at a time the paramilitary forces are struggling to find their bearings in areas whose terrain and culture are alien to them.        
	Singh today reaffirmed his idea of setting up a standing committee of DGPs to provide policy inputs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal college sop for Matuas
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal college sop for Matuas
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 7: The Bengal government today assigned a plot for a college to be named after two icons of the Matuas, moving to fulfil a promise made by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and counter Mamata Banerjees wooing of the politically influential sect.        
	The higher education department has written to the agriculture department, which owns the five-acre plot at Gaighata in North 24-Parganas Gaighata, to hand over the land.         
	The institute will be tentatively named Sri Sri Thakur Harichand Guruchand College, after Matua icons Thakur Harichand and son Thakur Guruchand.        
	Haripada Biswas, the Forward Bloc MLA who has been trying to speed up the project since the chief minister made the promise at a felicitation ceremony for Matua leader Kapil Krishna Thakur in September, said the ball had been set rolling. It is a crucial step. The foundation ceremony will be organised soon.        
	The Matuas, whose number is estimated at 1.2 crore, could hold the key to the outcomes in many seats in the state polls next summer. Backers of the ruling Left for long, the Matuas apparently voted for Mamatas candidates in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. Mamata has announced plans to name a station after the two icons.         
	A sum of Rs 1 crore has been earmarked for the college, an official said.

	Patna, Nov. 25: Caste took a back seat and women gained in visibility this Bihar election. Both developments may now be reflected in Nitish Kumars ministry.        
	The landslide win will allow the chief minister to pick just the ministers he wants, overriding the pressures of caste and clout that shackled him during his first tenure, sources said.        
	More women ministers are expected  compared with the five in the previous government  in acknowledgement of the higher number of women winners and women voters. In 2005, the House of 243 had 25 women; this time it has 33, all from the ruling alliance.        
	Nitishs remarks today suggested he would choose his ministers on merit and performance rather than accommodate someone because of their caste or muscle power.        
	It is a mandate for development, a mandate to work harder and perform better, the chief minister told the Janata Dal (United) legislature party and repeated the remarks at the allies meeting.        
	A senior Dal (United) leader said: Nitish Kumar has strongly promoted the cause of the Extreme Backward Castes, Mahadalits and Pasmanda Muslims. Employing the criterion of merit actually amounts to (letting) these social groups share power in governance.        
	Sources said the chief minister might also induct a few fresh and energetic faces instead of the old and worn-out ones.        
	Although the BJPs numbers have improved significantly  it has 91 MLAs to the Dal (United)s 115, compared with 55 and 88 the last time insiders said the alliance would stick to the 4:3 ratio in the ministry.        
	That is, there will be 20 ministers from the Dal (United) and 15 from the BJP. Going by the size of the Bihar House, the state can have a maximum 36 ministers.        
	Nitish, his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi (BJP) and some other ministers are to be sworn in tomorrow. Nitish today met governor Devendra Konwar and staked his claim, setting in motion the exercise of government formation.        
	In 2005, the chief minister had various debts to pay off and compulsions to consider. For instance, he was obliged to a group of 13 MLAs who had broken away from Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party and joined the Dal (United). He had to pick the leader of the breakaway group, Narendra Singh, as a minister though he was not a member of either House.        
	Similarly, Nitish had accommodated Ramashray Prasad Singh, who had lost the 2005 elections, as the representative of the upper caste Bhumihars in his ministry. He had also been under pressure to give berths to the loyalists of then state unit president Lallan Singh.

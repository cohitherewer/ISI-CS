          OUR BUREAU                                          Chandrababu Naidu in Hyderabad on Monday. (PTI)		    
	Hyderabad, Dec. 20: Chandrababu Naidu has managed to do outside the Andhra Assembly what he couldnt within its four walls  train the national spotlight on the plight of farmers crippled by successive national calamities and inadequate compensation.        
	The Telugu Desam president, who has been on indefinite hungerstrike at the new MLA quarters since Friday demanding higher compensation for farmers, was today forcibly taken into custody in the wee hours after a seven-hour drama that saw police clashing with Desam workers.        
	Sources said a large posse of policemen in riot gear descended on the protest site around 10pm last night and tried to shift Naidu to hospital after doctors reported his blood pressure had risen and blood sugar levels had dropped.        
	Naidu had refused to heed chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddys assurance that his regime was looking into the TDP leaders demands to pay Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers growing paddy and Rs 15,000 to those growing cotton and tobacco.        
	The farmers and artisans faced Natures fury at least five times in the last one year. The loss was colossal but the government failed to come to their rescue, Naidu had said while launching his fast.        
	When police landed at the protest site, thousands of Desam workers surrounded the dais on which Naidu was resting to block them from reaching their leader. The police then locked the main gate of the MLA quarters to prevent the hundreds thronging outside from barging in.        
	Soon after, the joint commissioner of police, M.M. Bhagawat, requested Naidu to shift to the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences because of his deteriorating health. But the leader refused.        
	Clashes erupted around 5am when policemen from the city task force made their way to Naidus dais and the riot police allegedly wielded canes to disperse party workers. They then allegedly pushed the National Security Guard personnel guarding Naidu and took him to hospital.        
	Naidus fast drew support from Left parties with CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM boss Prakash Karat calling on him last week. Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda expressed full solidarity with him, warning the UPA that once people revolt, nobody can stop them.        
	A stream of other leaders also expressed support, including Janata Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav, MDMK leader Vaiko and AIADMK MP Sammali. Many condemned the alleged police brutality on Naidu.        
	The leader, however, continued his protest from hospital, refusing to touch either food or medicines till his demands were met. A NIMS official said he is taking only water and there is certainly some anxiety about his health.        
	In an open letter to farmers today, Naidu said: There is no question of ending my hungerstrike even if they admit me in hospital, lodge me in jail or rain blows with lathis. I am ready to do anything to wipe the tears from farmers eyes.        
	Dont lose heart. We shall unitedly march ahead on the warpath and seek redress of your grievances.        
	Andhra health minister minister D.L. Ravindra Reddy said: A group of ministers discussed Chandrababus health report and took the decision to shift him to hospital. There is no politics in the decision.        
	Several leaders visited NIMS and enquired about Naidus health, including Rashtriya Lok Dal president Ajit Singh and CPI national deputy secretary S.S. Reddy. They deplored his arrest and demanded that the government concede his demands.        
	A bandh was observed in Andhra to protest Naidus arrest. Desam and Left workers blocked roads in many towns and staged protests in front of RTC bus depots. Sporadic violence was reported. Most business houses remained shut in Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and other places.

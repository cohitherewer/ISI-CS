                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dignity most prized asset
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 13 (PTI): The Supreme Court today asked the media not to drag in the name of any person figuring in the Niira Radia tapes until the case was decided by it as the dignity of every individual was precious.        
	It warned journalists that they would be hauled up if the Lakshmanrekha was crossed.        
	A bench of Justices G.S. Singhvi and A.K. Ganguly chided the media for distorted reporting of court proceedings during the past three weeks on 2G spectrum allocation.        
	Till we decide, nobodys name should be dragged in the media. The image of a person should not be tarnished. All of us know that the most prized right is the right to dignity and none of the right is above it, the court said.        
	Taking umbrage at the distorted reporting, the court asked the media not to take risk but added it valued the role of press as watchdog of the society.        
	They must not cross the Lakshmanrekha. They are crossing the limits every day. From now on they would do it at their own peril. For three weeks, there has been distorted versions of the proceedings of this court. This is most unfortunate. We will not ignore any nonsense henceforth.        
	Justice Singhvi said he was aghast to see the telecast on a news channel of certain queries the bench raised on Union home secretary G.K. Pillais purported remarks on the tapes.        
	My wife asked me what type of orders you are passing? Justice Singhvi remarked amid laughter, citing the reported telecast by a news channel that Pillai was slammed by the apex court. They said SC raps home secretary. What is the language they use? he asked.        
	The bench said it would not tolerate any attempt by the media to tarnish the image of any individual or counsel appearing in the case as every individuals dignity was paramount.        
	The apex court has said the media should conduct itself in a responsible manner as the society appreciates its role in a democracy.        
	Distorted reports are appearing in the media. We are making it very clear nobody will be allowed to tarnish the image of the counsel. There are exchanges of words in the court. They do not constitute an order or direction.        
	It should stop as till now we have ignored. Now we are making it clear, dont take the risk of being hauled up. We are making it very clear nobody will be allowed to play with the proceedings of the court. Use restraint in reporting the views, the bench advised the media.        
	Most irresponsible reports are appearing. They (media) are watchdog of democracy. Everybody appreciates the role of media and the important contribution they make, the bench said.

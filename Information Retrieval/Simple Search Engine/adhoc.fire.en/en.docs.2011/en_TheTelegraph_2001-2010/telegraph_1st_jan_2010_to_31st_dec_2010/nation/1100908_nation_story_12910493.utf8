The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Doctors end lethal strike
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Doctors end lethal strike
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, Sept. 7: Doctors in Rajasthan today called off a three-day-old strike during which 55 people died in hospitals, though the health ministry has said all cases cannot be attributed to the ceasework.         
	The doctors, who were calling for action against policemen who had injured some of them during a baton-charge on Saturday, today said their demands had been met. The state government, so far, has not spoken on the negotiations.        
	It is not clear if a mild threat from Delhi to cancel the resident doctors licences played a part in ending the strike that had adversely affected work in at least 40 hospitals.        
	Hours before the strike was called off, Union minister of state for health Dinesh Trivedi appealed to the doctors to get back to work, a PTI report said. I would like to appeal to all the striking doctors with folded hands... your job is to save life and not to be the cause of deaths. So please go back to work, he said.        
	If they (the doctors) do not behave, there are provisions of law, Trivedi was quoted as saying.        
	Asked whether he favoured invoking the Essential Service Maintenance Act against the doctors, the minister did not give a direct answer but said the time had come for the Medical Council of India to consider whether it should revoke the licences of such doctors.        
	At least 1,200 resident doctors have been on strike since Saturday night after an altercation took place between doctors and a patients family at Jodhpurs Mathura Das Mathur Hospital. The doctors retaliated when they were attacked by the relatives. Later, they claimed that a police baton-charge had injured seven of them.        
	In the past three days, 55 people have died in state hospitals but health minister A.A. Ahmed today said all the deaths may not have occurred because of the strike.        
	After the strike ended, Dr Ajay Malviya, the president of the Doctors Action Committee, said over phone from Jodhpur that the state had accepted most of their demands. He said the government had a plan ready for compensating the doctors whose belongings such as laptops were damaged in the scuffle.

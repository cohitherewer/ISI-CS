          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Pranab Mukherjee    
	New Delhi, July 5: The Planning Commission today decided in favour of pumping nearly Rs 14,000 crore into social and physical infrastructure building in some 35 Maoist-hit districts.        
	The plan, formulated at the request of finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, will focus on the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, rural roads, health, rural electricity, universal elementary education, child nutrition and health and new residential schools called ashram schools.        
	Later this month, the action plan will be placed before the cabinet. It will then go to the National Development Council (NDC) where chief ministers will be present. The Maoist-hit districts include one in Andhra, two in Bengal, six in Bihar, seven in Chhattisgarh, two in Maharashtra, 10 in Jharkhand, one in Madhya Pradesh, five in Orissa and one in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Planning Commission has recommended that forest land used by tribals to grow rice and subsistence crops should be legally handed over to them.        
	It also wants state governments to set up a state mineral fund and levy upto 10 per cent of the royalty now being collected for extracting minerals. This levy would be used for tribal welfare programmes.        
	Annual mineral production in the country is estimated to be worth over Rs 99,000 crore. Most of this money comes from poor Naxalite-hit states, which suffer from what economists call a resource curse  rich in resources but poor in human capital and with low income levels.        
	Over the last few years, the government has come round to the view that the only long-term solution to Maoist insurgency is to bring the fruits of development to tribal people and assuage their sense of deprivation.        
	Despite India growing at 9 per cent annually, economic progress has eluded remote, forested, tribal-majority districts. According to a recent CII report presented to the Prime Minister, the only way to contain Naxalism and secure investments in the Red Corridor is to accelerate infrastructure development, involve people in decision-making, secure their livelihood and skill levels and strengthen local governance.        
	Officials said the plan would have both aggregate components as well as district-wise plans. Our experts and economists have toured remote districts and prepared detailed development plans in consultation with district officials, an official said.        
	The plan will be placed before the NDC meeting scheduled for July 24. The meeting was originally convened to get chief ministers approval for the mid-term appraisal of the 11th five-year plan. But with Maoist insurgency taking centrestage in the governments scheme of things, the focus has shifted to development of Naxalite-hit areas.

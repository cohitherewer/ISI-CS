The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cloud on bid to buy Airbus refuellers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cloud on bid to buy Airbus refuellers
          SUJAN DUTTA                          An Ilyushin-78 refuels two Sukhoi 30 Mki combat jets of the Indian Air Force                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: An Indian Air Force bid to buy six mid-air refuellers from European consortium Airbus for about $1.5 billion instead of the Russian origin Ilyushin-78 is in jeopardy after the defence ministry is understood to have communicated that the competition is being cancelled.         
	Mid-air refuellers are a strategic asset for the IAF, meant to extend the duration and multiply the missions of its fighter aircraft. For example, a Sukhoi 30Mki combat jet based in Tezpur in Assam can fly nearly 1,600km west over Punjab for a mission, get refuelled by a tanker based in Agra and go on another operational sortie without having to return to base.         
	A European diplomat said he believed the competition was still wide open and the choice of the Airbus by the IAF demonstrated its willingness to go for a top quality product. EADS, the European consortium, will be a long-standing partner for the Indian armed forces, he said.         
	Last year, the Russians had conveyed their unhappiness over the IAFs choice despite having supplied the IL-78s. The Russians displeasure was conveyed to an Indian delegation led by the then defence secretary, Vijay Singh. The mid-air refueller squadron based in Agra currently comprises 10 IL-78 aircraft.         
	A high-level defence ministry source said there were problems in awarding the deal to EADS right away after the questions raised by the finance ministry.        
	Cancellation of the contract means that the IAFs tanker expansion and modernisation programme will be set back by a few more years for a new round of competitive trials unless the decision is reversed.         
	The finance ministry had asked questions on the price and the choice of the Airbus 330 Multi Role Tanker Transport that former Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major announced in May last year.         
	The current air chief, Pradeep Vasant Naik, had also confirmed that the Airbus 330 MRTT was the IAFs choice though the tanker aircraft in its fleet currently are the Ilyushin-78.         
	Traditionally, military equipment has been bought (mostly from the Russians) from foreign vendors on the basis of the lowest price offered. But the Defence Procurement Policy now stipulates that the armed forces must factor in life cycle costs  the expense incurred on a platform over the duration of its service life  before indicating their choice.         
	The governments decision again raises doubts on Indias military relations with European countries, especially the lead country for the MRTT, France, which ceremonially feted India by inviting its armed forces to lead the French National Day (Bastille Day) parade in Paris last year.         
	The competition has been on for nearly six years. Air Chief Marshal Major had said in May 2009 that he understood that defence minister A.K. Antony would shortly take the proposal to the cabinet committee on security for clearance.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 12: A defiant Maharashtra government has promised a new law to prevent defamation of state icons three days after the Supreme Court overturned its ban on a book on Shivaji.        
	Home minister R.R. Patil moved a resolution in the Assembly today condemning American scholar James Laine for his book Shivaji Hindu King in Islamic India which contains a controversial passage about the Maratha heros parentage.        
	He then announced the government would bring in legislation in the winter session in December providing for stringent action against writing that defamed iconic figures.        
	It (the new legislation) will make it difficult to write any history, scholar Aroon Tikekar, who had played a key role in drafting the states culture policy, rued.        
	Earlier, the Opposition had staged noisy protests outside and inside the House and stalling proceedings on the opening day of the monsoon session, demonstrating against Fridays court order lifting the book ban.        
	Patil said the new law would cover attempts to hurt caste and religious sentiments. He said Maharashtra would take inspiration from Tamil Nadu, which had passed an act to deal with such issues.        
	We will study the legislation in Tamil Nadu and introduce the new legislation in the next session, he said during a special debate on the subject in the House.        
	Patil said the Oxford University Press (OUP), the publisher of Laines book, had assured him that no fresh copies would be printed despite the Supreme Court overturning the ban. He said the publishing house had no copies of the book left after the title was withdrawn on November 21, 2003.        
	The minister said the assurance had come from the OUPs managing director, Manzar Khan. He read out from the faxed letter: The author has also given an affidavit of undertaking that the said paragraph on page 93 of the book would be deleted from all future publication of the book world-wide.        
	Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt slammed Maharashtras political class for not standing up for freedom of expression. When it comes to choosing between power and justice, they (politicians) will inevitably choose power rather than fight for justice, he said.        
	Tikekar, the scholar, said: No historian worth his reputation has given any credence to the controversial theory (in Laines book). So this theory has already been exploded.        
	The Assembly witnessed three adjournments. Nationalist Congress Party MLA Jitendra Avhad demanded that the historians at Punes Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, who had helped Laine with his research, be charged with abetment. Independent MLA Anil Bonde asking for a ban on the Pune institute itself.

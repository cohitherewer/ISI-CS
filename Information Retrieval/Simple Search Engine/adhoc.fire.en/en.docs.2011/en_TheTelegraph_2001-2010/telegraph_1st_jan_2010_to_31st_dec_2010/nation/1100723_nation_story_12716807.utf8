	New Delhi, July 22: Americas special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan today said the Lashkar-e-Toiba was as dangerous as the Taliban and al Qaida.        
	The statement by Richard Holbrooke almost equated Indias concerns on terror outfits with bases in Pakistan to the USs concern over the fundamentalists in Afghanistan.        
	Holbrooke, who has met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi, said the US has been asking Pakistan to act against the Lashkar, the terror outfit suspected to have masterminded the 26/11 attack.        
	Another high-profile US official, Admiral Mike Mullen, who reached New Delhi this evening, warned that terrorists could engineer a conflict between India and Pakistan.        
	One of the things that struck me then (after 26/11) and is still a great concern is how 10 terrorists could drive two nuclear-armed nations closer to conflict, Mullen said, adding that he feared there was a possibility of a miscalculation in response to a terrorist attack.        
	Holbrooke, who met Singh yesterday, said it was for India to determine its role in Afghanistan but that peace would not be established in Afghanistan without Pakistan which has legitimate concerns.        
	When we talk about major terrorist groups, we consider it (Lashkar) as dangerous as other groups, Holbrooke said when asked if the US would deal with the Lashkar as it does with the Taliban and al Qaida.        
	He said the US was also asking Pakistan to deny sanctuary to the outfit. We understand, as a government, that it (Lashkar) is a threat and we talk about it all the time with the Pakistani military (asking them) to deny their territory to this organisation, he said. Tackling it (Lashkar) is equal to any other priority in the region.        
	About the way Pakistan was dealing with the alleged Mumbai attackers, he said it had taken some steps but these are not enough.        
	Holbrookes visit and talks come after discussions between foreign affairs minister S.M. Krishna and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton in Kabul earlier in the week.         
	It is being followed by Mullen who is also expected to meet Manmohan Singh.

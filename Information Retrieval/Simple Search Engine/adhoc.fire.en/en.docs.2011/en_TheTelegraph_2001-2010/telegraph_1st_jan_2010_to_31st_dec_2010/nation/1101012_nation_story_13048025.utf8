The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mystery email threat to IPL team owners
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mystery email threat to IPL team owners
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Vijay Mallya                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: All the IPL franchisees apparently received a mystery text message last night from a top BCCI official, warning them of the same taste of the medicine we have given today to the Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab.        
	The message, allegedly sent from board secretary N. Srinivasans cellphone, asked the team owners to align yourself with us and avoid talking to Lalit Modi.        
	Srinivasan and the Board of Control for Cricket in India today denied any links with the text and none of the franchisees were available for comment. The text had been forwarded to The Telegraph last night by a co-owner of one of the teams but was held back to verify its authenticity.        
	The BCCI-run IPL governing council had yesterday thrown the Royals and Kings out of the cash-rich T20 league over alleged breaches of the franchise agreement, but sources said the two teams Modi links were a crucial factor in their ouster.        
	The text, apparently sent to all team owners including Vijay Mallya, Shah Rukh Khan, Subroto Roy and Mukesh Ambani, read:        
	As we have been saying. Please align yourself with us. Or everyone will get the same taste of the medicine we have given today to RR and KXIP. Owners should not think they are above the BCCI. You should be happy we allow you to participate.        
	We know how to clip your wings. President and I have decided we will run the IPL the way we want to and after all its our property. You can either be a part of it or we can find a way for you to get out. We will throw Lalit Modi and anyone attached with him. So best avoid talking to him.        
	After angry team owners complained to the IPL governing council members this morning, the board issued a statement.        
	The BCCI has just received information that some messages, allegedly sent from Mr N. Srinivasans cellphone to the IPL franchisees, are being circulated and talked about by the media, it said.        
	The board would like to clarify that no such messages have been sent from his mobile. This is clearly a case of foul play, and complaints to that effect are being lodged with the concerned mobile phone service, and the police, for immediate action.        
	Srinivasan too told reporters in Chennai: I did not send any SMS to anybody. Somebody has hacked into my phone, through the service provider or some technical means. Because it is not reflected in my service provider, I have complained to the police. Let us find out, you know, who has perpetrated this crime.        
	Mallya, the Royal Challengers Bangalore boss who had yesterday tweeted against the twin expulsions and has been publicly supporting Modi, was unreachable today. His stepdaughter Laila had been part of Modis team that managed the IPL, and a hotels CCTV had allegedly shown her leaving Modis suite with crucial documents on the night his office was first raided.        
	Sources close to the owners said hectic parleys were on between the franchisees and the BCCI to allow the two scrapped teams to redeem themselves.        
	As of now, it looks tough, as the BCCI is in no mood to relent. But the owners are influential people and hope to make use of their political contacts to help RR and KXIP. Some of them have old personal or business relationships with some or other co-owner of these teams, an IPL source said.        
	The sacked teams too have kept channels of communication open with the IPL governing council members.        
	English county team Hampshire today indicated it would wait and watch the IPL developments relating to the Royals before signing an earlier promised contract with the Jaipur franchise.        
	The Royals had announced the the worlds first global sporting franchise in February by signing MoUs with four global sports entities, including Hampshire.        
	The plan was to share players and profits and team up with these clubs. But Hampshire officials called us today and said they were disturbed by the IPL decision and would like to take some more time before signing the agreement. They have not said no  just postponed their decision, a Royals source said.        
	Royals chief executive Sean Morris had announced a T20 tournament at Lords featuring the Rajasthan franchise and its three partners, but opposition from the England and Wales Cricket Board had stalled it.

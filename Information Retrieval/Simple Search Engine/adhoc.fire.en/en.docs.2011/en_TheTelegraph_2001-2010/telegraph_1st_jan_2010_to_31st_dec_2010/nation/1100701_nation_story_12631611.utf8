                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI opposes Mahindra bail as crusader race hots up
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                              Keshub Mahindra      
	June 30: The CBI has opposed the continuation of bail for industrialist Keshub Mahindra and six others convicted in the Bhopal gas case  a change of stand that mirrors the competition among the Centre and the Madhya Pradesh government to be seen as crusaders for justice.        
	For the second successive day today, a sessions court in Bhopal adjourned hearing on petitions challenging a trial courts verdict awarding two years imprisonment to seven Union Carbide executives, including Mahindra, the then non-executive chairman.        
	The seven are now out on a 30-day bail, which will expire on July 7.         
	District and sessions court judge Subhash Kakde will hear the submissions on Wednesday.        
	On June 7, when the verdict was delivered, the CBI had not opposed the bail to the seven. However, today, CBI counsel Hemant Shukla opposed the continuation of the bail. He contended that the court did not have the power to grant bail to Mahindra and the others.        
	Sources said the uproar over the verdict might have prompted the central agency to take such a stand, although Mahindra and others have been convicted of bailable charges. Mahindra has resigned from the Prime Ministers trade council.        
	If the Centre cut a populist face in the court, the Madhya Pradesh government was not far behind.        
	The state governments counsel, Dinesh Dinkar, has petitioned the court to be heard. The state is contending that the punishment of two years is too little in view of the magnitude of the tragedy.        
	Opening another flank, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan announced the formation of a commission to look into all matters concerning the Bhopal gas tragedy.        
	Chauhan said the commission would be headed by a retired judge of the high court. However, he did not announce the name of the judge.        
	Sources said the commission would specifically look into how Carbides then CEO Warren Anderson was allowed to leave India on December 7, 1984. In all probability, the commission would summon the then chief minister, Arjun Singh, to depose on the circumstances that led to Andersons exit.        
	Sources close to chief minister Chauhan said the move to set up a fresh commission had been approved by the central BJP leadership and the RSS, which reportedly felt Arjuns si- lence required closer scrutny.

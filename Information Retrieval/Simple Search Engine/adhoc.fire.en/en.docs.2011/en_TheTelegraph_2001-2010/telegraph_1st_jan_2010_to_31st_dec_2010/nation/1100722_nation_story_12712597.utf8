The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Crash focus at CPM meet
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Crash focus at CPM meet
          J.P. YADAV and our bureau                            Biman Bose (top); Nilotpal Basu                                
	New Delhi, July 21: Sainthia occupied minds at the CPMs three-day central committee meeting that started here today to discuss the political approach to next years Assembly elections in Bengal and Kerala.        
	Comrades emerging from todays session highlighted Mondays train crash to attack their Bengal arch-rival, railway minister Mamata Banerjee, while vigorously denying suggestions they were out to draw political mileage from the tragedy.        
	But one man wasnt interested in the accident: Prakash Karat. The CPM general secretary, known to blame the Bengal government and the partys state unit for the Lefts poll reverses, refused to comment on the crash.        
	Asked about Union home minister P. Chidambarams statement that relief teams had reached late at the accident site, Karat left with the remark that the railways were not under the party.        
	But central committee members, particularly from Bengal, appeared more than keen to speak on the crash.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose, puffing a cigarette, explained how the party cadres and the Left governments officials had rushed to save the lives of the injured passengers.         
	But Boses colleague Nilotpal Basu was quick to assert the initiative was not undertaken with a political motive.         
	We dont want to derive political mileage out of the accident. It is for the people to decide. Her (Mamatas) managerial abilities are for the people to judge, Basu said when asked whether the spate of rail accidents under Mamatas tenure would create doubts about her abilities and help the CPM.        
	A central committee member claimed recent events in Bengal had energised cadres demoralised by successive poll debacles. In tea-shop gossips, people have started becoming critical of Mamata. They are also criticising the Left but speaking against Mamata is a big change, the member said.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not attend todays meeting. Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the Bengal chief minister was preoccupied with Assembly proceedings. A discussion on the departments under the chief minister is scheduled for tomorrow. Our ministers are not irresponsible like those of the Trinamul Congress, Yechury said.        
	The remark appeared meant as much to justify Bhattacharjees absence as to criticise Mamatas no-show on crucial days in Parliament.        
	Yechury lashed out at Trinamul leaders for making comments that appeared to blame the accident on a conspiracy by the CPM. It is absurd and ridiculous. It is unfortunate that they are blaming us for petty politics.        
	At the meeting, held behind closed doors, a key question was whether to maintain equi-distance from the Congress and the BJP or forge a tactical understanding with one of them. Yechury said the matter is to be discussed.        
	Party sources said with the Congress firmly behind Mamata after the train accident, it was advantage Karat as he favours a strong anti-Congress line to be adopted by the party in the run-up to the state polls.        
	Mamata on tragedies        
	In Calcutta, at the July 21 rally, Mamata referred to the Jnaneswari and Sainthia tragedies, hinting at a conspiracy.        
	 Both train accidents happened at 2am. Both occurred two days before two major events in the state  the May 30 civic election and our July 21 rally. The inquiry should keep this in mind. Now, the CPM is demanding my resignation. Its no big deal. I can put my resignation letter in Biman Boses pocket. But what about the 40,000 people killed in the Lefts 34-year tenure? she asked.         
	Mamata iterated her demand that the joint forces in Lalgarh be withdrawn, adding that she would take it up with the Prime Minister, if needed. Our Prime Minister is a good person. He will definitely hear me out.        
	Mamata said she would visit Lalgarh on August 9.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 18: The army, central intelligence agencies and the police of three states joined hands to catch four escaped militants from Jammu and Kashmir following a five-day hunt in the mountains of the neighbourhood.        
	Javed Qureshi, Tanveer, Jameel Ahmed Wani and Ghulam Nabi were arrested in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in a meticulously coordinated operation, defence spokesperson Lt Colonel Biplab Nath said here today.        
	The militants had come under tremendous pressure and decided to move out of (Kashmir) to places in Uttarakhand and Himachal, where they worked as casual labourers to evade arrest. However, they did not escape the... network of the military intelligence and the intelligence agencies in these areas, Nath said.        
	It was a meticulously planned and coordinated operation which was executed at multiple locations extending from Dehra Dun in Uttarakhand, Nurpur in Himachal Pradesh and Bihota in Marmat-Doda (Jammu), lasting more than five days.        
	The army said the four militants had been brought to the Marmat area of Doda after their arrests, which had led to the seizure of a Pika gun and a light machinegun as well as other weapons and ammunition.        
	Nath said: The army and the police continuously tracked the militants by deploying additional forces (and) temporary operating bases in the higher mountain reaches. This had made their movement, survival and sustenance nearly impossible.        
	The successful operation by the forces comes at a time militancy-related incidents has shown a further decline this year. The police said 450 such incidents took place between January 1 and November 15 in the state this year compared with 458 in the same period last year.        
	Some 67 civilians had died in militancy-related violence last year; this year, the figure is 40. Police figures show that 217 militants were killed till November 15 this year, against 228 in the same period last year. The police say 400 to 450 militants are active in Jammu and Kashmir now, and that around 100 of them had entered the state this year.        
	However, the biggest challenge for the security forces this year was the summer unrest in the Valley, the bloodiest in two decades with more than 110 dead in firing by the forces.

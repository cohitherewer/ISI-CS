The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu lies low, Cong targets Nitish
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu lies low, Cong targets Nitish
          NALIN VERMA                       Nitish Kumar                          
	Patna, July 16: Lalu Prasad appears to have shed his usual aggression against archrival Nitish Kumars government after a court ordered the CBI to probe an alleged funds scam, but the Congress isnt pulling punches.        
	I too had been framed in the fodder scam in a similar fashion. We are not a party to the petition against them (Nitish and his ministers). Let them clear their position before the court, the RJD boss said today, a day after Patna High Court ordered the investigation into the alleged irregularities, estimated at Rs 11,412 crore.        
	The irregularities are said to have occurred from April 2002 to March 2008 in development programmes such as the rural job plan and the mid-day meal scheme. Lalu Prasads party was in power and his wife Rabri Devi chief minister during much of the period  from April 2002 to March 2005. The Nitish-led NDA came to power in November 2005.        
	Lalu Prasad didnt forget to point out that his rivals in power today had gone after him in the fodder scam. The deputy chief minister, Sushil Modi, and others in power today were petitioners against me.        
	The Congress, though, seemed determined to make the funds row a campaign issue against the Nitish government ahead of the state polls later this year. Party leader and Union minister Sachin Pilot declared he would personally meet and request the Prime Minister to ensure the CBI probe was conducted.         
	Pilot, considered close to Rahul Gandhi who has been working to improve the Congresss stock in Bihar, was here to gear up party workers for the polls.        
	The Centre has given Rs 95,000 crore to Bihar during Nitishs tenure. The people must know that and ask how his government spent the money, Pilot said.        
	Lok Janshakti Party chief and Lalu Prasad ally Ram Vilas Paswan said Nitish should immediately resign, saying the scandal involves over Rs 11,000 crore against only Rs 1,000 crore in the fodder scam.         
	Nitish has not spoken on the matter but his deputy Sushil Modi said the government will make its position clear soon. The court ordered the CBI probe on a PIL.

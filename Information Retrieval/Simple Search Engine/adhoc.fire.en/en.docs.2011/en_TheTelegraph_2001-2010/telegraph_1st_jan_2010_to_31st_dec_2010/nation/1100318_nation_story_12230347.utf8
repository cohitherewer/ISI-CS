The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-bill class leaves BJP cold
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      N-bill class leaves BJP cold
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon today briefed senior BJP leaders on the need to pass the nuclear liability bill but apparently left them unconvinced.        
	The hour-long meeting, coming a day after Menons classroom with Congress leaders, betrayed the Prime Ministers desperation to get the bill passed at the earliest, BJP sources said.        
	Menon is likely to meet Samajwadi Party and Trinamul Congress leaders in the coming days.         
	Trinamul has expressed some reservations about the bill, while it was the Samajwadis about-turn days before the July 2008 trust vote that had broken the Opposition unity against the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	The national security advisers arguments today cut little ice with his listeners  Sushma Swaraj, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Jaitley and Murli Manohar Joshi.         
	A party spokesperson later reaffirmed the BJPs opposition to the bill in its present form.        
	Todays meeting came after a phone call from Manmohan Singh to Swaraj last week seeking her partys support on the bill. The Prime Minister had offered to send Menon to brief BJP leaders.        
	Menon had met Jaitley a month ago to discuss the legislation. However, it was primarily because of the BJPs opposition that the government was forced to delay tabling the bill in Parliament on Monday. The main Opposition partys floor managers had co-ordinated their strategy with the Left and the two Yadavs: Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad.        
	The BJPs opposition to the bill is tinted with a dilemma. On one hand, it needs to lead and keep intact the anti-government opposition in Parliament for the next four years of this Lok Sabhas term. On the other, it has traditionally supported civil nuclear co-operation and related deals.        
	The party is now inclined towards occupying the Opposition space more vociferously, and is unlikely to drop its objections to the bill in a hurry. The BJP is mainly opposed to the low liability of the operator at Rs 500 crore.        
	Yesterday, Menon had briefed Congress leaders, mostly the partys media faces, on the bills advantages.

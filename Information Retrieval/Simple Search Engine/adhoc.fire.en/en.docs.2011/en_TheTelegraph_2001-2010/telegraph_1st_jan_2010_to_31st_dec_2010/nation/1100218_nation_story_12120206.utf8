          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Policemen on guard in Shilda                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 17: The state government has decided to step up security at all strategic installations and start joint operations against Maoists following the terror attack in Pune and Naxalite strike in neighbouring Bengal.        
	The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here last evening to take stock of the law and order situation and the states preparedness to counter any terrorist or Maoist attack.        
	After the Pune blast and the Maoist attack in Bengal, the state government is apparently taking no chances. It has decided to upgrade security at important installations and launch offensive against the Maoists at the earliest. Operation Green Hunt will be launched as soon as the central paramilitary forces arrive in the state, said director-general of intelligence Prakash Mishra.        
	The Centre has agreed to provide an additional eight battalions of central paramilitary forces for the joint operation against the Left-wing extremists. While five battalions of paramilitary forces will be deployed in south Orissa, another three battalions will be allotted for northern and western parts of the state.        
	Mishra said security forces had been alerted in Orissa after the Midnapore incident. Security has been beefed up in and around all the strategic and vulnerable locations, a senior police officer said.        
	Several strategic defence establishments, including the interim test range and archaeological monuments like Jagannath temple in Puri, are located in Orissa. The state has also a 480km long porous coastline vulnerable to the terrorist attack.         
	Besides, at least 16 out of 30 districts have been identified as Maoists-affected areas.

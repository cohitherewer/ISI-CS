	Srinagar, Sept. 15: The deadly virus of violence today crossed over from Kashmir to Muslim-majority districts in Jammu where security forces opened fire on protesters, killing four of them.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs promise of a healing touch had little effect in Jammus Poonch district where there were huge protests against the alleged desecration of the Quran in the US and the civilian killings in Kashmir. The toll in the three-month-long unrest in the Valley now stands at 93.        
	These are the first killings in Jammu. They have taken place at a time Hindu groups in the region are bracing for a showdown against any proposed withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or any political package for the state.        
	Police sources claimed the protesters were killed in Mendhar area after a large group assembled outside a missionary school and tried to set it on fire. Fierce clashes ensued, in which 15 protesters and 30 policemen were injured. The protesters also torched eight government buildings.        
	Curfew has been clamped in the township and the army requested to help maintain law and order.        
	Khalid Hussain, a Mendhar resident, claimed the protesters had been demonstrating peacefully when security forces used brute force to disperse them. We had assembled near the school. Perhaps worried that we may target it, they (security forces) opened fire at us.        
	Poonch police chief Manmohan Singh, however, said the protesters had tried to torch the school. Sources said the school was intact but the government buildings had been burnt down.        
	There have been protests in all Muslim-majority districts of Jammu  Poonch, Rajouri, Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban  to express solidarity with the Kashmiris.        
	Public opinion in the Jammu region about the Valley unrest is, however, divided on communal lines. Hindus are a majority in Jammu but Muslims outnumber other communities in five of its 10 districts.        
	The Sangharsh Samiti, a new avatar of the Shri Amarnath Sangarsh Samiti that spearheaded the Amarnath land agitation in 2008, is strongly opposed to any concession to the Kashmir-centric groups. Yesterday, it threatened to launch an agitation if the Armed Forces Special Powers Act was diluted.         
	We believe the turmoil in Kashmir is because of non-governance. Omar Abdullah is advocating the agenda of the separatists and anti-national forces, a samiti spokesperson said.        
	Snub to talks offer        
	Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani tonight said the separatists were not willing to talk to any team from Delhi.        
	We will not meet any delegation. Unless there is positive movement on our demands, there is no question of being part of any dialogue process, he said.        
	Geelani has proposed five conditions for participating in talks: accepting Kashmir as an international dispute, withdrawing troops, releasing prisoners, revoking special powers to forces and punishment to security forces involved in killings.        
	A moderate Hurriyat leader said: It is New Delhi s old formula to hold these meetings to prolong the deadlock in the expectation that it will tire the people. We have been part of a dialogue process in the past but that only eroded our credibility. Joining any such process now will be suicidal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya calls for Raja arrest
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jaya calls for Raja arrest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Jayalalithaa                          
	Chennai, Nov. 15: Jayalalithaa today demanded that former telecom minister A. Raja be arrested and prosecuted in the 2G spectrum scam and that his resignation be treated only as the beginning of a probe into it.        
	Rajas resignation does not signal the end of the mother of all scams. It is only the beginning, the AIADMK leader, enthused by Rajas resignation, said in a statement.        
	She claimed the government had lost an unprecedented Rs 1,76,379 crore by the alleged sale of the spectrum at lower-than-market rates in 2008, and that Raja and persons close to him, particularly the Karunanidhi family, had gained from the shady deals.        
	Raja himself should be charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act and should be arrested and tried for perpetrating the biggest scam in the history of mankind. The money trail has to be traced and every single person who has gained out of this scam should be made accountable and should be proceeded against, the statement said.        
	Claiming some credit for Rajas ouster  Jayalalithaa had offered support to the Congress in case the DMK pulled out  she praised the outcome as a victory for democracy as the opposition and the media had contributed to it. Her words came as a welcome change because she had once said she did not need the media for her politics. She had even filed a slew of defamation cases against the media when she was Tamil Nadu chief minister.        
	Jayalalithaas offer was more a question to the Congress on what was stopping them from acting against Raja in spite of so much of evidence, Thuglak editor Cho Ramaswamy said.        
	She exposed their weakness in tackling the DMK. Her offer of support actually jolted the Congress into some kind of action since she had made the party look bad in the eyes of the public by its perceived weakness in dealing with a corrupt ally.        
	Jayalalithaa is expected to keep up the pressure on the Karunanidhi family, with Madurai city gearing up for the wedding of Union minister M.K. Alagiris son Dayanidhi on Thursday.        
	If the DMK goes overboard with that wedding, like Jayalalithaa did with her foster sons wedding in 1995, it would only further harden public perception against the ruling party, a Congress leader said.        
	Had Raja not resigned, Jayalalithaas offer of support would have been seen as a sign of her desperation to wean the Congress away from the DMK fold. Now, however, it looks like a tactical masterstroke.        
	The average Tamil would perceive that Raja resigned only after our leader made that dramatic announcement on TV. Even if the Congress does not come to our side, weve scored an important psychological victory over the DMK, an AIADMK MP said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish to march for trust
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish to march for trust
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish Kumar: A new journey                                  
	Patna, April 13: First it was a dhanyavad yatra , then a vikas yatra . Now, Nitish Kumar is all set to embark on a vishwas yatra .        
	The rally, sources say, will mark the Bihar chief ministers journey to come back to power after the Assembly polls scheduled in October or November.         
	Though he is yet to declare the date, sources close to him said Nitish would begin his meticulously planned vishwas yatra in the last week of this month.         
	According to reports, Nitish has planned to tour the hinterlands in all 38 districts and interact directly with the people before the Election Commission notifies the Assembly polls and clamps the model code of conduct.        
	The JD(U) leader has also planned night halts at every district headquarters. He will explain to the people what his government has done for them in the past four-and-a-half years and what it wishes to do if it comes back to power. I will also ask the voters to tell us what were our shortcomings. The people are the ultimate masters in democracy and as such, I will put myself and my work under their scrutiny, Nitish told The Telegraph.        
	In fact, soon after unsettling the 15-year Lalu-Rabri regime in November 2005, Nitish had announced: I will go to the masses at the end of my present tenure and ask them to vote for me only if I felt that I have delivered the things for which they voted me to power. If I feel that I have not been bale to fulfil their expectations, I will not join the fray.        
	Ahead of embarking on the campaign, Nitish also seemed to try to bridge the gap between him and party president Sharad Yadav.         
	There is only an honest difference of opinion between Sharadji and me on the issue of womens bill. Sharad Yadav wants a quota within the quota. I also favour it. The only difference is that I believe that we should not oppose the passage of the bill. It will be sorted out very soon, he added.        
	Nitish, it seems, wants to make peace with his rivals too. His advice to Union home minister P. Chidambaram to speak less and work more struck a bitter chord between the two leaders on the issue of Naxalism.        
	But the chief minister clarified: The media has presented my statement as if I have snubbed Chidambaram. It is totally wrong, for I have high regard for the Union home minister. Who am I to give him suggestions?                    
	He explained that what he meant to say that there should not be media hype about the sensitive operations against the rebels. The hype and sabre-rattling on such sensitive issues usually prove counter-productive. I had stated it in a very mild and amicable manner, he added.

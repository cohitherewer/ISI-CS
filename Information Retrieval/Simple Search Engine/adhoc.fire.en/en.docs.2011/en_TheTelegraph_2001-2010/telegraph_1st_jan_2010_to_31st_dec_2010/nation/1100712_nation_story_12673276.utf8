The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan for talks in jail with rebel leaders
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plan for talks in jail with rebel leaders
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, July 11: The Centre has decided to hold talks with incarcerated leaders of northeastern militant outfits in special jails, thus ruling out the possibility of releasing them for starting a dialogue.         
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai today told The Telegraph there was no impediment to holding talks even if the leaders were in jail since the exercise could be conducted at venues which may be designated as special jails where they may be shifted for the purpose.         
	However, the process of shifting the leaders to a special jail would involve the judiciary, which has to give permission to move out anyone in judicial custody. The step would meet halfway the demand from various quarters and the jailed leaders themselves for their release for talks.         
	Holding the leaders in these special jails would mean they are not in prisons and yet they would remain in custody. Any venue can be designated as a special jail and the talks can be held there, Pillai said, when asked if talks with the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) could be held now that the outfits top two leaders  chairman Jewel Gorlosa and commander-in-chief Niranjan Hojai  had been arrested.         
	While Gorlosa was arrested from Bangalore in June last year and is currently in jail, Hojai is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency following his arrest on July 1 from Motihari in Bihar.         
	Hojais seven-day custody expires tomorrow.         
	Pillai said the same formula would apply to Ulfa leaders as well. Asked if there had been any communication with the DHD (J) or the Ulfa leaders about the move, he said: We will wait for these things.         
	Nekibur Zaman, a senior advocate, said any place could be designated a special jail under special circumstances and jailed persons may be shifted there.

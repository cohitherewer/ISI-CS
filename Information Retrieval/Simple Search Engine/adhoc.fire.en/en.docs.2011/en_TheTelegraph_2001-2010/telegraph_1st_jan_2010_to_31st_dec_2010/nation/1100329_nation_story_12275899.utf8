The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rebel threat mail in Naveen inbox
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rebel threat mail in Naveen inbox
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen: Scared?                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 28: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has received an email, threatening to blow up Naveen Nivas and several other important places in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri.        
	The mail landed in chief ministers official id last evening from plgaorissa.gov.in.        
	Signed by the central military commission of the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), the mail threatened to blow up Naveen Nivas and target several offices in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri, said a senior official.        
	The guerrillas have threatened to target the secretariat, offices of the commissioner of police, police headquarters in Cuttack, armoury of 6th Battalion of Orissa Special Armed Police, Orissa Computer Application Centre, Grid Corporation of Orissa, Nalco and Biju Patnaik University of Technology. With the beginning of Operation Greenhunt, we will start simultaneous attacks on Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri, the mail reads.        
	The email asked the chief minister not to rejoice over the additional deployment of the central paramilitary force, as it was short-lived. The Maoists said they had better weapons and far more modernised machinery to target the force and the corrupt system. The rebels have also taken the responsibility of hacking the government website on March 11. The cyber security system of the state portal and other e-governance system was very weak, said the email.        
	Referring to the injuries sustained by rebel leaders Kishan and Bikram, it said: We will answer to every bullet that hit them.        
	We are verifying the authenticity and the real source of the mail, a senior police officer said.        
	I hope the police will be able to come up with results soon, Naveen said today.        
	On January 25, the chief ministers office had received an email threatening to release Subhashree, the wife of most wanted Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda or face dire consequences. The sender was arrested later.

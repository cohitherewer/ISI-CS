          SANJAY K. JHA                           Manmohan Singh at a news conference in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, May 24: If Manmohan Singh now appears more prime ministerial, both in terms of command and stature, the credit should go to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party leaders have suggested.        
	In the Congress culture of intrigues and conspiracies, Sonias unwavering faith in the leader who scarcely enjoyed support within the party has ensured the success of an extraordinary arrangement that initially appeared unsustainable.        
	Senior Congress leaders fully endorsed the Prime Ministers assertion at his news conference today that there was no mistrust or distrust between him and Sonia, and said his position would be unassailable as long as the understanding between the two remained as it was. The leaders agreed that attempts were made to create bitterness, but Sonia refused to change the opinion about her choice that had left many aspirants bitter in 2004.        
	Insiders have denied the impression that the relationship between the two leaders had changed in UPA-II and that differences over issues such as the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement, dilution of the Right to Information Act, food security bill and womens reservation had sown the seeds of discord.         
	Vested interests, especially those who are not part of the existing leadership structure, secretly tried to strengthen such a perception, but Sonia herself never dropped any hint of her displeasure with the Prime Minister.         
	The two leaders religiously honoured the division of work; while Sonia didnt try to encroach upon the Prime Ministers domain, Singh kept away from political and organisational decisions.         
	The revival of National Advisory Council (NAC) bolstered the perception of the divide. Many Congress leaders privately admitted that the purpose of the NAC in 2004 was entirely different from that in 2010. One senior leader had said earlier: If Sonia wanted to strengthen the hands of the Prime Minister in 2004, she revived the NAC to put curbs on him in 2010.         
	But now, the Prime Minister has emphatically said the NAC plays an effective role as it gives a perspective to the developments in the social sector. One Congress functionary dismissed the suggestion the Sonia-headed NAC was meant to rein in Singh. It is ridiculous to think that the Prime Minister will get upset to grant an NAC (post) to Sonia who has given him the reins of the whole country, the functionary said.         
	Asked about the perceived tension between the two, he said: What for? Does Sonia gain anything by weakening her own government? As far as issues are concerned, it is her job to take a holistic view as party president while the Prime Minister will respond according to the administrative and financial compulsions. This is not to be seen as conflict.        
	In fact, the bonding between the two has matured with rise of Rahul Gandhi, who himself holds Singh in high esteem. There are other factors that have enhanced the Prime Ministers authority, providing UPA II with a much stronger centre of gravity. If one veteran, Arjun Singh, who was seen as someone destabilising Singh, is out of scene, the other veteran, Pranab Mukherjee, is working in harmony with the Prime Minister.        
	Ministers say the most striking feature of the cabinet meetings is the understanding Singh has with Mukherjee, who has gone out of his way to manage every crisis of the UPA II government  from the IPL row to the cut motion.

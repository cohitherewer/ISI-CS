	Mumbai, Sept. 26 (PTI): Bombay High Court has upheld a disciplinary committees decision to censure a civil judge for puffing away in the Bar room with lawyers, reporting late, and allowing his birthday celebrations on the premises.        
	The penalty imposed on S.B. Kulkarni by the five-judge high court panel is minor and fully justified, a division bench of Justices S.B.H. Marlapalle and Amjad Sayed said while hearing an appeal by the judge last week.        
	Kulkarni, currently presiding over a Buldana civil court, was censured in February this year by the committee on a complaint filed by lawyers.        
	There is material (evidence) to hold that the judge occupies seat on the dais for a limited time. He spends much time during working hours in the diwani room (Bar room) with lawyers and smokes in the office. This conduct of the judge is against judicial discipline, the inquiry report by the committee said.        
	The committee also found it objectionable that the birthday celebrations of Kulkarni had been held on the court premises, although there was nothing on record to show that the programme was organised at his behest.        
	Still, the panel felt he should not have allowed such personal events to be held there. The judge should not have allowed the birthday celebrations to be held on the court premises during working hours, the committee said.        
	The division bench did not agree with the arguments put forward by Kulkarnis counsel, Anil Anturkar, that smoking and chatting with lawyers could not be regarded as acts of misconduct.

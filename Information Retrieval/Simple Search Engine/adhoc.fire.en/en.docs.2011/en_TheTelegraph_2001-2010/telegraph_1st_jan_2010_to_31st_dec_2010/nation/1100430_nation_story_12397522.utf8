	Tamluk, April 29: Police today dispersed labourers loyal to the Trinamul Congress who had been protesting the entry of cargo-handling machines inside the Haldia docks for the past four months and escorted 15 dumpers into the complex.        
	Around 3am today, nearly 400 policemen, led by district superintendent of police Ashok Biswas, escorted the dumpers to the gate of the docks but were stopped by around 300 labourers.        
	The labourers hurled bricks at the police. Seven policemen were injured.         
	Twenty workers were injured in the police cane-charge that followed.         
	Labourers belonging to the Trinamul union at the Haldia docks have been agitating since December against the use of machines for cargo handling because they believe over 2,000 people will lose their jobs.        
	The dumpers are owned by a Mumbai-based firm, ABG Group, which has signed a deal with port authorities to handle cargo with the help of cranes, payloaders and dumpers.         
	The company had in December managed to skirt protesters and send six cranes, 26 payloaders and two bulldozers to the docks by ship. But the protesters have stopped 50 dumpers, which arrived by road, from entering the docks.        
	On March 26, 37 dumpers at a garage in Haldia town were found immobilised with sand in their fuel tanks after an agitation there by Trinamul workers.        
	Since then, the Trinamul-affiliated labourers have been guarding the gate of the Haldia docks round the clock to prevent the company from bringing in dumpers and other machinery for cargo handling.         
	We have been asked by Calcutta High Court to escort the dumpers to the docks. So, we dispersed the agitators and took the dumpers into the dock complex, Biswas said.        
	An ABG official said: We will have to take in 35 more dumpers into the dock complex. We will take them in with police escort soon.         
	Madan Pal, the secretary of the Trinamul-affiliated labour union at the dock complex, claimed that the party had been carrying out a peaceful movement against mechanical handling of cargo at the docks.         
	Around 2,500 labourers are involved in loading and unloading cargo at the Haldia docks. If mechanical handling of cargo is introduced, over 2,000 people will lose their jobs, Pal said.

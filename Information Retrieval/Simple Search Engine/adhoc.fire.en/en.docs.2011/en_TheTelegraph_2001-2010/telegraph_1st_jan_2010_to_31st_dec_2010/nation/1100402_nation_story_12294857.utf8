The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister on dance duty
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minister on dance duty
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Malviya (in red turban) at the fair                                  
	Jaipur, April 1: One dance step too many has landed in a jam a Rajasthan minister, who has been absent from the Assembly for almost three weeks.         
	Tribal development minister Mahendrajit Singh Malviya has been on medical leave from the Assembly for two weeks from March 12, citing a stomach ailment.        
	Although he has been attending his office, programmes, functions and even local fairs, the minister has failed to turn up at the House to answer queries.        
	Malviya, 50, reportedly also went on an adventure trip in a balloon at the Bhaironji ka Mela in Bhawanpura, in southern Rajasthan on the Gujarat border, and was seen dancing with the local people.         
	All this while, Malviya did not apply for leave extension and failed to attend the House.        
	The Opposition BJP today brought a privilege motion against the minister, saying his continued absence amounts to contempt of the House as the minister is attending all other functions, hosting official meetings at the secretariat and even grooving at local functions.        
	Malviya, a tribal from Banswara, 527km from Jaipur, is said to be close to Union minister C.P. Joshi and chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who has entrusted the upcoming leader with additional charge of technical, public grievance and engineering education.        
	Malviya, whose wife is a zila pramukh, is quite popular among the local tribals and actively participates in most functions.         
	Sources in Banswara said he has been attending cultural programmes daily between March 15 and March 30, when he was supposed to be on leave.        
	On March 29, the sources added, at a tribal fair in Bhawanpura, the minister himself took up the dafli and swayed continuously to the accompaniment of the dhol and nagara.        
	The hyper active minister has made the BJP see red.        
	Deputy leader of Opposition Ghanshyam Tiwari brought up the issue during Question Hour today, saying the minister is misleading the Assembly, claiming he is ill, but is surprisingly well enough to attend all other programmes.        
	Intervening, Speaker Deependra Singh Shekhawat said he would talk to the minister before proceeding. Home minister Shanti Dhariwal sprang to Malviyas defence, saying his doctor in Ahmedabad had advised operation for ulcer, which would take a little time.        
	Malviya was not available for comment, but Congress chief whip Virendra Beniwal said the minister was unwell and the doctor had advised him not to sit in the House for long stretches but had permitted him to attend other functions.

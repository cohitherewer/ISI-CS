	New Delhi, April 3 (PTI): Karnataka High Court chief justice P.D. Dinakaran, whose elevation to the Supreme Court was stalled by land-grab allegations, has been asked to go on leave.        
	The decision against the 59-year-old judge was taken a few days ago by the apex court. Justice Dinakaran has not been performing any judicial work since December after more than 100 MPs moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha for his impeachment, sources said.        
	The collegium has cleared the acting chief justice of Delhi High Court, Madan B. Lokur, to be appointed chief justice of Karnataka High Court, the sources added.        
	Putte Gowda, president of Karnataka High Court bar association welcomed the decision of the collegium to appoint the new chief justice.         
	Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari had admitted the MPs motion in December seeking Justice Dinakarans removal on charges of corruption, land-grab and abuse of office. The judge has denied all the allegations.        
	The impeachment motion accuses Justice Dinakaran of possessing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income, unlawfully securing five housing board plots in the name of his wife and daughters, entering into benami transactions, and acquiring and possessing agricultural holdings beyond the land ceiling.        
	The other charges relate to illegal encroachment on government and public property, thus depriving Dalits and other poor families of their livelihood; violation of human rights of the backward classes and the poor; and destruction of evidence during an official inquiry.

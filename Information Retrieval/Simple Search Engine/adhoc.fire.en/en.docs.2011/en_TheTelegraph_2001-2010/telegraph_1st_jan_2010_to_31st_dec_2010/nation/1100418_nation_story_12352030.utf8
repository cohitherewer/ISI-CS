The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cannes red carpet quiz: What will Freida wear?
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cannes red carpet quiz: What will Freida wear?
          AMIT ROY                          Freida Pinto (right) with her Slumdog Millionaire co-star Dev Patel                                  
	London, April 17: The Cannes conundrum this year is whether Freida Pinto will wear something Indian when she graces the red carpet during the worlds most glamorous film festival next month.        
	In the past, the Slumdog Millionaire actress had defended her decision not to wear a sari on the grounds she was too young.        
	She has also discounted reports she is being lined up to play a Bond girl.        
	It was very flattering, she has been quoted as saying. I dont know if I would have done it. I am too young to be a Bond girl and you need someone more mature and beautiful than me.        
	Freida is almost certain to come to Cannes as part of the cast of Woody Allens new film You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger, which was shot in London and also stars Naomi Watts, Anthony Hopkins and Anna Friel.        
	The film, which features Anupam Kher as the father of the character played by Freida, is being shown out of competition.        
	Since Allen, who has a habit of making divas of his female actresses  Penelope Cruz is an example  went out of his way to pick Freida after the Oscar triumph of Slumdog Millionaire, he will definitely want the one-time Mumbai model to make an impression in Cannes during the festival from May 12-23.        
	I met her at the wrap party after Slumdog Millionaire had finished filming in Bombay (three years ago), recalled Shekhar Kapur, who, it was announced on Thursday, will be on the Cannes jury.        
	She was a shy girl who had done some modelling and spoke to me about her hopes for her career, Shekhar remembered. Who has not heard of her now?        
	Last year, Sharmila Tagore, on being picked for the Cannes jury, promised The Telegraph she would wear only saris. She was as good as her word.                  Shekhar Kapur      
	So what would Shekhar wear?        
	You know me, he said on Thursday, I am a bohemian.        
	As an afterthought, Shekhar, who has directed films as varied as Bandit Queen and Elizabeth, added: Perhaps I will ask some people (designers) to make me a few things.        
	Shekhar disclosed he was invited to be on the Cannes jury two weeks ago.        
	I have been on several juries  Bafta, Marrakech, Tokyo  but there is something special about Cannes. I am honoured.        
	He explained his sense of excitement: The great thing is being able to see three or four films a day. It is a tough job because you have to leave your prejudices behind and give yourself to a film.        
	Two other much anticipated films will be screened officially but out of competition. The festival will open with Ridley Scotts Robin Hood, with Russell Crowe cast as the outlaw, while Oliver Stones Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps will close Cannes.        
	Shekhars fellow jurors will include British actress Kate Beckinsale, Italian actress Giovanna Mezzogiorno, French writer-director Emmanuel Carrere, Puerto Rican-American actor Benicio Del Toro, Spanish director Victor Erice and director of Italys national cinema museum Alberto Barbera.        
	The president, announced some weeks ago, will be American filmmaker Tim Burton.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist top gun shot dead
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, March 12: Police today gunned down a top-rung Maoist leader in Andhra Pradesh, who carried a reward similar to that on offer for Telugu Deepak, the arrested Naxalite leader in charge of Bengal operations.         
	Shakamuri Appa Rao, a member of the central committee as well as the state committee of the CPI (Maoist), was shot dead in an encounter in the Nallamala forests in Prakasham district, about 435km southeast of Hyderabad. Appa Rao, 50, who used the aliases Ravi and Venkanna, carried a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head, the same as that offered by the state for Deepak, an Andhra Maoist leader who had shifted base to Bengal and was the architect of the military campaigns there. Deepak was arrested in Calcutta on March 2, weeks after the massacre of security personnel in a camp at Shilda in Maoist-infested West Midnapore district.         
	Appa Raos death was a double whammy for the Maoists in Andhra following the gunning down of another senior leader Kondal Reddy, alias Tech Ramanna, in the Tadavai forests of Warangal district.        
	Police said a team of Naxalite hunters spotted four or five guerrillas atop a hillock near Netikonda village, deep inside the Nallamala forests, early this morning. A combing team cited four or five Maoists atop a small hillock in the forests and surrounded it. One activist was killed in the exchange of fire and later identified as Shakamuri Appa Rao, said Prakasham superintendent of police V. Naveenchand.        
	The police recovered an AK-47 rifle and several documents on Maoist activities in the state from the hilltop den.

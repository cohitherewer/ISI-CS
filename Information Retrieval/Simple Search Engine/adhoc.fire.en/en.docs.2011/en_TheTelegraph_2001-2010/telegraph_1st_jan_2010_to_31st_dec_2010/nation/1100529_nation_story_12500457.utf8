	Midnapore, May 28: Of the 146 injured admitted to Kharagpur and Midnapore hospitals, a two-year-old boy caught chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees attention. His parents had not been traced till tonight.        
	The chief minister told a patient who has volunteered to look after the baby as long as she is in the hospital to take good care of him. We must trace his family, he said.        
	Another victim, S3 passenger Asit Baran Roy, who had suffered multiple injuries, was flown to Kharagpur and then driven to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. He is recovering after surgery and transfusion of three units of blood, but his wife is among the 80 dead.        
	Railway medical officers said 77 passengers had been admitted to Kharagpur Railway Hospital, 27 to Kharagpur Subdivisional Hospital and 42 to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital.        
	Bhattacharjee said that if the victims wished, they could be shifted to Calcutta.        
	 We were alerted at 3.30am and asked to set up treatment facilities. Our teams were ready by 5am, said medical college superintendent Parthapratim Pradhan. The injured began arriving from 6.05am.        
	Most have suffered multiple injuries and fractures. A team of 45 doctors, nurses and technicians, most of whom had just finished night shift, attended to the victims. We carried out 25 emergency operations, Pradhan said.        
	The cost of treatment is being borne by the hospital. Several junior doctors took the initiative to arrange for emergency medicines.        
	Only 14 bodies have been identified so far. We are collecting DNA samples from all the bodies, Pradhan said.        
	Most of the relatives and friends of the dead who turned up at the morgue said the bodies were mangled beyond recognition. Trinamul leader and Union minister Sisir Adhikari, Congress leader Manas Bhuniya and CPM ministers Asim Dasgupta and Subhas Naskar visited the injured.

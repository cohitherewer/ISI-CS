The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Munde joins   OBC chorus
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Munde joins   OBC chorus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 11: Gopinath Munde has lent his voice to the growing clamour within the BJP for a sub-quota for the Other Backward Classes in the womens reservation bill.        
	What makes Mundes demand particularly serious is that he is the deputy parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha, and that his stance is at odds with that of Sushma Swaraj, his immediate boss in the House. Sushma is one of the bills principal promoters, along with Sonia Gandhi and Brinda Karat.        
	Munde, the MP from Beed in Maharashtra and himself an OBC, raised the issue in Mumbai yesterday at an OBC forum convened by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal.        
	People raised questions on why there was no separate quota for OBC women. I said I fully appreciate your sentiment and go along with it. But the BJP and the NCP had backed the bill as it was in the Rajya Sabha, Munde told The Telegraph.        
	Asked if he would defy the party line in the Lok Sabha, he said: I know what my party line is but in the next meeting, I will bring up the sub-quota issue and seek an answer from the leaders.        
	An aide to Nitin Gadkari said the BJP president was aware of the statement but hadnt spoken to Munde yet. He said Gadkaris view was that the BJP would give 27 per cent tickets to the OBCs in an election instead of seeking to legislate a sub-quota.        
	There is no provision in the Constitution for an OBC quota. Let the bill be passed and we will internally earmark a sub-quota for OBC women. Remember, our president gave 33 per cent representation to women in party posts, the aide said.        
	Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said Mundes view was personal and not a dissenting opinion.        
	It was a community forum. He respected the sentiments expressed therein, she said.        
	Thirty of the BJPs 116 Lok Sabha MPs are OBCs. Many feel that the views of such a large block cannot be ignored, particularly with elections approaching in Bihar, where the party is part of the ruling coalition.

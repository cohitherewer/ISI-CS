          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, June 25: Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi today rejoined chief minister Nitish Kumars Vishwas Yatra, signalling possible progress in the patch-up efforts between the states ruling allies.        
	The BJPs Sushil Modi had refused to accompany Nitish, the Janata Dal (United) chief, on the yatra on June 20 to protest the chief ministers move to return the Kosi flood relief cheque of Rs 5 crore to Narendra Modi.        
	Nitish had objected to ads by BJP supporters showing him with the riot-tainted Gujarat chief minister and was said to have asked the BJP not to send him to campaign for the Bihar polls later this year.        
	I am happy the deputy chief minister is accompanying me, Nitish said as he boarded a helicopter with Sushil Modi today.

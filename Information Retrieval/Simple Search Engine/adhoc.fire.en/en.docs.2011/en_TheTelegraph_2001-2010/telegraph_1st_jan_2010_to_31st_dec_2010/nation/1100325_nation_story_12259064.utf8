          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 24: In their desperate bid to halt Operation Greenhunt, Maoists again ran amok last night, killing three policemen and injuring around 10 in Orissas Gajapati district, about 300km from here.        
	The rebels opened fire on a group of Special Operations Group (SOG) personnel who were on their way to raid a Naxalite camp in the Ambajhari forest in the districts Gumma block.        
	A team of 30 SOG jawans left for the area to launch a raid late last night. While they continued moving forward on foot, guerrillas ambushed them and opened fire. In retaliation, the policemen engaged the rebels for three hours in gun battle.        
	Two SOG personnel  Balram Pradhan and Dipak Sambhoi  and a local policeman, Sanjit Tirkey, were killed, inspector-general of police Sanjeev Marik said.        
	While Tirkey belonged to the district voluntary force, Sanbhoi and Pradhan were SOG personnel.         
	Ten other policemen have sustained bullet injuries. Of them, four critically injured jawans  Upendra Sabar, Krupasindhu Pradhan, Rajesh Munda and Pradip Sethi  have been shifted to Visakhapatnam. No information was available about any casualty among the rebels.        
	DIG (southwest) R.K. Sharma and Gajapati superintendent of police Sanjeeb Arora immediately rushed to the spot.         
	The slained jawans were accorded guard of honour at Parlekhamundi this afternoon after which the bodies were sent to their respective villages.         
	It is very tragic. But it wont have any effect on the anti-Maoist operations as a whole. The combing operations will continue, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik.        
	The rebels also tried to blow up three cellphone towers at Adaba and Birikot in Malkangiris Mohana block early this morning.        
	In a separate incident, about 20 Naxalites swooped on the pumping station of Essar Steel Limited in Chitrakonda in Malkangiri just after midnight today. They set the pumping station and two vehicles parked outside on fire. The guerrillas also fell trees along the way and left behind posters, asking local villagers not to work in the company, which was attacked by the rebels for the fourth time.

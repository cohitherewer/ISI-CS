  - duo could create disruption, say police          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Himangshu Ray, Mumbais joint commissioner of police, shows the pictures of Kalimuddin Khan and Hafiz Shareef. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Sept. 10: Mumbai police today released pictures of two terrorists believed to be in the city and appealed to people to be watchful as they celebrate Id-ul-Fitr and Ganesh Chaturthi tomorrow.        
	The duo, one from Pakistan and the other from Bangladesh, are suspected to belong to the Lashkar-e-Toiba or the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jihad al-Islami. Home ministry sources said they were in Maharashtra and may have been tasked to create disruptions in crowded areas, especially religious places.        
	This is the first time that the police have sought public support to track down terrorists. Kalimuddin Khan, 25, and Hafiz Shareef, 22, apparently sneaked into the city a fortnight ago.        
	We want to enlist the support of the public, so we are releasing these two pictures. These men are in Mumbai right now, with express orders from the Lashkar top guard to create disruption, especially in crowded areas or places of religious significance, Himangshu Ray, Mumbais joint commissioner of police, said at a news conference this afternoon.        
	There may also be an attempt to disrupt communal harmony tomorrow or later.        
	People have been asked to report to the nearest police station or dial helplines if they spot any of them. Special police teams have been constituted and closed-circuit televisions installed at public places.        
	We have set up dedicated helplines for the public to call us if they see these men. We will ask cinema halls to flash their pictures during intervals and at the beginning of shows, a Mumbai anti-terrorist squad source said.        
	The home ministry has shared intelligence inputs about the duo with other states because tomorrow is also the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The decision to release the duos pictures was Maharashtra chief minister, Ashok Chavans.        
	Police sources said the state intelligence unit first stumbled on information about the two while questioning Mirza Himayat Baig, the alleged Maharashtra Lashkar chief arrested this week in connection with the German Bakery blast. Soon after, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and RAW confirmed their presence.        
	The source said it was only two days ago that an informer had found out the names of the two. We found their pictures as carried on their LeT membership forms with the help of other intelligence agencies. We cross-checked them with IB and RAW before releasing them.         
	The source said the two were part of a module. It is not clear if the module is based in Mumbai. We do not know if these two have associates who have entered Mumbai or plan to do so.        
	Because of a technical glitch, the Mumbai police website is carrying pictures of wanted criminals Ali Ahmed Manu Miah and Salim Rahim Khan against the names of Kalimuddin Khan and Hafiz Shareef.        
	It is a technical error. Please dont nitpick about small things when there is such a big task at hand, a police officer said.

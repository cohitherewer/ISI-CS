          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 1: The commissionerate of police has decided to ban marriage processions on main roads in the city to end traffic chaos.        
	Commissioner of police B.K. Sharma said: The prohibition on the arterial roads is part of a detailed plan of measures, which are being adopted in phases to tackle traffic anarchy. The stretches on which grant of licence for marriage processions will not be allowed are being finalised.        
	According to sources, the ban is likely to be imposed on stretches like Badambadi-Dolamundai, Ranihat-Buxibazar, Bajrakabati Road, Jail Road, Dargha Bazar and Balu Bazaar. Licences for marriage processions would also not be granted on the stretch of national highway that runs through the city.        
	Stringent conditions have also been drawn up for issuing licence for marriage processions on other roads. The span of processions have been restricted to 500m while to check noise pollution crackers have been banned and bands are expected to limit themselves to emitting sound not more than 65 decibels.        
	If any procession is found violating the conditions, the person in whose name the licence was issued will be booked on the spot and the procession detained, Sharma warned.        
	Orissa High Court has been monitoring measures to improve traffic system in the city as part of a PIL. With the number of vehicles on the Cuttack roads increasing every day, along with a increasing population and space crunch, the traffic system in the Silver City has gone for a toss, the PIL had alleged.        
	The high court had expressed concern over the traffic system in Cuttack and in a set of orders directed the police commissionerate to take steps to deal with the traffic problem.

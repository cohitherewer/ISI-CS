The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist talks hint 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist talks hint 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 9: Months after the killing of top gun Azad in the forests of Adilabad in Andhra Pradesh and several setbacks in Dandakaranya, the Maoist leadership has renewed efforts for peace negotiations with the Centre.         
	In an interview with a Telugu news channel, CPI (Maoist) chief Ganapati alias Muppala Lakshman Rao said: We might have lost battles and taken casualties but we are not wiped out yet, as claimed by the government forces.         
	The 56-year-old Maoist boss said his organisation was keen to revive efforts for peace talks, a process abruptly stalled after the encounter killing of central committee member Azad alias Cherukuri Raj Kumar in July.         
	In all fairness, the announcement of a judicial inquiry into the encounter death of Azad is the right thing for the government to reassure us that they are serious about talks, he said in the voice interview.         
	The Centre should create a healthy environment for talks by ordering a judicial inquiry into Azads death, withdrawing Green Hunt forces and creating a democratic environment.         
	Azad was caught in Nagpur when he was on his way to deliver Swami Agniveshs letter seeking ceasefire from July 15 to 20 and a 72-hour no- fire period, Ganapati claimed, adding the superb negotiator was killed brutally.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram was not keen on peace talks and was only using Swami Agnivesh to buy time to regroup the security forces being sent to Dandakaranya, he alleged.         
	Ganapati accepted that the Maoists had suffered serial setbacks in the past few months but insisted: Our following among youths, women, farmers, low income groups and middle classes is still vibrant. All six front organisations of the CPI (Maoist) were active, he said.

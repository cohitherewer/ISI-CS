          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today visited flood-ravaged Leh and announced a Rs 125-crore package to rebuild houses damaged by the August 7 cloudburst.        
	Actor Aamir Khan also flew in with a pledge to bring back the smiles on the faces of all students of Druk White Lotus or Rancho School, where he had shot a sequence of his film 3 Idiots.        
	Singh, who assured the flood victims that the Centre, the Kashmir government and the Leh Hill Council would work together to rehabilitate them, said many precious lives had been lost. Some 200 people died in the cloudburst and 70 are still missing.         
	Hospitals, schools, electricity connections and roads will be rebuilt and all rehabilitation work will be completed within the next two-and-a-half months and before the onset of winter, the Prime Minister said. Funds will not be a problem.         
	Singh, who visited the worst-affected Zanak-Maney locality of Choglamsar, also announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the next of kin of each of those who died and Rs 50,000 for the injured.         
	Aamir promised to spearhead a campaign to raise funds. Apart from my personal contribution, we all have to contribute as a country, he said.        
	Leh Hill Council chairman Tsering Dorjey said Aamir would visit the school tomorrow.

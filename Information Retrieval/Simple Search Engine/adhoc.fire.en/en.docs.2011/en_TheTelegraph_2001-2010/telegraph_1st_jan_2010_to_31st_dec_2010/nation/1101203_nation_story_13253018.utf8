The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi BPO rape suspects caught
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi BPO rape suspects caught
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Two of the rape accused being taken to a court in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Two youths, who police claimed were serial rapists, were arrested in Haryana today for allegedly raping a BPO employee from Mizoram last month.        
	Both Shamshad, 28, and Usman, 30, were involved in other rape cases, said Delhi police commissioner B.K. Gupta. Their names apparently figure in three cases of rape, all committed in Delhi. The police said Mewat district in Haryana was their hideout.        
	Gupta said: It was a blind case as we did not have enough clues. We employed 300 policemen, among them several senior officers.        
	On November 23 midnight, the woman from Mizoram and a colleague were dropped by their BPOs pool vehicle near their rented apartment at Motibagh in south Delhi. Suddenly a mini-truck intercepted them. The four men inside dragged away the woman from Mizoram at gunpoint. Her colleague somehow escaped. The victim was pushed to the back of the truck and the four then took turns to rape her. They abandoned her at Mangolpuri, an industrial zone, after almost two hours.         
	Delhi police faced a lot of flak from people for failing to solve the case. Women from the Northeast who stay in the capital organised a protest rally demanding immediate arrest of the culprits. Lok Sabha leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj demanded the resignation of chief minister Sheila Dikshit over the deteriorating law and order in the capital.         
	The police yesterday announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information on the four suspects.         
	Between November 24 and yesterday, the police questioned over 500 people, mostly truck drivers and labourers in the Mangolpuri area, and scanned 600 goods vehicles. The police also checked the history of 300 people arrested in rape cases in the past.        
	The BPO employee had mentioned to the police about some writing on one side of the truck. Her colleagues description of three of the men helped the police draw up sketches.         
	Today, while the police were arresting Shamsad and Usman in Mewat, the third man in the gang surrendered in a court in Haryana, apprehending arrest.        
	Women from the Northeast have repeatedly fallen victim to sexual assaults in the capital.         
	In May 2005, a 20-year-old Mizo girl studying in Delhi University was abducted from south Delhi, a spot close to where the BPO employees were intercepted on November 23. She was pulled inside a small car and then raped for several hours before being dumped near a gurdwara in Dhaula Kuan.         
	The North East Support Centre amp; Helpline has claimed that in the last two years, the police refused to register complaints of 40 cases of molestation of women from the Northeast. In another 20 cases, the police have made little headway.         
	Almost half the women sexually harassed in the capital are from the Northeast and the recent rape of a Mizo woman is only an addition to the list. It tells the sorry state of affairs of the police force who have failed miserably to protect girls, said Madhu Chandra, spokesperson for the Northeast support group.         
	Police commissioner Gupta said the force has asked BPO companies to put a security guard in each vehicle while dropping women employees home. We will take action if they do not stick to the guidelines, he said.         
	Till November this year, Delhi police recorded 402 cases of rape.        
	Delhi Speaker Yoganand Shastri today said the national capital was completely unsafe.         
	Briefing reporters about the just-concluded winter session, Shastri said: According to me, Delhi is not safe when we have the SUV of the deputy Speaker being stolen and incidents of rape like the one in Dhuala Kuan happening. In my point of view, it is completely unsafe.

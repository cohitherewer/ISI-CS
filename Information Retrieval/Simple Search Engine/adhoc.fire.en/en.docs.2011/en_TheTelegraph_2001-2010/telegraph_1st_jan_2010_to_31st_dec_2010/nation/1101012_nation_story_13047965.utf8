The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No-luck lady and Reddy curse
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      No-luck lady and Reddy curse
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                       
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: In 1996, when the BJP battled its first serious outbreak of dissidence  in Gujarat which was billed then as the jewel in its crown  the party rose as one to shield chief minister Keshubhai Patel from the machinations of an ambitious Shankersinh Vaghela.        
	A control room was set up in Delhi, manned by stalwarts of RSS provenance such as Sunder Singh Bhandari and Kushabhau Thakre, with Atal Bihari Vajpayee for marg darshan (direction). Pramod Mahajan, already the BJPs man for all seasons, camped in Gandhinagar. Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj were active behind the scenes.         
	Its government was booted out despite the efforts, but the BJP won the propaganda offensive. It projected the Congress as a wily, scheming, power-hungry villain and itself as the repository of ethics and moral values.        
	Fourteen years later, B.S. Yeddyurappa has been left to fend for himself in Karnataka.        
	The Delhi leadership watched in amusement or cynicism or pity as Yeddyurappa battled on several fronts, from the Reddy brothers to his domestic detractors. The chief ministers Achilles heel was his confidante, Shobha Karandlaje, whom he had to drop from the cabinet to save his government in October 2009.        
	When he re-inducted her last September, he thought he had silenced his rivals by winning the by-elections, but was stunned by another round of dissidence. That lady has brought him ill luck, a sympathiser said.        
	Unlike the BJPs durable chief ministers such as Narendra Modi, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh, Yeddyurappas going was never smooth from the start. The BJP did not tire of pointing out that it was not because of him that the party had breached the Congresss southern citadel and installed its first government in Karnataka. It gave the credit to the cadre, collective leadership and the RSS.        
	Privately, though, BJP leaders grudgingly acknowledged that had Yeddyurappa not used his Lingayat caste roots to the hilt and sent across the message that Karnataka could get its first Lingayat chief minister after the last one, Veerendra Patil of the Congress, was shown the door by his party, the BJP would never have got its 110 seats in 2008.         
	But then Yeddyurappa packed 70 per cent of his cabinet with Lingayats, forgetting that although influential, the caste made up only 16 per cent of Karnatakas population. This stoked resentment in the local BJP unit.        
	Unlike the other BJP chief ministers, he did not look for a patron in Delhi either. Discreetly, certain central leaders used the wealthy Reddy brothers, who own iron ore mines around Bellary, to prop up a dissident faction that would keep Yeddyurappa on tenterhooks.         
	That the Reddys  G. Janardhana and G. Karunakara  had generously contributed to the BJPs coffers before the elections enhanced their clout.         
	So when Yeddyurappa used Shobha, who was his rural development minister, to undermine their importance in Bellary, he nearly lost his job. He was told by Reddys well-wishers in Delhi to stop meddling with Bellarys administration.         
	The same Reddys were made Yeddyurappas trouble-shooters in the latest crisis. He trusted them too much, thinking he had them in his palms, a source said.        
	Winning back 15 or so defectors should have been no big deal for the cash-rich Reddys when the going rate of Rs 30 crore or so for switching sides was openly bandied about, sources said. Their heart was not in the job, a Karnataka BJP MP said.         
	The central leaders, too, appeared to have given up on Yeddyurappa. Other than from M. Venkaiah Naidu, there were no loud protests. Nitin Gadkari and Sushma Swaraj limited themselves to issuing statements, while Arun Jaitley was away in Vietnam.        
	So there were no dharnas or delegations to the President that the BJP has become so famous for anytime its state governments are in trouble.        
	However, almost like an afterthought, the Karnataka BJP said today it would parade the party MLAs before the President in Delhi tomorrow.  
	your questions  
	When is an MLA disqualified from the House for defection?  
	Under the anti-defection law, an MLA of any political party can be disqualified if (a) he (or she) voluntarily gives up membership of that party or (b) if he votes or abstains in the House in violation of party whip.  
	The MLA, however, may escape disqualification if he has secured permission to vote in such a way, or if the party condones his act within 15 days.  
	What if an MLA withdraws support to a coalition mdash; ruling or Opposition mdash;without resigning his party membership (as has happened in Karnataka)?  
	The anti-defection law is unclear about this. But the Supreme Court said in its judgment of February 14, 2007 (Rajendra Singh Rana versus Swami Prasad Maurya) that the 
  anti-defection law would kick in the moment any MLA or MP expressed his intent (by his conduct or by writing) of going against his original political party.  
	Doesn rsquo;t disqualification have to do with how large the group of dissident or defecting MLAs is?   
	Yes, the rule applies only if the number of dissidents/ defectors is less than 
  two-thirds of their original party rsquo;s strength in the House. If the dissidents rsquo; number is higher, or if a party merges as a whole into another, the axe doesn rsquo;t apply.  
	Are these rules same for MLAs and MPs?   
	Yes.  
	But how do these disqualification rules apply to Independents, who have no party to 
  defect from or rebel against?  
	An Independent member of a House can be disqualified if he joins any political party.  
	Then how did the Karnataka Speaker disqualify the five Independents?  
	The Speaker seems to have treated these MLAs as ldquo;deemed members rdquo; of a 
  political party because they were holding ministerial or other government posts. 
  Legal experts said this was debatable as the law is not very clear on this. Some lawyers said the Karnataka Speaker rsquo;s move may be in keeping with the spirit of the anti-defection law and the Supreme Court rsquo;s February 2007 ruling that was intended to keep horse-trading in check.  
	But then, should the Speaker not have disqualified these members as ldquo;deemed rdquo; party members as soon as they had taken up these posts rather than when they turned against the government?  
	Yes, that is a point that may well be argued. As we said, the anti-defection law is hazy on this issue.  
	The Karnataka governor had advised the Speaker on Sunday not to disqualify the dissidents. So, who is the final authority in deciding disqualification issues?   
	The Speaker rsquo;s decision is final but only in cases of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law), or over issues such as cash-for-query scandals.   
	In these cases, he exercises his quasi-judicial powers, which can be challenged 
  in the courts on limited grounds of mala fide intention.   
	What are the other grounds for disqualification apart from defection, cash-for-query and the like?  
	There are many, such as holding an office of profit, being of unsound mind (as declared by a competent court), not being an Indian citizen, or criminal conviction with a sentence of two years or more.  
	Who has final say in these disqualification cases, if not the Speaker?  
	In these cases, the governor technically takes the final call mdash; but actually he acts on the advice of the Election Commission. If the issue involves an MP, it rsquo;s the President who takes the decision mdash; on Election Commission advice.  
	So, when the Karnataka governor advised the Speaker not to disqualify the dissidents, was he acting within his powers?  
	Under the Constitution, the governor is expected to aid and advise the state cabinet. He cannot issue directions to the Speaker, whose say is final in all House matters.
  The disqualification issues relating to citizenship, sanity, conviction etc, are not strictly House matters. They bring into question whether the member should have beenallowed to contest the election at all. Here, the governor does not advise the Speaker but basically implements the Election Commission rsquo;s decision.   
	Does the Constitution allow a trust motion or a no-trust motion to be 
  decided by a voice vote?  
	Parliamentary procedure only says that ordinary bills would be cleared by a voice vote, but doesn rsquo;t specifically say that trust motions cannot be passed by a voice vote. On March 11, 2009, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik won a trust motion by a voice vote.   
	He continues in office. During a voice vote, members indicate their choice by shouting ldquo;aye rdquo; or ldquo;nay rdquo;, and no records are kept. During traditional ballot or electronic voting, the votes are recorded in some form.  
	Does the Constitution allow police to enter a House?  
	Under the rules of business, a Speaker can call in the police to preserve order in the House. The Supreme Court had, in an unprecedented order on March 9, 2005, directed ldquo;state police rdquo; to be present inside the Jharkhand Assembly and video-graph the entire proceedings during a trust vote.  
	Can the governor recommend President rsquo;s rule on the ground of unconstitutional happenings in the House?  
	Yes, but it rsquo;s the President who takes the final call under Article 356 mdash; after 
  receiving a report from the governor or ldquo;otherwise rdquo; (as the law puts it).Suppose, the 11 BJP dissidents were not disqualified (since they had not resigned party membership or violated party whip) and were allowed to vote. But then, as soon as they voted, they would be guilty of ignoring the party whip and become candidates for disqualification.  
	Would their votes still count?   
	Once a member is disqualified, his vote doesn rsquo;t count. So, the dissidents rsquo; votes should have been taken and kept sealed till the Speaker had decided on their disqualification mdash; and till, perhaps, the high court had decided on the validity of their disqualification.

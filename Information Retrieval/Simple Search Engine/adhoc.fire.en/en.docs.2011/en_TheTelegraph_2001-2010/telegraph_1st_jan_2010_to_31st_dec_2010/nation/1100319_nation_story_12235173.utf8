          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, March 18: The army headquarters is now toiling over an internal report after an investigation by its counter-intelligence wing into charges that an officer arrested in November 2008 was a member of a Hindutva terrorist outfit.         
	Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit was arrested for his alleged involvement in a blast in Maharashtras Malegaon town in which six people were killed. He was also suspected to be associated with an organisation that was campaigning against a rampaging Islamic tide.         
	Subsequent revelations that Purohit had gone to the Bhonsala Military School in Nashik, was in close touch with its commandant  retired Colonel S.S. Raikar who was also a military intelligence officer  and with another accused in the Malegaon blast case, retired Major Ramesh Upadhyaya, threatened to taint the secular image that the army trumpets.         
	The counter-intelligence investigation by a court of inquiry, ordered in March 2009 four months after Purohits arrest, has taken a year.         
	The central command, under which a three-member team led by a Brigadier was conducting the investigation, has now sent its recommendation to the army chief.         
	Purohit, who had been in operations in Jammu and Kashmir, was enrolled in an Arabic language course in the Army Education Corps in Panchmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, at the time of his arrest. He was a military intelligence officer.         
	When the inquiry was ordered, there was a suspicion that Purohit might have tapped into the officer cadre of the army to recruit or influence military personnel with his radical Hindutva ideas.         
	The report of the court of inquiry, believed to have recommended the sacking of Purohit, is also understood to have come up with suggestions to increase vigilance within the force.         
	Purohit and the organisation he is alleged to have helped, Abhinav Bharat, was suspected to be tapping recruits from a particular linguistic and suspected casteist group within the soldiery. He was with the Maratha Light Infantry regiment before moving into the intelligence corps.         
	When the court of inquiry was ordered in March last year, a senior army officer said its brief was to probe:         
	A possible collusion in the stockpiling and/or procurement of weapons/explosives and/or procurement of arms licences in violation of the Arms Act         
	The possible involvement of other officers/soldiers knowingly or unknowingly in a conspiracy; this is being examined to see if provisions of the army act have been violated         
	What connections have been established that stain the character and military reputation of the military person(s) involved (under the Army Act)         
	How could the conspiracy (if established) be kept confidential from superior officers in the chain of command (under the Army Act).         
	Purohit is the first serving army officer to face a terror charge.

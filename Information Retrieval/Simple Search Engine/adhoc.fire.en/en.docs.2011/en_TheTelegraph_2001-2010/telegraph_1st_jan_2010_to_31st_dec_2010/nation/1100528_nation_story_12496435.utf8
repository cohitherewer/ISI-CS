	New Delhi, May 27: Before she takes off for Kashmir this weekend, Sonia Gandhi has to get over a headache.        
	The Congress chief, set to leave this Saturday for a few days respite from the scorching Delhi heat, has to solve the intricate Rajya Sabha riddle that will decide the fate of some important party leaders.        
	Sources said she had completed consultations with state leaders and shortlisted serious candidates from a crowd of ticket aspirants.         
	Nominations will be filed in the first week of June but, the sources said, Sonia would like to get over this headache before she leaves for Srinagar on May 29.        
	Senior leaders admitted that the final list had been prepared by Madam herself and it was difficult to predict the names. However, it appears that environment minister Jairam Ramesh is set to be re-nominated from Andhra Pradesh while commerce minister Anand Sharma could be accommodated from Maharashtra.         
	In Andhra, the complex political situation that has developed after the demise of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and the demand for a Telangana state has curtailed the high commands freedom.        
	Insiders said the Congress was trying to provide chief minister K. Rosaiah with a stronger cushion and hence negotiating with actor Chiranjeevis party for an alliance. If that happens, one of the four Rajya Sabha seats the Congress expects to win in Andhra will go to Chiranjeevis brother-in-law.        
	In Maharashtra, too, there are many contenders, such as Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, Vijay Darda, Rajne Patil, Avinash Pandey, Hussain Dalvi and K.L. Gidawani. While the NCP will give one ticket to Tariq Anwar, the Congress is trying to use the surplus votes of Sharad Pawars party to push its own additional candidate.        
	The Congress is also trying to persuade Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh in Uttar Pradesh to get its candidate  probably Satish Sharma  elected. If this does not materialise, Sharma may be nominated from Rajasthan.         
	The lone Congress seat from Punjab will go to Ambika Soni.

  its options open on
  participating in the Games                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Commonwealth Games organisers have asked for special army units to guard venues following a barrage of questions from participating countries on security.        
	Army units specialised in preventive measures in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack will be deployed at select venues in Delhi. This indicates that there is a threat-perception of a terrorist attack during the Games.        
	Participating countries, most notably New Zealand, have asked for Delhi polices security blueprint for the October 3-14 Games.        
	So far, the CWG organisers had asked for the armys help for ceremonial functions, for technical support in a few events and for infrastructure support to host performers who would be coming for the opening and closing ceremonies.        
	The armys security duties were limited to the Queens Baton relay.        
	There is already a back-and-forth between the urban development and defence ministries on the cost of the help the army is rendering. The urban development ministry, which had earlier said the organisers would pay for the army personnel deployed, has now urged the defence ministry to bear the cost itself.         
	Although it is a book transfer of funds, there are murmurs within the services that personnel posted for the Games may be denied their deputation allowances.        
	A defence ministry source said, following a request, about 1,000 officers and soldiers from specialised units would be on security duty. Military personnel deputed to the Games for non-security duties have been routed through the Services Sports Control Board but the current request is of an altogether different order.        
	The army units with responsibility for security are likely to be in operational readiness from September 15 till October 20 at the airport, Games venues and at the Games Village. The Games will conclude on October 14.        
	Apart from personnel trained in nuclear, chemical and biological measures, soldiers and officers from the Signals Corps specialising in communication interception, jamming of electronic signals and decryption would be deputed for the Games.        
	The army teams will be posted in addition to the central and state security forces totalling more than 22,000 personnel.        
	Fresh security plans        
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai yesterday held a meeting with Delhi police and Intelligence Bureau officers to chalk out a fresh plan for security drills at Games venues, most of which are incomplete.        
	The need for a fresh security plan arose because the earlier one that required all Games venues to be shut by August 1 for checks cannot be implemented.         
	Now, only the Games Village will be closed for security drills. The closure of the sports venues and non-competition areas will be staggered, home ministry sources said, as and when work gets over at these places.        
	The ministry, which will conduct drills involving one lakh security personnel, has other challenges ahead. Such as the Air Force Day on October 8, when the skies over Delhi will be shut for some time for the IAF fly-past though helicopters monitoring the Games will have to fly. There are many challenges, like it is Air Force Day on October 8, so the airspace would be closed but we would have to fly our helicopters to monitor Games traffic, said a senior home official.         
	Air force and BSF choppers will monitor air space over Delhi during the Games.        
	There are 63 Games venues to be secured, including 12 stadiums.                    WITH INPUTS FROM ARCHIS MOHAN

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, March 2: Three Annamalai University students from Bihar and Jharkhand protesting the death of a fellow student drowned in a canal while fleeing police action, triggering an indefinite closure of the varsity amid signs the trouble stemmed from the rejection of a demand for a holiday on Holi.        
	Tensions ran high on the campus in Chidambaram town after the management rejected the students demand for a Holi holiday. Over 16,000 of the estimated 28,000 students at the university  the countrys oldest private varsity  are from north India.        
	Vice-chancellor Ramanthan said the demand to declare a holiday on Holi was rejected as many working days had already been lost because of late commencement of courses  medical, engineering, arts and science.        
	Holi is not a state holiday in Tamil Nadu, where the festival is celebrated mostly by north Indians. In Karnataka, there is no state holiday and government-run and private educational institutions function normally. In Kerala, too, government offices and schools remain open on Holi. The celebrations that take place are restricted to military camps and central establishments such as Isro.        
	Against the backdrop of the tension over the holiday demand at Annamalai, Gautam Kumar, 20, a second-year engineering student from Bihar, died in an accident on Sunday afternoon while riding a bike in the town. He was rushed to the university hospital but his fellow students demanded that he be shifted to Chennai. But Gautam died while being taken to Chennai, 220km away, and his body was brought back to Chidambaram.        
	The agitated students demanded a holiday to mourn Gautams death, which, too, was turned down by the vice-chancellor. This triggered protests, with the students throwing stones at university buildings and buses. The police was called in and they resorted to a lathicharge. While fleeing the cops, Jharkhands Sumit Kumar, 21, and Bihars Mohammed Sarfraz, 21, and Ashis Ranjan Kumar, 19, fell into a canal running along the campus.         
	District police chief Ashwin Kotnis appeared to blame the students, and said the university authorities had been advised to close the campus to avoid further escalation of tension. It is an unfortunate incident and if only the students had remained calm after the road accident, we would not have lost three innocent lives.        
	According to Ramanthan, it is mostly students who stay in rooms outside the campus who cause such trouble. Once new hostels are built, we expect all students to stay within the campus. This will help ensure greater discipline.                           
	The 80-year-old university, spread over a 1,000-acre campus, is one of the largest universities in Asia where all courses are offered directly, not through affiliated colleges. Since it is a private university, many join medical and engineering courses under the management quota, which brings in droves of students from north India.

	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Calcutta, Lucknow and Mumbai figure on a shortlist of probable venues being considered by the Congress leadership for an AICC plenary session in December.         
	The plenary, where the Congress will celebrate the completion of 125 years of its existence, will host the spearheads of the party.        
	Before convening the plenary  supposed to be held once in three years but not always done so with such regularity  the Congress has almost decided to hold a two-day AICC meeting in Delhi on November 1 and 2.        
	 As on Tuesday night, Lucknow appeared to be enjoying a thin edge as several Congress leaders felt that the party would opt for a thrust area of Rahul Gandhi. Logistics also suits Lucknow as it is closer to Delhi than the other contenders. If the Uttar Pradesh capital does not make the final cut, it will be because of reservations over the attitude of the not-too-friendly Mayavati government.         
	Mumbai is being considered for the plenary for a historical reason as this was the venue when the party celebrated its 100th year.         
	A renowned speech by Rajiv Gandhi, in which he did some plainspeaking about the degeneration in the Congress culture, had made that plenary unforgettable.        
	 If Calcutta is chosen, it will purely be for political reasons. Some senior party leaders believe that Calcutta would be the ideal place as, in addition to the forthcoming Assembly elections in Bengal, the Congress is required to make a concerted political thrust to recover the ground lost in the east.         
	The eastern states of Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand have been a cause for concern to the party. These leaders feel that a celebration of 125 years in Calcutta will help remind the people of the region of the glorious past of the grand old party.         
	Some leaders have contended that the party did not have any major event in the north in the recent past. The last two AICC plenary sessions were held in Bangalore and Hyderabad.         
	The party had a session in Calcutta in 1997 when Sitaram Kesri was president. The following year, Sonia Gandhi became the Congress president, setting of a rollercoaster ride that eventually pitchforked the party into national supremacy.        
	The December plenary will be restricted to the celebrations of 125 years. The political and organisational formalities will be completed at the AICC meeting in Delhi.         
	The formalities include reconstitution of the Congress Working Committee and formation of Sonias new team of general secretaries.         
	AICC members from different states are now being finalised and the announcement of new state unit chiefs will begin in a few days.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Feb. 27: When surrounded, shock and smash.        
	Kashmirs most wanted militant Abdullah Uni has left security forces scratching their heads, with a new terror strategy that involves breaking open a cordon within the first moments of contact with the men in uniform.        
	The Lashkar chief of Kashmir, who operates from Sopore  the born-again militant stronghold  has done it around half a dozen times in recent months.        
	Earlier, militants would hold on to their hideouts. They would engage our men for hours in a gunfight but their death was certain. The militants are now increasingly making efforts to break the cordon from the word go, a police officer said.        
	It wasnt easy, the officer added, because any operation against militants involved hundreds of army personnel the paramilitary CRPF and police, armed with sophisticated weapons and bullet-proof vests.        
	Sources said most of the whos who of Kashmirs militant leadership operated from Sopore and among those working closely with Uni were the commanders of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and the Hizb-ul Mujahideen.        
	Officials said the strategy the forces had so long followed was to tire the militants and exhaust their ammunition before normally blasting the house they were holed up in, but the insurgents had now come up with a counter-tactic.         
	They have a well thought out strategy. We normally lay a cordon during night but it is before dawn that they make an effort to break through. They rain our men with grenades to create panic in our ranks. They also blunt the surprise element, which we normally had, by setting up OPs (observation posts where some men are posted to inform militants about the movement of security forces). Normally, we lay our cordon around the targeted house, take position and then only they would know, the police officer said.

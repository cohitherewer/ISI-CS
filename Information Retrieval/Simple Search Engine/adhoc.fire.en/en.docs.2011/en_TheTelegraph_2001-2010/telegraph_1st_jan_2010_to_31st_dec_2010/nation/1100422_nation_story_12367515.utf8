The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Elite policy jab at Sibal 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Elite policy jab at Sibal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 21: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal today faced criticism from his own party MPs for two school policy decisions that some dubbed elitist.        
	The MPs from the Congress joined members of the BSP, Janata Dal (United) and the RJD in questioning government funding for Sanskriti School, run privately in the capital by wives of top central bureaucrats, in the Lok Sabha.        
	The MPs also pilloried Sibal for his decision to scrap a discretionary quota for the HRD minister and MPs in Kendriya Vidyalayas.         
	The opposition came even as the ministry plans to seek cabinet approval tomorrow for starting 1,000 government-sponsored model schools in backward districts.        
	The Congress MP from Latur, Jaywantrao Awale, fired the first salvo through a starred question where he asked Sibal to explain whether Sanskriti was ensuring admission of disadvantaged children from the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.        
	Sibal responded that while the school did not have quotas for SC/ST students, it did admit several economically weak pupils and had also adopted a neighbourhood cluster of shanties.         
	But BSP leader Dara Singh Chauhan asked: When the Centre talks about education, it says it doesnt have enough funds. Then why is it financially supporting an elite private school?         
	The school principally caters to wards of IAS officers who do not wish to send their children to the Kendriya Vidyalayas.        
	The next starred question, also for Sibal, ironically pertained to KVs, which were meant for wards of all government employees with transferable jobs, but which are today preferred mostly only by non-IAS staff. The KVs routinely outperform private schools in board examinations for Classes X and XII.         
	The minister had a discretionary quota under which he could nominate 1,400 students to the KVs each year. Each MP could nominate two students. The quota seats were principally used by MPs and ministers to nominate wards of workers and economically weak aides who were not officially part of the government. But Sibal scrapped the quotas last month.

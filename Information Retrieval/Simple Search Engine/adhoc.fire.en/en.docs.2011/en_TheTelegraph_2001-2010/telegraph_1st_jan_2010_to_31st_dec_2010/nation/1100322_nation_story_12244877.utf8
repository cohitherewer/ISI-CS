	Bhubaneswar, March 21: The Orissa government intends to set up a state forest academy soon.        
	Speaking at the World Forestry Day celebrations here today, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said there was a plan to set up the academy in the state capital soon. The academy will continuously provide intellectual and professional inputs to forest officials, said Patnaik.         
	The state forest department has already set up seven medicinal plant conservation areas to improve conservation regime and sustainable harvest of medicinal species.         
	It is also in the process of setting up a medicinal plants knowledge centre in Bhubaneswar to demonstrate the rich diversity of medicinal species in our forests and to create a nodal centre to acquire, test and disseminate information on the application of each species.        
	Ensuring forest protection, the state has decided to modernise the field set-up towards the end of this year. The personnel manning territorial charges will be equipped with necessary weaponry, vehicles and communication equipment, Naveen said.        
	The overall coverage under afforestation and reforestation programmes that was around 35,000 hectares only a few years back, has been stepped up to 250,000 hectares this year. By 2014, it is proposed to cover 10 lakh hectares on the state by afforestation measures.

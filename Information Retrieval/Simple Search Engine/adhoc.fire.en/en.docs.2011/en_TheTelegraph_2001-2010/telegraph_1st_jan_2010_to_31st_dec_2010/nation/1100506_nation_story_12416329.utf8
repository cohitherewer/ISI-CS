	Bhubaneswar, May 5: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today instructed officials to formulate development plans for Maoist-hit areas in accordance with the needs of local area and people.        
	He also asked the district collectors and superintendents of police to ensure proper utilisation of funds and hear public grievance regularly.        
	The directions were issued at a high-level meeting, chaired by the chief minister, to review the implementation of development and welfare programmes in Maoist-hit Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada and Gajapati districts.        
	Naveen asked officials to ensure that the fruits of development reached real beneficiaries and the social and economic development of the particular area was sped up.        
	During the course of the review, emphasis was laid on tapping potential for horticulture sector in the districts, sources said. It was decided to take up horticultural programmes in a massive way and fill up all the vacancies.         
	A horticultural training institute would be opened in Koraput and food-processing units would be set up with assistance from state-run Agriculture Promotion and Investment Corporation Limited.        
	The meeting also decided to take up plantation programmes with community participation.         
	Settlement of forestland in favour of tribals and traditional forest-dwellers was going on satisfactorily.        
	Projects like Orissa Tribal Empowerment and Livelihood Programme, under implementation in selected blocks, would be taken up in all blocks in Maoist-hit districts.         
	New posts would also be created to monitor the performance of 5,000 special police officers, recruited in Naxalite-affected areas.

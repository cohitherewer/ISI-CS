          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, Nov. 14: A research scholar was allegedly dragged out of a train and beaten up by some youths in Burdwan for protesting against the presence of men in a ladies compartment and seeking police help in forcing them to leave.         
	Suchismita Roy, a sociology researcher at the Indian Statistical Institute had boarded the Ganadevta Express from Howrah station this morning on her way to Bolpur in Birbhum.        
	The Jadavpur resident said she saw at least eight men in the ladies compartment. When I protested, a woman passenger said the man seated next to her was her father. She said she was ill, Roy said.        
	But some co-passengers and I informed the Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel at Howrah station. The police asked the men to vacate the compartment, Roy said.        
	The former Visva-Bharati student said the woman, whose father was also forced to step out, threatened her with revenge once the train reached Burdwan. She told me her husband was driving the train, Roy said.        
	When the train reached Burdwan station, Roy said, someone shouted at me from the platform.         
	Soon, a group of youths entered my compartment and dragged me out on the platform. They pulled my hair, slapped me and beat me up, Roy said.        
	The research scholar said the woman who had threatened her snatched her bag, which contained important documents, and threw it on the platform.        
	Roy said no policeman or railway official was around when she was being beaten up. As the train started pulling out of the station, someone in the compartment pulled the chain, Roy said. But the train did not stop.         
	Some of her co-passengers pulled her back into the compartment, she said. One of my fellow travellers retrieved my bag from the platform.        
	I suffered an injury below my left eye, Roy added.        
	After reaching Bolpur, Roy lodged a complaint with the GRP.         
	Tourist robbed        
	A Class XII student from Bangalore who had come to visit Calcutta was robbed of his bag, which contained a laptop and cash, by two youths who befriended him at Howrah station on the pretext of showing him a temple.         
	Ricky Marins, a student of St Thomas School in Bangalore, said he became friendly with the youths, Singh and Mehta, at Howrah station after getting off the Yesvantpur Express this morning.         
	Singh and Mehta told me they would take me to the Shiva temple in Tarakeswar. I boarded a local train with them, Marins said.        
	He said that when the train reached Loknath, the station before Tarakeswar, the duo snatched his rucksack and escaped. The rucksack contained my laptop and Rs 5,000 in cash, Marins said.        
	Police said they would help the boy return to Bangalore.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 30: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has started investigating the Rs 300-crore fraud by Citibank manager Shivraj Puri after receiving a report from the bank.        
	Officials at Citibank said the RBI had been regularly updated on its internal investigations since the fraud came to light.        
	We have shared all the details with the RBI. The RBI will now investigate the matter further, the Citibank official said.         
	An RBI spokesperson confirmed that the probe had begun. Sources said the money trail could lead to other banks.        
	Yesterday, police said they had sealed 81 bank accounts at several banks where they believed the money siphoned off by Puri had gone. These banks include the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, HDFC Bank, Standard chartered, Axis Bank and the RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland).        
	The RBI investigators will determine how the fraud had been perpetrated and whether there were any systemic deficiencies that had been exploited. They will also see where the money came from and where it went, said a source.        
	He said the central bank would not focus on the criminal part of the investigations since that is within the purview of police in Gurgaon, where Puri worked at the local Citibank branch.        
	Reports suggest Puri had opened over 80 accounts in his name, those of his grandparents and his mother Diksha Puri. It is not clear whether the accounts had been opened in the banks mentioned above.        
	Bank officials, however, said each bank had a monitoring mechanism for large value transaction.        
	The fraud at Citibank is one of the biggest in Indian banking history. According to the annual report of the RBI for 2009-10, the number of frauds in the domestic banking sector has risen to 24,797 in 2009-10 from 23,914 in 2008-09.        
	The report said the amount involved in the frauds increased to Rs 2,017 crore from Rs 1,883 crore the previous year.        
	There had been 225 instances of large value frauds involving Rs 1 crore and more, up from 212 in the previous year.

	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Supreme Court today allowed an American couple to adopt an 11-year-old boy who is a slow learner, overturning a high court order that had refused their plea to adopt him, fearing exploitation.         
	A two-judge bench headed by Justice Markandey Katju cleared the adoption of Anil, who was found abandoned by Delhi police, after a committee asked to look into this cleared Craig Allen Coates and Cynthia Ann Coates.         
	The bench had earlier asked a four-member panel of psychiatrists to submit a report on the couples suitability as parents. The AIIMS panel had cleared them saying the child would receive the required emotional support from the parents.         
	The district judge, the sole guardian of all abandoned children, had first rejected their plea on December 18, 2008. Delhi High Court upheld this order on August 31, 2009, and also slapped costs of Rs 20,000 on the couple.         
	It noted that Coates, a transaction processor with a bank, was already suffering from cerebral palsy and Cynthia, a nursing supervisor, had her hands full taking care of her husband. Both were in their fifties.         
	Besides, the court expressed fears that the couple who already had three children might end up exploiting the boy as a domestic help. Two of their children aged between 16 and 21 years did not live with them, the court noted. So Anil, who was already withdrawn, might lack the company of children his age, it said.         
	The court also expressed healthy scepticism over why the Wisconsin-based couple intended to expand their family.         
	But on appeal, the apex court cleared the couple for adoption. It also asked the government to set up a committee to deal with inter-country adoptions of children with disabilities.

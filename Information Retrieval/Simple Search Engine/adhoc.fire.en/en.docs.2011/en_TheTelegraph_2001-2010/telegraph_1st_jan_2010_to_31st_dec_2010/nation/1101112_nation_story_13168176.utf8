The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indo-US chat in Seoul
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indo-US chat in Seoul
          ARCHIS MOHAN                            Obama, Singh                          
	, New Delhi, Nov. 11: Declaration in Delhi, follow-up in Seoul.        
	Manmohan Singh and Barack Obama are likely to have what in diplomatic parlance is called a pull aside on the sidelines of the G-20 summits second day in Seoul tomorrow. They had a working dinner with the 18 other heads of member states today.        
	Tomorrows meeting is unlikely to last beyond a few minutes as the two leaders had met this week during the US Presidents visit.         
	But New Delhi is now looking to the Obama administration to follow through on the promises. India wants the US to do more to rein in Pakistans terror infrastructure and remove Indian entities such as the Department of Atomic Energy and Barc from the US entities list  a roster of agencies to which nuclear supplies and component exports are banned.         
	Also expected is a firmer US commitment to Indias permanent membership in the UN Security Council after Obama pledged to back the quest during his visit.        
	Tomorrows meeting, at which the two leaders are expected to exchange notes on the reactions to Obamas India visit, also comes against the backdrop of some resentment at his remarks about New Delhis stance on Myanmar.        
	Obama had said India shied away from speaking against the suppression of democratic movements in Myanmar. Sources say India will, at least in private discussions, explain to the US its compulsions in engaging with the Myanmar junta and argue that they dont amount to an endorsement of the military rulers policies.

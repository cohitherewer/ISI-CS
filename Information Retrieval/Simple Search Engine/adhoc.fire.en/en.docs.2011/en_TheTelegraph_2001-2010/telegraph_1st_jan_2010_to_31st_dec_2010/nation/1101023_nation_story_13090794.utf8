The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | China cloud on PMs East tour
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      China cloud on PMs East tour

	New Delhi, Oct. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs October 24-30 tour of Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam faces twin clouds: uncertainty over concluding key pacts with Japan, and Chinas ambitions to dominate the region.        
	During his visits to Tokyo and Kuala Lumpur, and at the India-Asean and East Asia summits at Hanoi, Singh will be accompanied by teams that will include Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Naina Lal Kidwai and Chanda Kochhar.        
	The Indian economy is getting increasingly integrated with those of its East Asian partners. The PMs tour is organically defined by this process, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said today.        
	Yet, while Singh and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan are expected to announce the conclusion of negotiations on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa), there is no chance of the pact being inked. Japan has to go through internal processes that are fairly lengthy. Both sides have to legally scrub the documents, Rao said.        
	Talks to clinch the pact, which has the potential to double bilateral trade, had started in 2007. The nuclear co-operation treaty with Japan is proving even harder to clinch.        
	It is critical to take the discussions forward. There is political resolve in seeking to build common ground, Rao stressed but ruled out the pact being signed during the upcoming trip.        
	One the positive side, Japans entrepreneurial needs and the Kan administrations economic growth strategy emphasise increasing the export of infrastructure technology, including nuclear technology, said government sources privy to the negotiations.        
	Besides, General Electric and Westinghouse Electric, two US companies that have contracts to set up nuclear plants in India, are partially or wholly owned by Japanese companies Hitachi and Toshiba.        
	On the other hand, the anti-nuclear lobbies have been pressuring Kan not to deal with India because New Delhi is not a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty.        
	Japans pitch to include India in the East Asia summit and recognise it as part of the Asia Pacific region have arisen largely from Chinas not-so-subtle claim to exclusive territorial rights over the South China Sea and the regions many islands to the chagrin of its neighbours.        
	The inclusion of Russia and the US for the first time in the East Asia summit reflects how testy the regions actors feel about Chinas growing dominance, a foreign ministry source said.         
	However, observers believe that while Japan regards India as a balancer in a nascent coalition against China, New Delhi must consider if it is wise to be drawn into a front that may prove counter-productive to its security and economic considerations.        
	In Malaysia, Singh and his counterpart Najib Tun Abdul Razak are expected to announce the conclusion of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) as well as the launch of a CEOs forum.        
	If trade and economics form a major prong of Singhs programmes, no less vital is New Delhis desire to play a role in ensuring peace and stability and providing security to sea lines considered important to Indias interests.        
	Singh is expected to have a one-to-one meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabo on the Asean summits sidelines. He will also have bilateral talks with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Hanoi.

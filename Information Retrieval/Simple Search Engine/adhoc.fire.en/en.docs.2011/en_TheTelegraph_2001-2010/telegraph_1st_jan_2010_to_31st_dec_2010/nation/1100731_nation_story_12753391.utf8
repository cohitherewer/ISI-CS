          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 30: The Election Commission today derecognised Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) as a national party.        
	Coinciding with the decision, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said his party would field candidates in Bihar, a move said to be driven by compulsions of holding on to the national party status.         
	The RJD lost its national party status because of its poor show in the Jharkhand Assembly polls. The party, however, continues to be a recognised party in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur and Nagaland.         
	Earlier, responding to the derecognition notice from the Election Commission, RJD chief Lalu Prasad had appealed to the commission to withhold its decision till the next Assembly polls in Jharkhand under Presidents rule were held. The commission, however, refused to entertain the request.        
	According to one of the criteria for the national label, the votes of all candidates fielded by a party should add up to at least 6 per cent of the votes polled in the last elections to the Lok Sabha/Assembly in not less than four states.        
	Mulayam Singh, however, said he had decided to put up candidates in Bihar for the polls as Lalu Prasad was unwilling to part with seats.         
	If the Samajwadi Party presses ahead with the move, it could queer the poll pitch for Lalu Prasad to some extent by splitting the Yadav votes.

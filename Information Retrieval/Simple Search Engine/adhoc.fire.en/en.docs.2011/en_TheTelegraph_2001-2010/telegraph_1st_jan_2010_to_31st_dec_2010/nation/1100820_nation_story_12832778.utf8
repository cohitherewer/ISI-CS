The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat mum on BJP deal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat mum on BJP deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today refused to take on the BJP for allegedly striking a deal with the Congress for the passage of the nuclear liability bill in Parliament.        
	I cannot say what deal has been struck, Karat replied to repeated questions over allegations of a trade-off between the two national parties to get the bill passed. Non-BJP Opposition parties had stalled Parliament yesterday, alleging that the Congress had struck a deal with the BJP in return for letting off Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case.        
	Karats critics blame him for pursuing an aggressive anti-Congress line to the extent that the party is seen being soft towards the BJP.         
	On many issues in the past, the CPM has been seen co-ordinating with the BJP in Parliament to take on the Congress but the party recently has been trying to avoid such a situation.        
	CPM leaders, however, said Karat had deliberately shied away from attacking the BJP. The party had earlier raised objections similar to those of the Left.         
	But Karat denied having held consultations with the BJP or any other party.He, however, issued an appeal to different parties to reconsider their stand on the bill, underling that it was not in national interest.         
	Karat objected to the clubbing of two clauses in the proposed bill and alleged that a separate page with AND was attached to the report of the standing committee to protect the foreign equipment suppliers from any responsibility in case of a nuclear accident. The original bill was better than this. This is worse, Karat said.        
	Asked whether the Left parties would support the bill if the AND page was removed, Karat said that they would consider their support only after perusing the final bill.         
	He said he and his Left colleagues had other objections as well, with the key one related to fixing the liability of foreign suppliers.         
	Unlike Karat, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury felt that the timing of clean chit to Narendra Modi and the nuclear liability bill had generated suspicions of an alleged trade-off. The Congress and the BJP should explain. Such horse-trading should not take place at the cost of national interest, Yechury said.         
	In Parliament yesterday, Left members had backed RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav who alleged that the Congress had struck a deal with the BJP to spare Modi to get the bill passed.

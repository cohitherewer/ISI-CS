          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 18: Three of the five accused in the gangrape of a Japanese tourist on Friday were arrested near Amwan village under Bodh Gaya police station this morning.        
	The Gaya police  working under a tough deadline of 24 hours set by DGP Neelmani to book the culprits  also recovered valuables, including Yen 2,300, Rs 2,500 in cash, mobile phone, credit card and club card belonging to the rape victim. The two autorickshaws used by the criminals were also seized.        
	Gaya superintendent of police Sushil Khopade said Pappu Kumar, a resident of Amwan, his cousin Udai of Bersawan village under the Tenkuppa police station area and Lootan of Amwan had been arrested.        
	The trio confessed their involvement and narrated a detailed sequence of events, the police said.        
	The Japanese visitor was on her way to Gaya station on Friday evening to catch a train to Calcutta when she was raped by five persons near Amwan, about 10km from here.         
	According to Khopade, the recovery of the items belonging to the victim from the house of one of the arrested men and other material evidence made a nearly foolproof case against the accused.         
	Chargesheet against them would be submitted within a couple of days, he said.        
	The trio would be produced in the court on Monday.        
	One of the arrested persons, Udai, works in Gujarat and was visiting his cousin Pappu in Amwan. Two of the five rapists are autorickshaw drivers, the police said. A massive hunt had been launched to arrest the rest of the culprits.        
	According to the version of the arrested men, the rape was not pre-planned and it was done on the spur of the moment.         
	Two of them said they accidentally were at the place of occurrence after hearing some commotion and joined three others who had been following the tourist from Bodh Gaya.         
	The duo claimed to have been tempted to join the crime.        
	Asked whether the arrested men had any criminal history, Khopade said no previous police record had been found against the culprits.         
	Though a quick breakthrough has been made, the polices job is far from over as the remaining two rapists managed to escape and the passport of the victim is yet to be recovered.

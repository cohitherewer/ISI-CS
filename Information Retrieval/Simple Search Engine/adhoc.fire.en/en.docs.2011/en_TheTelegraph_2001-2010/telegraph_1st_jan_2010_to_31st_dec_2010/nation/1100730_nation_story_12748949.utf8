The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pact with UK for fuel boost
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pact with UK for fuel boost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 29: India and the UK today announced a joint research plan to develop technologies for fuel cells  power packs that harness hydrogen energy  and pledged to collaborate in space, civilian nuclear, and rural technologies sectors.         
	British minister for universities and science David Willets and junior science minister Prithviraj Chavan announced a research initiative to encourage scientists from both countries to jointly develop next generation fuel cell technologies.         
	Both countries hope to invest 3 million (Rs 21 crore) each under the programme that will seek to build partnerships between 15 research groups in the UK and about 20-odd groups in India already studying fuel cells.         
	A typical fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electric current that may be used to drive vehicles, run electric motors, or deliver power.         
	Although some fuel cells proponents believe the technology has already matured, others argue that costs, raw materials, and infrastructure to sustain the use of such cells still needs to be addressed through more research.         
	Theres exceptional scientific research in India and in the UK  if we bring it together, the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts, Willets said after a meeting with Chavan and the heads of Indias science departments.         
	We believe there is a possibility for collaboration in civilian nuclear research and space technology, Willets said. India has excellent launch vehicles, he said, and the two countries could collaborate to develop satellite technologies.         
	A senior Indian science and technology official said collaboration in civilian nuclear research and space was discussed as an opportunity for the future and there are no concrete proposals for joint research in these areas yet.         
	The two countries have also decided to invest up to 12 million (Rs 84 crore) on a special programme that will seek to improve the quality of life of rural residents in both countries through technological solutions.         
	Indias department of biotechnology (DBT) and UK-based Wellcome Trust also announced a five-year programme to support research on healthcare technologies such as diagnostic tools, drugs, and vaccines. Under this programme, the DBT and Wellcome Trust will each contribute 22.5 million to support healthcare research at institutions and industrial partners in India and the UK.

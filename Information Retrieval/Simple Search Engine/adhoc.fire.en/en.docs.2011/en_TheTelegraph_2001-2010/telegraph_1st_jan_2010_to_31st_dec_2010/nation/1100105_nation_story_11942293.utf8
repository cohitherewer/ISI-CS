          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: Rebels blew up a government school building in Naxalite-hit K Bolang area in Sundargarh district today in retaliation to the resistance put up by the locals against them.        
	About 40 armed rebels, including women, swooped on the school around 11 last night and used powerful landmines to bring down the building.         
	Rourkela superintendent of police Diptesh Pattnaik confirmed the news. The Maoists blew up a school building in Rehlatu panchayat with landmines last night. No one was injured. Enforcements are being rushed to the area, he said.         
	The Middle English School building was completely destroyed in the incident. The rebels also attacked a public health centre.        
	The Maoists, who spoke in Hindi and Oriya, made away after looting 50 quintals of rice stored inside the school for midday meals. The rebels left posters in Hindi and Oriya threatening villagers of dire consequences if they did not support them.         
	Earlier, residents of five villages  Langalakata, Jharbeda, Sanbalijore and Rehlatur in Koida block  had left their homes following Maoist threats and sat on a dharna seeking police protection against Maoists.         
	Villagers of Mahupada, Langalakata, Jharbeda, Sanbalijore and Rehlatur in Koida block were reportedly being threatened to co-operate or face death penalty.         
	In December, the rebels had triggered an explosion destroying two schools and a community health centre in Jharabeda village and one school each in Sunaballijore and Mahupada under K Bolang police station.         
	The local administration had arranged food and temporary shelter for around 3,000 tribals after they refused to return to their villages until adequate security forces were deployed in the area.         
	Yesterdays attack has spread more panic in the region.

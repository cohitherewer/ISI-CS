The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani draws scam fine line
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Advani draws scam fine line
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: L.K. Advani today raised the pitch of the BJPs anti-corruption campaign against the government but could not explain why his party was persisting with B.S. Yeddyurappa as Karnataka chief minister despite an investigation into his alleged irregular land deals.        
	The BJPs parliamentary party chairperson accused the UPA government of indifference to corruption. Even if the allegation was likely to reach the high levels of political office, the government is absolutely adamant (about not yielding to the Oppositions demand for a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum allocation), he said.         
	The government cannot seriously expect the Opposition to accept that the CBI and the Central Vigilance Commission are the appropriate institutions which are capable of an honest investigation into the monumental 2G spectrum allocation scam, Advani added.         
	Asked about the corruption charges against Yeddyurappa, he said: I am very much concerned about what I hear about Karnataka. But we are dealing with it.         
	In response to another question on the Karnataka chief minister, Advani said there was no comparison between the cases he was allegedly embroiled in and the alleged scams at the Centre.        
	Asked about some questionable land transactions by the BJPs Uttarakhand chief minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal, he said: Our party spokespersons have handled such matters. Advani would not comment when asked how the management of such issues could be left to spokespersons.        
	Later, when the BJP leader was told that Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde had expressed resentment with Yeddyurappa for ordering a probe into the alleged land scams when he was already looking into the complaints, Advani shot back: Why do you people only pick on this governments deals? Because its a BJP government? Previous CMs were implicated too but nobody will investigate these.         
	Yeddyurappa yesterday called on Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, to deny derogatory remarks about her that were attributed to him in the media. The chief minister told Swaraj he had the deepest respect for her and had spoken positively about her to party president Nitin Gadkari and Rajya Sabha leader Arun Jaitley when they informed him he would keep his job.

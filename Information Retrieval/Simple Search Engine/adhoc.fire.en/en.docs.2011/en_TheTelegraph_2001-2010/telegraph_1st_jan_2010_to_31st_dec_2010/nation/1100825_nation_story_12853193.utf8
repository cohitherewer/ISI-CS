The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Afghan course correction

	New Delhi, Aug. 24: India has decided to make a course correction in the aid it is offering Afghanistan: instead of taking on infrastructure projects, it will now focus on training Afghans in information technology, agricultural sciences and the like.        
	New Delhi is likely to commit more aid to President Hamid Karzais government during the three-day visit of Afghan foreign minister Zalmay Rassoul that started today. India is Afghanistans sixth-largest donor, having committed $1.3 billion since 2001.        
	India has now decided to put money into capacity and institution building or training the Afghans, although it is currently involved in the construction of the Afghan Parliament and the Salma dam in Herat. In the past, India has helped lay the 218km Zaranj-Delaram Road and the transmission line between Pul-e-Khumri and Kabul.        
	The change in strategy follows increasing attacks on Indians in Afghanistan by al Qaida and the Taliban, which, intelligence agencies believe, have been engineered by Pakistans ISI. There have been attacks on Indian institutions in July 2008, October 2009 and February this year. The Indian Medical Mission, attacked on February 26 this year, is yet to be re-opened.         
	According to a recent Pentagon report, Karzais government controls 29 of the 121 key strategic districts. But Indian intelligence agencies believe the government writ does not run beyond Kabul. With international forces likely to start leaving soon, Indian interests in Afghanistan will become more vulnerable. There are 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan now, mostly businessmen and contract workers. At its mission, New Delhi has only 10 Indians as part of its diplomatic staff.        
	Government sources said the course correction in Indian aid would be tailored to the wishes of the Afghan people, which would include more scholarships for Afghans willing to study in India.        
	At present, India offers Afghans 1,350 scholarships annually for IT and humanities related courses. It now plans to offer 300 more scholarships to students interested in agricultural sciences. It is also willing to train more Afghan police and army personnel.        
	For its part, the Afghan government is trying to dispel the impression that it has cosied up to Pakistan. In a signed article titled Pakistan is the Afghan wars real aggressor that appeared in The Washington Post, Karzais national security adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta has said Pakistans military-intelligence establishment... still regards Afghanistan as its sphere of influence.        
	Spanta also said Pakistan was continuing to provide sanctuary to al Qaida and other groups.

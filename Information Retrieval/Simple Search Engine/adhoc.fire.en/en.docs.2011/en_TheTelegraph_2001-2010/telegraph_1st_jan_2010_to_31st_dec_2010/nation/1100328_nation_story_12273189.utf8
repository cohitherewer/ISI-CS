The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bill must for equity: Sonia
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bill must for equity: Sonia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, March 27: Sonia Gandhi today claimed that the UPA government had widened the legal framework to help the common man and the weaker sections, but accepted that laws are little more than words on paper if they are not enforced.        
	She cited the Right to Information Act and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act as unprecedented measures to empower the common man.        
	For the first time, citizens had the power to hold their elected representatives and their civil servants accountable. For the first time, there was a guarantee of 100 days manual work to anyone who demanded it in all districts of the country, she told a convention on Law, Justice and Common Man, organised by the Congress legal cell.        
	Through these legislative reforms we have sought to put pressure on the executive to ensure greater accountability to the people. We have taken action to make government more transparent and more efficient.        
	She hoped the Lok Sabha would pass the womens reservation bill. It is only through the law that we can ensure equity for all.        
	Sonia said it was the responsibility of every government to ensure that its legislative agenda had at its core a genuine concern for the well-being of the common man and his hopes and aspirations.        
	She mentioned the domestic violence and child rights acts, the amendments to Hindu inheritance laws and the unorganised workers social security act, and hoped the right to education act would become a reality in April.        
	Most importantly, we are committed to the passage of a right to food security law. This will mark yet another achievement in our continuing battle against chronic starvation and malnutrition, she said.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who attended the convention, said the lead for legal and judicial reforms had to come from within and promised to walk the extra mile to match each step taken by the bar and the bench.        
	Legal and judicial reform is not the concern only of the judiciary or the legislature  it is equally the solemn responsibility of the executive and indeed of the bar, he said.        
	The Prime Minister expressed concern at the backlog of cases at every judicial level and asked the states to quickly implement the legislation to set up rural courts.        
	We have passed the gram nyayalaya act. Once the act is fully implemented, it would add more than 5,000 courts at the panchayat level, he said.        
	Singh said his government would set up 71 additional CBI courts in different states.        
	This is the first time the Congress has organised a law convention on such a large scale, triggering heartburn in some sections of the party. Many leaders felt that party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi, the brain behind the convention, was more interested in a personal show of strength to achieve his objective of becoming a minister.

	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Centre is likely to override apparent differences in the Congress top brass to make revocation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in some central Valley districts part of a bouquet extended in a near-desperate bid to woo angered Kashmir.         
	A meeting of the cabinet committee on security has been especially convened tomorrow, even though it is a holiday, to encash the symbolism of Id and grant a clutch of concessions that chief minister Omar Abdullah has been openly demanding.        
	Three months of unrelenting violence and emotional discord have made Kashmir a front-burner issue with the Centre, and the mounting sense with decision-makers is that the situation demands a slightly out-of-the-box, if not dramatic, response.         
	The flurry of activity over the past few days has raised expectations in Kashmir, there is a clear sense of anticipation, said a senior official, We cannot let this opportunity slip away without making an attempt at something substantial.         
	The Prime Minister is also keen that fast-tracked economic and employment-related measures be dovetailed with the security concessions on the discussion table in order to help Omar regain lost credibility in the Valley. Cash relief for the families of those killed or injured are also likely to be part of New Delhis offer.         
	The Congress core group, which met at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs residence this evening, was clearly divided on whether to lift the AFSPA from the Valley.         
	While home minister P. Chidambaram and Kashmir Congress chief Saifuddin Soz are learnt to have been in favour of revoking AFSPA from a few non-border districts like Srinagar, Budgam and Ganderbal, defence minister A.K. Antony and former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad expressed reservations. Antony was, of course, representing the point of view of the armed forces, which have argued against both lifting or diluting the AFSPA.         
	Shortly before the core group met, army chief V.K. Singh too met the Prime Minister to personally articulate his views against any tinkering with the AFSPA. He is believed to have conveyed to the Prime Minister that should the controversial act be abrogated from certain areas, it will have to be followed with the army pulling out from those zones.         
	The trio of Congress elders  Sonia Gandhi, the Prime Minister and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee  heard out colleagues without seeming to take sides in the debate.         
	But sources said the top three were inclined towards reworking the jurisdiction of the AFSPA in the Valley, if only to provide Omar some room to work with.         
	The sudden summoning of the Congress core group carried another message. If key decisions are in the works for Kashmir, the Congress leadership wanted to be seen as putting its stamp on it, rather than let it be merely a function of government.         
	Both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are learnt to have been in close touch with Omar at a personal and political level and they are keen the party assumes ownership of decisions in addition to the UPA government. Soz, Azad and Prithviraj Chavan (who is general secretary in charge of Kashmir affairs) were special invitees to the core group session today.         
	At this stage, there appears near-unanimity in the government and Congress that diluting the AFSPA is not a good idea  legal fidgeting with provisions will take away from the thrust of security operations and offer no political returns.         
	There is, equally, a strong drift emerging from Kashmir that even revoking the AFSPA  or offering economic sops is not going to go very far in terms of easing the Valley-wide unrest that has claimed over 60 lives.         
	The jailed separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, for instance has put forth a five-point demand charter that, among other things, seeks the withdrawal of all security forces from Kashmir as a starting point for negotiations.         
	It is a demand whose fulfilment is inconceivable in New Delhis scheme. As one Kashmiri commentator said: The problem is fundamental. While New Delhi thinks it is making a huge concession in even thinking of lifting the AFSPA, Kashmiris think it is too little, too late. The ground is shifting fast and neither Omars government nor New Delhi are able to keep pace.         
	But New Delhi remains willing to bet against nay sayers within  and recalcitrant voices from the Valley  and gamble with what it can.         
	To strident opponents of any changes to the AFSPA regime, it is arguing that the security risks will have to be measured against the political benefits that might emerge from the move.         
	To Kashmiris willing to listen, it is sending out a message that given a window of peace, it is ready to assuage grievances and address aspirations. Kashmir is not about one move or two, an official involved with current strategy said, It is about an evolving strategy that will play out over time.         
	As was evident from the Prime Ministers recent remark to top editors  We are still groping in Kashmir the Centre isnt deluded about the complexity of the challenge it faces. But it is no longer prepared to extend the lease on the drift which it perceives as dangerous to Indias integrity.         
	It sees the proposal to revoke the AFSPA in that perspective  a serious attempt to address a deep grudge and break the cycle of violence the Valley is caught in.

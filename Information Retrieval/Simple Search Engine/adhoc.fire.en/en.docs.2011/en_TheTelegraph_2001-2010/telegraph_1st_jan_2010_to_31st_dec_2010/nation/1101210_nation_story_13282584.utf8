The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 2G tango: nights minus leave
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      2G tango: nights minus leave
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                         A CBI sleuth leaves with papers taken from Raja rsquo;s house during a raid on Wednesday, as the Tamil Nadu leader walks past      
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The CBI has to go through over 18,000 files, running into 2.5 lakh pages, and examine the contents of 5,851 telephone calls and file a detailed report on the 2G scam by March next year to meet the Supreme Court deadline.         
	Considering the enormity of the task, the investigating agency has cancelled leave for three months for its anti-corruption branch officers.         
	Everybody has been denied leave. We have never faced this kind of deadline, said an officer who is part of the team examining the seized documents. Many of us are now working even at night.         
	During raids at 14 places in Delhi and Chennai yesterday, including the premises of former telecom minister A. Raja and his associates, the CBI seized over 10,000 files going into over 1.6 lakh pages.         
	The CBI today questioned Rajas former personal secretary R.K. Chandolia, former telecom secretary Siddhartha Behuria, former Telecom Commission member K. Sridhar and former deputy director-general, access service wing, in the department A.K. Srivastava in Delhi.         
	All four persons were questioned by our officers at length. We are recording their statements after conducting raids at their houses yesterday, a senior CBI officer said, adding Raja would also be questioned soon. Its just a matter of time. Our officers questioned him informally yesterday as he was present at his house when the raid took place. But we will question him after examining the papers seized from his house and other premises.         
	Asked if a diary was seized from the former ministers house containing phone numbers of some people connected with the scam, DIG Vineeta Thakur said: I do not have any knowledge of any such diary but we have seized some incriminating documents.         
	So far, the CBI has examined a little over 40,000 pages of documents relating to the scam.         
	It takes a minimum two days to scrutinise a file thoroughly. We need to examine it vis--vis the information gathered through sources. Only after this are the statements of witnesses recorded, the officer who is part of the team examining the documents said.        
	After scrutinising the documents, we need to record statements and conduct searches which would again lead to further seizures. It is a continuous process and many statements would lead to further examination of other witnesses.         
	The officer said the delay in carrying out raids had led to the mess and pointed out that the CBI had registered the case on October 21, 2009. It is possibly the first time it has taken 14 months to conduct raids.         
	We were awaiting the nod from the bosses and they were waiting for the go-ahead from theirs, he said. Last year, some corporate houses and Department of Telecommunication offices were raided and the CBI had seized 866 files comprising 83,665 pages. All the files were not examined and this is why we need to slog now, the officer admitted.         
	The CBI is also examining transcripts of 5,851 telephone calls of corporate lobbyist Niira Radia. Nearly 4,000 calls have been analysed so far, the officer said.         
	We are burning the midnight oil to complete the investigation. Had we studied so sincerely in our school and college days, things would have been different in our lives today, he joked.         
	Another officer wanted the special allowance given to CBI officers to be raised. All officers from the rank of constable to superintendent of police get a special allowance every month that is 25 per cent of their basic salary. Officers from the rank of DIG upwards get 15 per cent of the basic pay as allowance. We all get a special allowance as our officers have to travel across the country during raids, Vineeta Thakur said.

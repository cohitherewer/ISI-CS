The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Saffron volley at party amp; rivals
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Saffron volley at party amp; rivals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          P Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Union home minister P. Chidambaram, under fire from his party for having used the phrase saffron terror, avoided the S-word today but pointed out that it had been used by his Congress colleagues before.        
	Message is that right-wing fundamentalist groups are behind some incidents. The message should not be lost in the phrases, he told reporters here after presenting his monthly report card for August.        
	The home ministry has brought several cases allegedly involving Hindu terror groups under the purview of either the CBI or the National Investigation Agency. The Samjhauta Express blasts, the Mecca Masjid attack and the Malegaon blasts are cases where groups linked to the Sangh parivar are suspected to be involved.        
	The home minister had spoken of saffron terror during the conference of directors-general of police on August 25, drawing protests from the BJP in Parliament. Soon, the Congress, which faces elections in several states, ticked off Chidambaram and said terror had no colour.        
	Today, the minister did not refer to either saffron or Hindu in the context of terror. But he did quote a newspaper report and thank the reporter for his research on who in the Congress had used the phrase saffron terror earlier. The message to his colleagues was clear: people living in glass houses should not throw stones at others.        
	Chidambaram was asked for a reaction on the repeated challenges he was facing from within his own party. First, general secretary Digvijay Singh had opposed his handling of the Maoist issue.        
	Later, he had to do with a limited mandate on tackling Naxalites. Instead of the Centre taking the brunt of criticism for Maoist violence, the minister then began talking of the states responsibility to ensure law and order and the Centres responsibility to assist. The party is supreme, he said today.        
	Not a Bollywood buff        
	Chidambaram today said he does not watch Hindi films.        
	The minister scuttled questions on foreign artistes working in the Hindi film industry without valid employment visa.        
	I do not watch Bollywood movies, he said in reply to a question on the issue.        
	According to reports, several foreigners, including some big stars working in the Hindi movie industry, have tourist visas whereas rules say they can only work after getting employment visas.

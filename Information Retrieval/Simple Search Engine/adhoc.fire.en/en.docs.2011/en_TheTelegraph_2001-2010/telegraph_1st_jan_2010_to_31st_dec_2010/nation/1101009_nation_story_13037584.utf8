	New Delhi, Oct. 8: Policewomen from all over the country guarding Delhi during the Games dont have toilets to use during their long duty hours.         
	We have come here for the first time. There are hardly any toilets nearby and it is so embarrassing to have to go to restaurants, said a woman constable from Uttar Pradesh, posted at the Connaught Place metro station.         
	Our colleagues deployed on the roads and outside markets face major problems. Nobody seems concerned, she added.         
	Another woman constable said there were a few mobile toilets in different parts of the city. We are not familiar with the city. But even these mobile toilets are in unhygienic condition. Most of the time there is no water, she said.         
	Around 6,000 policewomen have come from across the country, many from Orissa, Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. For the first time, a womens contingent from Nagaland is also in the capital.         
	Nearly 600 women from the womens battalion of Nagaland police are guarding Games venues, metro stations and the citys roads. Fresh out of a nine-month training programme, the girls aged between 18 and 25 are equipped to handle .303 rifles, 7.62 self-loading rifles, AK-47s, 9mm pistols, light machine guns, carbines and Insas rifles.         
	A woman constable from Nagaland said: We get low-quality food and the government has not made any arrangement for treatment if any of us falls sick. Everybody is concerned about providing the best food and facilities to foreign players and their families.         
	Rajan Bhagat, the spokesperson for Delhi police, said: We are trying to address the problems.         
	The government should have made arrangements for basic needs, such as toilets, especially for the policewomen. They work long hours but the food provided to the cops is not up to the mark. We have asked the government to look into the matter, a senior Delhi police officer said.         
	An official of the Delhi Municipal Corporation said in the rush to clean and beautify the city, the authorities forgot to set up more mobile toilets. This is a genuine problem but nobody thought about it, he said.         
	Nearly 100,000 security personnel have been deployed across the city for the Games. Fifteen bomb disposal squads and 200 specially trained dogs are also on the job.

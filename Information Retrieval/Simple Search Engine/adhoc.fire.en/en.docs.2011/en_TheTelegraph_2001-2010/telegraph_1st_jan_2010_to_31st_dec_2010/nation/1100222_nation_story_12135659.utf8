          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Shilda, Feb. 21: Maoist leader Kishan today said five guerrillas had been killed during the attack on the EFR camp here on February 15.         
	Five of our soldiers were killed that day during our fight against the unholy force of the state. We will honour them as martyrs. We will observe February 25 as Martyrs Day across the country, Kishan told The Telegraph.        
	He identified those killed as Sushen, Ujjal, Vijay, Chandan and Sujit.        
	The special inspector-general of the EFR, Benoy Chakraborty, too, had said yesterday that his force had shot dead five Maoists.        
	The last time Kishan admitted that a Maoist action squad member had been killed was in October. It was after Sunil Mahato was killed in an encounter with security forces near Banstala, where supporters of the Maoist-led Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities were blocking the Rajdhani Express that evening.        
	Twenty-four EFR personnel were killed in the attack on the Shilda camp.         
	 Kishans admission comes six days after the attack. On the day of the attack, he had claimed responsibility for the strike but had said he was unaware of any Maoist casualty.        
	Referring to the special IGs news conference yesterday in which he accused the West Midnapore police chief of setting up the Shilda camp in an unprofessional manner, Kishan said: The CPM headquarters at Alimuddin Street and the government at Writers Buildings are conspiring to punish Benoy Chakraborty. We are lodging our protest against it.        
	Kishan extended his sympathies to the family members of the EFR personnel killed in Shilda. We appeal to the policemen of lower ranks working in Jungle Mahal not to raise their arms against the poor. Please take transfer to other police stations and perform your duties there. If necessary, leave your job.         
	The attack, he added, was a reply to the Centre and the states planned Operation Green Hunt against the rebels. We attacked the camp in Shilda to give a fitting reply to the governments decision to launch Operation Green Hunt. It was part of our Operation Peace Hunt.        
	Intelligence sources said they were aware of Sushen. Sushen Mahato was a resident of Lalgarh. He was a CPM supporter and had joined the Maoists last June, said an officer.        
	The Maoists had fled with the bodies of Sushen and the four others in a pick-up they had brought with them.

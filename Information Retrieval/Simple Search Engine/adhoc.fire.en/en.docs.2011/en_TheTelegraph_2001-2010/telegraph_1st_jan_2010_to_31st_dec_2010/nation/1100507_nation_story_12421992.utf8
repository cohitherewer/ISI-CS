The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | OBC face rises
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      OBC face rises
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, May 6: The spirited push for a caste-based census by BJP leader Gopinath Munde has signalled the rise of a new OBC face of the party.        
	The emergence of Munde, the BJPs key speaker and deputy parliamentary party leader, fills a vacuum created by the exit of once-formidable leaders like Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti and the marginalisation of others like Vinay Katiyar and Om Prakash Singh.        
	Munde is the brother-in-law of the late Pramod Mahajan. As long as Mahajan, a Brahmin, was alive, Munde never asserted his OBC identity, although he kept winning Assembly elections from Beed on his caste votes.        
	Munde was in such full flow that even Lalu Prasad, who was reviled by the BJPs Ananth Kumar on Wednesday on the same subject, congratulated him. Lalu Prasad added that in his next incarnation, Munde was welcome to be reborn as a son of Bihar and a Yadav.        
	Munde placed his understanding of caste in perspective: OBC is not a caste, it is a class because OBC is made up of several castes.... It is necessary to list castes in the census.        
	He gently chided his colleague Ananth Kumar for running down Lalu Prasad, saying: Despite the various castes we have remained as one country. That is why it is wrong to cast aspersions on the patriotic credentials of the OBCs.

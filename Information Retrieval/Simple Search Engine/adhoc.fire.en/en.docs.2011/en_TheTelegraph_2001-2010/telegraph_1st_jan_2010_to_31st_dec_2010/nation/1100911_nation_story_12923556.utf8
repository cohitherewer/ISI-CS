The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP top brass to skip Ranchi coronation
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP top brass to skip Ranchi coronation
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                  (From top:) Arun Jaitley, L.K.Advani, Sushma Swaraj                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Top BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Ananth Kumar will not attend Arjun Mundas swearing-in as Jharkhand chief minister tomorrow, betraying differences in the party over its tie-up with JMM.        
	Also skipping the event will be BJP chief Nitin Gadkari, with whom the seniors are apparently miffed for having conducted the government-formation efforts without informing them and then presenting them with a fait accompli.        
	Gadkari was earlier expected to attend the swearing-in, and his would have been the only high-profile presence. He returned only today from Russia where he had gone on a study tour but instead of flying to Ranchi, he is headed to hometown Nagpur tomorrow, ostensibly for Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations.        
	The BJP leaders expected to be present in Ranchi are Rajnath Singh, S.S. Ahluwalia, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Nishikant Dubey and Vijay Goel.        
	Party sources said Advani and his loyalists were peeved at Gadkaris unilateralism as he had not observed the protocol of having his decision ratified by the parliamentary board, the BJPs apex decision-making body.        
	A member of the board, a senior Lok Sabha MP, said: I learnt of the decision through the press. I cant remember another occasion when a development impacting the party has not been endorsed by us.        
	Advani, Sushma and the rest were unhappy with the idea of a second partnership with the JMM, whose leader Shibu Sorens flip-flop had prompted the national party to dump him and set the stage for Presidents rule three months ago.        
	Apparently, their pique had less to do with Soren and more with the choice of Munda as chief minister. Munda was originally patronised by Gadkaris predecessor, Rajnath and, therefore, fell foul of Advani and his group.        
	Gadkari circumvented the niceties of organisational processes, sources said, only because he is armed with the RSSs support.         
	The Sangh wants a friendly government in Jharkhand to help the working of its outfits like Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and the Ekal Vidyalayas, a source said.        
	For the record, BJP spokesperson Ramnath Kovind dismissed suggestions of the reported differences as media creations. No parliamentary board meeting took place because the party president is abroad, he added.        
	Prasad, also the chief spokesperson, chose the easy way out. Theres only a days notice (for the Ranchi event), so some people are coming and others are not.

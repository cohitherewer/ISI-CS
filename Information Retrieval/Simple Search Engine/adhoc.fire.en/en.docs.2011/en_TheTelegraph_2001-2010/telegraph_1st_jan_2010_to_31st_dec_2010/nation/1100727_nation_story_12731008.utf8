The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI lines up quiz in jail
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI lines up quiz in jail
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Amit Shah heads to an Ahmedabads magistrate house on Sunday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, July 26: The CBI is in a hurry to record Amit Shahs statement but is treading with caution against the former Gujarat junior home minister.        
	The agency, at the centre of a political storm over charge-sheeting Shah, has sought permission to quiz him in judicial custody ahead of a July-end deadline set by the Supreme Court to investigate and report back.         
	An Ahmedabad court today granted permission to the CBI to question Shah in Sabarmati jail between July 28 and 30 in connection with the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case.        
	Shah, accused of masterminding the conspiracy to eliminate the alleged extortionist in a 2005 fake encounter, gave himself up yesterday and was sent to judicial remand after the CBI refrained from seeking his custody.        
	The agency could have sought Shahs custody after his surrender but preferred to talk to him while he is in jail, possibly to avoid allegations of being party to political vendetta.        
	Sources said the CBI was under pressure to get the version of Shah, who got away in earlier investigations by the state CID. Call records, not examined during the earlier probe but specifically ordered to be examined by the top court, seem to have led the CBI to the former minister who resigned on Saturday.        
	But call records are not enough, his statement is a must before any report can be wrapped up. It could then be juxtaposed with other evidence to make out a case against Shah.        
	Sohrabuddin was pulled off a bus and killed in a fake encounter in November 2005. His wife Kauser Bi was killed later in a bid to eliminate witnesses. Another witness, Tulsiram Prajapati, also disappeared.        
	Although the state later admitted under court fire that Sohrabuddin had been killed by some police officers for name, fame and money, it could not explain Kauser Bis elimination.         
	The states stubborn refusal to explain the circumstances surrounding her death prompted the court to refer the case to the CBI for a fresh probe.         
	Two years after Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin sought a CBI probe, the Supreme Court on January 12, 2010, asked the agency to investigate all aspects of the killings and the alleged possibility of a larger conspiracy.         
	It asked the state CID to hand over all records relating to the case within a fortnight.         
	The court said CBI authorities would thereafter take up the investigation and complete the same within six months from the date of taking over (the) investigation from state police.        
	The report of the CBI authorities shall be filed in this court when this court will pass further necessary orders in accordance with the said report, if necessary, the bench of Justices Tarun Chatterjee and Aftab Alam said.        
	Justice Chatterjee has since retired. But Justice Alam will be part of any new bench set up to look into the CBI report.

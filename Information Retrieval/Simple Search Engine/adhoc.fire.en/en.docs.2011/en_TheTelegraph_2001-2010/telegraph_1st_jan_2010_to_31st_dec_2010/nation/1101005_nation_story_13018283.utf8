          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Oct. 4: Rajasthan High Court today sought an explanation from the state government for its failure to check corporal punishment in schools, citing the case of a seven-year-old girl who lost her vision in one eye after a teacher thrashed her.        
	Piya, a Class I student of a private school run by the BJPs Santosh Ahlawat, was hit by a notebook and then punched on her left eye for not completing her mathematics homework by class teacher Pratibha Singh in July this year.         
	The child got medical help only after reaching home when her grandfather took her to a doctor who advised that she be shifted to Jaipur.         
	Doctors in Jaipur and Chandigarh said the cornea of the childs left eye was shrinking and she would lose vision.         
	Police had initially refused to register a case because of the alleged political influence of the school authorities. Only after the childs mother went on dharna, a FIR was registered on August 7.        
	A single-judge bench of the high court pulled up the school authorities and issued show-cause notices to the deputy secretary, Board of Secondary Education, Ajmer; principal secretary (education); district magistrate, Jhunjhunu; superintendent of police and secretary, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Jhunjhunu.

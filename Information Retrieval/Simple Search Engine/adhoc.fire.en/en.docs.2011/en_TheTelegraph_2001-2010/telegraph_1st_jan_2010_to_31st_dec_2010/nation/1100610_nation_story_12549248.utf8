The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gas letter? No, not so far
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gas letter? No, not so far
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 9: The foreign ministry today scrambled to throw doubt on claims that it had asked the CBI 15 years ago to stop pursuing Warren Andersons extradition, but it stopped short of denying outright that such a letter existed.        
	A senior ministry bureaucrat said officials had gone through the records and so far had not come across any such letter.        
	Former CBI official B.R. Lall, who was in charge of the gas-leak probe in 1994-95, had alleged yesterday that the agency had received a letter from the foreign ministry asking it to stop efforts for Andersons extradition.        
	 We (the government) were collectively looking at collating evidence (against Anderson). How in such a situation could we have written that letter? the ministry bureaucrat asked.        
	Rather, the bureaucrat said, the ministry had asked the CBI to provide the missing evidence that Washington had sought, which would have enabled India to send a renewed extradition request after the failure of the first in 2003. He, however, did not reveal what that evidence might be.        
	However, another senior government source gave a different version. He said the India-US extradition treaty did not cover hand-over of those accused of culpable homicide, as Anderson had been.        
	However, the external affairs ministry bureaucrat claimed the foreign office had, till September 2008, kept repeating the extradition request to the US but the US said it (extradition) was not possible on the basis of the evidence we had sent.        
	In September 2008, Indias then ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, had written to the CBI director for further information, the bureaucrat claimed, adding that the ministry was still waiting for a reply.        
	Former CBI director Vijay Rama Rao said both the investigating agency and the ministry had made all efforts to pursue Andersons extradition. There was never any let-up to the extent I remember, he said.        
	South Block mandarins also struggled to explain the delay in the first extradition request, which came 19 years after the gas tragedy.

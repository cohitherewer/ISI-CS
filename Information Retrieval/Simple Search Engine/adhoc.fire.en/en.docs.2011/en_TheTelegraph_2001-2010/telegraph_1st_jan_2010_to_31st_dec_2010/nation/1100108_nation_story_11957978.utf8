          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Jan. 7: Supporters of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today attacked outlets of a retail major following a report aired on several Telugu TV channels that the former chief ministers death in a helicopter crash was the result of a conspiracy hatched by oil and gas explorers in the Krishna Godavari basin.         
	The supporters also attacked mobile phone towers belonging to a telecom company having familial ties with the retail major.        
	The conspiracy theory, which coincided with the first anniversary of the Satyam scam outbreak, gained ground when several Telugu channels quoted a Russian newspaper and its website to suggest that the copter crash of September 1 last year was the result of a plot masterminded by natural gas explorers.        
	The Russian website, which was subsequently blocked, claimed to have extracted a purported confession from a former US associate of an Indian tycoon about an attempt to blow up the helicopter of the industrialists feuding brother. The associate is believed to have insinuated a similar plot to kill YSR since he was opposed to the corporate house extracting gas for its own use.

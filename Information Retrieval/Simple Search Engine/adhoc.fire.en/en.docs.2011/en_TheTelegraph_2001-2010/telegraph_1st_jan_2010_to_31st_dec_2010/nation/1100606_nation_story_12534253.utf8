          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 5: Vulnerable coastline, unpredictable agriculture production and recurring natural disasters leading to food scarcity and other climatic adversities like rising temperature across Orissa might get a breather with the state government readying a plan to launch a Rs 17,000 crore climate-change action plan (CAP) in five years.        
	While there would be 11 key sectors to address the complicated scenario, chief minister Naveen Patnaik launched the CAP draft action plan on World Environment Day today.         
	Orissa, with this unique initiative in the country, will become a carbon conscious and climate resilient state, he said.         
	The state government has already started the Orissa Wetland Development Authority and State Biodiversity Statutory Action Plan to intensify its crusade against the environmental and biodiversity degradation, he said at a state-level programme. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan, which has already been launched, would also provide a fillip to the endangered coastal ecosystem zone.        
	Chief secretary T.K. Mishra said time had come to understand the benefits of traditional agricultural practices and hoped that the Food and Agriculture Organisation would include Orissa as their future project destination besides Latin American and South Asian nations.         
	Calling for adoption of sustainable practices in industrialisation and other development initiatives, Mishra said live and let live should be the new mantra for a greener planet.        
	The CAP will stress climate-based agriculture, horticulture and conservation activities besides studies on frequent floods, coastal erosion, rise in sea level, biodiversity in coastal ecosystem.        
	As the future of Orissa will be more dependent on energy, the plan will focus on transmission and distribution loss, energy management plan, recycling of flyash, checking pollution, solar power and bio gas.        
	The draft document, which wants citizens to give feedback latest by June 25, will also include vital sectors like forests, health, industries, mining, transport, urban development and water management, among others.        
	Steel city pledge        
	In neighbouring Jharkhands Jamshedpur, Andhra Bhakta Kolata Samajam, a socio-religious body, promised to organise eco-friendly Ganesh Puja and Navratri celebrations, while Tata Steel Zoological Park evolved a new system to minimise entry of polythene items inside its premises.        
	Corporate giants, including Tata Steel, Jusco and Adhunik Group, also lined up programmes on the day. Social bodies like Devdoot and Singhbhum Kendriya Varisht Nagarik Samiti were also not left behind in observing the occasion.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      First scalp in land scam
                            
	Bangalore, Dec. 3 (PTI): Karnataka IT and biotechnology minister Katta Subramanya Naidu resigned today over a land deal, becoming the most high-profile casualty yet of the scandal rocking the B.S. Yeddyurappa government.        
	The minister resigned a day after the Lokayukta filed an FIR against him over a land deal.        
	Chief minister Yeddyurappa made an announcement about the exit of his trusted lieutenant, and forwarded Naidus resignation letter to governor H.R. Bhardwaj for acceptance.         
	To facilitate an impartial probe by the Lokayukta, Katta Subramanya Naidu has submitted his resignation today, Yeddyurappa, who himself recently got a fresh lease of life from the BJP top brass to remain in office, told reporters.        
	The Lokayukta, an anti-corruption watchdog, had yesterday registered an FIR against Naidu and nine others after it found evidence of their involvement in irregularities in allotting of 385 acres by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) to ITASCA Software Company.        
	ITASCA has been floated by an aide of Naidu.         
	For allotment of land and obtaining the consent of farmers, most of whom were family members and associates of Naidu and his son Jagadish, illegal gratification of Rs 87 crore was allegedly paid to a benami company of Naidu and Jagadish, the FIR said.         
	Lokayukta Santosh Hegde said yesterday the accused have been slapped with charges of forgery, cheating, benami transactions, creating false documents and creating fictitious firms in the FIR.         
	A second FIR was also filed yesterday against Naidus son for allegedly bribing a witness in a case involving securing of compensation for KIADB land acquired from him.        
	The first BJP government in south India has been hit by alleged land scams that almost cost Yeddyurappa his position after the Opposition mounted a sustained attack, accusing him of denotifying land and allotting prime plots to favour his family members.         
	Opposition Congress leader in the Assembly Siddaramaiah earlier today demanded Naidus immediate resignation and also dismissal of three KIADB officials against whom FIRs have been lodged.

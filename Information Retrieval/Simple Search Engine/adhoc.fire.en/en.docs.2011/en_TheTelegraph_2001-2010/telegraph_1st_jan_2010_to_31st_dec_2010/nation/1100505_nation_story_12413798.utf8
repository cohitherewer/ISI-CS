The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tiger tourism not to be banned: Jairam
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tiger tourism not to be banned: Jairam
          CITHARA PAUL                          Tourists can come                                  
	New Delhi, May 4: William Blakes tiger will burn bright  and you will continue to catch a glimpse of it.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh today said his ministry had no intention to ban tourism in tiger reserves, bringing down the curtains on a tussle with the tourism ministry which had feared the move would hit visitor numbers. The row had even reached the PMO, which appears to have settled it in favour of the tourism ministry.        
	Our policy is to develop a set of guidelines where eco-tourism takes place in a sustainable way, linked to the capacity of the reserves. We are not at all interested in stopping tiger tourism, Ramesh said. He insisted, however, that the tourism ministry should follow better regulations.        
	The last straw in the tussle came was when National Tiger Conservation Authority head Rajesh Gopal told The Times, London, that the government has decided on the ban.         
	We should not forget that tiger reserves are primarily for conserving the endangered tiger and tourism is just a secondary outcome, he had said. The animals, which now number only 1,411 in their natural habitat, are in danger of being loved to death, he added.        
	The remarks had caused a scare among western tourists who felt they would no longer be able spot a Bengal Tiger in the wild. The shockwaves began to be felt in India: local tour operators started getting cancellation calls, especially from high-spending visitors.                  Jairam Ramesh      
	The tourism industry got really worried. We took up the matter at the highest level and we hope the matter is settled for now, said an official of the tourism ministry.        
	Pitching for the ban, Rameshs ministry had pointed out that increasing tourists and tourism-related construction had proved disastrous for the ecology of the reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Gopal, the conservation authority head, had declared that tourism would be phased out in the countrys 37 tiger reserves as part of measures to protect the animal. He maintained that tiger tourism should never be at the expense of tigers.        
	Indian reserves, Gopal argued, are relatively smaller and prone to disturbances caused by tourism, and cannot be compared to the large African savannah parks which can take in a large number of visitors. The tourism ministry countered the argument saying well-managed tourism was one of the best ways to ensure the big cats survival.        
	But the tourism ministry has agreed to initiate measures to regulate visitor inflow into the reserves. It has accepted a suggestion that all tourism projects in such areas get environment clearances.         
	A tourism ministry official said the number of visits would be limited and made costlier.         
	India has 37 tiger reserves, 357 wildlife sanctuaries and 96 national parks. Around 1,000-1,500 tourists visit these daily. The most popular spots include the Jim Corbett National Park, the Sunderbans, Kaziranga National Park and the Manas Tiger Reserve.

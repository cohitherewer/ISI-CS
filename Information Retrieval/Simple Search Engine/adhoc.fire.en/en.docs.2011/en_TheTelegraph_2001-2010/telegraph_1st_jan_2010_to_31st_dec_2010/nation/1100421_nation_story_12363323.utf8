          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 20: A government proposal to allow central university vice-chancellors a second term has triggered protests amid fears that the move could leave institutional autonomy a victim of political appointees.        
	A human resource development ministry circular asking central universities to amend their statutes to allow a second term to VCs has erupted into a heated debate on the merits of a single varsity head for a decade.        
	Student unions across political shades at Jawaharlal Nehru University today held a referendum on the move, and close to 2,000 students had voted till late this evening, varsity sources said. At Delhi University, incumbent vice-chancellor Deepak Pental has indicated that he will not push through the proposed amendments.

	New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Congress overcame its pre-verdict unease by this evening but many in the party were worried if todays ruling had the potential of providing greater legitimacy to the BJPs brand of politics.        
	The party was quick to welcome the judgment, conscious of the sentiments of the majority community and alive to the possibility of the BJP running away with the credit. The relief emanated from the fact that the ruling was not completely one-sided and was received largely with a sense of relief by most people.         
	It could have been much worse. Now the situation is manageable, a senior leader said, apparently breathing easy as the nation remained peaceful and the threat of a violent campaign by the Sangh Parivar receded.        
	But the relief seemed to give way to extreme caution on the implications of the verdict, so much so that the party even avoided responding to a question on the demolition of the Babri mosque. Asked if the ruling diluted in any manner the crime of demolishing the structure, party general secretary and chief spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi said: We are not going to give a value judgment today.         
	It was surprising the Congress was not even willing to point out that the demolition was altogether a different case, and not to be clubbed with the matter of the disputed lands ownership on which todays ruling came.        
	Dwivedi also didnt refute the suggestion that the BJP would gain. Asked if the verdict was a vindication of the BJPs stand, he merely said judicial pronouncements should not be linked to a political partys stand.         
	The judiciary is the most objective institution in a democracy and everybody should accept its order. There is no need to make any distorted analysis and to whip up passions, Dwivedi said.         
	Asked about RSS chief Mohan Bhagwats remark that the ruling was a cause for anand (joy), Dwivedi said: The RSS which talks of Ram should understand his ideals. Ram didnt express any happiness when he heard of his coronation, he didnt express any disappointment when he heard of his vanvaas (exile).         
	Others, like Digvijay Singh, also welcomed the verdict, describing it as a step in the direction of reconciliation.         
	But some were worried that the BJP had received a boost and would try to regroup even though the ground situation was not very conducive for Hindutva politics.         
	One senior minister said: This is going to be a long-time worry if the BJP starts the temple movement again. The RSS and the BJP have already started talking of a grand temple.        
	Underlying the comments are misgivings that BJP leaders will try to claim that their cause has been vindicated by the court. No one disputed the fact that Ram was born in Ayodhya but the BJP will now say we fought to restore Lord Rams dignity. This should have little political significance but we will have to tackle it as a major problem in the future, another leader said.

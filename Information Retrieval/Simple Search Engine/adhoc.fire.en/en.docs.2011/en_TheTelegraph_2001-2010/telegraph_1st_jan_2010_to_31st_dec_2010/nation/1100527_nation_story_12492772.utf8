          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Chandigarh, May 26: Molester cop S.P.S. Rathore today challenged his 18-month sentence and appealed for bail, but he will have to spend at least two more days in jail.        
	Punjab and Haryana High Court has adjourned the hearing of the bail application till Friday  a day before it closes for a months summer vacation.        
	The 68-year-old former Haryana police chief was sent to jail for the first time yesterday and spent last night in Barracks No. 10 with several other policemen serving time in various cases.        
	He was treated like any other convict. He was not provided with a separate bed or extra mattress, Burail jail official Amandeep Singh said.        
	Jail sources said Rathores demand for an extra blanket could not be granted since he had not made a written request.        
	A sessions court had yesterday dismissed Rathores appeal against his conviction for molesting 14-year-old Ruchika Girhotra in 1990, and increased his sentence to 18 months from six months. The earlier sentence had been accompanied with bail.        
	Rathores wife and lawyer Abha today moved the bail application and the review petition challenging the sentence. Seeking suspension of the sentence, she cited Rathores heart ailment and alleged that the sessions courts verdict had come under media pressure.        
	Apart from meeting Abha, Rathore has so far kept to himself inside his barracks. The jails inmates range from petty criminals to terrorists convicted of the 1995 assassination of the then Punjab chief minister, Beant Singh.        
	Since the jail is a small one, it does not provide convicts with numbers.        
	Like all the other prisoners, Rathore had dal-roti last night and bread in the morning. He will get dal-subzi for lunch, a prison official said.        
	He has complained about the hot and humid conditions, and is being kept under medical observation. He will be rushed to hospital if an emergency occurs. Its normal procedure.        
	The CBI is also probing Rathore for abetment of suicide and attempt to murder. Ruchika had killed herself in 1993, and Rathore had allegedly got her brother Ashu arrested and tortured in lock-up.

  -   Police clamp down on lit candles in Ayodhya

	Ayodhya/Faizabad, Sept. 30: Candles and diyas popped up briefly in fortress Ayodhya after the verdict as many saw in it an end to the darkness that the security clampdown had cast on their livelihood.        
	A little after watching the verdict on TV, many residents came out on the streets that had remained deserted for much of the day. Shopkeepers in Ayodhyas Naya Ghat, Ram Ghat, Vashishtha Bhavan and Hindu Dham areas lit candles and earthen lamps. Many queued up at temples.        
	The celebratory illuminations did not last long, though. Police went around extinguishing some of the candles, a nudge to the families to keep their feelings about the verdict within their minds and houses.        
	In nearby Faizabad, both Hindus and Muslims came out of their homes and felt reassured by the sight of the milling troops. Both communities, having spent the afternoon glued to TVs, appeared to feel a sense of relief by the time evening descended. They hoped life would go on now and they could get back to business.        
	Taxi owner Mohammad Shamim silently wished his wheels would start spinning money again. This uncertainty had really hurt us. There is no industry here. Our livelihood comes from pilgrims who pass through Faizabad to reach Ayodhya. I hope tourists come to Ayodhya in large numbers now that the verdict has been delivered, Shamim said.        
	Forces flag-marched through the sensitive zones but there were no reports of trouble. Around two dozen vehicles, some of them of the Rapid Action Force, patrolled the area. Ambulances wailed around the twin towns.        
	Appeals for peace flowed from Hindus as well as Muslims following the verdict. Hashim Ansari, one of the original petitioners, said he was satisfied with the ruling. Personally, I would request the Sunni Wakf Board not to move the Supreme Court. But it will be a collective decision, to be reached after discussions, he said.         
	The 90-year-old said Muslims should honour the order. I would appeal to all Muslims that whether they want to celebrate the verdict or express unhappiness, it should be done within the four walls of their homes.         
	However, some in his family did admit to being disappointed at being granted just a third of the disputed land.        
	At Karsevakpuram, sadhus in saffron didnt appear enthused either. It is clear that the case will go to the Supreme Court. It is not our final victory, said Mahant Nitya Gopal Das of the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas.

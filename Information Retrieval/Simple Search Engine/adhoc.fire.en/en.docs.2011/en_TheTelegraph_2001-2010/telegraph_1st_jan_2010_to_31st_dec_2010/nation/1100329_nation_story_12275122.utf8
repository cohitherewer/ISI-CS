The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM hopes of rivals split fade
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM hopes of rivals split fade
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 28: The CPMs campaign for the Bengal civic polls in May will highlight the Congress-led Centres anti-people economic policies and Trinamuls acceptance of them, signalling its hope of a split in the Opposition alliance is fading.        
	In his concluding speech today at the CPM state committees two-day strategy session for the civic polls, state secretary Biman Bose said the civic polls to 82 municipal bodies, particularly in Calcutta, would be extremely important for the state politics. Assembly elections are scheduled next year.        
	While his reference to the Assembly elections was obvious, Bose told comrades to ensure unity within the party and Left Front, assuming that there would be no serious crack in the Opposition alliance before the polls.        
	Boses observations today were in contrast to the leaderships earlier hope, articulated in the February party note for internal circulation. Without harbouring excessive illusion, we should not think that the present extremely unprincipled anti-Left grand alliance would continue in future, the note had said.        
	The change in tactics comes after efforts to drive wedge between the Opposition allies on anti-Maoist operations didnt make much headway. The Congress stuck to its coalition dharma, while Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee offered a quid pro quo by going soft on the petroleum price hike and other hard decisions of the Centre.         
	Politburo member Nirupam Sen criticised Union home minister P. Chidambarams remarks yesterday that Bengal would be the Waterloo for the Left in another 12 months. Chidambarams attack had come in the wake of the Lefts campaign against the Centres economic policies.         
	Let us see what happens after 12 months. But we will continue to criticise the central economic policies, Sen said.        
	Bose claimed there was a groundswell in favour of the Left and urged cadres to turn that into an element of victory. He pointed to the large turnout at a Left Front anti-price rise rally in Calcutta on February 8.

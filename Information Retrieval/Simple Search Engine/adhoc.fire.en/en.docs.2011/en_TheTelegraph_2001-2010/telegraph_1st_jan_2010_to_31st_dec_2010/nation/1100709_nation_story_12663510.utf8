          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                      YSR Reddy rsquo;s supporters pay their tributes on Thursday on his birth anniversary in Hyderabad. (PTI)                          
	Hyderabad, July 8: The scorned scion has sounded the bugle loud and long.        
	Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the son of late Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, today took the battle to the Congress after being denied the crown following his fathers death in a chopper crash last September.        
	On his fathers 61st birth anniversary, Jaganmohan set out on a week-long bus yatra to console the families of people who died of heart attack or committed suicide unable to bear the shock of YSRs death.        
	Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had apparently red-flagged the Odarpu yatra, which began from Itchapuram town on the Andhra-Orissa border. Itchapuram is the spot where YSR ended the 2003 padayatra that catapulted him into the chief ministers chair.        
	As Jaganmohans bus wound its way through Itchapuram, huge crowds lined up along the roads and waved from rooftops. Many greeted him emotionally when he stopped at Loddaputti village to offer condolences to the family of Pyla Chandramma.        
	I am not alone. My father has left behind such a huge family, Jaganmohan said.        
	In an open letter released on Monday, Jaganmohan said he was going ahead with the yatra despite Sonias alleged disapproval. She is believed to have said he could compensate the families by asking them to converge at one place instead of going on a yatra to visit them individually.        
	Jaganmohan, the Congress MP from Kadapa, has termed Sonia insensitive to Indian customs and practices and claimed that she had little knowledge of them.        
	Jaganmohan also quoted what his mother, Vijayalakshmi, told Sonia during their June 29 meeting in Delhi. When my husband died, you (Sonia) came to Hyderabad to console me. You did not ask us to come to Delhi, she said.        
	Vijaylakshmis point was that one dropped by peoples homes when they lost loved ones. That was the custom in India, not the other way around. So, it would be insensitive to ask the bereaved families to come to Jaganmohan instead of him visiting them.        
	Sources close to Jaganmohan said his message to his supporters was clear: the time had come to choose between him and the party.        
	The sources said Jaganmohan felt he would never get the chief ministers crown. If the high command had denied him last September when he had the support of 150 MLAs, why would it look at him now when most of his loyalists had switched over to current chief minister K. Rosaiahs camp?        
	Jaganmohan was also aware that the sympathy factor was ebbing, the sources said. So if he had to extract political capital out of the death-and-denial drama and lob any challenge at the Congress high command, the time was now.        
	Rosaiah said the Congress was not against the yatra per se but against the manner in which it was being conducted.

	Srinagar, Sept. 20: The all-party delegation led by Union home minister P. Chidambaram ran into a whole range of demands from mainstream and separatist groups that will pose a fresh and incremental challenge to the Centre.        
	While the separatists, who boycotted the official meeting, placed tough conditions before they could even mull talks for the final solution, the Opposition PDP expressed anger with the conduct of proceedings. The ruling National Conference (NC), an ally of the Congress, pressed its autonomy demand on the table.        
	The all-party delegation came to Kashmir already a bitterly divided house with the BJP opposing both autonomy and the demand to withdraw the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). On the evidence of today, it will probably return even more confounded on finding a way out of the current impasse.        
	Opening the exchange, Chidambaram said the delegation had come to Srinagar to hear out Kashmiri grievances and aspirations. But the set that has real issues with New Delhi -- the two Hurriyats -- was not on the conference table.        
	Informal talks, conducted between breakaway groups from the delegation and separatist leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, appeared to have superseded the official deliberations today.        
	As PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who herself stayed away from the all-party deliberations, said, it was a hopeful sign that some delegation members had been able to talk to separatist leaders, if only informally.        
	Significantly, nobody from the Congress, the BJP or the NC was part of any of these groups that met the separatist leaders at their residences scattered across Srinagar.        
	 This is first time since the separatist insurgency began in Kashmir in 1989 that an official delegation of parliamentarians has visited the residences of separatists, including hardliner Geelani and moderates Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik. The last such delegation to visit the Valley was 20 years ago, and it was led by the then Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, which left Kashmir without meeting the separatists.        
	The 39-member delegation included Chidambaram, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal, BJP parliamentary leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, Sitaram Yechury of the CPM, Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI and Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party.        
	High drama unfolded at the Dal-side venue, the secured Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Complex (SKICC), as hordes of Kashmiris, from traders, transporters, hoteliers and people from business community, thronged the site and raised pro-freedom slogans, along with demanding an end to the wanton violence which has claimed 100 lives over the past three months.        
	We have rejected any speculation over an economic package. We demanded end to the killings and process for resolution of Kashmir issue, said Shakeel Qalandar, the president of Federation of the Chamber of Industries, told the delegation, foregrounding a political settlement ahead of any economic welfare measures that Prime Minsiter Manmohan Singh has been keen on.         
	Qalandar had been nominted to the high-profile jobs panel formed by the Prime Minister last month, but it is clear he has reservations about being part of the group.        
	The separatists had refused to meet the delegation, citing a host of reasons, including New Delhis refusal to accept their conditions for resuming dialogue. But when the parliamentarians visited their homes, they received them with open arms even though they stuck to their stated positions on Kashmir.        
	The delegates came out of a tight security ring that was thrown around SKICC to meet the separatists in highly volatile areas like Maisuma, Hyderpora and Hazratbal.        
	Kashmir was officially under curfew but thousands of civilians were out on the streets, either protesting or out of curiosity about the meetings APD members held.        
	Sources said leaders like Yechury were in favour of meeting the separatists even if they were unwilling to reciprocate the gesture. The decision to meet them emerged during the lunch break. Paswan, who led a delegation to meet Yasin Malik, later said the Prime Minister knew of his decision.         
	Geelani chose to meet the guests in full media glare, betraying fears that any in-camera meet may be seen as cosying up to New Delhi. He probably ended up making the parliamentarians more uncomfortable; they would have preferred to hold talks behind closed doors.        
	Umar and Yasin followed suit, apparently to avoid giving hardliners a chance to hurl allegations of a sell-out.        
	You cannot legitimise the Indian occupation by power. Kashmir is not an integral part of India. The youths in Kashmir have decided that they will prefer to perish rather surrender before India, Geelani told his guests who included Sitaram Yechury, Assaduddin Owaisi and T.R. Baalu.        
	The hardliner refused to play peace-maker or participate in talks with New Delhi unless his demand of accepting Kashmir as international dispute, demilitarising it, punishing security forces involved in human rights abuses and releasing detainees were met. People do not need roads, flyovers or economic packages. They want to get rid of Indian occupation here, the Hurriyat hawk bluntly told them.        
	Yechury reminded Geelani of a joint resolution of the Parliament which declared Kashmir an integral part of India but said they had come here to help facilitate restoration of peace and break the deadlock over talks.        
	We want you to sit down and talk. We dont want killings in Kashmir, he told Geelani, who in turn, referred to 150 rounds of futile talks between Kashmiri leaders and the Centre since 1947.        
	The Mirwaiz, in his meeting with a separate delegation comprising Shahid Siddiqui, Gurudas Dasgupta, C.M. Chang and Rajneeti Prasad, urged the Centre to make the sentiment of aazadi the point of reference in its dealings with Kashmir. I urge you to tell the truth to the people of India about what Kashmiris really want. It is time that you not only accept the sentiment of Azadi but also make it a point of reference in the dialogue on the future of state, Mirwaiz, who wore a black arm band, told the team.        
	The Mirwaiz argued that New Delhi comes to them only when Kashmir is on the boil and forgets them when that crisis is over. Dasgupta asked the Mirwaiz to drop the demand of aazadiand said discussions can be held on any other issue.        
	Paswan was critical of both the security forces and the government and said they are responsible for the present trouble. When the boys was killed, if the army chief would have apologised to the families, this issue would not taken such a shape now, he said.        
	Early in the morning, Mirwaiz and Malik had refused to talk to delegation but sent a joint memorandum, listing their demands.        
	The memorandum said Kashmir has been turned into a concentration camp and called upon New Delhi to facilitate establishment and empowerment of a Kashmir Committee, comprising senior representatives of all major Indian political parties to enter into a process of engagement with the representatives of the people of Jammu amp; Kashmir.         
	Let this process be designed to deliver a negotiated solution to the Kashmir issue that is mutually acceptable to all parties, the memorandum said.        
	 We believe that a similar Kashmir Committee, bringing together all political forces, should also be established in Pakistan. We will advocate to the political parties in Pakistan that this be done. This will ensure that all major political forces in India and Pakistan are on board with the peace process and it will help institutionalise and sustain the process to resolve the Kashmir problem, their message said.        
	 While separatists stole todays limelight, the mainstream politicians, who met the all-party delegation at SKICC, raised several issues ranging from autonomy to gradual withdrawal of troops from Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Chidambaram, at the outset, promised people a dignified position within the country.        
	We hope and believe that the honour, dignity and future of Kashmiris are secure as part of India, he said.        
	 The ruling National Conference team, led by finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather, sought restoration of the pre-1953 autonomy for state that would only leave foreign affairs, defence, currency and communications with the Centre.        
	Mehbooba Mufti sent a 15-member team led by general secretary Dilawar Mir which accused the Omar Abdullah government of sabotaging the all-party session by imposing strict curfew across Kashmir. The PDP told the parliamentarians to meet the victims of violence and come out with out-of-the-box solutions for resolving the issue.         
	The PDP appeared upset also that the all-party delegation had allotted only 15 minutes to each party.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On death road, a clear message: civilians are no longer immune
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      On death road, a clear message: civilians are no longer immune
          SUJAN DUTTA                                            
	New Delhi, May 17: Mondays Maoist attack on a busload of police and civilians occurred on a road that is known to pass through rebel territory and is frequently used by the security forces for supplies and reinforcements.        
	Driving to Sukma and beyond a day after the April 6 killing of 76 policemen was risky. Even before that killing, National Highway 221, from Konta near the Andhra border through Sukma to Jagdalpur, and the smaller roads that lead from it into the forests were known as a kind of death road.        
	At night, gangs of drunken tribal youths, women among them, put up barricades and stop what little traffic passes through and demand money. At many places, trees are felled across the road  as in Lalgarh, only in larger numbers  and that makes the going slow.        
	The road is two-way, but narrow. It snakes its way through a reserve forest that is thick with sal trees. It also goes uphill and downhill.         
	At Sukma, the road is closest to the Orissa border after crossing the Indravati river. Orissas Malkangiri district, another rebel base, is just east of Sukma.        
	The administration and local people have known for a long time that the Maoists could attack the road almost at will. But they have also known that such an attack would most likely be on security forces because the Maoists would not want to lose influence in villages on either side of the road.        
	Mondays attack, however, makes the brutal point that killing non-combatants is on the Maoist agenda in their reply to P. Chidambarams Green Hunt if such an attack will take the lives of a few policemen.        
	Indications are that the Maoists targeted the busload of special police officers (SPOs) after tracking them for some time.         
	The SPOs present a bigger threat to the Maoists than the paramilitary forces such as the CRPF. Unlike the constabulary of the paramilitary forces, Chhattisgarhs SPOs are home and hearth cadre, often drawn from among the same tribes from which the Maoists recruit their rank and file.        
	In and around Sukma, one such SPO unit calls itself the Koya Commandos, Koya being the language they speak.         
	A Koya Commando who was in Mukram (where the CRPF men were killed) on April 7 as part of the forces who were securing the road for the visit of the director-general of police Viswa Ranjan to visit, took this correspondent around the village, identifying trees and implements. The SPOs know the terrain much better than the CRPF or even the State Armed Police.        
	Since the April 6 killings near Mukram, central forces have been told strictly that they are not to go on patrol without being escorted by the SPOs.         
	First, patrolling has become more infrequent since that bloodbath.         
	Second, after todays targeting of the SPOs, the Maoists have sent out the message that they will go after the special police even at the cost of civilian lives.         
	Chhattisgarh and Dantewada have become more dangerous than they already were.
